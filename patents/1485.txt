                                          TECHNICAL FIELD
20          The present invention relates to the field of therapeutic agent delivery using lipid
   particles. In particular, the present invention provides targeting lipids and lipid particles
   comprising these lipids, which are advantageous for the in vivo delivery of nucleic acids, as
   well as nucleic acid-lipid particle compositions suitable for in vivo therapeutic use.
   Additionally, the present invention provides methods of making these compositions, as well
25 as methods of introducing nucleic acids into cells using these compositions, e.g., for the
   treatment of various disease conditions.
                                             BACKGROUND
            Oligonucleotide compounds have important therapeutic applications in medicine.
30 Oligonucleotides can be used to silence genes that are responsible for a particular disease.
   Gene-silencing prevents formation of a protein by inhibiting translation. Importantly, gene
   silencing agents are a promising alternative to traditional small, organic compounds that
                                                      1

   inhibit the function of the protein linked to the disease. siRNA, antisense RNA, and micro
   RNA are oligonucleotides that prevent the formation of proteins by gene-silencing.
   RNA interference or "RNAi" is a term initially coined by Fire and co-workers to describe the
   observation that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can block gene expression when it is
 5 introduced into worms (Fire et al. (1998) Nature 391, 806-811). Short dsRNA directs gene
   specific, post-transcriptional silencing in many organisms, including vertebrates, and has
   provided a new tool for studying gene function. RNAi is mediated by RNA-induced
   silencing complex (RISC), a sequence-specific, multi-component nuclease that destroys
   messenger RNAs homologous to the silencing trigger. RISC is known to contain short RNAs
10 (approximately 22 nucleotides) derived from the double-stranded RNA trigger, but the
   protein components of this activity remained unknown.
            siRNA compounds are promising agents for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic
   purposes.    siRNA compounds can be used to identify the function of a gene. In addition,
   siRNA compounds offer enormous potential as a new type of pharmaceutical agent which
15 acts by silencing disease-causing genes.          Research is currently underway to develop
   interference RNA therapeutic agents for the treatment of many diseases including central
   nervous-system diseases, inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, oncology, infectious
   diseases, and ocular disease.
            siRNA has been shown to be extremely effective as a potential anti-viral therapeutic
20 with numerous published examples appearing recently.          siRNA molecules directed against
   targets in the viral genome dramatically reduce viral titers by orders of magnitude in animal
   models of influenza (Ge et. al., Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. USA, 101:8676-8681 (2004); Tompkins
   et. al., Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. USA, 101:8682-8686 (2004); Thomas et. al., Expert Opin. Biol.
   Ther. 5:495-505 (2005)), respiratory synctial virus (RSV) (Bitko et. al., Nat. Med. 11:50-55
25 (2005)), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Morrissey et. al., Nat. Biotechnol. 23:1002-1007 (2005)),
   hepatitis C virus (Kapadia, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 100:2014-2018 (2003); Wilson et. al.,
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 100:2783-2788 (2003)) and SARS coronavirus (Li et. al., Nat.
   Med. 11:944-951 (2005)).
            Antisense methodology is the complementary hybridization of relatively short
30 oligonucleotides to mRNA or DNA such that the normal, essential functions, such as protein
   synthesis, of these intracellular nucleic acids are disrupted. Hybridization is the sequence
                                                    2

   specific hydrogen bonding via Watson-Crick base pairs of oligonucleotides to RNA or single
   stranded DNA. Such base pairs are said to be complementary to one another.
           The naturally-occurring events that alter the expression level of the target sequence,
   discussed by Cohen (Oligonucleotides:Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press,
 5 Inc., 1989, Boca Raton, Fla.) are thought to be of two types. The first, hybridization arrest,
   describes the terminating event in which the oligonucleotide inhibitor binds to the target
   nucleic acid and thus prevents, by simple steric hindrance, the binding of essential proteins,
   most often ribosomes, to the nucleic acid.
           Another means by which antisense oligonucleotides alter the expression level of
10 target sequences is by hybridization to a target mRNA, followed by enzymatic cleavage of
   the targeted RNA by intracellular RNase H. A 2'-deoxyribofuranosyl oligonucleotide or
   oligonucleotide analog hybridizes with the targeted RNA and this duplex activates the RNase
   H enzyme to cleave the RNA strand, thus destroying the normal function of the RNA.
   Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are the most prominent example of an antisense agent that
15 operates by this type of antisense terminating event.
           The opportunity to use these and other nucleic 1 acid based therapies holds significant
   promise, providing solutions to medical problems that could not be addressed with current,
   traditional medicines. The location and sequences of an increasing number of disease-related
   genes are being identified, and clinical testing of nucleic acid-based therapeutics for a variety
20 of diseases is now underway.
           Despite the advances in application of oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs
   as therapeutics, the need exists for oligonucleotides having improved pharmacologic
   properties. Efforts aimed at improving the transmembrane delivery of nucleic acids and
   oligonucleotides have utilized protein carriers, antibody carriers, liposomal delivery systems,
25 electroporation, direct injection, cell fusion, viral vectors, and calcium phosphate-mediated
   transformation. However, many of these techniques are limited by the types of cells in which
   transmembrane transport is enabled and by the conditions needed for achieving such
   transport.
           To attempt to improve efficacy, investigators have also employed lipid-based carrier
30 systems to deliver chemically modified or unmodified therapeutic nucleic acids. In Zelphati,
   o and   Szoka, F.C., J. Contr. Rel. 41:99-119 (1996), the authors refer to the use of anionic
   (conventional) liposomes, pH sensitive liposomes, immunoliposomes, fusogenic liposomes,
                                                     3

   and cationic lipid/antisense aggregates. Similarly siRNA has been administered systemically
   in cationic liposomes, and these nucleic acid-lipid particles have been reported to provide
   improved down-regulation of target proteins in mammals including non-human primates
   (Zimmermann et al., Nature 441: 111-114 (2006)).
 5          In spite of this progress, there remains a need in the art for improved lipid-therapeutic
   nucleic acid compositions that are suitable for general therapeutic use. Preferably, these
   compositions would encapsulate nucleic acids with high-efficiency, have high drug:lipid
   ratios, protect the encapsulated nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be
   suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the encapsulated nucleic
10 acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an
   adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid
   is not associated with significant toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention
   provides such compositions, methods of making the compositions, and methods of using the
   compositions to introduce nucleic acids into cells, including for the treatment of diseases.

            The present invention further includes methods of preparing lipid particles and
   pharmaceutical compositions, as well as kits usedful in the preparation of these lipid particle
   and pharmaceutical compositions. The method includes providing a composition that
   includes an agent, e.g. an oligonucleotide based construct that targets a selected target gene,
 5 e.g. a gene expressed in the liver, and the targeting lipid; and administering the composition
   to a test subject, e.g. an animal; thereby evaluating the agent and the targeting lipid, e.g. by
   evaluating the expression of the target gene.

   Carbohydrate
           As used herein, "carbohydrate" refers to a compound which is either a carbohydrate
   per se made up of one or more monosaccharide units having at least 6 carbon atoms (which
10 may be linear, branched or cyclic) with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each
   carbon atom; or a compound having as a part thereof a carbohydrate moiety made up of one
   or more monosaccharide units each having at least six carbon atoms (which may be linear,
   branched or cyclic), with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each carbon atom.

   LIGANDS
           A wide variety of entities can be used as ligands for conjugation according to the
   present invention. Preferred moieties are ligands, which are coupled, preferably covalently,
   either directly or indirectly via an intervening tether.
30         In preferred embodiments, a ligand alters the distribution, targeting or lifetime of the
   molecule into which it is incorporated. In preferred embodiments a ligand provides an
   enhanced affinity for a selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, compartment, e.g., a
                                                    31

   cellular or organ compartment, tissue, organ or region of the body, as, e.g., compared to a
   species absent such a ligand. Ligands providing enhanced affinity for a selected target are
   also termed targeting ligands.
            Some ligands can have endosomolytic properties. The endosomolytic ligands
 5 promote the lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition of the invention, or its
   components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. The endosomolytic ligand may
   be a polyanionic peptide or peptidomimetic which shows pH-dependent membrane activity
   and fusogenicity. In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic ligand assumes its active
   conformation at endosomal pH. The "active" conformation is that conformation in which the
10 endosomolytic ligand promotes lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition of
   the invention, or its components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. Exemplary
   endosomolytic ligands include the GALA peptide (Subbarao et al., Biochemistry, 1987, 26:
   2964-2972), the EALA peptide (Vogel et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118: 1581-1586), and
   their derivatives (Turk et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 2002, 1559: 56-68). In certain
15 embodiments, the endosomolytic component may contain a chemical group (e.g., an amino
   acid) which will undergo a change in charge or protonation in response to a change in pH.
   The endosomolytic component may be linear or branched. Exemplary primary sequences of
   peptide based endosomolytic ligands are shown in Table 2.

            Ligands can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a
   specific affinity for a co-ligand, or antibodies e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell
 5 type such as a cancer cell, endothelial cell, or bone cell. Ligands may also include hormones
   and hormone receptors. They can also include non-peptidic species, such as lipids, lectins,
   carbohydrates, vitamins, cofactors, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl
   galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucosamine multivalent mannose, multivalent fucose, or aptamers.
   The ligand can be, for example, a lipopolysaccharide, an activator of p38 MAP kinase, or an
10 activator of NF-wB.
            The ligand can be a substance, e.g, a drug, which can increase the uptake of the
   conjugate into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by disrupting
   the cell's microtubules, microfilaments, and/or intermediate filaments. The drug can be, for
   example, taxon, vincristine, vinblastine, cytochalasin, nocodazole, japlakinolide, latrunculin
15 A, phalloidin, swinholide A, indanocine, or myoservin.
            The ligand can increase the uptake of the conjugate into the cell by activating an
   inflammatory response, for example. Exemplary ligands that would have such an effect
   include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1 beta, or gamma interferon.
            In one aspect, the ligand is a lipid or lipid-based molecule. Such a lipid or lipid
20 based molecule preferably binds a serum protein, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA). An
   HSA binding ligand allows for distribution of the conjugate to a target tissue, e.g., a non
   kidney target tissue of the body. For example, the target tissue can be the liver, including
   parenchymal cells of the liver. Other molecules that can bind HSA can also be used as
   ligands. For example, neproxin or aspirin can be used. A lipid or lipid-based ligand can (a)
25 increase resistance to degradation of the conjugate, (b) increase targeting or transport into a
   target cell or cell membrane, and/or (c) can be used to adjust binding to a serum protein, e.g.,
   HSA.
            A lipid based ligand can be used to modulate, e.g., control the binding of the
   conjugate to a target tissue. For example, a lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA
30 more strongly will be less likely to be targeted to the kidney and therefore less likely to be
   cleared from the body. A lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA less strongly can be
   used to target the conjugate to the kidney.
                                                      36

            In a preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA. Preferably, it binds
   HSA with a sufficient affinity such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to a non
   kidney tissue. However, it is preferred that the affinity not be so strong that the HSA-ligand
   binding cannot be reversed.
 5          In another preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA weakly or not at
   all, such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to the kidney. Other moieties that
   target to kidney cells can also be used in place of or in addition to the lipid based ligand.
            In another aspect, the ligand is a moiety, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a target
   cell, e.g., a proliferating cell. These are particularly useful for treating disorders
10 characterized by unwanted cell proliferation, e.g., of the malignant or non-malignant type,
   e.g., cancer cells. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other exemplary
   vitamins include are B vitamin, e.g., folic acid, B12, riboflavin, biotin, pyridoxal or other
   vitamins or nutrients taken up by cancer cells. Also included are HAS, low density
   lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
15          In another aspect, the ligand is a cell-permeation agent, preferably a helical cell
   permeation agent. Preferably, the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide
   such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a
   peptidylmimetic, invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of D-amino
   acids. The helical agent is preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has a
20 lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.
            The ligand can be a peptide or peptidomimetic. A peptidomimetic (also referred to
   herein as an oligopeptidomimetic) is a molecule capable of folding into a defined three
   dimensional structure similar to a natural peptide. The peptide or peptidomimetic moiety can
   be about 5-50 amino acids long, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino
25 acids long (see Table 4, for example).

            A peptide or peptidomimetic can be, for example, a cell permeation peptide, cationic
   peptide, amphipathic peptide, or hydrophobic peptide (e.g., consisting primarily of Tyr, Trp
   or Phe). The peptide moiety can be a dendrimer peptide, constrained peptide or crosslinked
   peptide. In another alternative, the peptide moiety can include a hydrophobic membrane
 5 translocation sequence (MTS). An exemplary hydrophobic MTS-containing peptide is RFGF
   having the amino acid sequence AAVALLPAVLLALLAP. An RFGF analogue (e.g., amino
   acid sequence AALLPVLLAAP) containing a hydrophobic MTS can also be a targeting
   moiety. The peptide moiety can be a "delivery" peptide, which can carry large polar
   molecules including peptides, oligonucleotides, and protein across cell membranes. For
10 example, sequences from the HIV Tat protein (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) and the Drosophila
   Antennapedia protein (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) have been found to be capable of
   functioning as delivery peptides. A peptide or peptidomimetic can be encoded by a random
   sequence of DNA, such as a peptide identified from a phage-display library, or one-bead-one
   compound (OBOC) combinatorial library (Lam et al., Nature, 354:82-84, 1991). Preferably
15 the peptide or peptidomimetic tethered to an iRNA agent via an incorporated monomer unit is
   a cell targeting peptide such as an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide, or RGD
   mimic. A peptide moiety can range in length from about 5 amino acids to about 40 amino
   acids. The peptide moieties can have a structural modification, such as to increase stability or
   direct conformational properties. Any of the structural modifications described below can be
20 utilized.
            An RGD peptide moiety can be used to target a tumor cell, such as an endothelial
   tumor cell or a breast cancer tumor cell (Zitzmann et al., Cancer Res., 62:5139-43, 2002). An
   RGD peptide can facilitate targeting of an iRNA agent to tumors of a variety of other tissues,
   including the lung, kidney, spleen, or liver (Aoki et al., Cancer Gene Therapy 8:783-787,
25 2001). Preferably, the RGD peptide will facilitate targeting of an iRNA agent to the kidney.
   The RGD peptide can be linear or cyclic, and can be modified, e.g., glycosylated or
   methylated to facilitate targeting to specific tissues. For example, a glycosylated RGD
   peptide can deliver an iRNA agent to a tumor cell expressing avB3 (Haubner et al., Jour.
   Nucl. Med., 42:326-336, 2001).
30          Peptides that target markers enriched in proliferating cells can be used. E.g., RGD
   containing peptides and peptidomimetics can target cancer cells, in particular cells that
   exhibit an  103  integrin. Thus, one could use RGD peptides, cyclic peptides containing RGD,
                                                     39

   RGD peptides that include D-amino acids, as well as synthetic RGD mimics. In addition to
   RGD, one can use other moieties that target the I,-153 integrin ligand. Generally, such
   ligands can be used to control proliferating cells and angiogeneis. Preferred conjugates of
   this type lignads that targets PECAM-1, VEGF, or other cancer gene, e.g., a cancer gene
 5 described herein.
           A "cell permeation peptide" is capable of permeating a cell, e.g., a microbial cell,
   such as a bacterial or fungal cell, or a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. A microbial
   cell-permeating peptide can be, for example, an a-helical linear peptide (e.g., LL-37 or
   Ceropin P1), a disulfide bond-containing peptide (e.g., a -defensin, P-defensin or bactenecin),
10 or a peptide containing only one or two dominating amino acids (e.g., PR-39 or indolicidin).
   A cell permeation peptide can also include a nuclear localization signal (NLS). For example,
   a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite amphipathic peptide, such as MPG, which is
   derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV-1 gp4l and the NLS of SV40 large T antigen
   (Simeoni et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31:2717-2724, 2003).
15
           In one embodiment, a targeting peptide can be an amphipathic a-helical peptide.
   Exemplary amphipathic a-helical peptides include, but are not limited to, cecropins,
   lycotoxins,    paradaxins,   buforin,  CPF,    bombinin-like     peptide   (BLP),   cathelicidins,
   ceratotoxins,   S.  clava peptides,    hagfish intestinal    antimicrobial  peptides   (HFIAPs),
20 magainines, brevinins-2, dermaseptins, melittins, pleurocidin, H2 A peptides, Xenopus
   peptides, esculentinis-1, and caerins. A number of factors will preferably be considered to
   maintain the integrity of helix stability.       For example, a maximum number of helix
   stabilization residues will be utilized (e.g., leu, ala, or lys), and a minimum number helix
   destabilization residues will be utilized (e.g., proline, or cyclic monomeric units.          The
25 capping residue will be considered (for example Gly is an exemplary N-capping residue
   and/or C-terminal amidation can be used to provide an extra H-bond to stabilize the helix.
   Formation of salt bridges between residues with opposite charges, separated by i  3, or i  4
   positions can provide stability.     For example, cationic residues such as lysine, arginine,
   homo-arginine, ornithine or histidine can form salt bridges with the anionic residues
30 glutamate or aspartate.
           Peptide and peptidomimetic ligands include those having naturally occurring or
   modified peptides, e.g., D or L peptides; a,  P, or y peptides; N-methyl peptides; azapeptides;
                                                   40

   peptides having one or more amide, i.e., peptide, linkages replaced with one or more urea,
   thiourea, carbamate, or sulfonyl urea linkages; or cyclic peptides.
            The targeting ligand can be any ligand that is capable of targeting a specific receptor.
   Examples are: folate, GalNAc, galactose, mannose, mannose-6P, clusters of sugars such as
 5 GalNAc cluster, mannose cluster, galactose cluster, or an apatamer. A cluster is a
   combination of two or more sugar units. The targeting ligands also include integrin receptor
   ligands, Chemokine receptor ligands, transferrin, biotin, serotonin receptor ligands, PSMA,
   endothelin, GCPII, somatostatin, LDL and HDL ligands. The ligands can also be based on
   nucleic acid, e.g., an aptamer. The aptamer can be unmodified or have any combination of
10 modifications disclosed herein.
            Endosomal release agents include imidazoles, poly or oligoimidazoles, PEIs, peptides,
   fusogenic peptides, polycaboxylates, polyacations, masked oligo or poly cations or anions,
   acetals, polyacetals, ketals/polyketyals, orthoesters, polymers with masked or unmasked
   cationic or anionic charges, dendrimers with masked or unmasked cationic or anionic
15 charges.
            PK modulator stands for pharmacokinetic modulator. PK modulator include
   lipophiles, bile acids, steroids, phospholipid analogues, peptides, protein binding agents,
   PEG, vitamins etc. Examplary PK modulator include, but are not limited to, cholesterol, fatty
   acids, cholic acid, lithocholic acid, dialkylglycerides, diacylglyceride, phospholipids,
20 sphingolipids, naproxen, ibuprofen, vitamin E, biotin etc. Oligonucleotides that comprise a
   number of phosphorothioate linkages are also known to bind to serum protein, thus short
   oligonucleotides, e.g. oligonucleotides of about 5 bases, 10 bases, 15 bases or 20 bases,
   comprising multiple of phosphorothioate linkages in the backbaone are also amenable to the
   present invention as ligands (e.g. as PK modulating ligands).
25          In addition, aptamers that bind serum components (e.g. serum proteins) are also
   amenable to the present invention as PK modulating ligands.
            Other ligands amenable to the invention are described in copending applications

           When two or more ligands are present, the ligands can all have same properties, all
   have different properties or some ligands have the same properties while others have different
   properties. For example, a ligand can have targeting properties, have endosomolytic activity
   or have PK modulating properties. In a preferred embodiment, all the ligands have different
 5 properties.
   LINKERS/TETHERS
           The terms "linker" and "tether" means an organic moiety that connects two parts of a
10 compound. Linkers typically comprise a direct bond or an atom such as oxygen or sulfur, a

   Lipid Particles
            The present invention also provides lipid particles comprising one or more of the
   targeting lipids described above. Lipid particles include, but are not limited to, liposomes.
25 As used herein, a liposome is a structure having lipid-containing membranes enclosing an
   aqueous interior. Liposomes may have one or more lipid membranes. The invention
   contemplates both single-layered liposomes, which are referred to as unilamellar, and multi
   layered liposomes, which are referred to as multilamellar. When complexed with nucleic
   acids, lipid particles may also be lipoplexes, which are composed of cationic lipid bilayers
30 sandwiched between DNA layers, as described, e.g., in Felgner, Scientific American.
            The lipid particles of the present invention may further comprise one or more
   additional lipids and/or other components such as cholesterol. Other lipids may be included
                                                      43

   in the liposome compositions of the present invention for a variety of purposes, such as to
   prevent lipid oxidation or to attach ligands onto the liposome surface. Any of a number of
   lipids may be present in liposomes of the present invention, including amphipathic, neutral,
   cationic, and anionic lipids. Such lipids can be used alone or in combination. Specific
 5 examples of additional lipid components that may be present are described below.
            Additional components that may be present in a lipid particle of the present invention
   include bilayer stabilizing components such as polyamide oligomers (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
   No. 6,320,017), peptides, proteins, detergents, lipid-derivatives, such as PEG coupled to
   phosphatidylethanolamine and PEG conjugated to ceramides (see, U.S. Patent No.
10 5,885,613).
            In particular embodiments, the lipid particles include one or more of an amnio lipid or
   cationic lipid, a neutral lipid, a sterol, and a lipid selected to reduce aggregation of lipid
   particles during formation, which may result from steric stabilization of particles which
   prevents charge-induced aggregation during formation.
15          Examples of lipids that reduce aggregation of particles during formation include
   polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids, monosialoganglioside Gm1, and polyamide
   oligomers ("PAO") such as (described in US Pat. No. 6,320,017). Other compounds with
   uncharged, hydrophilic, steric-barrier moieties, which prevent aggregation during
   formulation, like PEG, Gml or ATTA, can also be coupled to lipids for use as in the methods
20 and compositions of the invention. ATTA-lipids are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No.
   6,320,017, and PEG-lipid conjugates are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,820,873,
   5,534,499 and 5,885,613. Typically, the concentration of the lipid component selected to
   reduce aggregation is about 1 to 15% (by mole percent of lipids).
            Specific examples of PEG-modified lipids (or lipid-polyoxyethylene conjugates) that
25 are useful in the present invention can have a variety of "anchoring" lipid portions to secure
   the PEG portion to the surface of the lipid vesicle. Examples of suitable PEG-modified lipids
   include PEG-modified phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid, PEG-ceramide
   conjugates (e.g., PEG-CerC14 or PEG-CerC20) which are described in co-pending USSN
   08/486,214, incorporated herein by reference, PEG-modified dialkylamines and PEG
30 modified 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3-amines. Particularly preferred are PEG-modified
   diacylglycerols and dialkylglycerols.
                                                      44

            In embodiments where a sterically-large moiety such as PEG or ATTA are conjugated
   to a lipid anchor, the selection of the lipid anchor depends on what type of association the
   conjugate is to have with the lipid particle. It is well known that mePEG (mw2000)
   diastearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) will remain associated with a liposome
 5 until the particle is cleared from the circulation, possibly a matter of days. Other conjugates,
   such as PEG-CerC20 have similar staying capacity. PEG-CerC14, however, rapidly
   exchanges out of the formulation upon exposure to serum, with a Tm/2 less than 60 mins. in
   some assays. As illustrated in US Pat. Application SN 08/486,214, at least three
   characteristics influence the rate of exchange: length of acyl chain, saturation of acyl chain,
10 and size of the steric-barrier head group. Compounds having suitable variations of these
   features may be useful for the invention. For some therapeutic applications it may be
   preferable for the PEG-modified lipid to be rapidly lost from the nucleic acid-lipid particle in
   vivo and hence the PEG-modified lipid will possess relatively short lipid anchors. In other
   therapeutic applications it may be preferable for the nucleic acid-lipid particle to exhibit a
15 longer plasma circulation lifetime and hence the PEG-modified lipid will possess relatively
   longer lipid anchors.
            Other examplary PEG-lipids include, without limitation PEG coupled to
   dialkyloxypropyls (PEG-DAA) as described in, e.g., WO 05/026372, PEG coupled to
   diacylglycerol (PEG-DAG) as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20030077829
20 and 2005008689, PEG coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (PEG-PE), or PEG
   conjugated to ceramides, or a mixture thereof (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,613).
            It should be noted that aggregation preventing compounds do not necessarily require
   lipid conjugation to function properly. Free PEG or free ATTA in solution may be sufficient
   to prevent aggregation. If the particles are stable after formulation, the PEG or ATTA can be
25 dialyzed away before administration to a subject.
            Neutral lipids, when present in the lipid particle, can be any of a number of lipid
   species which exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at physiological pH.
   Such lipids include, for example diacylphosphatidylcholine, diacylphosphatidylethanolamine,
   ceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin, cephalin, and cerebrosides. The selection
30 of neutral lipids for use in the particles described herein is generally guided by consideration
   of, e.g., liposome size and stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. Preferably, the
   neutral lipid component is a lipid having two acyl groups, (i.e., diacylphosphatidylcholine
                                                     45

   and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine). Lipids having a variety of acyl chain groups of
   varying chain length and degree of saturation are available or may be isolated or synthesized
   by well-known techniques. In one group of embodiments, lipids containing saturated fatty
   acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of CIO to C20 are preferred. In another group of
 5 embodiments, lipids with mono or diunsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the
   range of CIO to C 20 are used. Additionally, lipids having mixtures of saturated and
   unsaturated fatty acid chains can be used. Preferably, the neutral lipids used in the present
   invention are DOPE, DSPC, POPC, or any related phosphatidylcholine. The neutral lipids
   useful in the present invention may also be composed of sphingomyelin,
10 dihydrosphingomyeline, or phospholipids with other head groups, such as serine and inositol.
            The sterol component of the lipid mixture, when present, can be any of those sterols
   conventionally used in the field of liposome, lipid vesicle or lipid particle preparation. A
   preferred sterol is cholesterol.
            Cationic lipids suitable for use in lipid particles of the present invention include, but
15 are not limited to, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride ("DODAC"); N-(2,3
   dioleyloxy)propyl-N,N-N-triethylammonium chloride ("DOTMA"); N,N-distearyl-N,N
   dimethylammonium bromide ("DDAB"); N-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N
   trimethylammonium chloride ("DOTAP"); 1,2-Dioleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride
   salt ("DOTAP.Cl"); 3 -(N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl)cholesterol ("DC-Chol"),
20 N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N-2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium
   trifluoracetate ("DOSPA"), dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine ("DOGS"), 1,2-dileoyl
   sn-3-phosphoethanolamine ("DOPE"), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium propane
   ("DODAP"), N, N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy)propylamine ("DODMA"), and N-(1,2
   dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide ("DMRIE").
25 Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids can be used, such as,
   e.g., LIPOFECTIN (including DOTMA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL), and
   LIPOFECTAMINE (comprising DOSPA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL).                        In
   particular embodiments, a cationic lipid is an amino lipid.
            Other cationic lipids amenable to the present invetntion are disclosed in PCT patent
30 application PCT/US2007/080331 filed October 3, 2007.
            Anionic lipids suitable for use in lipid particles of the present invention include, but
   are not limited to, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diacylphosphatidylserine,
                                                     46

   diacylphosphatidic acid, N-dodecanoyl phosphatidylethanoloamine, N-succinyl
   phosphatidylethanolamine, N-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine, lysylphosphatidylglycerol,
   and other anionic modifying groups joined to neutral lipids.
            In numerous embodiments, amphipathic lipids are included in lipid particles of the
 5 present invention. "Amphipathic lipids" refer to any suitable material, wherein the
   hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients into a hydrophobic phase, while the
   hydrophilic portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Such compounds include, but are not
   limited to, phospholipids, aminolipids, and sphingolipids. Representative phospholipids
   include sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine,
10 phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, palmitoyloleoyl phosphatdylcholine,
   lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine,
   dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, or
   dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine. Other phosphorus-lacking compounds, such as
   sphingolipids, glycosphingolipid families, diacylglycerols, and -acyloxyacids, can also be
15 used. Additionally, such amphipathic lipids can be readily mixed with other lipids, such as
   triglycerides and sterols.
            Also suitable for inclusion in the lipid particles of the present invention are
   programmable fusion lipids. Such lipid particles have little tendency to fuse with cell
   membranes and deliver their payload until a given signal event occurs. This allows the lipid
20 particle to distribute more evenly after injection into an organism or disease site before it
   starts fusing with cells. The signal event can be, for example, a change in pH, temperature,
   ionic environment, or time. In the latter case, a fusion delaying or "cloaking" component,
   such as an ATTA-lipid conjugate or a PEG-lipid conjugate, can simply exchange out of the
   lipid particle membrane over time. By the time the lipid particle is suitably distributed in the
25 body, it has lost sufficient cloaking agent so as to be fusogenic. With other signal events, it is
   desirable to choose a signal that is associated with the disease site or target cell, such as
   increased temperature at a site of inflammation.
            In one exemplary embodiment, the lipid particle comprises a mixture of a targeting
   lipid of the present invention, a cationic lipid, neutral lipids (other than an amino lipid), a
30 sterol (e.g., cholesterol) and a PEG-modified lipid (e.g., a PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or
   PEG-DMA). In certain embodiments, the lipid mixture consists of or consists essentially of a
   targeting lipid of the present invention, a cationic lipid, a neutral lipid, cholesterol, and a
                                                     47

   PEG-modified lipid. In further preferred embodiments, the lipid particle consists of or
   consists essentially of the above lipid mixture in molar ratios of about 20-50% targeting lipid:
   20-70% cationic lipid: 5-45% neutral lipid:20-55% cholesterol:0.5-15% PEG-modified lipid.
           In a preferred embopdiment, all components of the lipid particle are optically pure.

   Therapeutic Agent-Lipid Particle Compositions and Formulations
           The present invention includes compositions comprising a lipid particle of the present
   invention and an active agent, wherein the active agent is associated with the lipid particle.
   In particular embodiments, the active agent is a therapeutic agent. In particular embodiments,
10 the active agent is encapsulated within an aqueous interior of the lipid particle. In other
   embodiments, the active agent is present within one or more lipid layers of the lipid particle.
   In other embodiments, the active agent is bound to the exterior or interior lipid surface of a
   lipid particle.
            "Fully encapsulated" as used herein indicates that the nucleic acid in the particles is
15 not significantly degraded after exposure to serum or a nuclease assay that would
   significantly degrade free DNA. In a fully encapsulated system, preferably less than 25% of
   particle nucleic acid is degraded in a treatment that would normally degrade 100% of free
   nucleic acid, more preferably less than 10% and most preferably less than 5% of the particle
   nucleic acid is degraded. Alternatively, full encapsulation may be determined by an
20 Oligreen assay. Oligreen* is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating
   oligonucleotides and single-stranded DNA in solution (available from Invitrogen
   Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Fully encapsulated also suggests that the particles are serum
   stable, that is, that they do not rapidly decompose into their component parts upon in vivo
   administration.
25         Active agents, as used herein, include any molecule or compound capable of exerting
   a desired effect on a cell, tissue, organ, or subject. Such effects may be biological,
   physiological, or cosmetic, for example. Active agents may be any type of molecule or
   compound, including e.g., nucleic acids, peptides and polypeptides, including, e.g.,
   antibodies, such as, e.g., polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments;
30 humanized antibodies, recombinant antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, and
   PrimatizedTM antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, apoptotic factors, differentiation-inducing
                                                    48

   factors, cell surface receptors and their ligands; hormones; and small molecules, including
   small organic molecules or compounds.
            In one embodiment, the active agent is a therapeutic agent, or a salt or derivative
   thereof. Therapeutic agent derivatives may be therapeutically active themselves or they may
 5 be prodrugs, which become active upon further modification. Thus, in one embodiment, a
   therapeutic agent derivative retains some or all of the therapeutic activity as compared to the
   unmodified agent, while in another embodiment, a therapeutic agent derivative lacks
   therapeutic activity.
            In various embodiments, therapeutic agents include any therapeutically effective
10 agent or drug, such as anti-inflammatory compounds, anti-depressants, stimulants, analgesics,
   antibiotics, birth control medication, antipyretics, vasodilators, anti-angiogenics, cytovascular
   agents, signal transduction inhibitors, cardiovascular drugs, e.g., anti-arrhythmic agents,
   vasoconstrictors, hormones, and steroids.
            In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is an oncology drug, which may also be
15 referred to as an anti-tumor drug, an anti-cancer drug, a tumor drug, an antineoplastic agent,
   or the like. Examples of oncology drugs that may be used according to the invention include,
   but are not limited to, adriamycin, alkeran, allopurinol, altretamine, amifostine, anastrozole,
   araC, arsenic trioxide, azathioprine, bexarotene, biCNU, bleomycin, busulfan intravenous,
   busulfan oral, capecitabine (Xeloda), carboplatin, carmustine, CCNU, celecoxib,
20 chlorambucil, cisplatin, cladribine, cyclosporin A, cytarabine, cytosine arabinoside,
   daunorubicin, cytoxan, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, dexrazoxane, dodetaxel, doxorubicin,
   doxorubicin, DTIC, epirubicin, estramustine, etoposide phosphate, etoposide and VP-16,
   exemestane, FK506, fludarabine, fluorouracil, 5-FU, gemcitabine (Gemzar), gemtuzumab
   ozogamicin, goserelin acetate, hydrea, hydroxyurea, idarubicin, ifosfamide, imatinib
25 mesylate, interferon, irinotecan (Camptostar, CPT-1 11), letrozole, leucovorin, leustatin,
   leuprolide, levamisole, litretinoin, megastrol, melphalan, L-PAM, mesna, methotrexate,
   methoxsalen, mithramycin, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, nitrogen mustard, paclitaxel,
   pamidronate, Pegademase, pentostatin, porfimer sodium, prednisone, rituxan, streptozocin,
   STI-571, tamoxifen, taxotere, temozolamide, teniposide, VM-26, topotecan (Hycamtin),
30 toremifene, tretinoin, ATRA, valrubicin, velban, vinblastine, vincristine, VP16, and
   vinorelbine. Other examples of oncology drugs that may be used according to the invention
                                                    49

   are ellipticin and ellipticin analogs or derivatives, epothilones, intracellular kinase inhibitors
   and camptothecins.
   Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles
 5          In certain embodiments, lipid particles of the present invention are associated with a
   nucleic acid, resulting in a nucleic acid-lipid particle. In particular embodiments, the nucleic
   acid is fully encapsulated in the lipid particle. As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" is
   meant to include any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. Fragments containing up to 50
   nucleotides are generally termed oligonucleotides, and longer fragments are called
10 polynucleotides. In particular embodiments, oligonucletoides of the present invention are 20
   50 nucleotides in length.
            In the context of this invention, the terms "polynucleotide" and "oligonucleotide"
   refer to a polymer or oligomer of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally
   occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The terms "polynucleotide" and
15 "oligonucleotide" also includes polymers or oligomers comprising non-naturally occurring
   monomers, or portions thereof, which function similarly. Such modified or substituted
   oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of properties such as, for
   example, enhanced cellular uptake and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.
            Oligonucleotides are classified as deoxyribooligonucleotides or ribooligonucleotides.
20 A deoxyribooligonucleotide consists of a 5-carbon sugar called deoxyribose joined covalently
   to phosphate at the 5' and 3' carbons of this sugar to form an alternating, unbranched
   polymer. A ribooligonucleotide consists of a similar repeating structure where the 5-carbon
   sugar is ribose.
            The nucleic acid that is present in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this
25 invention includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. The nucleic acids used herein can
   be single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or DNA-RNA hybrids.
   Examples of double-stranded DNA include structural genes, genes including control and
   termination regions, and self-replicating systems such as viral or plasmid DNA. Examples of
   double-stranded RNA include siRNA and other RNA interference reagents. Single-stranded
30 nucleic acids include, e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, microRNA, antagomirs and
   triplex-forming oligonucleotides.
                                                     50

            Nucleic acids of the present invention may be of various lengths, generally dependent
   upon the particular form of nucleic acid. For example, in particular embodiments, plasmids
   or genes may be from about 1,000 to 100,000 nucleotide residues in length. In particular
   embodiments, oligonucleotides may range from about 10 to 100 nucleotides in length. In
 5 various related embodiments, oligonucleotides, both single-stranded, double-stranded, and
   triple-stranded, may range in length from about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, from about 20 o
   about 50 nucleotides, from about 15 to about 30 nucleotides, from about 20 to about 30
   nucleotides in length.
            In particular embodiments, an oligonucleotide (or a strand thereof) of the present
10 invention specifically hybridizes to or is complementary to a target polynucleotide.
   "Specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a
   sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the
   DNA or RNA target and the oligonucleotide. It is understood that an oligonucleotide need
   not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence to be specifically
15 hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the
   oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the target molecule to
   cause a loss of utility or expression therefrom, and there is a sufficient degree of
   complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences
   under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in
20 the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or, in the case of in vitro assays, under
   conditions in which the assays are conducted. Thus, in other embodiments, this
   oligonucleotide includes 1, 2, or 3 base substitutions as compared to the region of a gene or
   mRNA sequence that it is targeting or to which it specifically hybridizes.
25 RNA Interference Nucleic Acids
            In particular embodiments, nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present invention are
   associated with RNA interference (RNAi) molecules. RNA interference methods using
   RNAi molecules may be used to disrupt the expression of a gene or polynucleotide of
   interest. These RNAi molecules are also referred to as iRNA agents and described below.
30          The iRNA agent should include a region of sufficient homology to the target gene,
   and be of sufficient length in terms of nucleotides, such that the iRNA agent, or a fragment
   thereof, can mediate downregulation of the target gene. (For ease of exposition the term
                                                   51

   nucleotide or ribonucleotide is sometimes used herein in reference to one or more monomeric
   subunits of an RNA agent. It will be understood herein that the usage of the term
   "ribonucleotide" or "nucleotide", herein can, in the case of a modified RNA or nucleotide
   surrogate, also refer to a modified nucleotide, or surrogate replacement moiety at one or more
 5 positions.) Thus, the iRNA agent is or includes a region which is at least partially, and in one
   embodiment fully, complementary to the target RNA. It is not necessary that there be perfect
   complementarity between the iRNA agent and the target, but the correspondence must be
   sufficient to enable the iRNA agent, or a cleavage product thereof, to direct sequence specific
   silencing, e.g., by RNAi cleavage of the target RNA, e.g., mRNA. Complementarity, or
10 degree of homology with the target strand, is most critical in the antisense strand. While
   perfect complementarity, particularly in the antisense strand, is often desired one embodiment
   can include, particularly in the antisense strand, one or more, or for example, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or
   fewer mismatches (with respect to the target RNA). The mismatches, particularly in the
   antisense strand, are most tolerated in the terminal regions and if present may be in a terminal
15 region or regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, or 3 nucleotides of the 5' and/or 3' termini. The sense
   strand need only be sufficiently complementary with the antisense strand to maintain the over
   all double stranded character of the molecule.
            As discussed elsewhere herein, and in the material incorporated by reference in its
   entirety, an iRNA agent will often be modified or include nucleoside surrogates. Single
20 stranded regions of an iRNA agent will often be modified or include nucleoside surrogates,
   e.g., the unpaired region or regions of a hairpin structure, e.g., a region which links two
   complementary regions, can have modifications or nucleoside surrogates. Modification to
   stabilize one or more 3'- or 5'-termini of an iRNA agent, e.g., against exonucleases, or to
   favor the antisense siRNA agent to enter into RISC are also envisioned. Modifications can
25 include C3 (or C6, C7, C12) amino linkers, thiol linkers, carboxyl linkers, non-nucleotide
   spacers (C3, C6, C9, C12, abasic, triethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol), special biotin or
   fluorescein reagents that come as phosphoramidites and that have another DMT-protected
   hydroxyl group, allowing multiple couplings during RNA synthesis.
            iRNA agents include: molecules that are long enough to trigger the interferon
30 response (which can be cleaved by Dicer (Bernstein et al. 2001. Nature, 409:363-366) and
   enter a RISC (RNAi-induced silencing complex)); and, molecules which are sufficiently short
   that they do not trigger the interferon response (which molecules can also be cleaved by
                                                    52

   Dicer and/or enter a RISC), e.g., molecules which are of a size which allows entry into a
   RISC, e.g., molecules which resemble Dicer-cleavage products. Molecules that are short
   enough that they do not trigger an interferon response are termed siRNA agents or shorter
   iRNA agents herein.      "siRNA agent or shorter iRNA agent" as used herein, refers to an
 5 iRNA agent, e.g., a double stranded RNA agent or single strand agent, that is sufficiently
   short that it does not induce a deleterious interferon response in a human cell, e.g., it has a
   duplexed region of less than 60, 50, 40, or 30 nucleotide pairs. The siRNA agent, or a
   cleavage product thereof, can down regulate a target gene, e.g., by inducing RNAi with
   respect to a target RNA, wherein the target may comprise an endogenous or pathogen target
10 RNA.
           Each strand of a siRNA agent can be equal to or less than 30, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, or 20
   nucleotides in length. The strand may be at least 19 nucleotides in length. For example, each
   strand can be between 21 and 25 nucleotides in length. siRNA agents may have a duplex
   region of 17, 18, 19, 29, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotide pairs, and one or more overhangs, or
15 one or two 3' overhangs, of 2- 3 nucleotides.
           In addition to homology to target RNA and the ability to down regulate a target gene,
   an iRNA agent may have one or more of the following properties:
           A single strand iRNA agent may be sufficiently long that it can enter the RISC and
   participate in RISC mediated cleavage of a target mRNA. A single strand iRNA agent is at
20 least 14, and in other embodiments at least 15, 20, 25, 29, 35, 40, or 50 nucleotides in length.
   In certain embodiments, it is less than 200, 100, or 60 nucleotides in length.
           Hairpin iRNA agents will have a duplex region equal to or at least 17, 18, 19, 29, 21,
   22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotide pairs. The duplex region will may be equal to or less than 200,
   100, or 50, in length. In certain embodiments, ranges for the duplex region are 15-30, 17 to
25 23, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides pairs in length. The hairpin may have a single strand
   overhang or terminal unpaired region, in one embodiment at the 3', and in certain
   embodiments on the antisense side of the hairpin. In one embodiment, the overhangs are 2-3
   nucleotides in length.
           A "double stranded (ds) iRNA agent" as used herein, is an iRNA agent which
30 includes more than one, and in some cases two, strands in which interchain hybridization can
   form a region of duplex structure.
                                                    53

           The antisense strand of a double stranded iRNA agent may be equal to or at least, 14,
   15, 16 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, 40, or 60 nucleotides in length. It may be equal to or less than 200,
   100, or 50, nucleotides in length. Ranges may be 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19 to21 nucleotides
   in length.
 5         The sense strand of a double stranded iRNA agent may be equal to or at least 14, 15,
   16 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, 40, or 60 nucleotides in length. It may be equal to or less than 200,
   100, or 50, nucleotides in length. Ranges may be 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides
   in length.
           The double strand portion of a double stranded iRNA agent may be equal to or at
10 least, 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 40, or 60 nucleotide pairs in length. It
   may be equal to or less than 200, 100, or 50, nucleotides pairs in length. Ranges may be 15
   30, 17 to 23, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides pairs in length.
           In many embodiments, the ds iRNA agent is sufficiently large that it can be cleaved
   by an endogenous molecule, e.g., by Dicer, to produce smaller ds iRNA agents, e.g., siRNAs
15 agents
           It may be desirable to modify one or both of the antisense and sense strands of a
   double strand iRNA agent. In some cases they will have the same modification or the same
   class of modification but in other cases the sense and antisense strand will have different
   modifications, e.g., in some cases it is desirable to modify only the sense strand. It may be
20 desirable to modify only the sense strand, e.g., to inactivate it, e.g., the sense strand can be
   modified in order to inactivate the sense strand and prevent formation of an active
   siRNA/protein or RISC. This can be accomplished by a modification which prevents 5'
   phosphorylation of the sense strand, e.g., by modification with a 5'-O-methyl ribonucleotide
   (see Nykanen et al., (2001) ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the
25 RNA interference pathway. Cell 107, 309-321.) Other modifications which prevent
   phosphorylation can also be used, e.g., simply substituting the 5'-OH by H rather than O-Me.
   Alternatively, a large bulky group may be added to the 5'-phosphate turning it into a
   phosphodiester linkage, though this may be less desirable as phosphodiesterases can cleave
   such a linkage and release a functional siRNA 5'-end. Antisense strand modifications include
30 5' phosphorylation as well as any of the other 5' modifications discussed herein, particularly
   the 5' modifications discussed above in the section on single stranded iRNA molecules.
                                                    54

           The sense and antisense strands may be chosen such that the ds iRNA agent includes
   a single strand or unpaired region at one or both ends of the molecule. Thus, a ds iRNA
   agent may contain sense and antisense strands, paired to contain an overhang, e.g., one or two
   5' or 3' overhangs, or a 3' overhang of 2-3 nucleotides. Many embodiments will have a 3'
 5 overhang. Certain siRNA agents will have single-stranded overhangs, in one embodiment 3'
   overhangs, of 1 or 2 or 3 nucleotides in length at each end. The overhangs can be the result
   of one strand being longer than the other, or the result of two strands of the same length being
   staggered. 5' ends may be phosphorylated.
           In one embodiment, the length for the duplexed region is between 15 and 30, or 18,
10 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 nucleotides in length, e.g., in the siRNA agent range discussed above.
   siRNA agents can resemble in length and structure the natural Dicer processed products from
   long dsiRNAs. Embodiments in which the two strands of the siRNA agent are linked, e.g.,
   covalently linked are also included. Hairpin, or other single strand structures which provide
   the required double stranded region, and a 3' overhang are also within the invention.
15         The isolated iRNA agents described herein, including ds iRNA agents and siRNA
   agents can mediate silencing of a target RNA, e.g., mRNA, e.g., a transcript of a gene that
   encodes a protein. For convenience, such mRNA is also referred to herein as mRNA to be
   silenced. Such a gene is also referred to as a target gene. In general, the RNA to be silenced
   is an endogenous gene or a pathogen gene. In addition, RNAs other than mRNA, e.g.,
20 tRNAs, and viral RNAs, can also be targeted.
           As used herein, the phrase "mediates RNAi" refers to the ability to silence, in a
   sequence specific manner, a target RNA. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is
   believed that silencing uses the RNAi machinery or process and a guide RNA, e.g., an siRNA
   agent of 21 to 23 nucleotides.
25         As used herein, "specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are
   used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding
   occurs between a compound of the invention and a target RNA molecule. Specific binding
   requires a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the
   oligomeric compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is
30 desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic
   treatment, or in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are
   performed. The non-target sequences typically differ by at least 5 nucleotides.
                                                    55

            In one embodiment, an iRNA agent is "sufficiently complementary" to a target RNA,
   e.g., a target mRNA, such that the iRNA agent silences production of protein encoded by the
   target mRNA. In another embodiment, the iRNA agent is "exactly complementary" to a
   target RNA, e.g., the target RNA and the iRNA agent anneal, for example to form a hybrid
 5 made exclusively of Watson-Crick base pairs in the region of exact complementarity. A
   "sufficiently complementary" target RNA can include an internal region (e.g., of at least 10
   nucleotides) that is exactly complementary to a target RNA. Moreover, in one embodiment,
   the iRNA agent specifically discriminates a single-nucleotide difference. In this case, the
   iRNA agent only mediates RNAi if exact complementary is found in the region (e.g., within 7
10 nucleotides of) the single-nucleotide difference.
            As used herein, the term "oligonucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid molecule (RNA or
   DNA) for example of length less than 100, 200, 300, or 400 nucleotides.
            RNA agents discussed herein include unmodified RNA as well as RNA which have
   been modified, e.g., to improve efficacy, and polymers of nucleoside surrogates. Unmodified
15 RNA refers to a molecule in which the components of the nucleic acid, namely sugars, bases,
   and phosphate moieties, are the same or essentially the same as that which occur in nature,
   for example as occur naturally in the human body. The art has often referred to rare or
   unusual, but naturally occurring, RNAs as modified RNAs, see, e.g., Limbach et al., (1994)
   Summary: the modified nucleosides of RNA, Nucleic Acids Res. 22: 2183-2196. Such rare
20 or unusual RNAs, often termed modified RNAs (apparently because the are typically the
   result of a post transcriptionally modification) are within the term unmodified RNA, as used
   herein. Modified RNA refers to a molecule in which one or more of the components of the
   nucleic acid, namely sugars, bases, and phosphate moieties, are different from that which
   occur in nature, for example, different from that which occurs in the human body. While
25 they are referred to as modified "RNAs," they will of course, because of the modification,
   include molecules which are not RNAs. Nucleoside surrogates are molecules in which the
   ribophosphate backbone is replaced with a non-ribophosphate construct that allows the bases
   to the presented in the correct spatial relationship such that hybridization is substantially
   similar to what is seen with a ribophosphate backbone, e.g., non-charged mimics of the
30 ribophosphate backbone.
                                                    56

   MicroRNAs
           Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of small RNA molecules that are
   transcribed from DNA in the genomes of plants and animals, but are not translated into
   protein. Processed miRNAs are single stranded -17-25 nucleotide (nt) RNA molecules that
 5 become incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and have been
   identified as key regulators of development, cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation.
   They are believed to play a role in regulation of gene expression by binding to the 3'
   untranslated region of specific mRNAs.RISC mediates down-regulation of gene expression
   through translational inhibition, transcript cleavage, or both. RISC is also implicated in
10 transcriptional silencing in the nucleus of a wide range of eukaryotes.
           The number of miRNA sequences identified to date is large and growing, illustrative
   examples of which can be found, for example, in: "miRBase: microRNA sequences, targets
   and gene nomenclature" Griffiths-Jones S, Grocock RJ, van Dongen S, Bateman A, Enright
   AJ. NAR, 2006, 34, Database Issue, D140-D144; "The microRNA Registry" Griffiths-Jones
15 S. NAR, 2004, 32, Database Issue, D109-D111; and also at
   http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/.
   Antisense Oligonucleotides
           In one embodiment, a nucleic acid is an antisense oligonucleotide directed to a target
20 polynucleotide. The term "antisense oligonucleotide" or simply "antisense" is meant to
   include oligonucleotides that are complementary to a targeted polynucleotide sequence.
   Antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA that are complementary to a
   chosen sequence. In the case of antisense RNA, they prevent translation of complementary
   RNA strands by binding to it. Antisense DNA can be used to target a specific,
25 complementary (coding or non-coding) RNA. If binding takes places this DNA/RNA hybrid
   can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. In particular embodiment, antisense
   oligonucleotides contain from about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, more preferably about 15 to
   about 30 nucleotides. The term also encompasses antisense oligonucleotides that may not be
   exactly complementary to the desired target gene. Thus, the invention can be utilized in
30 instances where non-target specific-activities are found with antisense, or where an antisense
   sequence containing one or more mismatches with the target sequence is the most preferred
   for a particular use.
                                                    57

           Antisense oligonucleotides have been demonstrated to be effective and targeted
   inhibitors of protein synthesis, and, consequently, can be used to specifically inhibit protein
   synthesis by a targeted gene. The efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides for inhibiting protein
   synthesis is well established. For example, the synthesis of polygalactauronase and the
 5 muscarine type 2 acetylcholine receptor are inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides directed
   to their respective mRNA sequences (U. S. Patent 5,739,119 and U. S. Patent 5,759,829).
   Further, examples of antisense inhibition have been demonstrated with the nuclear protein
   cyclin, the multiple drug resistance gene (MDG1), ICAM-1, E-selectin, STK-1, striatal
   GABAA receptor and human EGF (Jaskulski et al., Science. 1988 Jun 10;240(4858):1544-6;
10 Vasanthakumar and Ahmed, Cancer Commun. 1989;1(4):225-32; Peris et al., Brain Res Mol
   Brain Res. 1998 Jun 15;57(2):310-20; U. S. Patent 5,801,154; U.S. Patent 5,789,573; U. S.
   Patent 5,718,709 and U.S. Patent 5,610,288). Furthermore, antisense constructs have also
   been described that inhibit and can be used to treat a variety of abnormal cellular
   proliferations, e.g. cancer (U. S. Patent 5,747,470; U. S. Patent 5,591,317 and U. S. Patent
15 5,783,683).
           Methods of producing antisense oligonucleotides are known in the art and can be
   readily adapted to produce an antisense oligonucleotide that targets any polynucleotide
   sequence. Selection of antisense oligonucleotide sequences specific for a given target
   sequence is based upon analysis of the chosen target sequence and determination of
20 secondary structure, Tm, binding energy, and relative stability. Antisense oligonucleotides
   may be selected based upon their relative inability to form dimers, hairpins, or other
   secondary structures that would reduce or prohibit specific binding to the target mRNA in a
   host cell. Highly preferred target regions of the mRNA include those regions at or near the
   AUG translation initiation codon and those sequences that are substantially complementary to
25 5' regions of the mRNA. These secondary structure analyses and target site selection
   considerations can be performed, for example, using v.4 of the OLIGO primer analysis
   software (Molecular Biology Insights) and/or the BLASTN 2.0.5 algorithm software
   (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997, 25(17):3389-402).
30 Ribozymes
           According to another embodiment of the invention, nucleic acid-lipid particles are
   associated with ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA-protein complexes having specific catalytic
                                                   58

   domains that possess endonuclease activity (Kim and Cech, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987
   Dec;84(24):8788-92; Forster and Symons, Cell. 1987 Apr 24;49(2):211-20). For example, a
   large number of ribozymes accelerate phosphoester transfer reactions with a high degree of
   specificity, often cleaving only one of several phosphoesters in an oligonucleotide substrate
 5 (Cech et al., Cell. 1981 Dec;27(3 Pt 2):487-96; Michel and Westhof, J Mol Biol. 1990 Dec
   5;216(3):585-610; Reinhold-Hurek and Shub, Nature. 1992 May 14;357(6374):173-6). This
   specificity has been attributed to the requirement that the substrate bind via specific base
   pairing interactions to the internal guide sequence ("IGS") of the ribozyme prior to chemical
   reaction.
10          At least six basic varieties of naturally-occurring enzymatic RNAs are known
   presently. Each can catalyze the hydrolysis of RNA phosphodiester bonds in trans (and thus
   can cleave other RNA molecules) under physiological conditions. In general, enzymatic
   nucleic acids act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs through the target
   binding portion of an enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic
15 portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target RNA. Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid
   first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through complementary base-pairing, and once
   bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of
   such a target RNA will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein. After an
   enzymatic nucleic acid has bound and cleaved its RNA target, it is released from that RNA to
20 search for another target and can repeatedly bind and cleave new targets.
            The enzymatic nucleic acid molecule may be formed in a hammerhead, hairpin, a
   hepatitis 6 virus, group I intron or RNaseP RNA (in association with an RNA guide
   sequence) or Neurospora VS RNA motif, for example. Specific examples of hammerhead
   motifs are described by Rossi et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Sep 11;20(17):4559-65.
25 Examples of hairpin motifs are described by Hampel et al. (Eur. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. EP
   0360257), Hampel and Tritz, Biochemistry 1989 Jun 13;28(12):4929-33; Hampel et al.,
   Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Jan 25;18(2):299-304 and U. S. Patent 5,631,359. An example of
   the hepatitis 6 virus motif is described by Perrotta and Been, Biochemistry. 1992 Dec
   1;31(47):11843-52; an example of the RNaseP motif is described by Guerrier-Takada et al.,
30 Cell. 1983 Dec;35(3 Pt 2):849-57; Neurospora VS RNA ribozyme motif is described by
   Collins (Saville and Collins, Cell. 1990 May 18;61(4):685-96; Saville and Collins, Proc Natl
   Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Oct 1;88(19):8826-30; Collins and Olive, Biochemistry. 1993 Mar
                                                     59

   23;32(11):2795-9); and an example of the Group I intron is described in U. S. Patent
   4,987,071. Important characteristics of enzymatic nucleic acid molecules used according to
   the invention are that they have a specific substrate binding site which is complementary to
   one or more of the target gene DNA or RNA regions, and that they have nucleotide
 5 sequences within or surrounding that substrate binding site which impart an RNA cleaving
   activity to the molecule. Thus the ribozyme constructs need not be limited to specific motifs
   mentioned herein.
           Methods of producing a ribozyme targeted to any polynucleotide sequence are known
   in the art. Ribozymes may be designed as described in Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO
10 93/23569 and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 94/02595, each specifically incorporated herein
   by reference, and synthesized to be tested in vitro and in vivo, as described therein.
           Ribozyme activity can be optimized by altering the length of the ribozyme binding
   arms or chemically synthesizing ribozymes with modifications that prevent their degradation
   by serum ribonucleases (see e.g., Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 92/07065; Int. Pat. Appl. Publ.
15 No. WO 93/15187; Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 91/03162; Eur. Pat. Appl. Publ.
   No. 92110298.4; U. S. Patent 5,334,711; and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 94/13688, which
   describe various chemical modifications that can be made to the sugar moieties of enzymatic
   RNA molecules), modifications which enhance their efficacy in cells, and removal of stem II
   bases to shorten RNA synthesis times and reduce chemical requirements.
20
   Immunostimulatory Oligonucleotides
           Nucleic acids associated with lipid paticles of the present invention may be
   immunostimulatory, including immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (ISS; single-or double
   stranded) capable of inducing an immune response when administered to a subject, which
25 may be a mammal or other patient. ISS include, e.g., certain palindromes leading to hairpin
   secondary structures (see Yamamoto S., et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148: 4072-4076), or CpG
   motifs, as well as other known ISS features (such as multi-G domains, see WO 96/11266).
           The immune response may be an innate or an adaptive immune response. The
   immune system is divided into a more innate immune system, and acquired adaptive immune
30 system of vertebrates, the latter of which is further divided into humoral cellular components.
   In particular embodiments, the immune response may be mucosal.
                                                   60

           In particular embodiments, an immunostimulatory nucleic acid is only
   immunostimulatory when administered in combination with a lipid particle, and is not
   immunostimulatory when administered in its "free form." According to the present
   invention, such an oligonucleotide is considered to be immunostimulatory.
 5         Immunostimulatory nucleic acids are considered to be non-sequence specific when it
   is not required that they specifically bind to and reduce the expression of a target
   polynucleotide in order to provoke an immune response. Thus, certain immunostimulatory
   nucleic acids may comprise a seuqence correspondign to a region of a naturally occurring
   gene or mRNA, but they may still be considered non-sequence specific immunostimulatory
10 nucleic acids.
   Antagomirs
           Antagomirs are RNA-like oligonucleotides that harbor various modifications for
   RNAse protection and pharmacologic properties, such as enhanced tissue and cellular uptake.
15 They differ from normal RNA by, for example, complete 2'-0-methylation of sugar,
   phosphorothioate backbone and, for example, a cholesterol-moiety at 3'-end. Antagomirs may
   be used to efficiently silence endogenous miRNAs thereby preventing miRNA-induced gene
   silencing. An example of antagomir-mediated miRNA silencing is the silencing of miR- 122,
   described in Krutzfeldt et al, Nature, 2005, 438: 685-689, which is expressly incorporated by
20 reference herein, in its entirety.
   Decoy Oligonucleotides
           Because transcription factors can recognize their relatively short binding sequences,
   even in the absence of surrounding genomic DNA, short oligonucleotides bearing the
25 consensus binding sequence of a specific transcription factor can be used as tools for
   manipulating gene expression in living cells. This strategy involves the intracellular delivery
   of such "decoy oligonucleotides", which are then recognized and bound by the target factor.
   Occupation of the transcription factor's DNA-binding site by the decoy renders the
   transcription factor incapable of subsequently binding to the promoter regions of target genes.
30 Decoys can be used as therapeutic agents, either to inhibit the expression of genes that are
   activated by a transcription factor, or to upregulate genes that are suppressed by the binding
   of a transcription factor. Examples of the utilization of decoy oligonucleotides may be found
                                                    61

   in Mann et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2000, 106: 1071-1075, which is expressly incorporated by
   reference herein, in its entirety.
   Nucleic Acid Modifications
 5          Much of the discussion below refers to single strand molecules. In many
   embodiments of the invention a double stranded iRNA agent, e.g., a partially double stranded
   iRNA agent, is envisioned. Thus, it is understood that that double stranded structures (e.g.,
   where two separate molecules are contacted to form the double stranded region or where the
   double stranded region is formed by intramolecular pairing (e.g., a hairpin structure)) made of
10 the single stranded structures described below are within the invention. Lengths are
   described elsewhere herein.
            As nucleic acids are polymers of subunits, many of the modifications described below
   occur at a position which is repeated within a nucleic acid, e.g., a modification of a base, or a
   phosphate moiety, or the a non-linking 0 of a phosphate moiety. In some cases the
15 modification will occur at all of the subject positions in the nucleic acid but in many cases it
   will not. By way of example, a modification may only occur at a 3' or 5' terminal position,
   may only occur in a terminal regions, e.g., at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last
   2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of a strand. A modification may occur in a double strand region,
   a single strand region, or in both. A modification may occur only in the double strand region
20 of an RNA or may only occur in a single strand region of an RNA. E.g., a phosphorothioate
   modification at a non-linking 0 position may only occur at one or both termini, may only
   occur in a terminal regions, e.g., at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5,
   or 10 nucleotides of a strand, or may occur in double strand and single strand regions,
   particularly at termini. The 5' end or ends can be phosphorylated.
25          In one embodiment it is possible, e.g., to enhance stability, to include particular bases
   in overhangs, or to include modified nucleotides or nucleotide surrogates, in single strand
   overhangs, e.g., in a 5' or 3' overhang, or in both. E.g., it can be desirable to include purine
   nucleotides in overhangs. In one embodiment all or some of the bases in a 3' or 5' overhang
   will be modified, e.g., with a modification described herein. Modifications can include, e.g.,
30 the use of modifications at the 2' OH group of the ribose sugar, e.g., the use of
   deoxyribonucleotides, e.g., deoxythymidine, instead of ribonucleotides, and modifications in
                                                    62

   the phosphate group, e.g., phosphothioate modifications. Overhangs need not be homologous
   with the target sequence.
           Unmodified oligoribonucleotides may be less than optimal in some applications, e.g.,
   unmodified oligoribonucleotides can be prone to degradation by e.g., cellular nucleases.
 5 Nucleases can hydrolyze nucleic acid phosphodiester bonds. However, chemical
   modifications to one or more of the above RNA components can confer improved properties,
   and, e.g., can render oligoribonucleotides more stable to nucleases.
           Specific modifications are discussed in more detail below.
   The Phosphate Group
10         The phosphate group is a negatively charged species. The charge is distributed
   equally over the two non-linking oxygen atoms. However, the phosphate group can be
   modified by replacing one of the oxygens with a different substituent. One result of this
   modification to RNA phosphate backbones can be increased resistance of the
   oligoribonucleotide to nucleolytic breakdown. Thus while not wishing to be bound by
15 theory, it can be desirable in one embodiment to introduce alterations which result in either
   an uncharged linker or a charged linker with unsymmetrical charge distribution.
           Examples of modified phosphate groups include phosphorothioate,
   phosphoroselenates, borano phosphates, borano phosphate esters, hydrogen phosphonates,
   phosphoroamidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates and phosphotriesters. Phosphorodithioates
20 have both non-linking oxygens replaced by sulfur. The phosphorus center in the
   phosphorodithioates is achiral which precludes the formation of oligoribonucleotides
   diastereomers. Diastereomer formation can result in a preparation in which the individual
   diastereomers exhibit varying resistance to nucleases. Further, the hybridization affinity of
   RNA containing chiral phosphate groups can be lower relative to the corresponding
25 unmodified RNA species. Thus, oxygens of the phosphodiester linkage can be replaced by
   any one of S, Se, B, C, H, N, or OR (R is alkyl or aryl).
           The phosphate linker can also be modified by replacement of a linking oxygen with
   nitrogen (bridged phosphoroamidates), sulfur (bridged phosphorothioates) and carbon
   (bridged methylenephosphonates).
                                                  63

   The Sugar Group
            A modified RNA can include modification of all or some of the sugar groups of the
   ribonucleic acid. E.g., the 2' hydroxyl group (OH) can be modified or replaced with a
 5 number of different "oxy" or "deoxy" substituents. While not being bound by theory,
   enhanced stability is expected since the hydroxyl can no longer be deprotonated to form a 2'
   alkoxide ion. The 2' alkoxide can catalyze degradation by intramolecular nucleophilic attack
   on the linker phosphorus atom. Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it can be
   desirable to one embodiment to introduce alterations in which alkoxide formation at the 2'
10 position is not possible.
            Examples of "oxy"-2' hydroxyl group modifications include alkoxy or aryloxy (OR,
   e.g., R = H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or sugar); polyethyleneglycols (PEG),
   O(CH 2CH 2O),CH 2CH 2 OR; "locked" nucleic acids (LNA) in which the 2' hydroxyl is
   connected, e.g., by a methylene bridge, to the 4' carbon of the same ribose sugar; O-AMINE
15 (AMINE = NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl
   amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine, polyamino) and aminoalkoxy,
   O(CH 2)aAMINE, (e.g., AMINE = NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino,
   diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine, polyamino). It is
   noteworthy that oligonucleotides containing only the methoxyethyl group (MOE),
20 (OCH 2CH 20CH3, a PEG derivative), exhibit nuclease stabilities comparable to those
   modified with the robust phosphorothioate modification.
            "Deoxy" modifications include hydrogen (i.e., deoxyribose sugars, which are of
   particular relevance to the overhang portions of partially ds RNA); halo (e.g., fluoro); amino
   (e.g., NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl
25 amino, diheteroaryl amino, or amino acid); NH(CH 2CH 2NH)aCH 2CH 2-AMINE (AMINE
   NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino,or
   diheteroaryl amino), -NHC(O)R (R = alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or sugar),
   cyano; mercapto; alkyl-thio-alkyl; thioalkoxy; and alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkenyl and
   alkynyl, which may be optionally substituted with e.g., an amino functionality. Other
30 substitutents of certain embodiments include 2'-methoxyethyl, 2'-OCH3, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-C
   allyl, and 2'-fluoro.
                                                    64

           The sugar group can also contain one or more carbons that possess the opposite
   stereochemical configuration than that of the corresponding carbon in ribose. Thus, a
   modified RNA can include nucleotides containing e.g., arabinose, as the sugar.
           Modified RNA's can also include "abasic" sugars, which lack a nucleobase at C-1'.
 5 These abasic sugars can also be further contain modifications at one or more of the
   constituent sugar atoms.
           To maximize nuclease resistance, the 2' modifications can be used in combination
   with one or more phosphate linker modifications (e.g., phosphorothioate). The so-called
   "chimeric" oligonucleotides are those that contain two or more different modifications.
10 Replacement of the Phosphate Group
           The phosphate group can be replaced by non-phosphorus containing connectors.
   While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that since the charged phosphodiester
   group is the reaction center in nucleolytic degradation, its replacement with neutral structural
   mimics should impart enhanced nuclease stability. Again, while not wishing to be bound by
15 theory, it can be desirable, in some embodiment, to introduce alterations in which the charged
   phosphate group is replaced by a neutral moiety.
           Examples of moieties which can replace the phosphate group include siloxane,
   carbonate, carboxymethyl, carbamate, amide, thioether, ethylene oxide linker, sulfonate,
   sulfonamide, thioformacetal, formacetal, oxime, methyleneimino, methylenemethylimino,
20 methylenehydrazo, methylenedimethylhydrazo and methyleneoxymethylimino. In certain
   embodiments, replacements may include the methylenecarbonylamino and
   methylenemethylimino groups.
   Replacement of Ribophosphate Backbone
           Oligonucleotide- mimicking scaffolds can also be constructed wherein the phosphate
25 linker and ribose sugar are replaced by nuclease resistant nucleoside or nucleotide surrogates.
   While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the absence of a repetitively
   charged backbone diminishes binding to proteins that recognize polyanions (e.g., nucleases).
   Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it can be desirable in some embodiment, to
   introduce alterations in which the bases are tethered by a neutral surrogate backbone.
30         Examples include the mophilino, cyclobutyl, pyrrolidine and peptide nucleic acid
   (PNA) nucleoside surrogates. In certain embodiments, PNA surrogates may be used.
                                                   65

   Terminal Modifications
            The 3' and 5' ends of an oligonucleotide can be modified. Such modifications can be
   at the 3' end, 5' end or both ends of the molecule. They can include modification or
   replacement of an entire terminal phosphate or of one or more of the atoms of the phosphate
 5 group. E.g., the 3' and 5' ends of an oligonucleotide can be conjugated to other functional
   molecular entities such as labeling moieties, e.g., fluorophores (e.g., pyrene, TAMRA,
   fluorescein, Cy3 or Cy5 dyes) or protecting groups (based e.g., on sulfur, silicon, boron or
   ester). The functional molecular entities can be attached to the sugar through a phosphate
   group and/or a spacer. The terminal atom of the spacer can connect to or replace the linking
10 atom of the phosphate group or the C-3' or C-5' 0, N, S or C group of the sugar.
   Alternatively, the spacer can connect to or replace the terminal atom of a nucleotide surrogate
   (e.g., PNAs). These spacers or linkers can include e.g., -(CH 2)n-, -(CH 2)nN-, -(CH 2).O-,
   (CH 2 )nS-, O(CH 2CH 2O)nCH 2CH 2OH (e.g., n = 3 or 6), abasic sugars, amide, carboxy, amine,
   oxyamine, oxyimine, thioether, disulfide, thiourea, sulfonamide, or morpholino, or biotin and
15 fluorescein reagents. When a spacer/phosphate-functional molecular entity- spacer/phosphate
   array is interposed between two strands of iRNA agents, this array can substitute for a hairpin
   RNA loop in a hairpin-type RNA agent. The 3' end can be an -OH group. While not
   wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that conjugation of certain moieties can improve
   transport, hybridization, and specificity properties. Again, while not wishing to be bound by
20 theory, it may be desirable to introduce terminal alterations that improve nuclease resistance.
   Other examples of terminal modifications include dyes, intercalating agents (e.g., acridines),
   cross-linkers (e.g., psoralene, mitomycin C), porphyrins (TPPC4, texaphyrin, Sapphyrin),
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., phenazine, dihydrophenazine), artificial
   endonucleases (e.g., EDTA), lipophilic carriers (e.g., cholesterol, cholic acid, adamantane
25 acetic acid, 1-pyrene butyric acid, dihydrotestosterone, 1,3-Bis-O(hexadecyl)glycerol,
   geranyloxyhexyl group, hexadecylglycerol, borneol, menthol, 1,3-propanediol, heptadecyl
   group, palmitic acid, myristic acid,03-(oleoyl)lithocholic acid, 03-(oleoyl)cholenic acid,
   dimethoxytrityl, or phenoxazine)and peptide conjugates (e.g., antennapedia peptide, Tat
   peptide), alkylating agents, phosphate, amino, mercapto, PEG (e.g., PEG-40K), MPEG,
30 [MPEG] 2 , polyamino, alkyl, substituted alkyl, radiolabeled markers, enzymes, haptens (e.g.,
   biotin), transport/absorption facilitators (e.g., aspirin, vitamin E, folic acid), synthetic
                                                     66

   ribonucleases (e.g., imidazole, bisimidazole, histamine, imidazole clusters, acridine
   imidazole conjugates, Eu3+ complexes of tetraazamacrocycles).
            Terminal modifications can be added for a number of reasons, including as discussed
   elsewhere herein to modulate activity or to modulate resistance to degradation. Terminal
 5 modifications useful for modulating activity include modification of the 5' end with
   phosphate or phosphate analogs. E.g., in certain embodiments iRNA agents, especially
   antisense strands, are 5' phosphorylated or include a phosphoryl analog at the 5' prime
   terminus. 5'-phosphate modifications include those which are compatible with RISC
   mediated gene silencing. Suitable modifications include: 5'-monophosphate ((HO)2(O)P-0
10 5'); 5'-diphosphate ((HO)2(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-triphosphate ((HO)2(O)P-0
   (HO)(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-guanosine cap (7-methylated or non-methylated) (7m-G-0
   5'-(HO)(O)P-O-(HO)(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-adenosine cap (Appp), and any modified or
   unmodified nucleotide cap structure (N-0-5'-(HO)(O)P-O-(HO)(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5');           5'
   monothiophosphate (phosphorothioate; (HO)2(S)P-0-5'); 5'-monodithiophosphate
15 (phosphorodithioate; (HO)(HS)(S)P-0-5'), 5'-phosphorothiolate ((HO)2(O)P-S-5'); any
   additional combination of oxgen/sulfur replaced monophosphate, diphosphate and
   triphosphates (e.g., 5'-alpha-thiotriphosphate, 5'-gamma-thiotriphosphate, etc.), 5'
   phosphoramidates ((HO)2(O)P-NH-5', (HO)(NH2)(O)P-0-5'), 5'-alkylphosphonates
   (R=alkyl=methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, propyl, etc., e.g., RP(OH)(O)-0-5'-, (OH)2(O)P-5'-CH2-),
20 5'-alkyletherphosphonates (R=alkylether=methoxymethyl (MeOCH2-), ethoxymethyl, etc.,
   e.g., RP(OH)(O)-0-5'-).
            Terminal modifications can also be useful for monitoring distribution, and in such
   cases the groups to be added may include fluorophores, e.g., fluorscein or an Alexa dye, e.g.,
   Alexa 488. Terminal modifications can also be useful for enhancing uptake, useful
25 modifications for this include cholesterol. Terminal modifications can also be useful for
   cross-linking an RNA agent to another moiety; modifications useful for this include
   mitomycin C.
   The Bases
            Adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil are the most common bases found in RNA.
30 These bases can be modified or replaced to provide RNA's having improved properties. E.g.,
   nuclease resistant oligoribonucleotides can be prepared with these bases or with synthetic and
   natural nucleobases (e.g., inosine, thymine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, nubularine, isoguanisine,
                                                   67

   or tubercidine) and any one of the above modifications. Alternatively, substituted or
   modified analogs of any of the above bases and "universal bases" can be employed.
   Examples include 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and
   guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 5-halouracil and
 5 cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil
   (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 5-halouracil, 5-(2-aminopropyl)uracil, 5-amino allyl uracil, 8
   halo, amino, thiol, thioalkyl, hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5
   trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine, 5-substituted
   pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including 2
10 aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine, dihydrouracil, 3-deaza-5
   azacytosine, 2-aminopurine, 5-alkyluracil, 7-alkylguanine, 5-alkyl cytosine,7-deazaadenine,
   N6, N6-dimethyladenine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 5-amino-allyl-uracil, N3-methyluracil,
   substituted 1,2,4-triazoles, 2-pyridinone, 5-nitroindole, 3-nitropyrrole, 5-methoxyuracil,
   uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluracil, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 5
15 methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouracil, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino
   3carboxypropyl)uracil, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N 4 -acetyl cytosine, 2
   thiocytosine, N6-methyladenine, N6-isopentyladenine, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine,
   N-methylguanines, or O-alkylated bases. Further purines and pyrimidines include those
   disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, those disclosed in the Concise Encyclopedia Of
20 Polymer Science And Engineering, pages 858-859, Kroschwitz, J. I., ed. John Wiley & Sons,
   1990, and those disclosed by Englisch et al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition,
   1991, 30, 613.
                Generally, base changes are not used for promoting stability, but they can be
        useful for other reasons, e.g., some, e.g., 2,6-diaminopurine and 2 amino purine, are
25      fluorescent. Modified bases can reduce target specificity. This may be taken into
        consideration in the design of iRNA agents.

10         The nucleic acid that is used in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this invention
   includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. Thus, the nucleic acid may be a modified
   nucleic acid of the type used previously to enhance nuclease resistance and serum stability.
   Surprisingly, however, acceptable therapeutic products can also be prepared using the method
   of the invention to formulate lipid-nucleic acid particles from nucleic acids that have no
15 modification to the phosphodiester linkages of natural nucleic acid polymers, and the use of
   unmodified phosphodiester nucleic acids (i.e., nucleic acids in which all of the linkages are
   phosphodiester linkages) is a preferred embodiment of the invention.
   Chimeric Oligonucleotides
20         It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified,
   and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a
   single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide. Certain preferred
   oligonucleotides of this invention are chimeric oligonucleotides. "Chimeric
   oligonucleotides" or "chimeras," in the context of this invention, are oligonucleotides that
25 contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one nucleotide.
   These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region of modified nucleotides that
   confers one or more beneficial properties (such as, e,g., increased nuclease resistance,
   increased uptake into cells, increased binding affinity for the RNA target) and a region that is
   a substrate for RNase H cleavage.
30         In one embodiment, a chimeric oligonucleotide comprises at least one region
   modified to increase target binding affinity. Affinity of an oligonucleotide for its target is
   routinely determined by measuring the Tm of an oligonucleotide/target pair, which is the
                                                     71

   temperature at which the oligonucleotide and target dissociate; dissociation is detected
   spectrophotometrically. The higher the Tm, the greater the affinity of the oligonucleotide for
   the target. In one embodiment, the region of the oligonucleotide which is modified to
   increase target mRNA binding affinity comprises at least one nucleotide modified at the 2'
 5 position of the sugar, most preferably a 2'-O-alkyl, 2'-O-alkyl-O-alkyl or 2'-fluoro-modified
   nucleotide. Such modifications are routinely incorporated into oligonucleotides and these
   oligonucleotides have been shown to have a higher Tm (i.e., higher target binding affinity)
   than 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides against a given target. The effect of such increased affinity is
   to greatly enhance oligonucleotide inhibition of target gene expression.
10         In another embodiment, a chimeric oligonucletoide comprises a region that acts as a
   substrate for RNAse H. Of course, it is understood that oligonucleotides may include any
   combination of the various modifications described herein.
           Another modification of the oligonucleotides of the invention involves chemically
   linking to the oligonucleotide one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity,
15 cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. Such conjugates and methods
   of preparing the same are known in the art.
           Those skilled in the art will realize that for in vivo utility, such as therapeutic efficacy,
   a reasonable rule of thumb is that if a thioated version of the sequence works in the free form,
   that encapsulated particles of the same sequence, of any chemistry, will also be efficacious.
20 Encapsulated particles may also have a broader range of in vivo utilities, showing efficacy in
   conditions and models not known to be otherwise responsive to antisense therapy. Those
   skilled in the art know that applying this invention they may find old models which now
   respond to antisense therapy. Further, they may revisit discarded antisense sequences or
   chemistries and find efficacy by employing the invention.
25         The oligonucleotides used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and
   routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for
   such synthesis is sold by several vendors including Applied Biosystems. Any other means
   for such synthesis may also be employed; the actual synthesis of the oligonucleotides is well
   within the talents of the routineer. It is also well known to use similar techniques to prepare
30 other oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.

   (2) encapsulation efficiency; and (3) particle size. High drug to lipid rations, high
   encapsulation efficiency, good nuclease resistance and serum stability and controllable
   particle size, generally less than 200 nm in diameter are desirable. In addition, the nature of
   the nucleic acid polymer is of significance, since the modification of nucleic acids in an effort
10 to impart nuclease resistance adds to the cost of therapeutics while in many cases providing
   only limited resistance. Unless stated otherwise, these criteria are calculated in this
   specification as follows:
           Nucleic acid to lipid ratio is the amount of nucleic acid in a defined volume of
   preparation divided by the amount of lipid in the same volume. This may be on a mole per
15 mole basis or on a weight per weight basis, or on a weight per mole basis. For final,
   administration-ready formulations, the nucleic acid:lipid ratio is calculated after dialysis,
   chromatography and/or enzyme (e.g., nuclease) digestion has been employed to remove as
   much of the external nucleic acid as possible;
           Encapsulation efficiency refers to the drug to lipid ratio of the starting mixture
20 divided by the drug to lipid ratio of the final, administration competent formulation. This is a
   measure of relative efficiency. For a measure of absolute efficiency, the total amount of
   nucleic acid added to the starting mixture that ends up in the administration competent
   formulation, can also be calculated. The amount of lipid lost during the formulation process
   may also be calculated. Efficiency is a measure of the wastage and expense of the
25 formulation; and
           Size indicates the size (diameter) of the particles formed. Size distribution may be
   determined using quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) on a Nicomp Model 370 sub-micron
   particle sizer. Particles under 200 nm are preferred for distribution to neo-vascularized
   (leaky) tissues, such as neoplasms and sites of inflammation.

   Pharmaceutical Compositions
            The lipid particles of present invention, particularly when associated with a
   therapeutic agent, may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, e.g., which further
 5 comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, or carrier, such as physiological
   saline or phosphate buffer, selected in accordance with the route of administration and
   standard pharmaceutical practice.
            In particular embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the lipid-nucleic
   acid particles of the invention are prepared according to standard techniques and further
10 comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Generally, normal saline will be employed
   as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers include, e.g., water,
   buffered water, 0.9% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including glycoproteins for enhanced
   stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. In compositions comprising saline or
   other salt containing carriers, the carrier is preferably added following lipid particle
15 formation. Thus, after the lipid-nucleic acid compositions are formed, the compositions can
   be diluted into pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as normal saline.
            The resulting pharmaceutical preparations may be sterilized by conventional, well
   known sterilization techniques. The aqueous solutions can then be packaged for use or
   filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined
20 with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions may contain
   pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological
   conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like,
   for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium
   chloride, etc. Additionally, the lipidic suspension may include lipid-protective agents which
25 protect lipids against free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free
   radical quenchers, such as a-tocopherol and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as
   ferrioxamine, are suitable.
            The concentration of lipid particle or lipid-nucleic acid particle in the pharmaceutical
   formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.01%, usually at or at least about
30 0.05-5% to as much as 10 to 30% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes,
   viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected. For
   example, the concentration may be increased to lower the fluid load associated with
                                                     74

   treatment. This may be particularly desirable in patients having atherosclerosis-associated
   congestive heart failure or severe hypertension. Alternatively, complexes composed of
   irritating lipids may be diluted to low concentrations to lessen inflammation at the site of
   administration. In one group of embodiments, the nucleic acid will have an attached label
 5 and will be used for diagnosis (by indicating the presence of complementary nucleic acid). In
   this instance, the amount of complexes administered will depend upon the particular label
   used, the disease state being diagnosed and the judgement of the clinician but will generally
   be between about 0.01 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight, preferably between
   about 0.1 and about 5 mg/kg of body weight.
10          As noted above, the lipid-therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) particels of the
   invention may include polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified phospholipids, PEG-ceramide, or
   ganglioside GMl-modified lipids or other lipids effective to prevent or limit aggregation.
   Addition of such components does not merely prevent complex aggregation. Rather, it may
   also provide a means for increasing circulation lifetime and increasing the delivery of the
15 lipid-nucleic acid composition to the target tissues.
            The present invention also provides lipid-therapeutic agent compositions in kit form.
   The kit will typically be comprised of a container that is compartmentalized for holding the
   various elements of the kit. The kit will contain the particles or pharmaceutical compositions
   of the present invention, preferably in dehydrated or concentrated form, with instructions for
20 their rehydration or dilution and administration. In certain embodiments, the particles
   comprise the active agent, while in other embodiments, they do not.
   Methods of Manufacture
            The methods and compositions of the invention make use of certain targeting lipids,
25 the synthesis, preparation and characterization of which is described in the accompanying
   Examples. In addition, the present invention provides methods of preparing lipid particles,
   including those associated with a therapeutic agent, e.g., a nucleic acid. In the methods
   described herein, a mixture of lipids is combined with a buffered aqueous solution of nucleic
   acid to produce an intermediate mixture containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid
30 particles wherein the encapsulated nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of
   about about 1 wt% to about 30 wt%, prefereably 3 to 25 wt%, even more preferably 5 to 15
   wt%. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid-encapsulated nucleic
                                                   75

   acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles, preferably having a diameter
   of 20 to 200 nm, more preferably 30 to 150 nm, even more preferably about 40 to 90 nm.
   The pH is then raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on the lipid
   nucleic acid particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized lipid
 5 encapsulated nucleic acid composition.
            As described above, several of the cationic lipids are amino lipids that are charged at a
   pH below the pKa of the amino group and substantially neutral at a pH above the pKa. These
   cationic lipids are termed titratable cationic lipids and can be used in the formulations of the
   invention using a two-step process. First, lipid vesicles can be formed at the lower pH with
10 titratable cationic lipids and other vesicle components in the presence of nucleic acids. In this
   manner, the vesicles will encapsulate and entrap the nucleic acids. Second, the surface
   charge of the newly formed vesicles can be neutralized by increasing the pH of the medium
   to a level above the pKa of the titratable cationic lipids present, i.e., to physiological pH or
   higher. Particularly advantageous aspects of this process include both the facile removal of
15 any surface adsorbed nucleic acid and a resultant nucleic acid delivery vehicle which has a
   neutral surface. Liposomes or lipid particles having a neutral surface are expected to avoid
   rapid clearance from circulation and to avoid certain toxicities which are associated with
   cationic liposome preparations. Additional details concerning these uses of such titratable
   cationic lipids in the formulation of nucleic acid-lipid particles are provided in US Patent
20 6,287,591 and US Patent 6,858,225, incorporated herein by reference.
            It is further noted that the vesicles formed in this manner provide formulations of
   uniform vesicle size with high content of nucleic acids. Additionally, the vesicles have a size
   range of from about 20 to about 200 nm, preferably 30 to about 150 nm, more preferably
   about 30 to about 90 nm.
25          Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the very
   high efficiency of nucleic acid encapsulation is a result of electrostatic interaction at low pH.
   At acidic pH (e.g. pH 4.0) the vesicle surface is charged and binds a portion of the nucleic
   acids through electrostatic interactions. When the external acidic buffer is exchanged for a
   more neutral buffer (e.g. pH 7.5) the surface of the lipid particle or liposome is neutralized,
30 allowing any external nucleic acid to be removed. More detailed information on the
   formulation process is provided in various publications (e.g., US Patent 6,287,591 and US
   Patent 6,858,225).
                                                     76

            In view of the above, the present invention provides methods of preparing
   lipid/nucleic acid formulations. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is
   combined with a buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate
   mixture containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles, e.g., wherein the encapsulated
 5 nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 10 wt% to about 20 wt%. The
   intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid
   particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles, preferably having a diameter of
   30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to 90 nm. The pH is then raised to neutralize at least
   a portion of the surface charges on the lipid-nucleic acid particles, thus providing an at least
10 partially surface-neutralized lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid composition.
            In preparing the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention, the mixture of lipids is
   typically a solution of lipids in an organic solvent. This mixture of lipids can then be dried to
   form a thin film or lyophilized to form a powder before being hydrated with an aqueous
   buffer to form liposomes. Alternatively, in a preferred method, the lipid mixture can be
15 solubilized in a water miscible alcohol, such as ethanol, and this ethanolic solution added to
   an aqueous buffer resulting in spontaneous liposome formation. In most embodiments, the
   alcohol is used in the form in which it is commercially available. For example, ethanol can
   be used as absolute ethanol (100%), or as 95% ethanol, the remainder being water. This
   method is described in more detail in US Patent 5,976,567).
20          In one exemplary embodiment, the mixture of lipids is a mixture of targeting lipid,
   cationic lipids, neutral lipids (other than a cationic lipid), a sterol (e.g., cholesterol) and a
   PEG-modified lipid (e.g., a PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-DMA) in an alcohol solvent.
   In preferred embodiments, the lipid mixture consists essentially of a targeting lipid, acationic
   amino lipid, a neutral lipid, cholesterol and a PEG-modified lipid in alcohol, more preferably
25 ethanol. In further preferred embodiments, the first solution consists of the above lipid
   mixture in molar ratios of about 0.5-50% targeting lipid: 20-70% cationic lipid: 5-45%
   neutral lipid:20-55% cholesterol:0.5 -15% PEG-modified lipid.
            In accordance with the invention, the lipid mixture is combined with a buffered
   aqueous solution that may contain the nucleic acids. The buffered aqueous solution of is
30 typically a solution in which the buffer has a pH of less than the pKa of the protonatable lipid
   in the lipid mixture. Examples of suitable buffers include citrate, phosphate, acetate, and
   MES. A particularly preferred buffer is citrate buffer. Preferred buffers will be in the range
                                                     77

   of 1-1000 mM of the anion, depending on the chemistry of the nucleic acid being
   encapsulated, and optimization of buffer concentration may be significant to achieving high
   loading levels (see, e.g., US Patent 6,287,591 and US Patent 6,858,225).       Alternatively, pure
   water acidified to pH 5-6 with chloride, sulfate or the like may be useful. In this case, it may
 5 be suitable to add 5% glucose, or another non-ionic solute which will balance the osmotic
   potential across the particle membrane when the particles are dialyzed to remove ethanol,
   increase the pH, or mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as normal saline.
   The amount of nucleic acid in buffer can vary, but will typically be from about 0.01 mg/mL
   to about 200 mg/mL, more preferably from about 0.5 mg/mL to about 50 mg/mL.
10         The mixture of lipids and the buffered aqueous solution of therapeutic nucleic acids is
   combined to provide an intermediate mixture. The intermediate mixture is typically a
   mixture of lipid particles having encapsulated nucleic acids. Additionally, the intermediate
   mixture may also contain some portion of nucleic acids which are attached to the surface of
   the lipid particles (liposomes or lipid vesicles) due to the ionic attraction of the negatively
15 charged nucleic acids and positively-charged lipids on the lipid particle surface (the amino
   lipids or other lipid making up the protonatable first lipid component are positively charged
   in a buffer having a pH of less than the pKa of the protonatable group on the lipid). In one
   group of preferred embodiments, the mixture of lipids is an alcohol solution of lipids and the
   volumes of each of the solutions is adjusted so that upon combination, the resulting alcohol
20 content is from about 20% by volume to about 45% by volume. The method of combining
   the mixtures can include any of a variety of processes, often depending upon the scale of
   formulation produced. For example, when the total volume is about 10-20 mL or less, the
   solutions can be combined in a test tube and stirred together using a vortex mixer. Large
   scale processes can be carried out in suitable production scale glassware.
25          Optionally, the lipid-encapsulated therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) complexes
   which are produced by combining the lipid mixture and the buffered aqueous solution of
   therapeutic agents (nucleic acids) can be sized to achieve a desired size range and relatively
   narrow distribution of lipid particle sizes. Preferably, the compositions provided herein will
   be sized to a mean diameter of from about 70 to about 200 nm, more preferably about 90 to
30 about 130 nm. Several techniques are available for sizing liposomes to a desired size. One
   sizing method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323, incorporated herein by reference.
   Sonicating a liposome suspension either by bath or probe sonication produces a progressive
                                                    78

   size reduction down to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) less than about 0.05 microns in
   size. Homogenization is another method which relies on shearing energy to fragment large
   liposomes into smaller ones. In a typical homogenization procedure, multilamellar vesicles
   are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer until selected liposome sizes,
 5 typically between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns, are observed. In both methods, the particle size
   distribution can be monitored by conventional laser-beam particle size determination. For
   certain methods herein, extrusion is used to obtain a uniform vesicle size.
           Extrusion of liposome compositions through a small-pore polycarbonate membrane or
   an asymmetric ceramic membrane results in a relatively well-defined size distribution.
10 Typically, the suspension is cycled through the membrane one or more times until the desired
   liposome complex size distribution is achieved. The liposomes may be extruded through
   successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve a gradual reduction in liposome size. In
   some instances, the lipid-nucleic acid compositions which are formed can be used without
   any sizing.
15         In particular embodiments, methods of the present invention further comprise a step
   of neutralizing at least some of the surface charges on the lipid portions of the lipid-nucleic
   acid compositions. By at least partially neutralizing the surface charges, unencapsulated
   nucleic acid is freed from the lipid particle surface and can be removed from the composition
   using conventional techniques. Preferably, unencapsulated and surface adsorbed nucleic
20 acids are removed from the resulting compositions through exchange of buffer solutions. For
   example, replacement of a citrate buffer (pH about 4.0, used for forming the compositions)
   with a HEPES-buffered saline (HBS pH about 7.5) solution, results in the neutralization of
   liposome surface and nucleic acid release from the surface. The released nucleic acid can
   then be removed via chromatography using standard methods, and then switched into a buffer
25 with a pH above the pKa of the lipid used.
           Optionally the lipid vesicles (i.e., lipid particles) can be formed by hydration in an
   aqueous buffer and sized using any of the methods described above prior to addition of the
   nucleic acid. As described above, the aqueous buffer should be of a pH below the pKa of the
   amino lipid. A solution of the nucleic acids can then be added to these sized, preformed
30 vesicles. To allow encapsulation of nucleic acids into such "pre-formed" vesicles the mixture
   should contain an alcohol, such as ethanol. In the case of ethanol, it should be present at a
   concentration of about 20% (w/w) to about 45% (w/w). In addition, it may be necessary to
                                                     79

   warm the mixture of pre-formed vesicles and nucleic acid in the aqueous buffer-ethanol
   mixture to a temperature of about 250 C to about 50' C depending on the composition of the
   lipid vesicles and the nature of the nucleic acid. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in
   the art that optimization of the encapsulation process to achieve a desired level of nucleic
 5 acid in the lipid vesicles will require manipulation of variable such as ethanol concentration
   and temperature. Examples of suitable conditions for nucleic acid encapsulation are provided
   in the Examples. Once the nucleic acids are encapsulated within the prefromed vesicles, the
   external pH can be increased to at least partially neutralize the surface charge.
   Unencapsulated and surface adsorbed nucleic acids can then be removed as described above.
10
   Method of Use
            The lipid particles of the present invention may be used to deliver a therapeutic agent
   to a cell, in vitro or in vivo. In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a nucleic
   acid, which is delivered to a cell using a nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present invention.
15 While the following description o various methodsof using the lipid particles and related
   pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are exemplified by description related
   to nucleic acid-lipid particles, it is understood that these methods and compositions may be
   readily adapted for the delivery of any therapeutic agent for the treatment of any disease or
   disorder that would benefit from such treatment.
20          In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for introducing a
   nucleic acid into a cell. Preferred nucleic acids for introduction into cells are siRNA,
   immune-stimulating oligonucleotides, plasmids, antisense and ribozymes. These methods
   may be carried out by contacting the particles or compositions of the present invention with
   the cells for a period of time sufficient for intracellular delivery to occur.
25          The compositions of the present invention can be adsorbed to almost any cell type.
   Once adsorbed, the nucleic acid-lipid particles can either be endocytosed by a portion of the
   cells, exchange lipids with cell membranes, or fuse with the cells. Transfer or incorporation
   of the nucleic acid portion of the complex can take place via any one of these pathways.
   Without intending to be limited with respect to the scope of the invention, it is believed that
30 in the case of particles taken up into the cell by endocytosis the particles then interact with
   the endosomal membrane, resulting in destabilization of the endosomal membrane, possibly
   by the formation of non-bilayer phases, resulting in introduction of the encapsulated nucleic
                                                     80

   acid into the cell cytoplasm. Similarly in the case of direct fusion of the particles with the
   cell plasma membrane, when fusion takes place, the liposome membrane is integrated into
   the cell membrane and the contents of the liposome combine with the intracellular fluid.
   Contact between the cells and the lipid-nucleic acid compositions, when carried out in vitro,
 5 will take place in a biologically compatible medium. The concentration of compositions can
   vary widely depending on the particular application, but is generally between about 1 Pmol
   and about 10 mmol. In certain embodiments, treatment of the cells with the lipid-nucleic acid
   compositions will generally be carried out at physiological temperatures (about 37 0 C) for
   periods of time from about 1 to 24 hours, preferably from about 2 to 8 hours. For in vitro
10 applications, the delivery of nucleic acids can be to any cell grown in culture, whether of
   plant or animal origin, vertebrate or invertebrate, and of any tissue or type. In preferred
   embodiments, the cells will be animal cells, more preferably mammalian cells, and most
   preferably human cells.
            In one group of embodiments, a lipid-nucleic acid particle suspension is added to 60
15 80% confluent plated cells having a cell density of from about 103 to about 105 cells/mL,
   more preferably about 2 x 104 cells/mL. The concentration of the suspension added to the
   cells is preferably of from about 0.01 to 20 pg/mL, more preferably about 1 pg/mL.
            Typical applications include using well known procedures to provide intracellular
   delivery of siRNA to knock down or silence specific cellular targets. Alternatively
20 applications include delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences that code for therapeutically
   useful polypeptides. In this manner, therapy is provided for genetic diseases by supplying
   deficient or absent gene products (i.e., for Duchenne's dystrophy, see Kunkel, et al., Brit.
   Med. Bull. 45(3):630-643 (1989), and for cystic fibrosis, see Goodfellow, Nature 341:102
   103 (1989)). Other uses for the compositions of the present invention include introduction of
25 antisense oligonucleotides in cells (see, Bennett, et al., Mol. Pharm. 41:1023-1033 (1992)).
            Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention can also be used for deliver of
   nucleic acids to cells in vivo, using methods which are known to those of skill in the art.
   With respect to application of the invention for delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences, Zhu,
   et al., Science 261:209-211 (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the
30 intravenous delivery of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)
   expression plasmid using DOTMA-DOPE complexes. Hyde, et al., Nature 362:250-256
   (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the delivery of the cystic fibrosis
                                                   81

   transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to epithelia of the airway and to alveoli
   in the lung of mice, using liposomes. Brigham, et al., Am. J. Med. Sci. 298:278-281 (1989),
   incorporated herein by reference, describes the in vivo transfection of lungs of mice with a
   functioning prokaryotic gene encoding the intracellular enzyme, chloramphenicol
 5 acetyltransferase (CAT). Thus, the compositions of the invention can be used in the
   treatment of infectious diseases.
           For in vivo administration, the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably
   administered parenterally, i.e., intraarticularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally,
   subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. In particular embodiments, the pharmaceutical
10 compositions are administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by a bolus injection. For
   one example, see Stadler, et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,286,634, which is incorporated herein by
   reference. Intracellular nucleic acid delivery has also been discussed in Straubringer, et al.,
   METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY,        Academic Press, New York. 101:512-527 (1983); Mannino, et
   al., Biotechniques 6:682-690 (1988); Nicolau, et al., Crit.Rev. Ther. Drug CarrierSyst.
15 6:239-271 (1989), and Behr, Acc. Chem. Res. 26:274-278 (1993). Still other methods of
   administering lipid-based therapeutics are described in, for example, Rahman et al., U.S.
   Patent No. 3,993,754; Sears, U.S. Patent No. 4,145,410; Papahadjopoulos et al., U.S. Patent
   No. 4,235,871; Schneider, U.S. Patent No. 4,224,179; Lenk et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,522,803;
   and Fountain et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,588,578.
20         In other methods, the pharmaceutical preparations may be contacted with the target
   tissue by direct application of the preparation to the tissue. The application may be made by
   topical, "open" or "closed" procedures. By "topical," it is meant the direct application of the
   pharmaceutical preparation to a tissue exposed to the environment, such as the skin,
   oropharynx, external auditory canal, and the like. "Open" procedures are those procedures
25 which include incising the skin of a patient and directly visualizing the underlying tissue to
   which the pharmaceutical preparations are applied. This is generally accomplished by a
   surgical procedure, such as a thoracotomy to access the lungs, abdominal laparotomy to
   access abdominal viscera, or other direct surgical approach to the target tissue. "Closed"
   procedures are invasive procedures in which the internal target tissues are not directly
30 visualized, but accessed via inserting instruments through small wounds in the skin. For
   example, the preparations may be administered to the peritoneum by needle lavage.
   Likewise, the pharmaceutical preparations may be administered to the meninges or spinal
                                                     82

   cord by infusion during a lumbar puncture followed by appropriate positioning of the patient
   as commonly practiced for spinal anesthesia or metrazamide imaging of the spinal cord.
   Alternatively, the preparations may be administered through endoscopic devices.
           The lipid-nucleic acid compositions can also be administered in an aerosol inhaled
 5 into the lungs (see, Brigham, et al., Am. J. Sci. 298(4):278-281 (1989)) or by direct injection
   at the site of disease (Culver, Human Gene Therapy, MaryAnn Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New
   York. pp. 7 0 - 7 1 (1994)).
           The methods of the present invention may be practiced in a variety of hosts. Preferred
   hosts include mammalian species, such as humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats, cattle,
10 horses, sheep, and the like.
           Dosages for the lipid-therapeutic agent particles of the present invention will depend
   on the ratio of therapeutic agent to lipid and the administrating physician's opinion based on
   age, weight, and condition of the patient.
           In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of modulating the
15 expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. These methods generally comprise
   contacting a cell with a lipid particle of the present invention that is associated with a nucleic
   acid capable of modulating the expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. As used
   herein, the term "modulating" refers to altering the expression of a target polynucleotide or
   polypeptide. In different embodiments, modulating can mean increasing or enhancing, or it
20 can mean decreasing or reducing. Methods of measuring the level of expression of a target
   polynucleotide or polypeptide are known and available in the arts and include, e.g., methods
   employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
   immunohistochemical techniques. In particular embodiments, the level of expression of a
   target polynucleotide or polypeptide is increased or reduced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%,
25 50%, or greater than 50% as compared to an appropriate control value.
           For example, if increased expression of a polypeptide desired, the nucleic acid may be
   an expression vector that includes a polynucleotide that encodes the desired polypeptide. On
   the other hand, if reduced expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide is desired, then the
   nucleic acid may be, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, or microRNA that comprises
30 a polynucleotide sequence that specifically hybridizes to a polnucleotide that encodes the
   target polypeptide, thereby disrupting expression of the target polynucleotide or polypeptide.
                                                    83

   Alternatively, the nucleic acid may be a plasmid that expresses such an antisense
   oligonucletoide, siRNA, or microRNA.
           In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a
   microRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, an antagomir and a plasmid capable of expressing
 5 an siRNA, a microRNA, or an antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA,
   microRNA, or antisense RNA comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a
   polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide, or a complement thereof, such that the
   expression of the polypeptide is reduced.
           In other embodiments, the nucleic acid is a plasmid that encodes the polypeptide or a
10 functional variant or fragment thereof, such that expression of the polypeptide or the
   functional variant or fragment thereof is increased.
           In related embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a disease
   or disorder characterized by overexpression of a polypeptide in a subject, comprising
   providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, wherein the
15 therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a microRNA, an antagomir, an antisense
   oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an siRNA, a microRNA, or an antisense
   oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or antisense RNA comprises a
   polynucleotide that specifically binds to a polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide, or a
   complement thereof.
20         In another related embodiment, the present invention includes a method of treating a
   disease or disorder characterized by underexpression of a polypeptide in a subject,
   comprising providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention,
   wherein the therapeutic agent is a plasmid that encodes the polypeptide or a functional variant
   or fragment thereof.
25         In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is provided to the subject in
   combination with a vaccine or antigen. Thus, the present invention itself provides vaccines
   comprising a lipid particle of the present invention, which comprises an immunostimulatory
   oligonucleotide, and is also associated with an antigen to which an immune response is
   desired. In particular embodiments, the antigen is a tumor antigen or is associated with an
30 infective agent, such as, e.g., a virus, bacteria, or parasiste.

   Definitions
   For convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification,
   examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy
   between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in
 5 this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.
           "G," "C," "A" and "U" each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine,
   cytosine, adenine, and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that the
   term "ribonucleotide" or "nucleotide" can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further
   detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that
10 guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without
   substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide including a nucleotide
   bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide including
   inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil.
   Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide
15 sequences of the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. Sequences
   including such replacement moieties are embodiments of the invention.
           By "Factor VII" as used herein is meant a Factor VII mRNA, protein, peptide, or
   polypeptide. The term "Factor VII" is also known in the art as AI132620, Cf7, Coagulation
   factor VII precursor, coagulation factor VII, FVII, Serum prothrombin conversion
20 accelerator, FVII coagulation protein, and eptacog alfa.
           As used herein, "target sequence" refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide
   sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of the gene, including
   mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product.
           As used herein, the term "strand including a sequence" refers to an oligonucleotide
25 including a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the
   standard nucleotide nomenclature.
           As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "complementary," when used
   in the context of a nucleotide pair, means a classic Watson-Crick pair, i.e., GC, AT, or AU. It
   also extends to classic Watson-Crick pairings where one or both of the nuclotides has been
30 modified as decribed herein, e.g., by a rbose modification or a phosphate backpone
   modification. It can also include pairing with an inosine or other entity that does not
   substantially alter the base pairing properties.
                                                     88

            As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "complementary," when used
   to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to
   the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the first nucleotide sequence to
   hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or
 5 polynucleotide including the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled
   person. Complementarity can include, full complementarity, substantial complementarity,
   and sufficient complementarity to allow hybridization under physiological conditions, e.g,
   under physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism. Full
   complementarity refers to complementarity, as defined above for an individual pair, at all of
10 the pairs of the first and second sequence. When a sequence is "substantially
   complementary" with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully
   complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 4, 3 or 2
   mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the
   conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. Substantial complementarity can also
15 be defined as hybridization under stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may
   include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50'C or 70'C for 12-16 hours
   followed by washing. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most
   appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate
   application of the hybridized nucleotides.
20          However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one
   or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with
   regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA including one
   oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length,
   wherein the longer oligonucleotide includes a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully
25 complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as "fully
   complementary" for the purposes of the invention.
            "Complementary" sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely
   from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified
   nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are
30 fulfilled.
            The terms "complementary", "fully complementary", "substantially complementary"
   and sufficient complementarity to allow hybridization under physiological conditions, e.g,
                                                    89

   under physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, may be
   used hereinwith respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense
   strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will
   be understood from the context of their use.
 5         As used herein, a polynucleotide which is "complementary, e.g., substantially
   complementary to at least part of' a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide
   which is complementary, e.g., substantially complementary, to a contiguous portion of the
   mRNA of interest (e.g., encoding Factor VII). For example, a polynucleotide is
   complementary to at least a part of a Factor VII mRNA if the sequence is substantially
10 complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding Factor VII.
           The term "double-stranded RNA" or "dsRNA", as used herein, refers to a ribonucleic
   acid molecule, or complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure including
   two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined above, nucleic acid strands.
   The two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA
15 molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where the two strands are part of one
   larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides
   between the 3'-end of one strand and the 5'end of the respective other strand forming the
   duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a "hairpin loop". Where the two
   strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides
20 between the 3'-end of one strand and the 5'end of the respective other strand forming the
   duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a "linker." The RNA strands may
   have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is
   the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA. In addition to the duplex
   structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs. A dsRNA as used
25 herein is also refered to as a "small inhibitory RNA," "siRNA," "siRNA agent," "iRNA
   agent" or "RNAi agent."
           As used herein, a "nucleotide overhang" refers to the unpaired nucleotide or
   nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3'-end of one strand
   of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5'-end of the other strand, or vice versa. "Blunt" or "blunt
30 end" means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the dsRNA, i.e., no
   nucleotide overhang. A "blunt ended" dsRNA is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its
   entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule.
                                                    90

            The term "antisense strand" refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a region
   that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term "region of
   complementarity" refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially
   complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the
 5 region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches
   are most tolerated in the terminal regions and, if present, are generally in a terminal region or
   regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5' and/or 3' terminus.
            The term "sense strand," as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that includes
   a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand.
10 The term "identity" is the relationship between two or more polynucleotide sequences, as
   determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also means the degree of sequence
   relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match between strings of
   such sequences. While there exist a number of methods to measure identity between two
   polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence
15 Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987); and Sequence
   Analysis Primer, Gribskov., M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York
   (1991)). "Substantially identical," as used herein, means there is a very high degree of
   homology (preferably 100% sequence identity) between the sense strand of the dsRNA and
   the corresponding part of the target gene. However, dsRNA having greater than 90%, or 95%
20 sequence identity may be used in the present invention, and thus sequence variations that
   might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence
   can be tolerated. Although 100% identity is preferred, the dsRNA may contain single or
   multiple base-pair random mismatches between the RNA and the target gene.
            "Introducing into a cell", when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating uptake or
25 absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of
   dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary
   agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also
   be "introduced into a cell," wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such instance,
   introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo
30 delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vitro
   introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and
   lipofection.
                                                     91

            The terms "silence" and "inhibit the expression of," in as far as they refer to the
   Factor VII gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of the Factor
   VII gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of mRNA transcribed from the Factor
   VII gene which may be isolated from a first cell or group of cells in which the Factor VII
 5 gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the expression of the Factor
   VII gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to
   the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The
   degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of
                           (mRNA in control cells) - (mRNA in treated cells) 6100%
                                         (mRNA in control cells)
10          Alternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a
   parameter that is functionally linked to Factor VII gene transcription, e.g. the amount of
   protein encoded by the Factor VII gene which is secreted by a cell, or the number of cells
   displaying a certain phenotype, e.g apoptosis. In principle, Factor VII gene silencing may be
   determined in any cell expressing the target, either constitutively or by genomic engineering,
15 and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine
   whether a given siRNA inhibits the expression of the Factor VII gene by a certain degree and
   therefore is encompassed by the instant invention, the assays provided in the Examples below
   shall serve as such reference.
            For example, in certain instances, expression of the Factor VII gene is suppressed by
20 at least about 20%, 25%, 35%, 40% or 50% by administration of the double-stranded
   oligonucleotide of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the Factor VII gene is
   suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of the double-stranded
   oligonucleotide of the invention. In a more preferred embodiment, the Factor VII gene is
   suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% by administration of the double-stranded
25 oligonucleotide of the invention.
            The terms "treat," "treatment," and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of a
   disease or disorder. In the context of the present invention insofar as it relates to any of the
   other conditions recited herein below (e.g., a Factor VII -mediated condition other than a
   thrombotic disorder), the terms "treat," "treatment," and the like mean to relieve or alleviate
30 at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression of
   such condition.

            A "therapeutically relevant" composition can alleviate a disease or disorder, or a
   symptom of a disease or disorder when administered at an appropriate dose.
            As used herein, the term "Factor VII -mediated condition or disease" and related
   terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder characterized by inappropriate, e.g., greater
 5 than normal, Factor VII activity. Inappropriate Factor VII functional activity might arise as
   the result of Factor VII expression in cells which normally do not express Factor VII, or
   increased Factor VII expression (leading to, e.g., a symptom of a viral hemorrhagic fever, or
   a thrombus). A Factor VII-mediated condition or disease may be completely or partially
   mediated by inappropriate Factor VII functional activity. However, a Factor VII-mediated
10 condition or disease is one in which modulation of Factor VII results in some effect on the
   underlying condition or disorder (e.g., a Factor VII inhibitor results in some improvement in
   patient well-being in at least some patients).
            A "hemorrhagic fever" includes a combination of illnesses caused by a viral infection.
   Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are typically followed by capillary hemorrhaging.
15          A "coagulopathy" is any defect in the blood clotting mechanism of a subject.
            As used herein, a "thrombotic disorder" is any disorder, preferably resulting from
   unwanted FVII expression, including any disorder characterized by unwanted blood
   coagulation.
            As used herein, the phrases "therapeutically effective amount" and "prophylactically
20 effective amount" refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment,
   prevention, or management of a viral hemorrhagic fever, or an overt symptom of such
   disorder, e.g., hemorraging, fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, inflammation, or
   circulatory shock. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily
   determined by ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in
25 the art, such as, e.g. the type of thrombotic disorder, the patient's history and age, the stage of
   the disease, and the administration of other agents.
            As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" includes a pharmacologically
   effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein,
   "pharmacologically effective amount," "therapeutically effective amount" or simply
30 "effective amount" refers to that amount of an RNA effective to produce the intended
   pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment
   is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter
                                                    93

   associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the
   treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction
   in that parameter.
            The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for administration of
 5 a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline,
   dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes
   cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
   include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents,
   disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents,
10 coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium
   carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are
   suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the
   lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If
   desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl
15 distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
            As used herein, a "transformed cell" is a cell into which a vector has been introduced
   from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.
            "Alkyl" means a straight chain or branched, noncyclic or cyclic, saturated aliphatic
   hydrocarbon containing from 1 to 24 carbon atoms. Representative saturated straight chain
20 alkyls include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, and the like; while saturated
   branched alkyls include isopropyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl, and the like.
   Representative saturated cyclic alkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,
   cyclohexyl, and the like; while unsaturated cyclic alkyls include cyclopentenyl and
   cyclohexenyl, and the like.
25          "Alkenyl" means an alkyl, as defined above, containing at least one double bond
   between adjacent carbon atoms. Alkenyls include both cis and trans isomers. Representative
   straight chain and branched alkenyls include ethylenyl, propylenyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl,
   isobutylenyl, 1-pentenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3-methyl-1-butenyl, 2-methyl-2-butenyl, 2,3-dimethyl
   2-butenyl, and the like.
30          "Alkynyl" means any alkyl or alkenyl, as defined above, which additionally contains
   at least one triple bond between adjacent carbons. Representative straight chain and branched
                                                    94

   alkynyls include acetylenyl, propynyl, 1-butynyl, 2-butynyl, 1-pentynyl, 2-pentynyl, 3
   methyl-i butynyl, and the like.
           "Acyl" means any alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl wherein the carbon at the point of
   attachment is substituted with an oxo group, as defined below. For example, -C(=O)alkyl,
 5 C(=O)alkenyl, and -C(=O)alkynyl are acyl groups.
           "Heterocycle" means a 5- to 7-membered monocyclic, or 7- to 10-membered bicyclic,
   heterocyclic ring which is either saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic, and which contains from
   1 or 2 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, and wherein the
   nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may be optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom
10 may be optionally quaternized, including bicyclic rings in which any of the above
   heterocycles are fused to a benzene ring. The heterocycle may be attached via any
   heteroatom or carbon atom. Heterocycles include heteroaryls as defined below.
   Heterocycles include morpholinyl, pyrrolidinonyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperizynyl,
   hydantoinyl, valerolactamyl, oxiranyl, oxetanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl,
15 tetrahydropyridinyl, tetrahydroprimidinyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl,
   tetrahydropyrimidinyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, and the like.
           "Heteroaryl" means a monocyclic- or polycyclic aromatic ring comprising carbon
   atoms, hydrogen atoms, and one or more heteroatoms, preferably, 1 to 3 heteroatoms,
   independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. As is well known to those skilled
20 in the art, heteroaryl rings have less aromatic character than their all-carbon counter parts.
   Thus, for the purposes of the invention, a heteroaryl group need only have some degree of
   aromatic character. Illustrative examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to,
   pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazyl, triazinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, (1,2,3,)
   and (1,2,4)-triazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, tetrazolyl.
25         The terms "optionally substituted alkyl", "optionally substituted alkenyl", "optionally
   substituted alkynyl", "optionally substituted acyl", and "optionally substituted heterocycle"
   means that, when substituted, at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a substituent. In
   the case of an oxo substituent (=O) two hydrogen atoms are replaced. In this regard,
   substituents include oxo, halogen, heterocycle, -CN, -ORx, -NRxRy, -NRxC(=O)Ry
30 -NRxSO 2RY, -C(=O)Rx, -C(=o)ORx, -C(=O)NRRY, -SORx and -SONRxRY, wherein n is 0,
   1 or 2, Rx and RY are the same or different and independently hydrogen, alkyl or heterocycle,
   and each of said alkyl and heterocycle substituents may be further substituted with one or
                                                   95

   more of oxo, halogen, -OH, -CN, alkyl, -ORx, heterocycle, -NRxRY, -NRxC(=O)RY,
   -NRxSO 2RY, -C(=O)Rx, -C(=O)ORx, -C(=O)NRRY, -SORx and -SONRRy.
              "Halogen" means fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.
              In one embodiment, the methods of the invention may require the use of protecting
 5 groups. Protecting group methodology is well known to those skilled in the art (see, for
   example, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Green, T.W. et. al., Wiley
   Interscience, New York City, 1999). Briefly, protecting groups within the context of this
   invention are any group that reduces or eliminates unwanted reactivity of a functional group.
   A protecting group can be added to a functional group to mask its reactivity during certain
10 reactions and then removed to reveal the original functional group. In one embodiment an
   "alcohol protecting group" is used. An "alcohol protecting group" is any group which
   decreases or eliminates unwanted reactivity of an alcohol functional group. Protecting
   groups can be added and removed using techniques well known in the art.
              The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by known organic synthesis
15 techniques, including the methods described in more detail in the Examples.

   In order to synthesize an appropriately substituted more versatile precursor of Folic acid
   amenable for RNA synthesis, the following strategy was used. In this method the protected
 5 Folic acid 152 was treated with the y-tert-butyl, ax-Me ester of glutamic acid, 156 to obtain
   the ester 157 which on treatment with TFA/CH 2Cl 2 provided the precursor 158.

   Preparation of 175. Treatment of folic acid 174 with DCC followed by N
   hydroxysuccinimide provided the activated ester 175 in 80% yield. In a typical procedure,
   folic acid (5 g, 11.33 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO (100 mL) and to this solution
 5 was added, triethyamine (2.5 mL), DCC (4.7 g, 22.6 mmol) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (2.6
   g, 22.6 mmol) and the solution was stirred at room temperature in dark for 18 h. The reaction
   mixture was filtered and to the filtrate EtOAc (1 L) was added and the precipitated product
   was filtered, washed with ethyl acetate (500 mL), ether (200 mL) and dried under vacuum to
   isolate the product as a yellow powder. The purity of the product was found to be 83% by
10 HPLC. This product was used as such for the coupling steps without further purification.

   and NN'-succinimidylcarboante (DSC, 23.76 g, 1.5eq) were taken               in dichloromethane
   (DCM, 500 mL) and stirred over an ice water mixture. Triethylamine (25.30 mL, 3eq) was
   added to stirring solution and subsequently the reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight
   at ambient temperature. Progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction
10 mixture was diluted with DCM (400 mL) and the organic layer was washed with water
   (2X500 mL), aqueous NaHCO 3 solution (500 mL) followed by standard work-up. Residue
   obtained was dried at ambient temperature under high vacuum overnight. After drying the
   crude carbonate 226a thus obtained was dissolved in dichloromethane (500 mL) and stirred
   over an ice bath. To the stirring solution mPEG 200 0 -NH 2 (227, 103.00 g, 47.20 mmol,
15 purchased from NOF Corporation, Japan) and anhydrous pyridine (80 mL, excess) were
   added under argon. In one embodiment, the methoxy-(PEG)x-amine has an x= from 45-49,
   preferably 47-49, and more preferably 49. The reaction mixture was then allowed stir at
   ambient temperature overnight. Solvents and volatiles were removed under vacuum and the
   residue was dissolved in DCM (200 mL) and charged on a column of silica gel packed in
20 ethyl acetate. The column was initially eluted with ethyl acetate and subsequently with
   gradient of 5-10 % methanol in dichloromethane to afford the desired PEG-Lipid 228a as a

 5 (0.710 g, 1.5eq) were taken together in dichloromethane (20 mL) and cooled down to 00 C in
   an ice water mixture. Triethylamine (1.00 mL, 3eq) was added to that and stirred overnight.
   The reaction was followed by TLC, diluted with DCM, washed with water (2 times),
   NaHCO 3 solution and dried over sodium sulfate. Solvents were removed under reduced
   pressure and the residue 226b under high vacuum overnight. This compound was directly

   Example 7: Targeting Lipid-mediated Delivery in Rodent Hepatic Gene Silencing
15 Models
            The liver represents an attractive organ for therapeutic intervention, both because of
   the number of potential hepatic targets as well as the highly-perfused nature of the organ,
   which may render it more amenable to delivery of exogenous siRNAs. A liver-directed in
   vivo screen is used to identify targeting lipid/siRNA complexes that facilitate high levels of
20 siRNA-mediated gene silencing in hepatocytes, the cells comprising the liver parenchyma.
   Factor VII, a blood clotting factor, is an ideal target gene for assaying functional siRNA
   delivery to liver. It is produced specifically in hepatocytes; therefore, gene silencing
   indicates successful delivery to parenchyma, as opposed to delivery solely to the cells of the
   reticulo-endothelial system (e.g., Kupffer cells). Furthermore, Factor VII is a secreted
25 protein that can be readily measured in serum, obviating the need to sacrifice animals.
   Finally, owing to its short half-life (2-5 hours), silencing at the mRNA level is manifest as
   silencing at the protein level with minimal lag.
            All procedures used in animal studies conducted at Alnylam are approved by the
   Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and are consistent with local, state,
30 and federal regulations as applicable. Mice will receive two daily i.v. injections of different
   lipid formulations of siRNA at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. Factor VII protein levels are quantified
   24 h after the second administration. Alternatively, rats are injected with cationic
                                                    136

   lipid/siRNA at 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg. Animals are bled at various time points and
   sacrificed 48 h after administration. Evaluated are liver factor VII mRNA levels, serum
   Factor VII protein levels, and prothrombin time.

   Silencing Models
            All procedures used in animal studies conducted at Alnylam are approved by the
   Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and are consistent with local, state,
   and federal regulations as applicable. To verify the specificity of gene silencing, liver mRNA
10 levels are measured for both Factor VII and another hepatocyte-expressed gene,
   apolipoprotein B (apoB). Animals will be treated with formulations containing only siFVII
   or only siapoB and levels of mRNAs transcribed from both genes will be measured. Further,
   administration of a cationic lipid formulation of a mixture of the two siRNAs will be
   evaluated as will the effect of a mismatched Factor VII siRNA. These data will show that the
15 observed gene silencing is a direct result of the specific effects of lipid/siRNA on mRNA
   levels in the liver and that these effects are applicable to multiple hepatocyte-expressed
   genes.

            All procedures used in animal studies conducted at Alnylam are approved by the
 5 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and are consistent with local, state,
   and federal regulations as applicable. BALB/c mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Laboratories,
   Indianapolis, IN) are anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 2,2,2
   tribromoethanol (Avertin) and instilled intranasally (i.n.) with lipid/siRNA formulations in a
   total volume of 50 p L. At 4 h post siRNA instillation, the mice are anesthetized and infected
10 intranasally with 106 PFU of RSV/A2 or RSV/B1. Prior to removal of lungs at day 4 post
   infection, anesthetized mice are exsanguinated by severing the right caudal artery. Lung
   tissue will be collected on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) to determine
   virus titers. RSV titers from lungs are measured by immunostaining plaque assay. Lungs are
   homogenized with a hand-held Tissumiser homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).
15 The lung homogenates are placed on ice for 5-10 minutes to allow debris to settle. Clarified
   lung lysates are diluted 10-fold in serum-free D-MEM, added to 95% confluent Vero E6 cells
   cultured in D-MEM in 24-well plates, and incubated for 1 h at 37 'C, followed by 2%
   methylcellulose overlay. At 5 days post-infection, the media is removed and the cells weare
   fixed with acetone:methanol (60:40) and immunostained. Plaques are counted and log (10)
20 pfu/g lung versus PBS or siRNA mismatch control is determined.

   injecting 10 mg/kg of lipid/siRNA i.p (4 mice per group). Peritoneal lavage is collected 4
   days later and stained with appropriate fluorophore conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences).
   Flow cytometry samples are analyzed on the LSRII flowcytometer (BD Bioscience) and
30 FlowJo software (Treestar) is used to identify the CD11b hhGr l"w macrophage population
   and quantify expression of surface proteins of interest.

   Example 12: In vivo miRNA Silencing Experiments
            All procedures used in animal studies conducted at Alnylam are approved by the
   Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and are consistent with local, state,
 5 and federal regulations as applicable. C57BL/6NCRL mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld,
   Germany) will receive lipid formulations of antagomir or anti-miR via tail vein injection at 5
   mg/kg (0.5 mg/mL) on three consecutive days. Livers are taken at day 4 and expression
   levels of miRNA of interest are determined. Liver tissue is dissolved in proteinase K
   containing cell and tissue lysis buffer (EPICENTRE, Madision, WI) and subjected to
10 sonication. Total RNA is extracted with TE-saturated phenol (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and
   subsequently precipitated using ethanol. Synthetic DNA probes complementary to the mouse
   miRNA of interest, as well as mouse U6 RNA as a control, are 5'-end labeled using
   polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and y-32P ATP (GE Healthcare).
            Total liver RNA is simultaneously hybridized in solution to a miRNA-specific probe
15 and the U6 probe. The hybridization conditions allow detection of U6 RNA and mature
   miRNA, but not pre-miRNA. Following treatment with SI nuclease, samples are loaded on
   denaturing 10% acrylamide gels. Gels are exposed to a phosphoimager screen and analyzed
   on a Typhoon 9200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Relative signal intensities of miRNA versus
   U6 are calculated for each sample.

   Example 13: Cationic Lipid-mediated Delivery of Single-stranded Oligoribonucleotides
   (Antagomirs) in vivo
            To examine the utility of cationic lipid materials in the delivery of nucleic acid drugs
   other than siRNAs, we will tested the potential of cationic lipids to facilitate the delivery of
25 single-stranded 2'-O-Me oligoribonucleotides targeting miRNAs (antagomirs or anti-miRs).
   In vivo delivery of anti-miR results in specific target miRNA silencing and, consequently, the
   specific upregulation of genes regulated by the target miRNA. Cationic lipid-formulated
   anti-miR122 will be given at doses of 5 mg/kg on three consecutive days to mice as described
   above.
30          Expression of genes regulated by miR-122 will be analyzed using a branched DNA
   assay. Briefly, 30-50 mg of frozen liver tissue is lysed in 1 mL Tissue and Cell Lysis Buffer
   (EPICENTRE, WI) by sonication. Between 10 and 40 p L of lysate is used for the branched
                                                   139

   DNA assay, depending on signal strength of target gene. Probe sets are designed using
   QuantiGene ProbeDesigner software. Target gene expression is assayed according to
   QuantiGene Detection Assay recommendations and normalized to corresponding GAPDH
   housekeeper expression from same liver tissue lysate.

            All procedures used in animal studies conducted at Alnylam are approved by the
   Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and are consistent with local, state,
   and federal regulations as applicable. Rats are given four once-per-week i.v. bolus injections
10 of a formulated siRNA at doses as high as 10 mg/kg/week. A control siRNA that should not
   hybridize with any known mRNA will be used in order to eliminate any potential target
   silencing-related toxicities. The appearance and weights of all organs will be determined.
   Example 15: Targeting lipid-mediated Gene Silencing in Non-human Primates
15 To determine the effects of cationic lipid-formulated siRNA in a third animal species, studies
   in non-human primates will be performed. All procedures using cynomolgus monkeys are
   conducted by a certified contract research organization using protocols consistent with local,
   state, and federal regulations as applicable and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
   Use Committee (IACUC). Cynomolgus monkeys (n = 6 per group) will receive either 5
20 mL/kg phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5 mg/kg formulated control siRNA (1.25 mL/kg), 2.5
   mg/kg (1.25 mL/kg) formulated siApoB, or 6.25 mg/kg (3.125 mL/kg) formulated siApoB as
   bolus i.v. injections via the brachial vein. For apoB-100 protein measurements, serum will be
   collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, and 30 days post
   administration. In a subsequent experiment, cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3 per group) will
25 recieve either 2.5 mg/kg formulated control siRNA or 2.5 or 6.25 mg/kg of formulated
   siApoB as bolus i.v. injections via the saphenous vein. For apoB-100 protein measurements,
   serum will be collected pre-dose and at 12, 24, and 48 h post administration. ApoB-100
   protein levels will be determined using an ELISA assay. Clinical chemistries are analyzed at
   pre-dose and 24 and 48 h post administration. Hematology and coagulation parameters are
30 analyzed at pre-dose and 48 h post administration. Animals are sacrificed at 48 h. Liver
