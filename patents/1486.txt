    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates generally to the field of antimicrobial compounds and to
 [0 methods of making and using them. These compounds are useful for treating, preventing, and
    reducing the risk of microbial infections in humans and animals.
    BACKGROUND
            Since the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s and streptomycin in the 1940s, many new
    compounds have been discovered or specifically designed for use as antibiotic agents. It was
 L5 once thought that infectious diseases could be completely controlled or eradicated with the use
    of such therapeutic agents. However, such views have been challenged because strains of cells
    or microorganisms resistant to currently effective therapeutic agents continue to evolve.
    Almost every antibiotic agent developed for clinical use has ultimately encountered problems
    with the emergence of resistant bacteria. For example, resistant strains of Gram-positive
20  bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and
    vancomycin-resistant enterococci have developed. Resistant bacteria can cause serious and
    even fatal results for infected patients. See, e.g., Lowry, F.D. "Antimicrobial Resistance: The
    Example of Staphylococcus aureus," J. Clin. Invest., vol. 111, no. 9, pp. 1265-1273 (2003); and
    Gold, H.S. and Moellering, R.C., Jr., "Antimicrobial-Drug Resistance," N. Engl. J. Med., vol.
25  335,pp.1445-53 (1996).
            The discovery and development of new antibacterial agents have been for decades a
    major focus in many pharmaceutical companies. Nonetheless, in more recent years there has
    been an exodus of pharmaceutical companies from this area of research and drug development
                                                        1

as a consequence of this exodus, there have been very few new antibiotics entering the market.
This lack of new antibiotics is particularly disturbing, especially at a
                                                  la

   time when bacterial resistance to current therapies is increasing both in the hospital and
   community settings.
           In the search for new antibiotic agents, researchers have tried combining or linking
   various portions of antibiotic molecules to create multifunctional or hybrid compounds Other
 5 researchers have tried making derivatives of known classes of antibiotics, e.g., telithromycin,
   which is sold under the trade name Ketek@, is a derivative of erythromycin. However, these
   approaches have met with limited success.
           An approach to developing new antimicrobial compounds is to design modulators, for
   example, inhibitors, of bacterial ribosome function. By modulating or inhibiting bacterial
10 ribosome function such antimicrobial compounds could interfere with essential processes
   such as RNA translation and protein synthesis, thereby providing an antimicrobial effect. In
   fact, some antibiotic compounds such as erythromycin, clindamycin, and linezolid are known
   to bind to the ribosome.
           The present invention utilizes a structure based drug design approach for discovering
15 and developing new antimicrobial agents. This approach starts with the high resolution X
   ray crystal of the ribosome to design new classes of antimicrobial compounds having specific
   chemical structures, ribosome binding characteristics, and antimicrobial activity. This
   structure based drug discovery approach is described in the following publication:
   Franceschi, F. and Duffy, E.M., "Structure-based drug design meets the ribosome",
20 Biochemical Pharmacology,vol. 71, pp. 1016-1025 (2006).
           Based on this structure based drug design approach, the present invention describes
   new chemical classes of antimicrobial compounds useful for treating bacterial infections in
   humans and animals. Without being limited by theories, these compounds are believed to
   inhibit bacterial ribosome function by binding to the ribosome. By taking advantage of these
25 ribosome binding sites, the antimicrobial compounds of the present invention can provide
   better activity, especially against resistant strains of bacteria, than current antibiotic
   compounds.
           The present invention utilizes a structure based drug design approach for discovering
   and developing new antimicrobial agents. This approach starts with the high resolution X
30 ray crystal of the ribosome to design new classes of antimicrobial compounds having specific
   chemical structures, ribosome binding characteristics, and desired antimicrobial activity.
                                                      2

   This structure based drug discovery approach is described in the following publication:
   Franceschi, F. and Duffy, E.M., "Structure-based drug design meets the ribosome",
   Biochemical Pharmacology,vol. 71, pp. 1016-1025 (2006).
           The present invention therefore fills an important ongoing need for providing new
 5 antimicrobial agents, particularly for antimicrobial agents, having activity against resistant
   pathogenic bacterial organisms.

           The foregoing and other aspects and embodiments of the invention can be more fully

 5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention provides a family of compounds that can be used as antimicrobial
   agents, more particularly as antibacterial agents.
           The present invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, tautomers, N
   oxides, and prodrugs thereof.
[0         The compounds described herein can have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the
   present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom can be isolated in optically
   active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such
   as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. Many
   geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the
[5 compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present
   invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are
   described and can be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separate isomeric forms. All chiral,
   diastereomeric, racemic, and geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless
   specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. All processes used to
!0 prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to
   be part of the present invention. All tautomers of shown or described
                                                    9w

   compounds are also considered to be part of the present invention. Furthermore, the
   invention also includes metabolites of the compounds described herein.
           The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the
   present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but
 5 different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of
   hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.
           When any variable (e.g., R 6 ) occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula
   for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every
   other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with one or more
10 R 6 moieties, then R 6 at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R 6 .
   Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible, but only if such
   combinations result in stable compounds within a designated atom's normal valency.
           A chemical structure showing a dotted line representation for a chemical bond
   indicates that the bond is optionally present. For example, a dotted line drawn next to a solid
15 single bond indicates that the bond can be either a single bond or a double bond.
           When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring,
   then such substituent can be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed
   without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound
   of a given formula, then such substituent can be bonded via any atom in such substituent.
20 Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible, but only if such combinations
   result in stable compounds.
           In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms in the compounds of the present invention,
   these, where appropriate, can be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent
   (e.g., MCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides). Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are
25 considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N->O) derivative, as
   appropriate.
            One approach to developing improved anti-proliferative and anti-infective agents is
   to provide modulators (for example, inhibitors) of ribosome function.
           Ribosomes are ribonucleoproteins, which are present in both prokaryotes and
30 eukaryotes. Ribosomes are the cellular organelles responsible for protein synthesis. During
   gene expression, ribosomes translate the genetic information encoded in a messenger RNA
                                                   10

   into protein (Garrett et al. (2000) "The Ribosome: Structure, Function,Antibiotics and
   CellularInteractions," American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.).
            Ribosomes comprise two nonequivalent ribonucleoprotein subunits. The larger
   subunit (also known as the "large ribosomal subunit") is about twice the size of the smaller
 5 subunit (also known as the "small ribosomal subunit"). The small ribosomal subunit binds
   messenger RNA (mRNA) and mediates the interactions between mRNA and transfer RNA
   (tRNA) anticodons on which the fidelity of translation depends. The large ribosomal subunit
   catalyzes peptide bond formation, i.e. the peptidyl-transferase reaction of protein synthesis,
   and includes, at least, three different tRNA binding sites known as the aminoacyl, peptidyl,
10 and exit sites. The aminoacyl site or A-site accommodates the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA
   that is to contribute its amino acid to the growing peptide chain. Also, the A space of the A
   site is important. The peptidyl site or P-site accommodates the peptidyl-tRNA complex, i.e.,
   the tRNA with its amino acid that is part of the growing peptide chain. The exit or E-site
   accommodates the deacylated tRNA after it has donated its amino acid to the growing
15 polypeptide chain.
   1.       Definitions
             "Isomerism" means compounds that have identical molecular formulae but that differ
   in the nature or the sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in
   space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed
20 "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed
   "diastereoisomers", and stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images are termed
   "enantiomers", or sometimes optical isomers. A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical
   substituents is termed a "chiral center".
            "Chiral isomer" means a compound with at least one chiral center. It has two
25 enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality and may exist either as an individual enantiomer or
   as a mixture of enantiomers. A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric
   forms of opposite chirality is termed a "racemic mixture". A compound that has more than
   one chiral center has 2"-lenantiomeric pairs, where n is the number of chiral centers.
   Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist as either an individual diastereomer
30 or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed a "diastereomeric mixture". When one chiral center
   is present, a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration (R or S) of that
                                                   11

   chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents
   attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration
   are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al,
   Angew. Chem. Inter. Edit. 1966, 5, 385; errata 511; Cahn et al., Angew. Chem. 1966, 78, 413;
 5 Cahn and Ingold, J. Chem. Soc. 1951 (London), 612; Cahn et al., Experientia 1956, 12, 81;
   Cahn, J., Chem. Educ. 1964, 41, 116).
            "Geometric Isomers" means the diastereomers that owe their existence to hindered
   rotation about double bonds. These configurations are differentiated in their names by the
   prefixes cis and trans, or Z and E, which indicate that the groups are on the same or opposite
10 side of the double bond in the molecule according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.
            Further, the structures and other compounds discussed in this application include all
   atropic isomers thereof. "Atropic isomers" are a type of stereoisomer in which the atoms of
   two isomers are arranged differently in space. Atropic isomers owe their existence to a
   restricted rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such
15 atropic isomers typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in
   chromatography techniques, it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers
   in select cases.
            "Tautomers" refers to compounds whose structures differ markedly in arrangement of
   atoms, but which exist in easy and rapid equilibrium. It is to be understood that compounds of
20 present invention may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that
   when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be within the
   scope of the invention, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomer
   form.
            Some compounds of the present invention can exist in a tautomeric form which are
25 also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
            The compounds, salts and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several
   tautomeric forms, including the enol and imine form, and the keto and enamine form and
   geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the
   scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In
30 solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described,
   the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds
                                                   12

            A tautomer is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and are
   readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This reaction results in the formal
   migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds.
   In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers can
 5 be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including
   temperature, solvent, and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertable by
   tautomerizations is called tautomerism.
            Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed. In
   keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring
10 chain tautomerism, is exhibited by glucose. It arises as a result of the aldehyde group (-CHO)
   in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups (-OH) in the same
   molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form.
            Tautomerizations are catalyzed by: Base: 1. deprotonation; 2. formation of a
   delocalized anion (e.g. an enolate); 3. protonation at a different position of the anion; Acid:
15  1. protonation; 2. formation of a delocalized cation; 3. deprotonation at a different position
   adjacent to the cation.
            Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone - enol, amide - nitrile, lactam - lactim, amide
   imidic acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g. in the nucleobases guanine, thymine, and
   cytosine), amine - enamine and enamine - enamine. An example below is included for
20 illustrative purposes, and the present invention is not limited to this example:
             O       N;       N'                     HO         N        N
                              H
            The terms "crystal polymorphs" or "polymorphs" or "crystal forms" means crystal
   structures in which a compound (or salt or solvate thereof) can crystallize in different crystal
   packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different crystal
25 forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectral, melting points,
   density hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility.
   Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may
   cause one crystal form to dominate. Crystal polymorphs of the compounds can be prepared
   by crystallization under different conditions.
                                                    13

            The term "substituted," as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the
   designated atom, usually a carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen atom, is replaced with a selection
   from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency is not
   exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto
 5 (i.e., =0), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are
   double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C=C, C=N, N=N, etc.).
            As used herein, the term "anomeric carbon" means the acetal carbon of a glycoside.
            As used herein, the term "glycoside" is a cyclic acetal.
            As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain
10 saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For
   example C 1- 6 alkyl is intended to include C 1 , C2 , C 3 , C4 , C5 , and C6 alkyl groups. Some
   examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl,
   s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, s-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, and n-octyl.
            As used herein, "alkenyl" is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either straight
15 or branched configuration and one or more unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds that can occur in

   intended to include C2 , C3 , C 4 , C5 , and C6 alkenyl groups.
            As used herein, "alkynyl" is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either straight
   or branched configuration and one or more triple carbon-carbon bonds that can occur in any
20 stable point along the chain, such as ethynyl and propynyl. For example, C2 - 6 alkynyl is
   intended to include C2 , C3 , C 4 , C5 , and C6 alkynyl groups.
            Furthermore, "alkyl", "alkenyl", and "alkynyl" are intended to include moieties which
   are diradicals, i.e., having two points of attachment, an example of which in the present
   invention is when D is selected from these chemical groups. A nonlimiting example of such
25 an alkyl moiety that is a diradical is -CH 2 CH 2 -, i.e., a C2 alkyl group that is covalently
   bonded via each terminal carbon atom to the remainder of the molecule. The alkyl diradicals
   are also known as "alkylenyl" radicals. The alkenyl diradicals are also known as
   "alkenylenyl" radicals. The alkynyl diradicals are also known as "alkynylenyl" radicals..

             As used herein "counterion" is used to mean a positively or negatively charged species
 5 present in conjunction with an ion of opposite charge. A nonlimiting example of a
   counterion is an ion or ions present to counterbalance the charge or charges on an organic
   compound. Nonlimiting examples of counterions include chloride, bromide, hydroxide,
   acetate, sulfate, and ammonium.
             As used herein, "halo" or "halogen" refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo
10 substituents.
             As used herein, "haloalkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain
   saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms,
   substituted with 1 or more halogen (for example -CvFw wherein v           = 1 to 3 and w  =  1 to
   (2v+1)). Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethyl,
15 trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, and pentachloroethyl.

25 include C 1, C2 , C3 , C 4 , C5, C6 , C7 , and C 8 alkylthio groups.
             As used herein, "carbocycle" or "carbocyclic ring" is intended to mean, unless
   otherwise specified, any stable 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12-membered monocyclic,
   bicyclic or tricyclic ring, any of which can be saturated, unsaturated (including partially and
   fully unsaturated), or aromatic. Examples of such carbocycles include, but are not limited to,
30 cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl,
                                                         15

   fluorenyl, phenyl, naphthyl, indanyl, adamantyl, and tetrahydronaphthyl. As shown above,
   bridged rings are also included in the definition of carbocycle (e.g., [2.2.2]bicyclooctane). A
 5 bridged ring occurs when one or more carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms.
   Preferred bridges are one or two carbon atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a
   monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the
   ring can also be present on the bridge. Fused (e.g., naphthyl and tetrahydronaphthyl) and
   spiro rings are also included.
10          As used herein, the term "heterocycle" means, unless otherwise stated, a stable 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12-membered monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring which is saturated,
   unsaturated (including partially and fully unsaturated), or aromatic, and consists of carbon
   atoms and one or more ring heteroatoms, e.g., 1 or 1-2 or 1-3 or 1-4 or 1-5 or 1-6
   heteroatoms, independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, and including any
15 bicyclic or tricyclic group in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings is fused or
   attached to a second ring (e.g., a benzene ring). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms can
   optionally be oxidized (i.e., N->O and S(O)p, wherein p    =  1 or 2). When a nitrogen atom is
   included in the ring it is either N or NH, depending on whether or not it is attached to a
   double bond in the ring (i.e., a hydrogen is present if needed to maintain the tri-valency of the
20 nitrogen atom). The nitrogen atom can be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein
   R is H or another substituent, as defined). The heterocyclic ring can be attached to its pendant
   group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic
   rings described herein can be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting
   compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle can optionally be quaternized. Bridged
25 rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or
   more atoms (i.e., C, 0, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Preferred
   bridges include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen
   atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. When a ring is bridged, the
   substituents recited for the ring can also be present on the bridge. Spiro and fused rings are
30 also included.

           As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocycle" or "heteroaryl" is intended to mean a
   stable 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12-membered monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic ring which
   consists of carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms, e.g., 1 or 1-2 or 1-3 or 1-4 or 1-5 or
    1-6 heteroatoms, independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. In the case of
 5 bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic rings, only one of the two rings needs to be aromatic (e.g., 2,3
   dihydroindole), though both can be (e.g., quinoline). The second ring can also be fused or
   bridged as defined above for heterocycles. The nitrogen atom can be substituted or
   unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, as defined). The nitrogen
   and sulfur heteroatoms can optionally be oxidized (i.e., N->O and S(O)p, wherein p     = 1 or 2).
10 In certain compounds, the total number of S and 0 atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not
   more than 1.

15 residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include
   the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound
    formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such
    conventional non-toxic salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from inorganic and
   organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic,
20 benzene sulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, ethane

            Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals
 5 (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention
   can be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs
   of the presently claimed compounds, methods of delivering the same and compositions
   containing the same. "Prodrugs" are intended to include any covalently bonded carriers that
   release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is
10 administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs the present invention are prepared by
   modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are
   cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include
   compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, or sulfhydryl group is bonded
   to any group that, when the prodrug of the present invention is administered to a mammalian
15 subject, it cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or free sulfhydryl group, respectively.
   Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, and benzoate
   derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the present invention.
            As used herein, "stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a
   compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a

   case of an animal, more typically a mammal) subject that would be subjected to a surgical or
   invasive medical procedure. Such patient or subject could be considered to be in need of the
   methods of reducing the risk of or preventing the infection due to a surgical procedure or an
25 invasive medical procedure. Such patient or subject can also be considered to be in need of
   peri-operative prophylaxis.
            As used herein, the term "treating" means to provide a therapeutic intervention to cure
   or ameliorate an infection.
            As used herein, the term "preventing", as used herein means, to completely or almost
30 completely stop an infection from occurring, for example when the patient or subject is
                                                    19

   predisposed to an infection or at risk of contracting an infection. Preventing can also include
   inhibiting, i.e. arresting the development, of an infection.
           As used herein, the term "reducing the risk of', as used herein, means to lower the
   likelihood or probability of an infection occurring, for example when the patient or subject is
 5 predisposed to an infection or at risk of contracting an infection.
           As used herein, "unsaturated" refers to compounds having at least one degree of
   unsaturation (e.g., at least one multiple bond) and includes partially and fully unsaturated
   compounds.
           As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound, or a
10 combination of compounds, of the present invention effective when administered alone or in
   combination as an antimicrobial agent. For example, an effective amount refers to an amount
   of the compound present in a composition, a formulation or on a medical device given to a
   recipient patient or subject sufficient to elicit biological activity, for example, anti-infective
   activity, such as e.g., anti-microbial activity, anti-bacterial activity, anti-fungal activity,
15 anti-viral activity, or anti-parasitic activity.
           The term "prophylactically effective amount" means an effective amount of a
   compound or compounds, of the present invention that is administered to prevent or reduce
   the risk of an infection due to a surgical procedure or an invasive medical procedure.
           It is to be further understood that the representations for "Hydrogen Bond Acceptor
20 Hydrogen Bond Acceptor - Hydrogen Bond Donor" and "Hydrogen Bond Acceptor
   Hydrogen Bond Acceptor - Hydrogen Bond Acceptor" are meant to indicate the relative
   orientation of the hydrogen bond acceptors and donor and not meant to limit that such groups
   are directly connected together as it is contemplated that additional atoms or groups of atoms
   can be included between such groups.
25          In the specification, the singular forms also include the plural, unless the context
   clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used
   herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to
   which this invention belongs. In the case of conflict, the present specification will control. As
   used herein, "mammal" refers to human and non-human patients.
30         As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to a compound, or a
   combination of compounds, of the present invention present in or on a recipient in an amount
                                                     20

   sufficient to elicit biological activity, for example, anti-microbial activity, anti-fungal
   activity, anti-viral activity, anti-parasitic activity, anti-diarrheal activity, and/or anti
   proliferative activity. The combination of compounds is preferably a synergistic combination.
   Synergy, as described, for example, by Chou and Talalay, Adv. Enzyme Regul. vol. 22, pp.
 5 27-55 (1984), occurs when the effect of the compounds when administered in combination is
   greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent.
   In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at sub-optimal concentrations of
   the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity, increased anti-proliferative
   and/or anti-infective effect, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with
10 the individual components.
           As used herein, the term "RNA microhelix binding site" refers to the ribofunctional
   locus of the large ribosomal subunit occupied by the RNA microhelix of Formula III. The
   RNA microhelix binding site defines at least a portion of or overlaps with the E-site.
           As used herein, the term "A-site" refers to the ribofunctional locus occupied by an
15 aminoacyl-tRNA molecule immediately prior to its participation in the peptide-bond forming
   reaction.
           As used herein, the term "E-site" refers to the ribofunctional locus occupied by a
   deacylated tRNA molecule following its participation in the peptide-bond forming reaction.
           As used herein, the term "P-site" refers to the ribofunctional locus occupied by a
20 peptidyl-tRNA at the time it participates in the peptide-bond forming reaction.
           As used herein, the term "A-space" refers to the portion of the A-site within the
   peptidyl transferase center in which the amino acid portion of the aminoacylated t-RNA
   binds, or alternatively the portion of the A-site in which the oxazolidinone ring of linezolid
   binds.
25         As used herein and in reference to a ribosome or ribosomal subunit, the terms "a
   portion of' or "a portion of the three-dimensional structure of' are understood to mean a
   portion of the three-dimensional structure of a ribosome or ribosomal subunit, including
   charge distribution and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity characteristics, formed by at least three,
   more preferably at least three to ten, and most preferably at least ten amino acid residues
30 and/or nucleotide residues of the ribosome or ribosomal subunit. The residues forming such
   a portion can be, for example, (i) contiguous residues based upon, for example, a primary
                                                     21

   a portion can be, for example, (i) solvent inaccessible atoms buried within the core of the
   RNA microhelix, (ii) solvent accessible atoms of the RNA microhelix, or (iii) a combination
10 thereof.
            All percentages and ratios used herein, unless otherwise indicated, are by weight.
            Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including,
   or comprising specific components, or where processes are described as having, including, or
   comprising specific process steps, it is contemplated that compositions of the present

   4.      Characterization of Compounds of the Invention
           Compounds designed, selected and/or optimized by methods described above, once
   produced, can be characterized using a variety of assays known to those skilled in the art to
10 determine whether the compounds have biological activity. For example, the molecules can
   be characterized by conventional assays, including but not limited to those assays described
   below, to determine whether they have a predicted activity, binding activity and/or binding
   specificity.
           Furthermore, high-throughput screening can be used to speed up analysis using such
15 assays. As a result, it can be possible to rapidly screen the molecules described herein for
   activity, for example, as anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic or anti-viral
   agents. Also, it can be possible to assay how the compounds interact with a ribosome or
   ribosomal subunit and/or are effective as modulators (for example, inhibitors) of protein
                                                    68

   synthesis using techniques known in the art. General methodologies for performing high
   throughput screening are described, for example, in Devlin (1998) High Throughput
   Screening, Marcel Dekker; and U.S. Patent No. 5,763,263. High-throughput assays can use
   one or more different assay techniques including, but not limited to, those described below.
 5          (1) Surface Binding Studies. A variety of binding assays can be useful in screening
   new molecules for their binding activity. One approach includes surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) that can be used to evaluate the binding properties of molecules of interest with respect
   to a ribosome, ribosomal subunit or a fragment thereof.
            SPR methodologies measure the interaction between two or more macromolecules in
10 real-time through the generation of a quantum-mechanical surface plasmon. One device,
   (BIAcore Biosensor RTM from Pharmacia Biosensor, Piscataway, N.J.) provides a focused
   beam of polychromatic light to the interface between a gold film (provided as a disposable
   biosensor "chip") and a buffer compartment that can be regulated by the user. A 100 nm
   thick "hydrogel" composed of carboxylated dextran that provides a matrix for the covalent
15 immobilization of analytes of interest is attached to the gold film. When the focused light
   interacts with the free electron cloud of the gold film, plasmon resonance is enhanced. The
   resulting reflected light is spectrally depleted in wavelengths that optimally evolved the
   resonance. By separating the reflected polychromatic light into its component wavelengths
   (by means of a prism), and determining the frequencies that are depleted, the BlAcore
20 establishes an optical interface which accurately reports the behavior of the generated surface
   plasmon resonance. When designed as above, the plasmon resonance (and thus the depletion
   spectrum) is sensitive to mass in the evanescent field (which corresponds roughly to the
   thickness of the hydrogel). If one component of an interacting pair is immobilized to the
   hydrogel, and the interacting partner is provided through the buffer compartment, the
25 interaction between the two components can be measured in real time based on the
   accumulation of mass in the evanescent field and its corresponding effects of the plasmon
   resonance as measured by the depletion spectrum. This system permits rapid and sensitive
   real-time measurement of the molecular interactions without the need to label either
   component.
30          (2) FluorescencePolarization. Fluorescence polarization (FP) is a measurement
   technique that can readily be applied to protein-protein, protein-ligand, or RNA-ligand
                                                    69

   interactions in order to derive IC 50 s and Kds of the association reaction between two
   molecules. In this technique one of the molecules of interest is conjugated with a
   fluorophore. This is generally the smaller molecule in the system (in this case, the compound
   of interest). The sample mixture, containing both the ligand-probe conjugate and the
 5 ribosome, ribosomal subunit or fragment thereof, is excited with vertically polarized light.
   Light is absorbed by the probe fluorophores, and re-emitted a short time later. The degree of
   polarization of the emitted light is measured. Polarization of the emitted light is dependent
   on several factors, but most importantly on viscosity of the solution and on the apparent
   molecular weight of the fluorophore. With proper controls, changes in the degree of
10 polarization of the emitted light depends only on changes in the apparent molecular weight of
   the fluorophore, which in-turn depends on whether the probe-ligand conjugate is free in
   solution, or is bound to a receptor. Binding assays based on FP have a number of important
   advantages, including the measurement of IC 5os and Kds under true homogenous equilibrium
   conditions, speed of analysis and amenity to automation, and ability to screen in cloudy
15 suspensions and colored solutions.
            (3) ProteinSynthesis. It is contemplated that, in addition to characterization by the
   foregoing biochemical assays, the compound of interest can also be characterized as a
   modulator (for example, an inhibitor of protein synthesis) of the functional activity of the
   ribosome or ribosomal subunit.
20          Furthermore, more specific protein synthesis inhibition assays can be performed by
   administering the compound to a whole organism, tissue, organ, organelle, cell, a cellular or
   subcellular extract, or a purified ribosome preparation and observing its pharmacological and
   inhibitory properties by determining, for example, its inhibition constant (IC50 ) for inhibiting
   protein synthesis. Incorporation of 3H leucine or 35 S methionine, or similar experiments can
25 be performed to investigate protein synthesis activity. A change in the amount or the rate of
   protein synthesis in the cell in the presence of a molecule of interest indicates that the
   molecule is a modulator of protein synthesis. A decrease in the rate or the amount of protein
   synthesis indicates that the molecule is a inhibitor of protein synthesis.
            (4) Antimicrobial assays and other evaluation. Furthermore, the compounds can be
30 assayed for anti-proliferative or anti-infective properties on a cellular level. For example,
   where the target organism is a microorganism, the activity of compounds of interest can be
                                                    70

   assayed by growing the microorganisms of interest in media either containing or lacking the
   compound. Growth inhibition can be indicative that the molecule can be acting as a protein
   synthesis inhibitor. More specifically, the activity of the compounds of interest against
   bacterial pathogens can be demonstrated by the ability of the compound to inhibit growth of
 5 defined strains of human pathogens. For this purpose, a panel of bacterial strains can be
   assembled to include a variety of target pathogenic species, some containing resistance
   mechanisms that have been characterized. Use of such a panel of organisms permits the
   determination of structure-activity relationships not only in regards to potency and spectrum,
   but also with a view to obviating resistance mechanisms.
10         Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are determined by the microdilution
   method, typically in a final volume of 100 microliters, according to protocols outlined by The
   Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI; formerly the National Committee for
   Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)]. See CLSI: Methods for dilution antimicrobial
   susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; approved standard-fifth edition.
15 Wayne, PA: NCCLS; 2000. The assays can be also be performed in microtiter trays
   according to conventional methodologies as published by the CLSI. See CLSI. Methods for
   Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved
   Standard-Seventh Edition. CLSI Document M7-A7 [ISBN 1-56238-587-9] CLSI, 940
   West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne Pennsylvania 19087-1898 USA, 2006).
20         The antimicrobial and other drug properties of the compounds can further be
   evaluated in various in vivo mammalian assays, such as a mouse or rat peritonitis infectious
   models, skin and soft tissue models (often referred to as the thigh model), or a mouse
   pneumonia model. There are septicemia or organ infection models known to those skilled in
   the art. These efficacy models can be used as part of the evaluation process and can be used
25 as a guide of potential efficacy in humans. Endpoints can vary from reduction in bacterial
   burden to lethality. For the latter endpoint, results are often expressed as a PD 5o value, or the
   dose of drug that protects 50% of the animals from mortality.
           To further assess a compound's drug-like properties, measurements of inhibition of
   cytochrome P450 enzymes and phase II metabolizing enzyme activity can also be measured
30 either using recombinant human enzyme systems or more complex systems like human liver
   microsomes. Further, compounds can be assessed as substrates of these metabolic enzyme
                                                   71

   activities as well. These activities are useful in determining the potential of a compound to
   cause drug-drug interactions or generate metabolites that retain or have no useful
   antimicrobial activity.
            To get an estimate of the potential of the compound to be orally bioavailable, one can
 5 also perform solubility and Caco-2 assays. The latter is a cell line from human epithelium
   that allows measurement of drug uptake and passage through a Caco-2 cell monolayer often
   growing within wells of a 24-well microtiter plate equipped with a 1 micron membrane. Free
   drug concentrations can be measured on the basolateral side of the monolayer, assessing the
   amount of drug that can pass through the intestinal monolayer. Appropriate controls to
10 ensure monolayer integrity and tightness of gap junctions are needed. Using this same
   system one can get an estimate of P-glycoprotein mediated efflux. P-glycoprotein is a pump
   that localizes to the apical membrane of cells, forming polarized monolayers. This pump can
   abrogate the active or passive uptake across the Caco-2 cell membrane, resulting in less drug
   passing through the intestinal epithelial layer. These results are often done in conjunction
15 with solubility measurements and both of these factors are known to contribute to oral
   bioavailability in mammals. Measurements of oral bioavailability in animals and ultimately
   in man using traditional pharmacokinetic experiments will determine the absolute oral
   bioavailability.
            Experimental results can also be used to build models that help predict physical
20 chemical parameters that contribute to drug-like properties. When such a model is verified,
   experimental methodology can be reduced, with increased reliance on the model
   predictability.
                                                    72

   5.      Formulation and Administration
           The compounds of the invention can be useful in the prevention or treatment of a
   variety of human or other animal, including mammalian and non mammalian, disorders,
   including for example, bacterial infection, fungal infections, viral infections, diarrhea,
 5 parasitic diseases, and cancer. It is contemplated that, once identified, the active molecules of
   the invention can be incorporated into any suitable carrier prior to use. The dose of active
   molecule, mode of administration and use of suitable carrier will depend upon the intended
   recipient and target organism. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human medical
   use, of compounds according to the present invention typically include such compounds in
10 association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
           The carrier(s) should be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other
   ingredients of the formulations and not deleterious to the recipient. Pharmaceutically
   acceptable carriers, in this regard, are intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion
   media, coatings, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying
15 agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media
   and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any
   conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the
   compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds (identified or designed
   according to the invention and/or known in the art) also can be incorporated into the
20 compositions. The formulations can conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and can
   be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy/microbiology. In
   general, some formulations are prepared by bringing the compound into association with a
   liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the
   product into the desired formulation.
25         A pharmaceutical composition of the invention should be formulated to be compatible
   with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include oral,
   otic, ophthalmic, nasal, or parenteral, for example, intravenous, intradermal, inhalation,
   transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used
   for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following
30 components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,
   polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial
                                                     73

   agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or
   sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as
   acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium
   chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or
 5 sodium hydroxide.
            Useful solutions for oral or parenteral administration can be prepared by any of the
   methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, described, for example, in Remington's
   Pharmaceutical Sciences, (Gennaro, A., ed.), Mack Pub., (1990). Formulations for parenteral
   administration can also include glycocholate for buccal administration, methoxysalicylate for
10 rectal administration, or citric acid for vaginal administration. The parenteral preparation can
   be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.
   Suppositories for rectal administration also can be prepared by mixing the drug with a non
   irritating excipient such as cocoa butter, other glycerides, or other compositions which are
   solid at room temperature and liquid at body temperatures. Formulations also can include,
15 for example, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, and
   hydrogenated naphthalenes. Formulations for direct administration can include glycerol and
   other compositions of high viscosity. Other potentially useful parenteral carriers for these
   drugs include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable
   infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation administration can contain as
20 excipients, for example, lactose, or can be aqueous solutions containing, for example,
   polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for
   administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Retention
   enemas also can be used for rectal delivery.
            Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration can be in the
25 form of: discrete units such as capsules, gelatin capsules, sachets, tablets, troches, or
   lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the drug; a powder or granular
   composition; a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid; or an
   oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. The drug can also be administered in the
   form of a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet can be made by compressing or moulding the
30 drug optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared
   by compressing, in a suitable machine, the drug in a free-flowing form such as a powder or
                                                    74

   granules, optionally mixed by a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing
   agent. Moulded tablets can be made by moulding, in a suitable machine, a mixture of the
   powdered drug and suitable carrier moistened with an inert liquid diluent.
            Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the
 5 purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with
   excipients. Oral compositions prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash include
   the compound in the fluid carrier and are applied orally and swished and expectorated or
   swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be
   included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can
10 contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as
   microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose; a
   disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as
   magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening
   agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate,
15 or orange flavoring.
           Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous
   solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
   preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,
   suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF,
20 Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). It should be stable under the conditions
   of manufacture and storage and should be preserved against the contaminating action of
   microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion
   medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene
   glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity
25 can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance
   of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many
   cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such
   as manitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the
   injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which
30 delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
                                                    75

           Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in
   the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
   enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
   prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic
 5 dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the
   case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of
   preparation include vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active
   ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution
   thereof.
10         Formulations suitable for intra-articular administration can be in the form of a sterile
   aqueous preparation of the drug that can be in microcrystalline form, for example, in the form
   of an aqueous microcrystalline suspension. Liposomal formulations or biodegradable
   polymer systems can also be used to present the drug for both intra-articular and ophthalmic
   administration.
15         Formulations suitable for topical administration, including eye treatment, include
   liquid or semi-liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, gels, applicants, oil-in-water or
   water-in-oil emulsions such as creams, ointments or pastes; or solutions or suspensions such
   as drops. Formulations for topical administration to the skin surface can be prepared by
   dispersing the drug with a dermatologically acceptable carrier such as a lotion, cream,
20 ointment or soap. Particularly useful are carriers capable of forming a film or layer over the
   skin to localize application and inhibit removal. For topical administration to internal tissue
   surfaces, the agent can be dispersed in a liquid tissue adhesive or other substance known to
   enhance adsorption to a tissue surface. For example, hydroxypropylcellulose or
   fibrinogen/thrombin solutions can be used to advantage. Alternatively, tissue-coating
25 solutions, such as pectin-containing formulations can be used.
           For inhalation treatments, inhalation of powder (self-propelling or spray
   formulations) dispensed with a spray can, a nebulizer, or an atomizer can be used. Such
   formulations can be in the form of a fine powder for pulmonary administration from a
   powder inhalation device or self-propelling powder-dispensing formulations. In the case of
30 self-propelling solution and spray formulations, the effect can be achieved either by choice of
   a valve having the desired spray characteristics (i.e., being capable of producing a spray
                                                   76

   having the desired particle size) or by incorporating the active ingredient as a suspended
   powder in controlled particle size. For administration by inhalation, the compounds also can
   be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which
   contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.
 5         Systemic administration also can be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For
   transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be
   permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants generally are known in the art, and
   include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents and bile salts.
   Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or
10 suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds typically are formulated
   into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.
           The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound
   against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including
   implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers
15 can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen,
   polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be
   apparent to those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions can also be used as
   pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to
   those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.
20         Oral or parenteral compositions can be formulated in dosage unit form for ease of
   administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form refers to physically discrete units
   suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined
   quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in
   association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit
25 forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of
   the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations
   inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.
   Furthermore, administration can be by periodic injections of a bolus, or can be made more
   continuous by intravenous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal administration from an external
30 reservoir (e.g., an intravenous bag).
                                                    77

           Where adhesion to a tissue surface is desired the composition can include the drug
   dispersed in a fibrinogen-thrombin composition or other bioadhesive. The compound then
   can be painted, sprayed or otherwise applied to the desired tissue surface. Alternatively, the
   drugs can be formulated for otic, ophthalmic, nasal, parenteral or oral administration to
 5 humans or other mammals, for example, in therapeutically effective amounts, e.g., amounts
   that provide appropriate concentrations of the drug to target tissue for a time sufficient to
   induce the desired effect.
           Where the active compound is to be used as part of a transplant procedure, it can be
   provided to the living tissue or organ to be transplanted prior to removal of tissue or organ
10 from the donor. The compound can be provided to the donor host. Alternatively or, in
   addition, once removed from the donor, the organ or living tissue can be placed in a
   preservation solution containing the active compound. In all cases, the active compound can
   be administered directly to the desired tissue, as by injection to the tissue, or it can be
   provided systemically, e.g., by otic, ophthalmic, nasal, oral or parenteral administration,
15 using any of the methods and formulations described herein and/or known in the art. Where
   the drug comprises part of a tissue or organ preservation solution, any commercially available
   preservation solution can be used to advantage. For example, useful solutions known in the
   art include Collins solution, Wisconsin solution, Belzer solution, Eurocollins solution and
   lactated Ringer's solution.
20         The compounds of the present invention can be administered directly to a tissue locus
   by applying the compound to a medical device that is placed in contact with the tissue. An
   example of a medical device is a stent, which contains or is coated with one or more of the
   compounds of the present invention.
           For example, an active compound can be applied to a stent at the site of vascular
25 injury. Stents can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art.
   See, e.g., Fattori, R. and Piva, T., "Drug Eluting Stents in Vascular Intervention," Lancet,
   2003, 361, 247-249; Morice, M. C., "A New Era in the Treatment of Coronary Disease?"
   European Heart Journal, 2003, 24, 209-211; and Toutouzas, K. et al., "Sirolimus-Eluting
   Stents: A Review of Experimental and Clinical Findings," Z. Kardiol., 2002, 91(3), 49-57.
30 The stent can be fabricated from stainless steel or another bio-compatible metal, or it can be
   made of a bio-compatible polymer. The active compound can be linked to the stent surface,
                                                   78

   embedded and released from polymer materials coated on the stent, or surrounded by and
   released through a carrier which coats or spans the stent. The stent can be used to administer
   single or multiple active compounds to tissues adjacent to the stent.
            Active compound as identified or designed by the methods described herein can be
 5 administered to individuals to treat disorders (prophylactically or therapeutically). In
   conjunction with such treatment, pharmacogenomics (i.e., the study of the relationship
   between an individual's genotype and that individual's response to a foreign compound or
   drug) can be considered. Differences in metabolism of therapeutics can lead to severe
   toxicity or therapeutic failure by altering the relation between dose and blood concentration
10 of the pharmacologically active drug. Thus, a physician or clinician can consider applying
   knowledge obtained in relevant pharmacogenomics studies in determining whether to
   administer a drug as well as tailoring the dosage and/or therapeutic regimen of treatment with
   the drug.
            In therapeutic use for treating, or combating, bacterial infections in mammals, the
15 compounds or pharmaceutical compositions thereof will be administered otically,
   ophthalmically, nasally, orally, parenterally and/or topically at a dosage to obtain and
   maintain a concentration, that is, an amount, or blood-level or tissue level of active
   component in the animal undergoing treatment which will be anti-microbially effective.
   Generally, an effective amount of dosage of active component will be in the range of from
20 about 0.1 to about 100, more preferably from about 1.0 to about 50 mg/kg of body
   weight/day. The amount administered will also likely depend on such variables as the type
   and extent of disease or indication to be treated, the overall health status of the particular
   patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound delivered, the formulation of the
   drug, the presence and types of excipients in the formulation, and the route of administration.
25 Also, it is to be understood that the initial dosage administered can be increased beyond the
   above upper level in order to rapidly achieve the desired blood-level or tissue level, or the
   initial dosage can be smaller than the optimum and the daily dosage can be progressively
   increased during the course of treatment depending on the particular situation. If desired, the
   daily dose can also be divided into multiple doses for administration, for example, two to four
30 times per day.
                                                    79

            Various disease states or conditions in humans and other mammals are found to be
   caused by or mediated by nonsense or missense mutations. These mutations cause or mediate
   the disease state or condition by adversely affecting, for example, protein synthesis, folding,
   trafficking and/or function. Examples of disease states or conditions in which an appreciable
 5 percentage of the disease or condition is believed to result from nonsense or missense
   mutations include hemophilia (factor VIII gene), neurofibromatosis (NF 1 and NF2 genes),
   retinitis pigmentosa (human USH2A gene), bullous skin diseases like Epidermolysis bullosa
   pruriginosa (COL7A1 gene), cystic fibrosis (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene),
   breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes), Duchenne muscular dystrophy
10 (dystrophin gene), colon cancer (mismatch repair genes, predominantly in MLH 1 and
   MSH2), and lysosomal storage disorders such as Neimann-Pick disease (acid
   sphingomyelinase gene). See Sanders CR, Myers JK. Disease-related misassembly of
   membrane proteins. Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct. 2004;33:25-51; National Center for

   human genetic disorders 1st ed. London ; New York : Chapman & Hall, 1995. NLM ID:
   9502404. The compounds of the present invention can be used to treat or prevent a disease
   state in a mammal caused or mediated by such nonsense or missense mutations by
   administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of the present invention to
20 suppress the nonsense or missense mutation involved in the disease state.

            Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 300 or
   Avance 500 spectrometer, or in some cases a GE-Nicolet 300 spectrometer. Common
   reaction solvents were either high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade or
25 American Chemical Society (ACS) grade, and anhydrous as obtained from the manufacturer

            Exemplary compounds synthesized in accordance with the invention are listed in
   Table 1. A bolded or dashed bond is shown to indicate a particular stereochemistry at a chiral
20 center, whereas a wavy bond indicates that the substituent can be in either orientation or that
   the compound is a mixture thereof. It should also be known that in the interest of conserving
   space, the chemical structures of some compounds have been split into two parts with the two
   points of connection each being indicated by a bond crossed by a wavy line. See, e.g.
   compound 755, which was drawn in two parts as:

   A mixture of phosphonium salt 12 (5.24 g, 9.88 mmol), la (or 1b) (2.65 g, 9.88 mmol),
   K 2 C0  3 (1.36 g, 9.88 mmol), and 18-crown-6 (catalytic amount) in toluene (50 mL) was
                                                   295

   heated at reflux under argon overnight. Upon completion, the mixture was cooled to rt and
   water was added. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 75 mL) and the
   combined organics were dried over Na 2 SO 4 and then concentrated. The residue was purified
   by silica gel chromatography (2:1 heptane/ethyl acetate). Compound 2a was isolated cleanly
 5 as mixture of E and Z isomers (3.78 g, 87% yield).
   Synthesis of 3a and 3b:
   To a flask containing phthalimide 2a (3.78 g, 8.58 mmol) (or 2b) in ethyl acetate was added
    10% Pd/C (0.76 g, 20% w/w). The flask was evacuated and filled with hydrogen via a
10 balloon assembly. Stirring at rt was continued for 45 minutes at which time the contents
   were purged with argon. After filtering the mixture through celite, solvent was evaporated to
   provide the desired product 3a in quantitative yield (3.77 g).
   Synthesis of 4a and 4b:
15 In a screw-cap pressure tube, 3a (3.70 g, 8.37 mmol) (or 3b) was dissolved in anhydrous
   ethanol. Hydrazine monohydrate (1.62 mL, 33.5 mmol) was added to the solution and heat
   was applied at 65 0C for 8 h. After cooling to rt, the slurry was filtered to remove the white
   solid byproduct and the resulting solution was concentrated to dryness. Water was added and
   the aqueous layer was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organics were
20 then washed with water and brine and dried over NaSO 4. Evaporation of solvent provided a
   clear, colorless oil (2.32 g, 89% yield) that was redissolved in dichloromethane (75 mL) and
   treated at 0 0C with benzyl chloroformate (1.27 mL, 8.94 mmol) and triethylamine (2.07 mL,
    14.9 mmol). After 1 h of stirring, water was added and the organic layer was collected, dried
   with NaSO 4 , and concentrated. Purification of the crude residue by silica gel
25 chromatography (2:1 heptane/ethyl acetate) furnished 4a as a viscous oil. (3.06 g, 92% yield)
   Synthesis of 5a and 5b:
   Compound 5a (and 5b) was prepared via the same two-step Sonogashira-deprotection
   sequence used for the synthesis of alkyne 10. Starting from 1.5 g 4a, the desire product was
30 obtained in 53% yield (0.69 g).

   Synthesis of 7a and 7b:
   Pyrrolocytosine 7a (and 7b) was prepared from the coupling of common intermediate 6 and
   alkyne 5a (and 5b, respectively) according to the procedure described above for the synthesis
   of 11. Starting from 690 mg of 5a, 1.23 g of the desired compound was obtained as an
 5 orange-brown solid (81%); LCMS (ESI) m/e 863.4 (M+1)*.
   Synthesis of 8a and 8b:
   Boc-deprotection of 7a (0.60 g, 0.69 mmol) (and 7b) was accomplished with trifluoroacetic
   acid as described for the preparation of 12A (note to attorney: provisional patent app
10 numbering). Alternatively, this transformation was carried out by treating the starting
   material with 8 mL of 6N HCl and anhydrous EtOH (30 mL) at 50 0C (2 h). Following
   solvent evaporation, the crude residue (from either approach) was taken to the next step
   without further purification. LCMS (ESI) m/e 663.3 (M+1)-.
15 Synthesis of 9a and 9b:
   Guanidine formation was carried out according to the protocol used to prepare compound 13
   (note to attorney: provisional patent app numbering) except that starting material 8a (~0.48
   g, 0.65 mmol) (and 8b) was used as a crude oil or semisolid rather than a MeOH-water
   solution. Removal of the Boc groups was facilitated by dissolving the protected guanidine
20 intermediate in 35 mL of anhydrous ethanol, followed by the addition of 10 mL of 6N HCl.
   The solution was heated to 70 0C for 3 h. Upon cooling, the mixture was concentrated and
   dried further by azeotroping with additional anhydrous ethanol. The yellow-brown solid was
   used directly in the next step without further purification.
25 Synthesis of 11a and 11b:
   Under argon, guanidine 9a (or 9b) was dissolved in 30 mL of trifluoroacetic acid.
   Thioanisole (0.5 mL) was added dropwise and the solution was stirred at rt for 3-4 h. Upon
   completion, solvent was evaporated affording an oil or semisolid. Diethyl ether was added
   and the liquid layer containing most of the residual thioanisole was decanted. Crude 10a was
30 then dissolved in [(20% MeOH-90% H20)+0.15%TFA] (20 mL). An aliquot (10 mL) was
   injected on a Dynamax 41.4 mm, C-18 prep HPLC Unit (guard+column), which was eluted with
                                                  298

   a gradient of solvents of 10% - 65% (MeOH/H20 + 0.15% TFA), over 45 min. The pure fractions
   were combined and concentrated with EtOH to dryness. This sample was treated with IN
   HCl/H20 (5 mL) and EtOH (70 mL), and concentrated. This operation was repeated; the solid
   thus obtained was lyophilized from H20-MeCN (4:1), affording compound 11a as a yellow

   ester (1.13 g, 2.16 mmol) in 10 mL of methanol was added 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-amino
    1,2,4-triazole (0.50 g, 2.81 mmol). A 0.5 M solution of sodium methoxide in methanol (5.6
   mL, 2.81 mmol) was added dropwise and the orange-colored mixture was gradually heated
   to 50 0C, where it was maintained overnight. Upon completion, methanol was removed in
 5 vacuo and the residue was partitioned between 100 mL of dichloromethane and 100 mL of
   water. The organic layer was collected, dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated to an orange
   yellow precipitate. The crude material was loaded onto a silica gel column and eluted as
   follows: 5 minutes at 40 mL/min with 100:0 CH 2Cl 2/MeOH; 15 minutes at 40 mL/min with
   95:5 CH 2 Cl 2/MeOH; 15 at 40 mL/min minutes with 90:10 CH 2 Cl 2/MeOH at which point the
10 desired product was collected from the column. Evaporation of the solvent provided a
   slightly yellow precipitate that was triturated with ether to yield 560 mg of white powder
   (44% yield). Removal of the BOC-protecting groups was then accomplished by dissolving
   the solid in 10 mL of dichloromethane, followed by the addition of 3 mL of trifluoroacetic
   acid. After 1 h at room temperature, complete conversion was observed. After the addition
15 of dichloroethane (10 mL), the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. Formation of
   the HCl salt was promoted by the addition of approximately 3 mL of aq. 1 N HCl and
   subsequent evaporation of the water. Lyophilization (aq. 1 N HCl/acetonitrile) provided 396

   was dissolved in 3 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 and 1 mL of TFA was added. The resulted mixture was
   stirred overnight and concentrated. 3 mL of 0.6 N HCl and 2 mL of acetonitrile were added
20 and stirred for 0.5 h, concentrated to a ca. 3 mL and lyophilized to give the title compound
   (40 mg). 1NMR (300 MHz, CD 30D): 6 9.41 (s, 1H), 8.25 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 1H), 7.87 (d, J = 7.8
   Hz, 2H), 7.74 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 3H), 7.68 (t, J = 8.2 Hz, 1H), 7.60 (t, J = 8.2 Hz, 1H), 4.34 (s,

25 Example 7 - Antimicrobial activity
            The compounds of the present invention were tested for antimicrobial activity. These
   data are presented in Table 2. The compounds were run against Eschericiacoli strain
   ATCC25922 using a standard microdilution assay to determine minimum inhibitory
   concentrations (MICs). The data is presented whereby a "+" indicates that the compound has
30 an MIC value of 16 micrograms/ml or less and a "-" indicates that the compound has an MIC
   value greater than 16 micrograms/ml. A "N/A" means that data is unavailable. It will be
                                                   307

   recognized by one skilled in the art that the compounds can be assessed against other
   bacterial organisms and that the presentation of data for activity against Eschericiacoli is
   illustrative and in no way is intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The
   compounds of the present invention can be assayed against a range of other microorganisms
 5 depending upon the performance activity desired to be gathered. Furthermore, the      "+", "-",
   and "N/A" representation and the selection of a cutoff value of 16 micrograms/ml is also
   illustrative and in no way is intended to limit the scope of the present invention. For
   example, a "-" is not meant to indicate that the compound necessarily lacks activity or utility,
   but rather that its MIC value against the indicated microorganism is greater than 16
10 micrograms/ml.
