                                       MIXER TRUCK
                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
      [0001]     The present invention relates to a mixer truck capable of loading
     ready-mixed concrete.
                                     BACKGROUND ART
      [0002]     JP2012-228830A discloses a mixer truck including a rotating drum
     rotatably mounted on a vehicle body, a hopper for leading ready-mixed
     concrete input into an inlet and outlet of the rotating drum, and a discharge
     chute for receiving the ready-mixed concrete discharged from the inlet and
     outlet of the rotating drum and discharging it to the outside.
      [0003]     The mixer truck has a spiral-shaped blade protruding from an inner
     wall of the rotating drum.    When the ready-mixed concrete is discharged, the
     rotating drum rotates in        one direction and the blade pushes       out the
     ready-mixed concrete to the inlet and outlet.
                                 SUMMARY OF INVENTION

     operation for discharging the ready-mixed        concrete through an opening
     portion of the rotating drum, there is a problem that a discharge amount of the
     ready-mixed concrete pushed out by the rotating blade cyclically increases and
     decreases.
      [0005]     The present invention has an object to provide a mixer truck capable
     of suppressing the cyclic increase and decrease of the discharge amount of the
     ready-mixed concrete.

     referring to the attached drawings.
      [0009]
      (First embodiment)
            Entire configuration of a mixer truck 100 will be described by referring to
      Figs. 1A and 1B.
      [0010]
            The mixer truck 100 is a vehicle including an operator's cabin 11 and a
     base 1.    The mixer truck 100 includes a mixer drum 2 mounted on the base 1
     and capable of loading ready-mixed concrete, a driving device 4 for rotating
     and driving the mixer drum 2, and a controller 10 for controlling rotation of the
     mixer drum 2.       The mixer truck 100 loads the ready-mixed concrete in the
     mixer drum 2 and transports it.       In Fig. 11B, the driving device 4 and the like
     are not shown.
      [0011]     The mixer drum 2 is a cylindrical container having a bottom
     rotatably mounted on the base 1 and has an opening portion 2A on a rear end
     thereof.    The mixer drum 2 is mounted with inclination so that its rotating
     axis 0 becomes gradually higher from a front part of the vehicle toward the
     rear part.
      [0012]     On a rear upper part of the opening portion 2A of the mixer drum 2,
     a hopper 16 is provided.         The ready-mixed concrete put into the opening
     portion 2A is led by the hopper 16 to the opening portion 2A.        On a rear lower
     part of the opening portion 2A of the mixer drum 2, a flow guide 17 and a chute
      18 are provided.      The ready-mixed concrete discharged from the opening
     portion 2A is led by the flow guide 17 to the chute 18 and is discharged by the
     chute 18 in a predetermined direction.
      [0013]     Inside the mixer drum 2, band-shaped first and second blades 13
     and 14 protruding from the inner wall thereof and spirally extending are

311507(PCT-1828) English Translation
                                              -4
     provided.    The first and second blades 13 and 14 are arranged so as to have a
     phase difference of 180 degrees to each other with respect to the rotating
     center axis 0.
      [0014]     During input of the ready-mixed concrete into the mixer drum 2 and
     agitation or kneading, the mixer drum 2 is rotated in a counterclockwise
     direction (forward driving) when the mixer drum 2 is seen from the rear (right
     end side in Fig. 1B).     The ready-mixed concrete in the mixer drum 2 is fed
     from the rear to the front of the mixer drum 2 (from the right to the left in Fig.
      1B) by the rotating first and second blades 13 and 14.             As a result, the
     ready-mixed concrete is agitated or kneaded and solidification thereof is
     prevented.
      [0015]     During discharge of the ready-mixed concrete with respect to the
     mixer drum 2, the mixer drum 2 is rotated in a clockwise direction (backward
     driving) when the mixer drum 2 is seen from the rear.               The ready-mixed
     concrete in the mixer drum 2 is fed from the front to the rear of the mixer drum
     2 (from the left to the right in Fig. 1B) by the rotating first and second blades 13
     and 14 and is discharged from the opening portion 2A of the mixer drum 2.
      [0016]     The mixer drum 2 is rotated and driven by using an engine 3 for
     running mounted on the mixer truck 100 as a power source.                The driving
     device 4 is driven by rotation of an engine 3 and rotates and drives the mixer
     drum 2 by a fluid pressure of an operating fluid.
      [0017]     A rotary motion of a crank shaft in the engine 3 is transmitted to the
     driving device 4 by a power take-off mechanism 9 (PTO: Power take-off) for
     taking out power from the engine 3 at all times and a drive shaft 8 (see Fig. 2)
     connecting the power take-off mechanism 9 and the driving device 4 to each
     other.
      [0018]     As illustrated in Fig. 2, in the power take-off mechanism 9, a

311507(PCT-1828) English Translation
                                            - 5
     rotation sensor 9a for detecting a rotating speed of the engine 3 and outputting
     a rotation speed signal according to the detected rotating speed to the
     controller 10 is provided.    It may be so configured that the rotating speed of
     the drive shaft 8 is detected by using the rotation sensor 9a.
      [0019]     In the driving device 4, an operating oil is used as the operating
     fluid.   Instead of the operating oil, another non-compressive fluid may be
     used as the operating fluid.    The driving device 4 includes a hydraulic pump 5
     as a fluid pressure pump driven by the engine 3 and discharging the operating
     fluid and a hydraulic motor 6 as a fluid pressure motor driven by the hydraulic
     pump 5 and rotating and driving the mixer drum 2.          The driving device 4 is
     capable of forward and backward rotation and acceleration and deceleration of
     the mixer drum 2.
      [0020]     The hydraulic pump 5 is rotated and driven by power taken out of
     the engine 3 through the power take-off mechanism 9 at all times.      Therefore,
     a rotating speed of the hydraulic pump 5 is largely affected by a change in the
     rotating speed of the engine 3 accompanying a running state of the vehicle.
     Thus, in the mixer truck 100, the rotating speed of the hydraulic motor 6 is
     controlled by the controller 10 so that the mixer drum 2 is in a target rotation
      state in accordance with the rotating speed of the engine 3.
      [0021]     The hydraulic pump 5 is a swash-plate type axial piston pump with
     variable capacity.    The hydraulic pump 5 receives a control signal from the
     controller 10 and switches a tilt angle of the swash plate (not shown) to a
     forward rotation direction or a backward rotation direction.       The hydraulic
     pump 5 includes an electromagnetic valve (not shown) for adjusting the tilt
     angle.    The hydraulic pump 5 has its discharge direction and a discharge
     capacity adjusted by switching of the electromagnetic valve.
      [0022]     The operating oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 5 is supplied

311507(PCT-1828)  English Translation

     to the hydraulic motor 6, and the hydraulic motor 6 is rotated.   The rotation of
     the hydraulic motor 6 is transmitted to the mixer drum 2 through a decelerator
      7.
      [0023]     As illustrated in Fig. 2, in the hydraulic pump 5, a pressure sensor
      5a as a pressure detector for detecting a pressure of the discharged operating
     oil is provided.    The pressure sensor 5a outputs a load pressure signal to the
     controller 10 according to the detected pressure of the operating oil.  It may be
      so configured that the pressure sensor 5a is provided not in the hydraulic
     pump 5 but in the hydraulic motor 6 so that the pressure of the operating oil in
     the hydraulic motor 6 is detected by the pressure sensor 5a.        As described
     above, the pressure sensor 5a detects the pressure of the operating oil in the
     driving device 4.
      [0024]     The hydraulic motor 6 is a swash-plate type axial piston motor with
     variable capacity.    The hydraulic motor 6 is rotated and driven upon receipt of
     the supply of the operating oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 5.        The
     hydraulic motor 6 includes an electromagnetic valve (not shown) for adjusting
     the tilt angle of the swash plate (not shown) by receiving a two-speed switching
      signal from the controller 10.       The capacity of the hydraulic motor 6 is
      switched in two stages, that is, a small capacity for high-speed rotation and a
     large capacity for normal rotation by switching of the electromagnetic valve.
     In the hydraulic motor 6, a rotation sensor 6a (see Fig. 2) as a rotating speed
     detector for detecting a rotating speed V of its output shaft (not shown) is
     provided.
      [0025]     The controller 10 controls an operation of the driving device 4.
      Specifically, the controller 10 is constituted by a microcomputer including a
      CPU (central processing unit), a ROM (read only memory), a RAM (random
     access memory), an I/O interface (input/output interface) and the like.      The

311507(PCT-1828)  English Translation
                                             -7
     RAM stores data in processing of the CPU, the ROM stores a control program of
     the CPU and the like in          advance,   and the I/O interface      is used for
     input/output of information with a connected device.        By operating the CPU,
     the RAM and the like in accordance with the program stored in the ROM,
     control of the driving device 4 is realized.
      [0026]     As illustrated in Fig. 2, when an operator operates an ignition switch
      (not shown) in the operator's cabin 11 so as to start the engine 3, an ignition
     power supply is input into the controller 10.     As a result, a power supply relay
     21 is switched, a main power supply from a main battery 23 is supplied to the
     controller 10, and the controller 10 is driven.
      [0027]     In the operator's cabin 11, a parking brake 31 and an operating
     device 32 for operating the mixer drum 2 are arranged.
      [0028]     In the parking brake 31, a detector for detecting a lever position of
     the parking brake 31 is provided.       When the parking brake 31 is operated, a
     vehicle stop signal is output from the detector to the controller 10.
      [0029]     In the operating device 32, a knob-type operation switch 32a for
      switching a rotating direction and a rotating speed of the mixer drum 2, a stop
      switch 32b for emergency stop of rotation of the mixer drum 2, and an
     automatic agitation switch 32c for automatically agitating and rotating the
     mixer drum 2 are provided.
      [0030]     On the basis of the operation of each of the operation switches 32a
     to 32c by the operator, an instruction signal is output from the operating
     device 32 to the controller 10.     The controller 10 determines a target rotation
      state of the mixer drum 2 or more specifically the rotating direction and the
     rotating speed on the basis of the instruction signal.
      [0031]     Here, a rotating operation of the mixer drum 2 will be described.
     When the automatic agitation switch 32c is on, if there is no vehicle stop signal

311507(PCT-1828) English Translation
                                           - 8
     from the parking brake 31 and the vehicle speed is at a predetermined speed or
     more, the controller 10 determines that the vehicle is running.     As a result,
     the controller 10 automatically agitates and rotates the mixer drum 2 in order
     to prevent discharge of the ready-mixed concrete and to maintain a quality of
     the ready-mixed concrete.
      [0032]     On the other hand, when the automatic agitation switch 32c is off,
     the controller 10 allows backward rotation of the mixer drum 2 by operating
     the operating device 32 even if the vehicle is running.     As a result, if the
     ready-mixed concrete is to be supplied to an elongated groove, for example, the
     ready-mixed concrete in the mixer drum 2 can be discharged to an outside
     while the vehicle is made to run at an extremely low speed.    Moreover, when
     the vehicle stop signal is output from the parking brake 31, too, the controller
      10 allows backward rotation of the mixer drum 2 by operating the operating
     device 32 so that the ready-mixed concrete in the mixer drum 2 can be
     discharged to the outside.
      [0033]     On a rear part of the mixer truck 100, a rear-part operating device
     38 for allowing an operation of the mixer drum 2 outside the mixer truck 100 is
     arranged.    In the rear-part operating device 38, similarly to the operating
     device 32, a knob-type operation switch 38a for switching the rotating
     direction and the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2, and a stop switch 38b for
     emergency stop of the rotation of the mixer drum 2 are provided.   On the basis
     of the operation of the rear-part operating device 38 by the operator, an
     instruction signal is output from the rear-part operating device 38 to the
     controller 10.
      [0034]     The controller 10 controls the operations of the hydraulic pump 5
     and the hydraulic motor 6 in accordance with the calculated rotating speed of
     the engine 3 so that the rotating direction and the rotating speed of the mixer

311507(PCT-1828) English Translation
                                           -  9
     drum 2 are in the target rotation state.          Specifically, the controller 10
     calculates a discharge direction and a discharge capacity of the hydraulic
     pump 5 and the capacity of the hydraulic motor 6 so that the rotating direction
     and the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 are in the target rotation state and
     outputs a control signal to the hydraulic pump 5 and outputs a two-speed
      switching signal to the hydraulic motor 6.
      [0035]     Into the controller 10, a load pressure signal is input from the
     hydraulic pump 5 through the pressure sensor 5a, and a rotating direction
      signal and a rotating speed signal are input from the hydraulic motor 6
     through the rotation sensor 6a.     The controller 10 controls the operations of
     the hydraulic pump 5 and the hydraulic motor 6 on the basis of these input
      signals.
      [0036]     Moreover, in the mixer truck 100, an automatic washing and
     kneading operating device 39 for allowing automatic washing inside the mixer
     drum 2 and a kneading operation of the ready-mixed concrete outside the
     mixer truck 100 is arranged.
      [0037]     In the prior-art mixer truck, during a discharge operation for
     discharging the ready-mixed concrete from the opening portion of the mixer
     drum, there is a problem that the discharge amount of the ready-mixed
     concrete pushed out by the rotating blades cyclically increases and decreases.
      Fig. 3A is a characteristic diagram illustrating a relation between the rotating
     angle of the mixer drum and the discharge amount of the ready-mixed
     concrete in the discharge operation in which the mixer drum is driven at a
      substantially constant rotating speed as a comparative example.     In the mixer
     drum in which two blades are provided, the discharge amount of the
     ready-mixed concrete increases and decreases twice during one rotation of the
     mixer drum.

      [0038]     As a method against that, the controller 10 executes control for
      suppressing cyclic increase and decrease of the discharge amount (flow rate) of
     the ready-mixed concrete by lowering the target rotating speed of the mixer
     drum 2 each time the first and second blades                13 and   14 come to
     predetermined      rotation positions   (rotating angles) during the discharge
     operation of the mixer drum 2.
      [0039]     The controller 10 includes a rotation position determining unit 10A
     for determining that the first and second blades 13 and 14 have come to the
     predetermined positions and a rotating speed control unit 10B for cyclically
     correcting the target rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 lower on the basis of
     the determination result of the rotation position determining unit 10A during
     the discharge operation of the mixer drum 2.
      [0040]     In the mixer truck 100, a rotation switch 12 for outputting a signal
     in accordance with a rotation position of the mixer drum 2 is provided.      The
     rotation switch 12 detects magnetic forces of first and second magnets 33 and
     34 mounted on an outer periphery of the mixer drum 2 and outputs a rotation
     position signal with passage of the first and second magnets 33 and 34 to the
     rotation switch 12.
      [0041]     The first and second magnets 33 and 34 are arranged with a phase
     difference of 180 degrees to each other with respect to the rotation center axis
      o so as to correspond to the positions of the first and second blades 13 and 14.
      [0042]     The rotation switch 12 is not limited to the aforementioned
     constitution but may be a limit switch or the like which is brought into contact
     with a projection mounted on the outer periphery of the mixer drum 2 and
     operated to be on/off.
      [0043]     The rotation position determining unit 10A receives a detection
      signal of the rotation switch 12 and receives a detection signal of the rotating

      speed V of the hydraulic motor 6 by the rotation sensor 6a.           The rotation
     position determining unit 10A determines that the mixer drum 2 gets closer to
     the rotation position where the discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete
     pushed out from the opening portion 2A by the first and second blades 13 and
      14 increases during the discharge operation of the mixer drum 2 in accordance
     with the rotation position and the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 on the
     basis of the detection signals of the rotation switch 12 and the rotation sensor
      6a.  Then, the rotation position determining unit 10A outputs a trigger signal
     at timing before the discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete increases
     in accordance with the rotating speed V of the hydraulic motor 6.
      [0044]     The rotation position determining unit 10A is configured such that
     the higher the rotating speed V of the hydraulic motor 6 is, the earlier the
     timing when the trigger signal is output after receiving the detection signal of
     the rotation switch 12 is set with respect to operation delayed time of the
     driving device 4.
      [0045]     A method of detecting the rotating speed V of the hydraulic motor 6
     is not limited to the aforementioned configuration that the signal of the
     rotation sensor 6a is received but may be configured such that the signal of the
     operation switches 32a and 38a for switching the target rotating speed of the
     mixer drum 2 are received.
      [0046]     The rotating speed control unit 1 OB receives a trigger signal from the
     rotation position determining unit 10A and calculates a discharge capacity of
     the hydraulic pump 5 so that the discharge amount of the ready-mixed
     concrete becomes constant by correcting the target rotating speed of the mixer
     drum 2 lower than the ordinary rotating speed.
      [0047]     The controller 10 outputs a control signal for controlling the
     operation of the hydraulic pump 5 so that the discharge capacity of the

     hydraulic pump 5 calculated by the rotating speed control unit 10B is
     obtained.
      [0048]     Fig. 3B is a timing chart illustrating relations among the rotation
     position signal to the rotating angle of the mixer drum 2, the trigger signal, the
     target rotating speed of the mixer drum 2, and the discharge amount of the
     ready-mixed concrete.      While the mixer drum 2 makes one rotation during the
     discharge operation of the mixer drum 2, the rotation position signal and the
     trigger signal rises twice, and the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 is lowered
     twice.    By controlling the operation of the hydraulic pump 5 so that the
     rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 cyclically lowers at timing corresponding to
     the rotation positions of the first and second blades 13 and 14, the cyclic
     fluctuation of the discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete can be
      suppressed.
      [0049]     In the rotation position determining unit 10A, the higher the
     rotating speed V of the hydraulic motor 6 is, the earlier the timing when the
     trigger signal is output from receiving the detection signal of the rotation
      switch 12 is set.    By changing the output timing of the trigger signal in
     accordance with the rotating speed V of the hydraulic motor 6, regardless of
     the change in the rotating speed V of the hydraulic motor 6, the rotation of the
     mixer drum 2 is decelerated at the rotation position where the discharge
     amount of the ready-mixed concrete is to increase.         As a result, the cyclic
     fluctuation of the discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete pushed out
     by the first and second blades 13 and 14 from the opening portion 2A can be
      suppressed.
      [0050]     According to the aforementioned embodiment, the mixer truck 100
     includes the driving device 4 for rotating and driving the mixer drum 2 and the
     controller 10 for controlling the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2.     And the

     controller   10   includes the rotation     position determining unit      10A for
     determining that the blades 13 and 14 have come to the predetermined
     rotation positions and the rotating speed control unit 10B for setting the
     rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 lower than the ordinary rotating speed on
     the basis of the determination result of the rotation position determining unit
      10A.
      [0051]     In the mixer truck       100, during the operation in which the
     ready-mixed concrete is discharged to the outside from the mixer drum 2, the
     controller 10 controls (cyclically lowers) the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2
     in accordance with the rotation positions of the blades 13 and 14.      Therefore,
     the cyclic increase and decrease of the discharge amount of the ready-mixed
     concrete pushed out by the blades 13 and 14 can be suppressed.           Since the
     ready-mixed concrete in a substantially constant flow rate is discharged from
     the mixer drum 2, when the ready-mixed concrete discharged from the
     opening portion 2A of the mixer drum 2 is input into a container such as a
     bucket, for example, fluctuation in an input amount of the ready-mixed
     concrete can be suppressed.
      [0052]     In the first embodiment, the rotation switch 12 for outputting the
      signal in accordance with the rotation position of the mixer drum 2 is provided
     in the mixer truck 100.          The rotation position determining unit 10A
     determines that the blades 13 and 14 have come to the predetermined
     positions on the basis of the signal from the rotation switch 12.
      [0053]     As a result, the rotation position determining unit           10A can
     accurately    determine   that   the blades    13   and  14 have     come   to the
     predetermined rotation positions on the basis of the signal of the rotation
      switch 12, and the discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete is controlled
     with accuracy by the controller 10.

      (Second embodiment)
            Subsequently, a second embodiment of the present invention will be
     described by referring to Fig. 4.     Hereinafter, points different from the first
     embodiment will be mainly described, and the same reference numerals are
     given to the same constitution as that of the mixer truck in the first
     embodiment, and explanation will be omitted.
      [0055]     In  the   mixer    truck  according   to  the   aforementioned    first
     embodiment, the rotation switch 12 outputting a signal in accordance with the
     rotation position of the mixer drum 2 is used, but according to the mixer truck
     in the second embodiment, the similar control is executed by using the
     pressure sensor 5a.
      [0056]     The pressure sensor 5a outputs a load pressure signal according to
     a discharge pressure P of the hydraulic pump 5 to the controller 10.           The
     discharge pressure P of the hydraulic pump 5 increases before the mixer drum
     2 comes to the rotation position where the ready-mixed concrete discharge
     amount pushed out by the first and second blades 13 and 14 increases.
      [0057]     A rotation position determining unit 10C receives a detection signal
     of the pressure sensor 5a.     Then, when the rotation position determining unit
      10C determines that the detected discharge pressure P rises to a threshold
     value set in advance or more, it outputs a trigger signal.        As a result, the
     trigger signal is output at timing before the discharge amount of the
     ready-mixed concrete pushed out by the first and second blades 13 and 14
     from the opening portion 2A increases.        The rotation position determining
     unit 10C may be configured to output the trigger signal when it determines
     that a rise rate of the detected discharge pressure P rises to the threshold value
      set in advance or more.

      [0058]     The rotation speed control unit 10B receives the trigger signal from
     the rotation position determining unit 10C and calculates a discharge capacity
     of the hydraulic pump 5 so that the discharge amount of the ready-mixed
     concrete becomes constant by setting the rotation speed of the mixer drum 2
     lower than the ordinary rotation speed.
      [0059]     The controller 10 outputs a control signal to the hydraulic pump 5
      so that the discharge capacity of the hydraulic pump 5 calculated by the
     rotation speed control unit 10B is obtained.
      [0060]     As a result, in the mixer truck 100, the rotation speed of the mixer
     drum 2 is lowered at timing according to the rotation positions of the first and
      second blades 13 and 14 during the discharge operation of the mixer drum 2,
     and the cyclic change of the discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete
     pushed out by the first and second blades 13 and 14 from the opening portion
     2A can be suppressed.
      [0061]     According to the aforementioned second embodiment, the pressure
      sensor (fluid pressure detector) 5a for detecting the discharge pressure P of the
     hydraulic pump 5 driving the hydraulic motor 6 is provided in the mixer truck
      100.   The rotation position determining unit 10C determines that the blades
      13 and 14 have come to the predetermined positions on the basis of the signal
     from the pressure sensor 5a.      As a result, the rotation position determining
     unit 10C can accurately determine the rotation position of the mixer drum 2
     whose discharge amount of the ready-mixed concrete increases by using the
     characteristics that the discharge pressure P driving the hydraulic motor 6
     increases and decreases in accordance with the rotation position of the mixer
     drum 2.
      [0062]     The embodiments of the present invention described above are
     merely illustration of some application examples of the present invention and

     not of the nature to limit the technical scope of the present invention to the
      specific constructions of the above embodiments.
      [0063]     In the aforementioned embodiments, it is configured to determine
     that the blades 13 and 14 have come to the predetermined rotation positions
     on the basis of the signal of the rotation switch 12 or the pressure sensor 5a.
     This is not limiting, and by providing a rotating angle detector for detecting an
     absolute rotating angle of the mixer drum 2, control may be executed such
     that the rotating speed of the mixer drum 2 is cyclically lowered on the basis of
     the signal of the rotating angle detector.
