                      TETRACYCLIC BROMODOMAIN INHIBITORS
                                          BACKGROUND
       The present application is a divisional of AU 2014231563, the entire specification of
which is incorporated herein by cross-reference.
       Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N-acetylated
lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing
proteins is comprised of four members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDt). Each member of the
BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N-acetylated lysine residues found
primarily, but not exclusively, on the amino-terminal tails of histone proteins. These
interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome
locations within chromatin. For example, histone-bound BRD4 recruits the transcription factor
P-TEFb to promoters, resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle
progression (Yang et al, Mol. Cell. Biol. 28: 967-976 (2008)). BRD2 and BRD3 also function
as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes (LeRoy et al, Mol. Cell 30: 51-60
(2008)). BET family members were recently established as being important for the maintenance
of several cancer types (Zuber et al., Nature 478: 524-528 (2011); Mertz et al; Proc. Nat'l. Acad.
Sci. 108: 16669-16674 (2011); Delmore et al., Cell 146: 1-14, (2011); Dawson et al., Nature
478: 529-533 (2011)). BET family members have also been implicated in mediating acute
inflammatory responses through the canomical NF-KB pathway (Huang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol.
29: 1375-1387 (2009)) resuting in the upregulation of genes associated with the production of
cytokines (Nicodeme et al., Nature 468: 1119-1123, (2010)). Suppression of cytokine induction
by BET bromodomain inhibitors has been shown to be an effective approach to treat
inflammation-mediated kidney disease in an animal model (Zhang, et al., J. Biol. Chem 287:
28840-28851 (2012)). BRD2 function has been linked to predisposition for dyslipidemia or
improper regulation of adipogenesis, elevated inflammatory profiles and increase susceptibility
to autoimmune diseases (Denis, Discovery Medicine 10: 489-499 (2010)). The human
immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral RNA from stably
integrated viral DNA (Jang et al., Mol. Cell, 19: 523-534 (2005)). BET bromodomain inhibitors
have also been shown to reactivate HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and
latent monocyte infection (Benerjee, et al, J. Leukocyte Biol. doi:10.1189/jlb.0312165). BRDt
has an important role in spermatogenesis that is blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitors
(Matzuk, et al, Cell 150: 673-684 (2012)). Thus, compounds that inhibit the binding of BET
family bromodomains to their cognate acetylated lysine proteins are being pursued for the
treatment of cancer, inflammatory diseases, kidney diseases, diseases involving metabolism or
fat accumulation, and some viral infections, as well as for providing a method for male
contraception.

           If a nuiety is des crib el as '"ubstitute", a mn-hydogen radical is in the place of
