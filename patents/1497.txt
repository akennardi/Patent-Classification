                          BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
   [00141    Various objects and advantages and a more complete understanding of the present
   invention are apparent and more readily appreciated by reference to the following Detailed
   Description and to the appended claims when taken in conjunction with the accompanying
 5 Drawings, wherein:
   [00151    FIG. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the video monitoring device based on the
   implementation mode of the utility model.
   [00161    FIG. 2 shows the schematic diagram of the wireless camera.
                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 0 [00171    The following combination of the implementation example and the attached drawing
   illustrate the utility model.
   [00181    As shown in FIG. 1, a video monitoring device is proposed according to the
   implementation mode of the utility model, and the device includes: multiple wireless
   communication modules 1, wireless cameras 2, a bus 3, a power source 4, a reset device 5, a
 5 microcontroller 6, a master computer 7 and an alarm 8.
   [00191    Wherein, the wireless communication modules 1, the power source 4, the reset device
   5, the microcontroller 6, the master computer 7, the alarm 8 are connected to the bus 3
   respectively, in order to transmit data in two-way connection. The microcontroller and/or the
   master computer control the wireless communication modules to send and receive signals
20 through the bus, to realize the interaction with the wireless camera.
   [00201    The wireless communication modules 1 can adopt Wi-Fi modules, Bluetooth modules,
   or Zigbee modules. The Wi-Fi modules can adopt the RKi6000 chips. The Bluetooth modules
   adopt BM77SPP03MC2 chips. The Zigbee modules can adopt MC13224, CC2430, CC2530,
   etc. FIG 1 shows two wireless communication modules 1. However, the above figure is not the
25 restriction on the number of the wireless communication modules 1. According to the need of
   reality layout, the size of the layout space and distance, the number and position of the wireless
                                                     3

                                                                                CQPC17121615U-AU
   communication modules 1 can be adjusted properly. For example, in a mall environment, one or
   more wireless modules can be set up on each floor of the mall. Each wireless communication
   module can control the movement of the multiple wireless cameras or receive the video
   information of the wireless cameras, so there is no need to set up a long wired connection
 5 between the camera and the controller as before. Therefore, the design of the utility model
   reduces the cost of the overall installation and reduces the wiring complexity in the process of
   mounting the video monitoring device. Each wireless module 1 is connected to the wireless
   camera 2 through wireless network, and the wireless camera 2 transmits the obtained video
   information to the wireless module 1 through the wireless network, and then to the
 o microcontroller 6 or the master computer 7 through the bus 3.
   [00211   The wireless camera 2, as shown in FIG 2, includes a camera 9, a controller 10, and a
   wireless transceiver 11 in sequence. The controller 10 controls the rotation of the camera 9 up
   and down, and controls the transceiving signals of the wireless transceiver 11. In this case, the
   chip used in the wireless transceiver 11 is matched with the chip of the above wireless
 5 communication module 1 to complete the transceiving of the wireless signals. For example,
   when the wireless communication modules 1 adopt           Wi-Fi modules, the wireless transceiver
   11 adopts RKi6000 chip or other chip to match the Wi-Fi modules to work. When wireless
   communication modules 1 adopt Bluetooth modules, the wireless transceiver 11 adopts
   BM77SPP03MC2         or other chip to match the Bluetooth modules. When wireless
20 communication modules 1 adopt the Zigbee modules, the wireless transceiver 11 adopts
   MC13224, CC2430, CC2530 or other chip to match the Zigbee modules. The controller 10 can
   use 51 series single chip or 52 series single chip. If there is need to adjust the shooting position
   of the camera, the control signals of the microcontroller 6 or the master computer 7 are sent to
   the wireless communication modules 1 through the bus 3, and then sent to the wireless camera
25 2 via the wireless network, to control the rotation in up and down, left and right direction of the
   wireless camera 2.
   [0022] The bus 3 is a public communication trunk that transmits information between various
   functional components. It is a transmission cable consisting of wires. The bus 3 in the utility
   model can includes a data bus, an address bus and a control bus, which are used to transmit data,
                                                     4

                                                                               CQPC17121615U-AU
   data address and control signals respectively.
   [00231    Power supply 4 is used to provide power for the whole video monitoring device, which
   can be a commercial power, and can also include a battery or a charging and discharging power
   devices, etc., so that the video monitoring device can still work in emergency situations such as
 5 the commercial power failed.
   [00241    The reset device 5 is mainly used to monitor the change of the power supply voltage. If
   the system power supply is unstable when the system of the video monitoring device is
   electrically operated or in working, the reset device 5 will output the reset signal to stop the
   system from working, so as to prevent abnormal phenomena from running away or crashed.
 o Reset device 5 can adopt NCP5663 chip, etc. If the whole video monitoring device has an error
   or in an abnormal working condition, the microcontroller 6 or the master computer 7 can send
   the control command to the reset device 5, so that the whole device can be restarted or reset.
   [00251    The microcontroller 6 can adopt a single chip of STM32FO3OC8T6 or other type.
   When the main machine 7 is uncontrollable, the microcontroller 6 is able to automatically
 5 process the usual information or status, and it can trigger the reset device 5 to reset, or trigger
   the alarm 8 to alarm.
   [00261    The master computer 7 is the center of the whole video monitoring device, and the
   videos obtained from all the cameras are summarized to the screen of the master computer, so
   as to facilitate the management personnel to monitor the entire layout of the place. The master
20 computer is also used to send control commands to each component of the video monitoring
   device, such as controlling the rotation of the camera, the switch of the reset device, the alerting
   of the alarm and so on. Users can watch and record the video information of each camera
   through the master computer 7, so in case of emergency, it can be dealt with in time and
   effectively.
25 [00271    The alarm 8 can be a common acousto-optic alarm, which can alarm under the control
   of the master computer or microcontroller. The alarm 8 can also be a smoke alarm, when there
   is smoke in the environment of the video monitoring device, the alarm is alarming, and the
   alarm uploads the result to the microcontroller or the master computer. The alarm can also be an
                                                     5

  alarm device including an infrared sensing unit, a mobile image detection unit and a network
  transmission unit. For example, when the alarm device is set in the sensitive area, if the infrared
  sensing unit or the mobile image detection unit of the alarm device detects the entry of
  personnel with no authorization, the alarm can be triggered by the network transmission unit in
5 time, to realize the function of anti-theft and security. If the device is overheating or damaged,
  the alarm 8 will alarm in sound and light, and give a alarm to maintenance personnel or device
  controller to handle it in time.
