Abstract:
A surgical humidification system includes a source of gas flow and a humidifier that receives the
gas flow and outputs a humidified gas to a delivery conduit. The delivery conduit has an outlet
and a suitable interface, such as a diffuser, is connected to the outlet. The interface can be
positioned near or within an open surgical cavity of a patient to supply the humidified gas to the
cavity. The system also includes a pressure relief arrangement that operates to relieve pressure
from the system above a normal operating pressure. The pressure relief arrangement can be
located in a non-sterile portion of the system, such as upstream from the humidifier, for example.

  Field
          10001]     This disclosure relates generally to open surgery insufflation systems, and
  more particularly to humidified insufflation systems for open surgery.
 Description of Related Art
          [0002]     Insufflation gases can be used in surgery for a variety of purposes. In open
 surgery, gas can be insufflated into a body cavity for de-airing, as in cardiac or thoracic
 surgery, for example. The insufflation gas can be inert or non-toxic, such as air or carbon
 dioxide (C02).     Other insufflation gases that have been proposed are nitrogen gas (N2),
 nitrogen dioxide N20, Argon (Ar) and Helium (He). Medical grade C02 can be supplied in
 cylinders and delivered to a patient at room temperature (e.g., between about 19 and
 21 degrees Celsius), with a relative humidity approaching 0%. This gas is colder and drier
 than the environment inside the patient (e.g., about 37 degrees Celsius and a relative humidity
 of about 100%, respectively).      Temperature and humidity of an insufflation gas can be
 adjusted to more closely approximate the environment inside the patient prior to delivery.
Heating and humidifying the insufflation gas can decrease cellular damage or desiccation,
limit adhesion formation, or reduce other deleterious effects.          Although open surgery
humidified insufflation systems exist, there remains room for improvement to, for example,
increase the performance or reliability of the system.
                                           SUMMARY
         [0003]     The systems, methods and devices described herein have innovative
aspects, no single one of which is indispensable or solely responsible for their desirable
attributes. Without limiting the scope of the claims, some of the advantageous features will
now be summarized.
        [0004]      An aspect involves an open surgical insufflation system.         The system
comprises a gas source for providing a constant flow of insufflation gas.           A humidifier
                                                -1-

  receives the flow of insufflation gas from the gas source and warms and humidifies the flow
  of insufflation gas. A gas diffuser dispenses the warmed and humidified flow of insufflation
  gas from the humidifier into an open surgical cavity in direct contact with an external
  atmosphere to create an insufflation gas environment in the open surgical cavity. A pressure
  relief arrangement is activated in response to a system pressure above a threshold pressure
  and operates to reduce the system pressure when activated.
            [0005]    In some configurations, the pressure relief arrangement is located between
 the gas source and the humidifier.
           [0006]     In some configurations, the pressure relief arrangement is located upstream
 from the humidifier relative to a direction of the flow of insufflation gas within the system.
           [0007]     In some configurations, the pressure relief arrangement is located
 downstream from the humidifier relative to a direction of the flow of insufflation gas within
 the system.
           [0008]    In some configurations, the threshold pressure is no greater than about 12
 psi.
          [0009]     In some configurations, the threshold pressure is no greater than about 9.5
 psi.
          [0010]     In some configurations, the threshold pressure is no greater than about 5
psi.
          [0011]     In some configurations, the threshold pressure is between about 2 psi and
about 9.5 psi.
          [00121     In some configurations, the threshold pressure is between about 3 psi and
about 5 psi.
         [00131     In some configurations, the gas source comprises a gas bottle, a pressure
regulator and a flow meter. In some configurations, the flow meter is adjustable and permits
a flow rate of the flow of insufflation gas to be adjusted to between about 5 L/min and about
15 L/min. In some configurations, the flow rate can be adjusted to about 10 L/min.
         100141     In some configurations, the gas diffuser is constructed from a foam or
foam-like material.

            [0015]      In some configurations the pressure relief arrangement may comprise a
   pressure relief valve.
            [0016]      In some configurations the pressure relief arrangement may comprise a
  protective shroud or cover around the pressure relief valve.
            [0017]      An aspect involves a method of providing insufflation gas therapy in an
  open surgical procedure. The method comprises providing a flow of an insufflation gas from
  a gas source. The flow of insufflation gas is passed through a humidification chamber to
  warm and humidify the flow of insufflation gas. The gas is diffused from a gas diffuser to
  within a surgical cavity that is open to the atmosphere to create an insufflation
                                                                                                 gas
  environment within the surgical cavity. Pressure within a system comprising
                                                                                     the gas source,
  humidification chamber and the gas diffuser is relieved through a pressure relief valve that
                                                                                                  is
  separate from the gas diffuser in response to an increase in pressure within the system above
  a threshold pressure.
           [0018]      In some configurations, the pressure relief valve is located between the gas
 source and the humidification chamber.
           [0019]      In some configurations, the pressure relief valve is located upstream from
 the humidification chamber relative to a direction of the flow of insufflation gas within
                                                                                                the
 system.
          [0020]      In some configurations, the pressure relief valve is located downstream
 from the humidification chamber relative to a direction of the flow of insufflation gas within
the system.
          [0021]      In some configurations, the threshold pressure is no greater than about 12
psi.
         [00221       In some configurations, the threshold pressure is no greater than about 9.5
psi.
         [0023]      In some configurations, the threshold pressure is no greater than about 5
psi.

about 9.5 psi.

          [00251      In some configurations, the threshold pressure is between about 3 psi and
  about 5 psi.
          [00261      In some configurations, the gas source comprises a gas bottle, a pressure
 regulator and a flow meter. In some configurations, the flow meter is adjusted so that a flow
 rate of the flow of insufflation gas is between about 5 L/min and about 15 L/min. In some
 configurations, the flow meter is adjusted so that the flow rate is about 10 L/min.
          [0027]      In some configurations, the gas diffuser is constructed from a foam or
 foam-like material.
          [0028]      An aspect involves a method of assembling an open surgical insufflation
 system.    The method comprises connecting a gas source to a humidifier, the gas source
 configured to supply a constant flow of an insufflation gas and the humidifier configured to
 receive the flow of insufflation gas and warm and humidify the insufflation gas. A gas
 diffuser is connected to the humidifier, the gas diffuser configured to dispense the flow of
 insufflation gas to an open surgical cavity of a patient. A pressure relief valve is connected to
 the system, the pressure relief valve configured to reduce pressure within the system when the
pressure reaches a threshold pressure.
          [0029]     In some configurations, the connecting of the pressure relief valve
 comprises connecting the pressure relief valve between the gas source and the humidifier.
         [0030]      In some configurations, the connecting of the pressure relief valve
comprises connecting pressure relief valve at a location upstream from the humidifier relative
to a direction of the flow of insufflation gas within the system.
         [0031]      In some configurations, the connecting of the pressure relief valve
comprises connecting pressure relief valve at a location downstream from the humidifier
relative to a direction of the flow of insufflation gas within the system.

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
         [0043]     Described herein are methods and systems that relieve system pressure or
limit the maximum pressure in an open loop or open insufflation system for use in open or
direct access surgical procedures. It will be understood that although much of the description
herein is in the context of open surgery, one or more features of the present disclosure can
                                                -5-

WO 2014/065678                                                             PCT/NZ2013/000192
 also be implemented in other scenarios where it is desirable to limit the output pressure of a
 gas, such as respiratory applications.
          10044]      Insufflation gases can be used in a variety of surgical procedures. In open
 surgery, insufflation gases can be used in a body cavity for de-airing, which can decrease the
 risk of air embolism or, possibly, decrease the risk of infection of the surgical wound. In
 open surgical applications, the insufflation system is an open loop system that provides a
 generally constant flow of insufflation gas as a desired flow rate over a desirable period of
 time, which can encompass a portion or the entirety of the surgical procedure. Such an open
 loop system is in contrast to the (essentially) closed loop or feedback insufflation systems
 used in minimally invasive surgery, in which insufflation gas is provided discontinuously or
 on demand to maintain a relatively low pressure (e.g., 0.3 psi, 2kPa) within the essentially
 sealed body cavity.
         [00451      It has been discovered by the present inventor that, although insufflation
 systems for use in open surgery are open loop gas delivery systems, which deliver insufflation
 gas to the atmosphere, occlusion of the system can occur during normal or routine operation.
 Occlusion of the system can cause a rise in system pressure and, possibly, failure of or
 damage to components of the system. This failure or damage can cause a temporary or, in
 some cases, a complete interruption in the insufflation therapy. Thus, the present inventor
has discovered that it can be desirable to provide for pressure relief in an open loop
insufflation system.
         100461      In some configurations, the open loop surgery insufflation system
incorporates a humidifier to warm and humidify the delivered insufflation gas. Body cavity
environments can include cells that are susceptible to damage when exposed to relatively dry
and cold gases. Insufflation gases can be relatively cold and dry and may cause damage to
cells, damage that can be reduced or avoided through humidifying and warming the
insufflation gas.     Warming and humidifying the insufflation gas can reduce or prevent
cellular desiccation. This can have a positive effect on post-operative pain that not only
increases quality of care but reduces recovery time and increase department throughput.
Warming and humidifying insufflation gases may reduce intra-operative hypothermia, reduce
post-operative pain, and improve post-operative recovery.

 WO 2014/065678                                                            PCT/NZ2013/000192
           [00471     Some embodiments described herein provide for a humidification system
  that is configured to deliver warm, humidified gas to a patient undergoing a surgical
  procedure. The gas is passed through a water chamber which is filled with water that is
  heated using a heater plate. Water evaporates in the chamber and combines with the gas
  which flows over it, thereby heating and/or humidifying the gas. The temperature of the gas
  can be maintained as it travels along a heated tube to an outlet port for delivery to the patient.
  The humidification system can monitor the temperature and flow rate of the gas at a chamber
  outlet, and control an amount of electrical power delivered to the heater plate to provide a gas
  having a desired temperature and humidity. Thus, surgical gas from a gas source (e.g., a gas
  bottle, wall source or the like) can be humidified and heated and delivered
                                                                                    to the patient,
  enabling the targeted area to remain moist and warm.
          [00481      Some embodiments described herein provide for a surgical humidification
  system that includes a humidifier control system configured to determine a mode of
 operation, a mode of control, a heater plate set point, or any combination of these. The
 humidifier control system can base this determination at least in part on feedback from
 components of the humidification system. The components of the humidification system can
 provide feedback through sensors or other electrical components, and feedback
                                                                                      can include,
 for example, outlet gas temperature, heater plate temperature, heater plate power, gas flow
rate, user input through user interface elements, duration of operation, and the like. Some
 embodiments of the humidifier control system can improve efficiency of the humidification
system, provide an output gas with relatively consistent humidity and temperature, and
provide greater control over temperature and humidity of the gas compared to control systems
that do not incorporate system component feedback.          The humidifier control system can
provide at least some of these improvements through modules configured to process system
component feedback and adjust output settings according to a control loop feedback
mechanism. If provided, the humidifier can be controlled in any suitable manner, such as
using a portion or an entirety of the control systems and methods disclosed in U.S.

            [00491     Figure 1 illustrates an example open surgery insufflation system 10 for
   delivering an insufflation gas to a patient 12 and, in particular, to an open surgical site of the
  patient 12, which can be, for example and without limitation, an area, cavity or wound
   (collectively referred to as a "cavity"). The open surgery insufflation system 10 comprises a
  gas source 14 for supplying a flow of insufflation gas. The insufflation gas can be any
  suitable gas for the desired purpose; however, in some configurations the insufflation gas is
  carbon dioxide (C02). As described above, C02 is often used as a surgical insufflation gas
  and is well-suited for open surgery insufflation because C02 is heavier than air and tends to
  displace air in an open surgical cavity.
           [00501      The gas source 14 can be of any suitable arrangement to deliver a suitable
  flow of insufflation gas, which in some configurations is a constant flow of insufflation gas.
  In some configurations, the gas source 14 comprises a gas bottle 16 filled with a compressed
 insufflation gas, such as C02. However, in other configurations, the insufflation gas could
 be supplied by another gas supply, such as a wall supply (i.e., gas supplied via appropriate
 conduit from a remote reservoir) for example and without limitation. The gas source 14 can
 also comprise a pressure regulator 20 if necessary or desirable to regulate the pressure of the
 flow of insufflation gas provided by the gas bottle 16 or other gas supply.               In some
 configurations, the gas bottle 16 contains insufflation gas (e.g., C02) that is pressurized to a
 relatively high pressure (e.g., about 5,000 kPa or about 725 psi). The pressure regulator 20
 can reduce the pressure of gas supplied by the gas bottle 16 to a pressure more suitable for
use by the open surgery insufflation system 10, such as about 400 kPa (about 58 psi), for
example. It is possible to construct a pressure regulator 20 that could further reduce the
pressure of gas supplied by the gas bottle 16; however, such a regulator would be larger
and/or more complicated and may not be practical for use in a surgical setting.
          [00511      In some configurations, the gas source 14 comprises a flow regulator or
flow meter 22 for regulating the flow rate of the flow of insufflation gas from the gas bottle
16 or other gas supply. The flow meter 22 can be any suitable type, such as a flow meter
commonly used to regulate the flow rate of medical gases (e.g., respiratory gases). The flow
meter 22 can be adjustable to permit adjustment of the gas flow rate. The flow meter 22 can
permit adjustment of the flow rate within any suitable range. In some configurations, the
                                                -8-

WO 2014/065678                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000192
 flow meter 22 can permit adjustment of the flow rate up to about 25 liters/minute (L/min). In
 some configurations, the flow meter 22 can permit adjustment of the flow rate to between
 about 1-2 L/min and about 25 L/min.          More particularly, the flow meter 22 can permit
 adjustment of the flow rate between about 5 L/min to about 15 L/min.               Even more
 particularly, the flow meter 22 can provide a flow rate of about 10 L/min.             In some
 configurations, a relatively low flow rate is desired and, in some such configurations, the
 insufflation gas can be shielded from evacuation from the surgical site, such as with a barrier,
 and/or the insufflation gas level can be measured at the surgical site. If the insufflation gas
 level is measured, feedback control of the flow rate can be utilized. However, other suitable
 flow rates can also be used, which may greater than 25 L/min.
         100521      In the illustrated configuration, the gas bottle 16 (or other gas supply),
pressure regulator 20 and flow meter 22 are separate from one another and coupled by
 suitable conduits 24. However, in other configurations, one or more of these components
could be combined in an integrated unit. Other suitable arrangements are also possible.
         [00531      The open surgery insufflation system 10 can also include a humidifier 30,
which receives a flow of insufflation gas from the gas source 14 and outputs a warmed and
humidified flow of insufflation gas. The humidifier 30 can be of any suitable arrangement,
such as the humidifier 30 described below with reference to Figure 2 or any other suitable
arrangement.
         [00541      The open surgery insufflation system 10 can also comprise an outlet 32 for
dispensing the flow of insufflation gas. The outlet 32 can be of any suitable arrangement to
deliver the flow of insufflation gas to the open surgical cavity of the patient 12.     In some
configurations, the outlet 32 is configured to disperse the flow of insufflation gas as it exits
the outlet 32.     In particular, the outlet 32 can comprise a gas diffuser of any suitable
arrangement.     The outlet 32 (e.g., diffuser, nozzle or other arrangement) can be referred to
generally as an interface or patient interface.
         [00551      The open surgery insufflation system 10 also comprises a pressure relief
arrangement, which can comprise a pressure relief valve or check valve 40 (referred to
hereinafter as a "pressure relief valve"). The pressure relief valve 40 can be configured to

above a threshold pressure level. The pressure relief valve 40 can be of any suitable type for
use in a medical fluid system, such as a ball-and-spring valve, a diaphragm valve, a leaflet
valve, etc. In some configurations, the threshold pressure level can be set to be slightly or
significantly higher than system pressures that are expected to occur during normal use of the
open surgery insufflation system 10, which can include system pressures that occur as a result
of foreseeable, but less-than-ideal use of the system 10. In response to systems pressures
above a threshold, the pressure relief valve 40 can open to vent pressure from the open
surgery insufflation system 10, such as to the atmosphere, and reduce the system pressure.
Such an arrangement can reduce the incident of or prevent failure of a system component,
such as connections (e.g., taper, luer or barb connections) between components of the system
 10 or, in some cases, larger system components (e.g., the humidifier 30).
         [00561     Figure 2 illustrates the open surgery insufflation system 10 with an
example surgical humidification system 100 for delivering temperature- and humidity
controlled gas to a patient 102 shown in greater detail. As described above, open surgery
insufflation system 10 can comprise a humidifier 30, which can incorporate a humidifier
control system 50. The humidifier 30 is connected to the gas source 14 through a supply
conduit 52. The humidifier 30 delivers humidified gas to the patient 12 through a patient
conduit 54. The conduits 52, 54 can be made of any suitable material, such as flexible plastic
tubing, for example.
         [0057]     The humidifier 30 receives gas from the gas source 14 through the supply
conduit 52. The gas can be filtered through a filter 56 and delivered to the humidifier 30
through a humidifier inlet 60. The filter 56 can be positioned at any suitable location within
the system 10, such as upstream from the humidifier 30, as shown, or downstream from the
humidifier 30. The gas is humidified as it passes through a humidifying chamber 62, which
is effectively a water bath, and the gas flows out through a humidifier outlet 64 and into the
patient conduit 54. The gas then moves through the patient conduit 54 to the patient 12. In
some configurations, a filter can be disposed between the humidifier outlet 64 and the patient
12.
         [0058]     The humidifier 30 comprises a body or base 66 with which the
humidification chamber 62 can be removably engaged.             In some configurations, the

  humidification chamber 62 has a metal base 70 and is adapted to hold a volume of water 72,
  which can be heated by a heater plate 74. The heater plate 74 can be in thermal contact with
  the metal base 70 of the humidification chamber 62. Providing power to the heater plate 74
  can cause heat to flow from the heater plate 74 to the water 72 through the metal base 70. As
 the water 72 within the humidification chamber 62 is heated it can evaporate and the
 evaporated water can mix with gases flowing through the humidification chamber 62 from
 the filter 56 and gas source 14. Accordingly, the humidified gases leave the humidification
 chamber 62 via outlet 64 and are passed to the patient 12 via the patient conduit 54 preferably
 to the surgical site to insufflate the surgical site.
          [0059]      In some configurations, the humidifier 30 includes the humidifier control
 system 50 configured to control a temperature and/or humidity of the gas being delivered to
 the patient 12. The humidifier control system 50 can be configured to regulate an amount of
 humidity supplied to the gases by controlling an electrical power supplied to the heater base
 74.    The humidifier control system 50 can control operation of the humidifier 30 in
 accordance with instructions set in software and in response to system inputs. System inputs
 can include a heater plate sensor 76, an outlet chamber temperature sensor 80, and a chamber
 outlet flow probe 82. For example, the humidifier control system 50 can receive temperature
 information from the heater plate sensor 76 which it can use as an input to a control module
used to control the power or temperature set point of the heater plate 74. The humidifier
control system 50 can be provided with inputs of temperature and/or flow rates of the gases.
For example, the chamber outlet temperature sensor 80 can be provided to indicate to the
humidifier control system 50 the temperature of the humidified gas as it leaves the outlet 64
of the humidification chamber 62. The temperature of the gases exiting the chamber can be
measured using any suitable temperature sensor 80, such as a wire-based temperature sensor.
The chamber outlet flow probe 82 can be provided to indicate to the humidifier control
system 50 the flow rate of the humidified gas.         The flow rate of the gases through the
chamber 62 can be measured using any suitable flow probe 82, such as a hot wire
anemometer. In some embodiments, the temperature sensor 80 and flow probe 82 are in the
same sensor housing. The temperature sensor 80 and flow probe 82 can be connected to the
humidifier 30 via connector 84.         Additional sensors may be incorporated into the open
                                                 -11-

   surgery insufflation system 10, for example, for sensing parameters at the patient end of the
  patient conduit 54.
          [0060]      The humidifier control system 50 can be in communication with the heater
  plate 74 such that the humidifier control system 50 can control a power delivered to the
  heater plate 74 and/or control a temperature set point of the heater plate 74. The humidifier
  control system 50 can determine an amount of power to deliver to the heater plate 74, or a
  heater plate set point, based at least in part on a flow condition, an operation mode, a flow
  reading, an outlet temperature reading, a heater plate sensor reading, or any combination of
  these or other factors.
          [0061]      The open surgery insufflation system 10 can include a conduit heating
  wire 86 configured to provide heat to the gases traveling along the patient conduit 54. Gases
 leaving the outlet 64 of the humidification chamber 62 can have a high relative humidity
 (e.g., about 100%). As the gases travel along the patient conduit 54 there is a chance that
 water vapor may condense on the conduit wall, reducing the water content of the gases. To
 reduce condensation of the gases within the conduit 54, the conduit heating wire 86 can be
 provided within, throughout, and/or around the patient conduit 54. Power can be supplied to
 the conduit heating wire 86 from the humidifier 30 and can be controlled through the
 humidifier control system 50. In some configurations, the heating wire 86 is configured to
maintain the temperature of the gas flowing through the patient conduit 54. In some
configurations, the conduit heating wire 86 can provide additional heating of the gas to
elevate the gases temperature to maintain the humidity generated by the heated water bath in
the humidifier 30.
         10062]      Figure 2 also illustrates an example of an outlet 32, which can be in the
form of a surgical site insufflation gas interface 32 for delivering the preferably warmed and
humidified flow of insufflation gas from the patient conduit 54 to the surgical site (e.g.,
surgical cavity 92). The gas interface 32 can be of any suitable arrangement for delivering a
flow of insufflation gas at a sufficient flow rate to create at least a partial protective
environment or insufflation gas environment 94 near, at or within the surgical cavity 92. In
some configurations, the gas interface 32 (in combination with a suitable gas source 14 and
optional humidifier 30) can deliver a sufficient amount of insufflation gas to maintain an

WO 2014/065678                                                              PCT/NZ2013/000192
  insufflation gas concentration (e.g., C02 concentration) of at least about 80%, or at least
  about 90%, within a substantial portion or an entirety of the surgical cavity 92. In some
  configurations, the gas interface 32 can deliver a sufficient amount of insufflation gas to
  maintain an insufflation gas concentration of between about 80% and about 99%, or between
  about 90% and about 99%, within a substantial portion or an entirety of the surgical cavity
  92. In some configurations, the gas interface 32 (in combination with a suitable gas source
  14 and optional humidifier 30) can deliver up to about 25 L/min. In some configurations, the
  gas interface 32 can deliver between about 1-2 L/min and about 25 L/min.                  In some
  configurations, the gas interface 32 can deliver between about 5 L/min and about 15 L/min,
 or between about 8 L/min to about 12 L/min. In some configurations, the gas interface 32
 can deliver about 10 L/min.
          [0063]      Preferably, the gas interface 32 can deliver the insufflation gas in a manner
 that minimizes or eliminates any deleterious effects on the surrounding tissue. That is,
 preferably the gas interface 32 does not provide a jet of insufflation gas, but disperses the
 insufflation gas over a larger area or through multiple outlets or ports and, in at least some
 cases, avoids creating turbulence. In some configurations, the gas interface comprises a gas
 diffuser 96 for dispersing the insufflation gas from the system 10 in a diffused manner. The
 gas diffuser 96 can be of any suitable arrangement. In some configurations, the gas diffuser
 96 is coupled to the patient conduit 54 by a conduit or tube 100. The tube 100 preferably is
 secured to the patient conduit 54 by a suitable connector 102, such as a luer lock connector.
         10064]      In some configurations, the gas diffuser 96 comprises a porous body,
which includes a large number of ports, flow paths or cavities that permit the insufflation gas
to pass from the tube 100 to the atmosphere outside of the gas diffuser 96. The flow paths or
cavities can be inherent in the material(s) used to construct the gas diffuser 96 or can be
created within a base material(s). In some configurations, the gas diffuser 96 is constructed
from a porous material, such as foam or foam-like material or sponge or sponge-like material.
In some configurations, the gas diffuser 96 can be constructed from a hydrophobic material.
Suitable gas diffusers 96 are marketed by Cardia Innovation AB of Stockholm, Sweden (the
Vita diffuser) and Temed of Bosham, England. Examples of gas diffuser are disclosed in
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,494,858 and 6,994,685, the entireties of which are incorporated by

  reference herein. Other suitable gas diffusers 96 could also be used, such as perforated tubes
  or catheters or other perforated dispensers, for example and without limitation.
           [00651     In some configurations, the tube 100 can include features to inhibit or
 prevent accidental occlusion, such as internal support ribs, for example.                In some
  configurations, the tube 100 can be deformable and can be configured to hold its shape once
  deformed. For example, one or more of the internal ribs, a wall of the tube 100 or another
 portion of the tube could incorporated a malleable material that would hold the tube 100 in a
 desired shape once deformed. Thus, the tube 100 could be bent to allow the gas diffuser 96
 to be positioned within the surgical cavity 92 and a portion of the tube 100 to be placed in
 contact with the patient 12 at a location adjacent to the surgical cavity 92. If desired, the tube
  100 can be secured in place.
          [0066]     As described above, the open surgery insufflation system 10 preferably
 includes a pressure relief arrangement, which can be a pressure relief valve 40. The pressure
 relief valve 40 can relieve or vent pressure from within the system 10 if the system pressure
 reaches or exceeds a threshold pressure. The system 10 could reach or exceed the threshold
pressure as a result of the partial or complete occlusion of a passage within the system 10,
 such as within the supply conduit 52, patient conduit 54, tube 100 or gas diffuser 96, for
 example and without limitation.       The pressure relief valve 40 can be positioned at any
 suitable location within the system 10. In some configurations, the pressure relief valve 40 is
located in a non-sterile portion of the open surgery insufflation system 10 when the system 10
is in normal use under normal circumstances. For example, a portion of the system 10 from
the gas source 14 up to and including the humidifier 30 can be non-sterile in normal use. A
sterile portion of the system 10 can include the gas diffuser 96, tube 100 and connector 102,
which can be an integrated assembly in some cases. The patient conduit 54 can be sterile,
non-sterile or can have portions that are within the sterile field and portions that are within
the non-sterile field.
         [0067]      Positioning the pressure relief valve 40 in the non-sterile field or within a
non-sterile area is advantageous because the pressure relief valve 40 can be re-used. In some
configurations, as illustrated in Figure 2, the pressure relief valve 40 can be positioned
upstream of the humidifier 30 relative to a direction of the gas flow. In some configurations,

    along or integrated into the supply conduit 52. For example, the pressure relief

    be coupled to a pair of conduit portions of the supply conduit 52 by a tee connection,

    an NPT threaded 1/4 inch tee connection, for example and without limitation.

   system 10, temporary or permanent, can cause an interruption or cessation of the insufflation
   therapy, which is undesirable at the least.
            [0071]    It has been discovered that some causes for occlusion of the system 10
   include, for example and without limitation, manipulation of the gas diffuser 96
                                                                                               (e.g.,
   depression of the diffuser material during placement or to evacuate fluid build-up

  diffuser 96 in fluid, and the gas diffuser 96 being adjacent to or surrounded by an object that
  partially or completely blocks flow, such as a semi-solid or a solid
                                                                            material (e.g., gauze,
  organs), for example and without limitation. In some cases, these actions or activities result
  in modest increases of the system pressure that do not pose a significant risk of damage
                                                                                                   or
  interruption of the insufflation therapy. However, in some cases, such actions or activities
  could result in significant increases in system pressure that could create a significant
                                                                                            risk of
 damage or interruption of the insufflation therapy.
           [00721     The present inventor has investigated the system pressure increases caused
 by these and similar actions or activities, as well as the system pressures that could cause
 damage to the system 10. For example, the connection strength of the various connections
 between components and conduits of the system 10 was evaluated. As a result,
                                                                                            it was
 determined that a preferred pressure relief valve 40 should open or vent system pressure at
                                                                                                   a
 threshold pressure of no more than about 83 kPa (12 pounds per square inch (psi)). In
                                                                                              some
configurations, it is preferable for the threshold pressure for opening or venting of
                                                                                                 the
pressure relief valve 40 to be no more than about 65.5 kPa (9.5 psi). In some configurations,
it is desirable for the threshold pressure for opening or venting of the pressure relief valve

    determined to be suitable to reduce or eliminate the risk of damage to the system 10

    interruption of the insufflation therapy.
             100731     In some configurations, it is desirable to avoid opening or venting the
   pressure relief valve 40 in response to elevations in system pressure that are not likely to be
   harmful to components of the system 10. Thus, in some configurations, it is desirable to
   configure the pressure relief valve 40 to remain closed or not vent in response to system
   pressure lower than about 14 kPa (2 psi). In some configurations, it is desirable to configure
   the pressure relief valve 40 to remain closed or not vent in response to system pressure lower
   than about 24 kPa (3.5 psi). Thus, in some configurations, it is desirable to configure the
  pressure relief valve 40 to have an opening or venting threshold pressure of between about
                                                                                                  14
  kPa (2 psi) to about 83 kPa (12 psi), or between about 14 kPa (2 psi) to about 34.5 kPa
                                                                                                  (5
  psi). In other configurations, it is desirable to configure the pressure relief valve 40 to
                                                                                              have
  an opening or venting threshold pressure of between about 21 kPa (3 psi) to about 83 kPa (12
  psi), or between about 21 kPa (3 psi) to about 65.5 kPa (9.5 psi). Any values or ranges within
  the above-recited ranges are also contemplated.            In other configurations, or other
  applications, the pressure relief valve 40 may be configured to have
                                                                              a higher activation,
  opening or venting pressure threshold. In some configurations, the pressure threshold of
                                                                                                the
 pressure relief valve 40 is fixed and/or preset. In other configurations, the pressure threshold
  could be adjustable, such as adjustable within one or more of the ranges identified herein.
            [00741    With additional reference to Figures 4a and 4b, the pressure relief valve 40
 may be provided with a protective shroud 110 which at least partially encloses the pressure
 relief valve 40 so that the valve 40 is protected from detritus, such as dust, settling on it.
 Without the shroud 110, the valve 40, when it triggers, might blast any dust from the valve 40
 into the room, which is not desirable in a surgical environment. The shroud 110 also helps
                                                                                                 to
prevent any unintentional disconnection of the pressure relief valve 40.
           [0075]     Figure 4a shows an example pressure relief valve 40, without the shroud
 110 attached. In Figure 4b, the pressure relief valve 40 has been substantially encased in
                                                                                               the
shroud 110. The shroud 110 in this example substantially covers the length of the pressure
relief valve 40, but has a gap 112 at one end to allow the gas to escape when the
                                                                                         pressure
relief valve 40 triggers. In this example, the shroud 110 comprises an open ended cylindrical
