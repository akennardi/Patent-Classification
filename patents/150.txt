   Field of the Invention
                  The present invention relates to a gaming system and
20 to a method of gaming, and, particularly, but not
   exclusively, to a gaming system and a method of gaming in
   which a game is played which may achieve a jackpot
   outcome.
25 Background of the Invention
                  It is know to provide a gaming system which comprises
   a game controller arranged to randomly display several
   symbols from a predetermined set of symbols and to
   determine a game outcome such as a game win based on the
30 displayed symbols.                      Such gaming systems may commonly be
   implemented as a stepping machine provided with reels with
   each reel carrying several symbols of the set, or a video
   machine wherein selected symbols are displayed on virtual
   reels on a graphical display device.                      Win outcomes can
35 occur based on symbols appearing in one or more horizontal
   lines, diagonal lines, or any other predetermined way.

                                                  - 2
                  Gaming systems are known which implement jackpot
   outcomes.                     A jackpot outcome may depend on a particular
   combination of symbols being selected in a base game.
   Alternatively, a jackpot outcome may depend on a random
 5 factor, such as a predetermined amount of turnover.                         Such
   a jackpot is termed a "mystery" jackpot                       (because the event
   which triggers the jackpot -                     in this case the amount of
   turnover of the system -                    is not known to the player).
   Both mystery and conventional jackpot games may be
10 progressive-type jackpots                     (the jackpot increasing as the
   gaming system is played - in one example in proportion to
   the amount of turnover of the system).                       Gaming systems may
   be linked so that more than one gaming system (for example
   more than one electronic gaming machine,                       (EGM) may
15 contribute to a progressive jackpot, enabling a large
   jackpot prize to be offered.                       Such jackpots are known as
   linked progressive jackpots.
                  Jackpots are generally triggered by a particular
   event occurring in the game played by the gaming system
20  (e.g. a particular symbol combination) or a particular
   event being generated by the gaming system                       (the gaming
   system "clicking over" a turnover amount).                        In either
   case, as far as the gaming system is concerned the jackpot
   trigger is invariable.                     It is either triggered by a
25 predetermined and unchangeable symbol combination, or by
   an event which the gaming machine has no control over
    (generation of turnover causing the jackpot controller to
   determine that a jackpot has occurred),                      or other
   predetermined outcome.
30                While such gaming systems provide users with
   enjoyment, a need exists for alternative gaming systems in
   order to maintain or increase player enjoyment.

   Summary of the Invention
                  In accordance with a first aspect, the present
   invention provides a gaming system, comprising a game
   controller arranged to control play of a game and to
 5 determine a game outcome, the game controller being
   arranged to perform a test to determine whether at least
   one of a plurality of separate jackpot outcomes is
   achieved when a jackpot trigger condition is satisfied by
   the game outcome, the game controller being arranged to
10 receive jackpot trigger condition instructions from a
   jackpot controller, setting the jackpot trigger condition,
   wherein the test comprises comparing a set of first
   integers generated during a series of game outcomes from
   the play of the game with a set of second integers
15 generated by the jackpot controller prior to the play of
   the game to determine a number of the first integers
   contained within the second integers, wherein the gaming
   system uses the number of first integers to select one of
   the plurality of separate jackpot outcomes.
20                An advantage of at least an embodiment of the
   invention is that the jackpot trigger condition is
   selectable.                        A new jackpot trigger condition can be set
   for the gaming system, for example, usually by the jackpot
   controller.                        For example, in a reel game which implements
25 a version of poker, a jackpot trigger condition may be
   that five Aces be displayed on a line on five reels.
   Conventionally, this jackpot trigger condition would be
   invariable for a gaming system.                         In this embodiment of the
   invention, however, the jackpot trigger condition can be
30 varied by providing new jackpot trigger condition
   instructions to the gaming system.                         For example, a
   decision may be made to change the five Aces jackpot
   trigger conditions to one requiring five Kings as a
   jackpot trigger condition.                         Any other jackpot trigger
35 condition may be implemented.                         This advantageously
   increases game variety and player interest.                         In an
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

   embodiment, the jackpot trigger condition may only be
   changed when a jackpot outcome has been achieved by the
   gaming system.
                  In an embodiment, the jackpot controller may be
 5 remote from the gaming system and may communicate the
   jackpot trigger condition instructions to the gaming
   system over a communications network.                        In an embodiment, a
   plurality of gaming systems may be linked to the jackpot
   controller and each may be arranged to receive trigger
10 condition instructions from the jackpot controller.                         In an
   embodiment, a linked progressive jackpot with selectable
   jackpot trigger conditions may be implemented.
                  In an embodiment, the jackpot trigger condition
   instructions may set a plurality of jackpot trigger
15 conditions.                        In an embodiment, the plurality of jackpot
   trigger conditions may enable multiple jackpots of varying
   values to be triggered.                        In an embodiment, the plurality
   of jackpot trigger conditions may enable a single jackpot
   to be triggered by a plurality of game outcomes.
20                In an embodiment, the gaming system may include a
   display displaying the jackpot trigger condition
   information for view by players, such as, for example, the
   combination of symbols or other game outcome that will
   achieve a jackpot outcome.                        In an embodiment, where a
25 linked jackpot is implemented, the display may be a
   display common to a number of associated gaming systems,
   such as associated EGMs.
                  Keno is a game where a player chooses a subset of
   numbers, typically six to twenty numbers, in a given range
30  (typically 1 to 80),                      then a gaming system chooses twenty
   numbers in the same range.                        A player may win a prize
   according to how many numbers are matched between the two
   selections, and also on the size of the player selection
    (which governs the odds and therefore can govern the
35 magnitude of the prize awarded).
                  Bingo is a game of chance where randomly-selected
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                    -  5
   numbers are drawn and players must match those numbers to
   numbers appearing in rows and columns on a "card".                          Cards
   may be electronically or physically represented.
                  An advantage of an embodiment of the present
 5 invention is that Keno or Bingo-type games may be
   implemented utilising the selectable jackpot trigger
   facility.                     In an embodiment, the jackpot trigger condition
   instructions may set a jackpot trigger condition which
   includes a plurality of symbols                        (number or letters).   The
10 gaming system may play a game which may generate numbers
   or letters.                        Matching the generated numbers or letters
   with those set by the jackpot trigger condition may result
   in a jackpot.                        This may be applied in a similar fashion to
   a Keno or Bingo-type game.                         The gaming system may generate
15 the numbers or letters                       for this type of game either as a
   base game or as part of a feature game which may be
   associated with or triggered by the base game.
                  In an embodiment, a display may be provided and the
   gaming system may be arranged to display jackpot trigger
20 condition information which gives information on the
   progress of achieving a trigger condition outcome.                          Where
   a game is implemented which matches numbers or other
   symbols generated by the gaming system with a set of
   numbers provided as a trigger condition by the jackpot
25 controller                     (such as a Keno or Bingo-type game),    the
   display may display the numbers achieved so far which
   match the numbers provided by the trigger condition
   instructions.
                  In accordance with a second aspect of the gaming
30 system, the present invention provides a gaming
   arrangement, comprising a plurality of gaming systems in
   accordance with the first aspect of the invention, each
   being arranged to receive jackpot trigger condition
   instructions from a common jackpot controller.

30 Detailed Description of Embodiments
                  Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a schematic
   diagram illustrating a gaming system 1 in accordance with
   an embodiment of the present invention.                      The gaming system
   1 includes a game controller 2 which, in this embodiment,
35 is arranged to control play of a game and to determine a
   game outcome.                      The game controller 2 is also arranged to
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                    - 9
   determine a jackpot outcome is achieved when a jackpot
   trigger condition is satisfied.                        The game controller 2 is
   arranged to receive jackpot trigger condition instructions
   from a jackpot controller 3, which in this example is
 5 remote from the gaming system 1.                        The jackpot trigger
   condition instructions set the jackpot trigger condition.
   The jackpot trigger condition is therefore selectable and
   may be changed, in this embodiment from the jackpot
   controller 3.
10                In this example, the game system 1 includes a player
   interface 4 via which a player may interact with the
   gaming system 1.                        The interface may include an arrangement
   via which a player may place a bet                        (e.g. a coin insert or
   card swipe),                       a display via which the player may follow
15 progress of the game and a player manipulatable interface
    (e.g. buttons) via which the player may interact with the
   game system 1.
                  In this embodiment, the jackpot game is a progressive
   jackpot.                   The jackpot controller 3 may be linked to other
20 gaming systems 1A, 1B                       (and there may be more gaming
   systems than shown) and the jackpot may be a linked
   progressive jackpot.                        The jackpot controller 3 may provide
   jackpot trigger condition instructions to all the gaming
   systems that are linked to it.
25                In the above embodiment the jackpot controller 3 is
   separate and linked via network communications to the
   gaming systems 1, which in an embodiment may be
   implemented as stand alone Electronic Gaming Machines
    (EGMs).
30                In an alternative embodiment, the gaming system may
   be a stand alone machine incorporating the jackpot
   controller as part of the gaming system.
                  The system is not limited to the above architectures
   and other architectures may be implemented.
35                The gaming system may take a number of forms.
                  In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                - 10
   provided wherein all or most components required for
   implementing the game are present in a player operable
   gaming machine.                    The jackpot controller may be implemented
   in the stand alone gaming machine or may be remote from
 5 it.
                  In a second form, a distributed architecture is
   provided wherein some of the components required for
   implementing the game are present in a player operable
   gaming machine and some of the components required for
10 implementing the game are located remotely relative to the
   gaming machine.                    For example, a "thick client"
   architecture may be used wherein part of the game is
   executed on a player operable gaming machine and part of
   the game is executed remotely, such as by a gaming server;
15 or a "thin client" architecture may be used wherein most
   of the game is executed remotely such as by a gaming
   server and a player operable gaming machine is used only
   to display audible and/or visible gaming information to
   the player and receive gaming inputs from the player.
20                However, it will be understood that other
   arrangements are envisaged.                     For example, an architecture
   may be provided wherein a gaming machine is networked to a
   gaming server and the respective functions of the gaming
   machine and the gaming server are selectively modifiable.
25 For example, the gaming system may operate in stand alone
   gaming machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client"
   mode depending on the game being played, operating
   conditions, and so on. Other variations will be apparent
   to persons skilled in the art.
30                Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50                    (equivalent to 4 of
   Figure 1) and a game controller 60                    (equivalent to 2 of

   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
                  Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
 5 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54 and a game
   play mechanism 56 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions.
                  The game controller 60 is in data communication with
10 the player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
15 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                       a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
20  (e.g.         a PC)            or a server.
                  A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 3. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which is
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
25 by a player.                       A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.                      The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
30 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.                        Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.             A reading device may also be provided for the
   purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
35 as part of a loyalty program.                        The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

   portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.
                  A top box 26 may carry artwork 28,         including for
   example pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
 5 information or images relating to the game.                    Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.                   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
10                The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   video display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.                  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
15 electromechanical device.                   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14,                  or of a different
   type.
                  Figure 4 shows a block diagram of operative
20 components of a typical gaming machine which may be the
   same as or different to the gaming machine of Figure 3.
                  The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.                  Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
25 which is in data communication with the processor 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
30                The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for
   purposes including ensuring regulatory compliance and
   monitoring player credit, an input/output                   (I/O) interface
   105 for communicating with peripheral devices of the
   gaming machine 100.                  The input/output interface 105 and/or
35 the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and

                                             - 13
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.                 A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
 5 reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
                  In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface
   120 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the
   game controller 101,                comprising one or more displays 106,
10 a touch screen 107,                a card and/or ticket reader 108, a
   printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism
   110 and a coin output mechanism 111.                  Additional hardware
   may be included as part of the gaming machine 100, or
   hardware may be omitted as required for the specific
15 implementation.
                  In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
20 to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
                  Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the main components
   of an exemplary memory 103.                  The memory 103 includes RAM
25 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                  The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                  The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.                  The mass storage device
30 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
                  It is also possible for the operative components of
35 the gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be

   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
                  Figure 6 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with
   an alternative embodiment.                        The gaming system 200 includes
   a network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet
 5 network.                   Gaming machines 202,       shown arranged in three
   banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are
   connected to the network 201.                         The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or
10 may have simplified functionality depending on the
   requirements for implementing game play.                         While banks 203
   of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks
   of one, three or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
                  One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
15 network 201.                       The displays 204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
20 promotional or informational material.
                  In a thick client embodiment, game server 205
   implements part of the game played by a player using a
   gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements
   part of the game. With this embodiment, as both the game
25 server and the gaming device implement part of the game,
   they collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.                         In this
30 embodiment, the jackpot server 207 implements jackpot
   controller and enables players to participate in a jackpot
   game.
                  In a thin client embodiment, game server 205
   implements most or all of the game played by a player
35 using a gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202
   essentially provides only the player interface.                         With this
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                             - 15
   embodiment, the game server 205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will receive player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
 5 machine for display.                 In a thin client embodiment, the
   gaming machines could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs
   running software that provides a player interface operable
   using standard computer input and output components.
                  Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
10 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.                  An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
15 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
                  The gaming network 200 may communicate with other
   gaming systems, other local networks, for example a
   corporate network, and/or a wide area network such as the
   Internet, for example through a firewall 211.
20                Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.                  For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
25 separate server may be provided.                  For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.                 Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
30 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
                  Referring to Figure 6, functionality of embodiments
   of the present invention may be implemented by a game
35 controller 2 having the functional components illustrated.
   In these embodiments, the functional components are
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                   - 16
   implemented utilising a processor and memory                       (such as
   processor 102 and memory 103 in Figure 4, or processor 62
   and memory 64 in Figure 2 or the game server 205 of Figure
   6) and associated programming.                       Other implementations are
 5 envisaged.                       For example, the functional blocks of Figure 6
   may be implemented in hardware of separate units, or a
   combination of hardware and software as separate units.
   Any practical implementation of these functional units may
   be employed.
10                Referring to Figure 6, the game controller 2 includes
   a symbol selector 301 which is arranged to select a
   plurality of symbols from a set of symbols in order to
   play a game.                       In the normal course of a game, these
   symbols are displayed on the display (54 of Figure 2, 16
15 of Figure 3, 106 of Figure 4, 204 of Figure 6).                        The
   selected symbols in this embodiment are displayed as a
   plurality of virtual reels on the video display.
   Alternatively, the display may comprise a stepper motor
   and physical reels.
20                The game controller 2 also includes an outcome
   generator 302 which is arranged to determine the outcome
   of a game.                       In this embodiment, the outcome of the game
   depends on the selected symbols and may include a win
   outcome, jackpot game outcome and a feature outcome.
25 Outcomes may be determined on the basis of symbols
   appearing in one or more horizontal lines, diagonal lines,
   or any other predetermined combination.
                  In this embodiment, the game controller 2 is arranged
   to receive jackpot trigger condition instructions from a
30 jackpot controller 303.                       As discussed previously, the
   jackpot controller 303 may be internal to a standalone EGM
   or may be remote from the game controller 2.                        The jackpot
   trigger condition instructions set the jackpot trigger
   condition. In this embodiment, the jackpot trigger
35 condition may be a predetermined combination of symbols to
   be selected by the symbol selector 301.                       If those symbols
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                   - 17
   are selected, the outcome generator generates a jackpot
   game outcome and a jackpot trigger is generated by the
   game controller 2 and provided to the jackpot controller
   303.           The player wins a jackpot.
 5                After a jackpot is won, the jackpot controller 303
   may provide further jackpot instructions to the game
   controller 2 which may vary the symbols that may result in
   a jackpot game outcome.                       For example, a preceding jackpot
   game outcome may have required five Aces on a five reel
10 row, and a succeeding jackpot game outcome may be
   triggered by a jackpot condition requiring five Kings in a
   row.
                  Note that the symbol selector and the outcome
   generator may be implemented by a process which involves
15 picking stopping positions of the reels                        (symbol selection)
   and subsequently spinning the reels to stop at particular
   stopping positions and then subsequently searching a pay
   table to determine a outcome                       (outcome generator).
                  In any event, the game outcome is determined by the
20 outcome generator based on a combination of symbols
   selected and appearing in the display.                        The symbols may be
   any symbols.                       As will be appreciated, many different types
   of symbols are used in gaming systems.                        A set of symbols
   may include standard symbols and function symbols.                         For
25 example, standard symbols may resemble fruit such as
   apples, pears and bananas with a win outcome being
   determined when a predetermined number of the same fruit
   appear on a display in the same line, scattered, and so
   on.
30                In the above example, the base game may trigger a
   jackpot.                   In an alternative embodiment, the jackpot may be
   triggered by a feature game.                        The feature game my comprise
   numbers or other symbols generated by the base game which
   are matched against other numbers.                        The other numbers are
35 downloaded by the jackpot controller as the jackpot
   trigger condition.                       One implementation is a variation of
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                    - 18
   keno.
                  In this game, the jackpot controller 303 first
   selects twenty unique numbers in the range 1 to 80.                         It
   sends them to a display associated with the gaming system
 5 and to each connected gaming machine                        (where the game
   system is implemented as a plurality of connected EGMs
   attached to the jackpot controller) for display.                         These
   twenty selected numbers comprise the jackpot trigger
   condition.                       It will be appreciated that the numbers may be
10 different symbols and there may be different ranges and
   amounts of numbers                       (not limited to 1-80).
                  During the course of a base game, players are awarded
   numbers in the range of 1 to 80.                        These numbers are
   displayed to the player of the gaming system.                         When all
15 the selected numbers e.g. say ten numbers match ten of the
   twenty of the jackpot trigger condition, the gaming
   machine determines that a win has occurred and triggers
   the jackpot.
                  As discussed above the jackpot controller 303 may
20 have multiple levels of jackpot, in which case matching
   ten of the numbers will trigger a win of jackpot level 1,
   matching nine of twenty will trigger a win of level 2, etc
   for as many levels of jackpot as required.                         Again, the
   amount of numbers selected by the base game and the amount
25 to match up games is a matter of choice of the game
   designer.
                  Multiple sets of trigger conditions may be used, one
   for each jackpot level.                        The jackpot controller may select
   a first set of twenty numbers from 80 and the second set
30 of twenty numbers from 60 and a third set of twenty from
   40.          Each selection has different odds of triggering a
   jackpot win.
                  Keno numbers may be selected by the game controller
   in many different ways.
35                1. A feature game may select all numbers during the
   course of a single feature.
   10162964 1 (GHMatters) P73804.AU.5

                                                    -  19
                  2. A series of free games may each select one Keno
   number, such that at the end of ten free games ten numbers
   have been selected.                        If the free game sequence retriggers
   more than ten Keno numbers are selected this subset of the
 5 numbers is used for a single Keno jackpot attempt, or all
   the Keno numbers are used for multiple jackpot entries.
                  3. The Keno numbers are selected over the course of a
   number of separate games.                         If a specific trigger occurs in
   the game one or more Keno numbers are generated.
10                The gaming machine Keno numbers may be unique                  (such
   that they do not repeat any of the previous nine numbers
   selected) or not.
                  Figure 8 is a flow diagram showing play of a game
   which may implement a Keno-type game played as a feature
15 of a base game.
                  At step 400, the player plays a base game on a gaming
   system in accordance with an embodiment of the present
   invention.                      The base game may result in a base game
   outcome 401 which may be a win, lose or other outcome,
20 including a feature outcome.                          If a feature outcome, the
   game feature generates one or more numbers                          (step 402).   If
   enough numbers have been generated                         (it may be one or more)
   the numbers are compared with a jackpot trigger condition
    (step 403).                       The jackpot trigger condition in this example
25 includes numbers which have been selected by a jackpot
   controller for matching against the numbers generated by
   the feature game.                        At step 404 it is determined whether or
   not a jackpot outcome is achieved.                          If not the game
   returns to step 402 for generation of a further number                           (if

   If a jackpot outcome is achieved, a jackpot trigger is
   provided to the jackpot controller                         (step 405).   The player
   wins a jackpot and the jackpot generates a further trigger
   condition for the gaming system (step 406).

   invention includes a variation of the game of Bingo.                            In
   this case a jackpot controller selects a predetermined
   number of numbers                        (e.g. 25)   to form a Bingo card, and
   these are distributed to connected EGMs as jackpot trigger
 5 conditions.                        Different Bingo cards     (e.g. different
   numbers) may be provided to each EGM, or each EGM may be
   provided with the same Bingo card.                           A game is played and
   results in the selection of numbers generated by the
   gaming system                        (randomly) which can be matched against the
10 Bingo card.                        When a winning pattern occurs the gaming
   machine triggers a jackpot win to the jackpot controller.
                  As discussed above, the jackpot may be a linked
   progressive jackpot, and in one embodiment the gaming
   system includes a plurality of EGMs that are connected to
15 a jackpot controller.
                  Many other types of games may be played with
   selectable jackpot trigger conditions, using any symbols
    (e.g. Poker, fruits, letters etc).
                  The jackpot controller and remote gaming machine
20  (where this is the implementation of the invention) in
   this embodiment should use the same trigger condition.
   There are various ways of ensuring this, including
   periodic broadcast of the trigger condition instruction,
   the gaming machine not taking part in the jackpot until it
25 has successfully communicated with jackpot controller,
   each message between the jackpot controller and gaming
   machine containing the code distinguishing one set of
   jackpot trigger condition instructions from another.
                  The trigger condition instructions may be implemented
30 in many ways.                        As discussed above it may be symbols or
   numbers to be matched, or a programme that is executed to
   determine if the trigger occurs.                           Using Microsoft.NET m for
   example.
                  There may be more than one game representation for
35 each trigger condition, so that apparently different games
   can be connected to the same jackpot link.

                  In an embodiment, the gaming system may communicate
   its current status to a display controller controlling a
   display that shows progress towards a jackpot.                       In a Keno
   type game or Bingo-type game, for example, the display
 5 could show the numbers generated by the game so far,
   matched up with the numbers providing the jackpot trigger
   condition selected by the jackpot controller, to show the
   players progress in achieving the jackpot.
