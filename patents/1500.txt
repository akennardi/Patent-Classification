IMPROVED SURGICAL IMPLANT DEVICES AND METHODS FOR THEIR
MANUFACTURE AND USE
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed on <removed-date>, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] The present invention relates to the field of surgical implant devices and methods for
their manufacture and use. Among the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are
improvements in sealing and retention medical devices particularly applicable to vascular
surgery and the treatment of aneurysms or other luminal defects in other anatomic conduits,
such as sealing and retention of replacement heart valves.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Medical and surgical implants are placed often in anatomic spaces where it is desirable
for the implant to conform to the unique anatomy of the targeted anatomic space and secure a
seal therein, preferably without disturbing or distorting the unique anatomy of that targeted
anatomic space.
[0004] While the lumens of most hollow anatomic spaces are ideally circular, in fact, the cross
sectional configurations of most anatomic spaces are, at best, ovoid, and may be highly
irregular. Such lumenal irregularity may be due to anatomic variations and/or to pathologic
conditions that may change the shape and topography of the lumen and its associated anatomic
wall. Examples of anatomic spaces where such implants may be deployed include, but are not
limited to, blood vessels, the heart, other vascular structures, vascular defects (such as thoracic
and abdominal aortic aneurysms), the trachea, the oropharynx, the esophagus, the stomach, the
duodenum, the ileum, the jejunum, the colon, the rectum, ureters, urethras, fallopian tubes,
biliary ducts, pancreatic ducts, or other anatomic structures containing a lumen used for the
transport of gases, blood, or other liquids or liquid suspensions within a mammalian body.

                                                   2
[0005] For a patient to be a candidate for existing endograft methods and technologies, to permit
an adequate seal, a proximal neck of, ideally, at least 12 mm of normal aorta must exist
downstream of the left subclavian artery for thoracic aortic aneurysms or between the origin of
the most inferior renal artery and the origin of the aneurysm in the case of abdominal
aneurysms. Similarly, ideally, at least 12 mm of normal vessel must exist distal to the distal
extent of the aneurysm for an adequate seal to be achieved.
[0006] Migration of existing endografts has also been a significant clinical problem, potentially
causing leakage and profusion of aneurysms and/or compromising necessary vascular supplies
to arteries such as the carotid, subclavian, renal, or internal iliac vessels. This problem only has
been addressed partially by some existing endograft designs, in which barbs or hooks have been
incorporated to help retain the endograft at its intended site. However, most existing endograft
designs are solely dependent on radial force applied by varying length of stent material to secure
a seal against the recipient vessel walls.
[0007] Because of the limitations imposed by existing vascular endograft devices and
endovascular techniques, a significant number of abdominal and thoracic aneurysms repaired in
the U.S. are still managed though open vascular surgery, instead of the lower morbidity of the
endovascular approach.
[0008] Pre-sizing is required currently in all prior art endografts. Such pre-sizing based on
CAT-scan measurements is a significant problem. This leads, many times, to mis-sized grafts.
In such situations, more grafts segments are required to be placed, can require emergency open
surgery, and can lead to an unstable seal and/or migration. Currently there exists no endograft
that can be fully repositioned after deployment.
[0009] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one of more of the above disadvantages.
SUMMARY
[0010] There is disclosed herein surgical implant devices and methods for their manufacture and
use and methods of this general type and that may at least increase the ability of such an implant
to be precisely positioned and sealed, with better in situ accommodation to the local anatomy of
the targeted anatomic site. There is also disclosed herein an adjustment tool that may at least
remotely actuate an adjustment member(s) that causes a configuration change of a portion(s) of

                                                    3
an implant, which configuration change includes but is not limited to diameter, perimeter, shape,
and/or geometry or a combination of these, to create a seal and provide retention of an implant
to a specific area of a target vessel or structure.
[0011] In one aspect, the present invention provides an assembly, comprising:
         an implant body having a stent member and an adjustment member, wherein the stent
member is circumferentially expandable and contractible, the adjustment member is coupled to
the stent member, and actuating the adjustment member results in circumferential expansion or
contraction of the stent member; and
         a delivery apparatus having a rotatable shaft and a locking mechanism coupled to an end
portion of the shaft, wherein the shaft is configured to actuate the adjustment member of the
implant body upon rotation of the shaft, and the locking mechanism is configured to selectively
couple the shaft to the adjustment member of the implant body.
[0012] In another aspect, the present invention provides an assembly, comprising:
         a stent member, wherein the stent member is circumferentially expandable and
contractible;
         an adjustment member, wherein the adjustment member is coupled to the stent member
and configured for circumferentially expanding and contracting the stent member;
         a rotatable shaft; and
         a locking mechanism coupled to the shaft and movable between a lock configuration and
a release configuration,
         wherein the locking mechanism is configured to engage the adjustment member such
that axial movement of the shaft results in corresponding axial movement of the adjustment
member when locking mechanism is in the lock configuration, and
         wherein the locking mechanism is configured to disengage the adjustment member such
that the shaft can move axially relative to the adjustment member when the locking mechanism
is in the release configuration.
[0013] In another aspect, the present invention provides an assembly, comprising:
         a radially expandable and contractible stent member;
         an adjustment member coupled to the stent member and having a rotatable portion,
wherein rotating the rotatable member in a first direction relative to the stent member radially
expands the stent member, and rotating the rotatable member in a second direction relative to
the stent member radially contracts the stent member;

                                                   4
         a rotatable shaft; and
         a locking mechanism coupled to the shaft and configured to releasably couple the shaft
to the adjustment member of the implant body, wherein the locking mechanism includes a lock
configuration and a release configuration, wherein, in the lock configuration, axial movement of
the shaft results in corresponding axial movement of the adjustment member, and, in the release
configuration, the shaft can move axially relative to the adjustment member.
[0014] There is disclosed herein designs for endovascular implant grafts, and methods for their
use for the treatment of aortic aneurysms and other structural vascular defects. An endograft
system for placement in an anatomic structure or blood vessel is disclosed in which an endograft
implant comprises, for example, a non-elastic tubular implant body with at least an
accommodating proximal end. Accommodating, as used herein, is the ability to vary a
configuration in one or more ways, which can include elasticity, expansion, contraction, and
changes in geometry. Both or either of the proximal and distal ends in an implant may further
comprise one or more circumferential expandable salable collars and one or more expandable
sealing devices, capable of being expanded upon deployment to achieve the desired seal
between the collar and the vessel's inner wall. Exemplary embodiments of such devices can be
found in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 11/888,009, filed July 31, 2007, and
12/822,291, filed June 24, 2010, which applications have been incorporated herein in their
entireties. Further embodiments of endovascular implants may be provided with retractable
retention tines or other retention devices allowing an implant to be repositioned before final
deployment. In other embodiments, the implant can be repositioned after final deployment. An
endograft system may further comprise a delivery catheter with an operable tubular sheath
capable of housing a folded or compressed endograft implant prior to deployment and capable
of retracting or otherwise opening in at least its proximal end to allow implant deployment. The
sheath is sized and configured to allow its placement via a peripheral arteriotomy site, and is of
appropriate length to allow its advancement into the aortic valve annulus, ascending aorta, aortic
arch, and thoracic or abdominal aorta, as required for a specific application.
[0015] While some post-implantation remodeling of the aortic neck proximal to an endovascular
graft (endograft) has been reported, existing endograft technology does not allow for the
management of this condition without placement of an additional endograft sleeve to cover the
remodeled segment.

                                                 5
[0016] Exemplary endografts as described herein may at least allow for better accommodation
by the implant of the local anatomy, using a self-expandable or compressible gasket for the
sealing interface between the endograft collar and the recipient vessel's inner wall.
Furthermore, exemplary endografts as disclosed herein are provided with a controllably
releasable disconnect mechanism that allows remote removal of an adjustment tool and locking
of the retained salable mechanism after satisfactory positioning and sealing of the endograft. In
some exemplary embodiments, the controllably releasable disconnect mechanism may be
provided in a manner that allows post-implantation re-docking of an adjustment member to
permit post-implantation repositioning and/or resealing of an endograft subsequent to its initial
deployment.
[0017] In other exemplary applications disclosed herein, improved devices for sealing other
medical devices such as vascular cannulae may be provided. There is also disclosed herein
novel designs for vascular cannulae to be used when bi-caval cannulation of the heart is
indicated, eliminating the need to perform circumferential caval dissection and further reducing
the tissue trauma caused by prior art balloon or other bypass cannulae. While the vascular
cannulae are inserted and positioned by a surgeon in the standard fashion, the need for
circumferential dissection of the cavae and tourniquet placement may be obviated. After the
vascular cannulae are positioned and secured with purse string sutures, the surgeon deploys the
adjustable sealing devices of the cannulae by turning an adjustment tool or torque wire. Once
the sealing devices are deployed, all of the venous return is diverted. The sealing devices
deploy around the distal ends of the cannulae and allow blood to flow through the lumen of the
cannulae, but not around the sealing devices. Use of these cannulae minimizes the chance of
caval injury by eliminating the need for circumferential dissection. Additionally, the
configuration of the adjustable sealing device in relation to the cannula is such that the
adjustable sealing device is "flush" with the cannula so that no acute change in diameter exists
along the external surface of the cannula, which serves to avoid tissue trauma during insertion
and withdrawal into and out of bodily structures.
[0018] In various exemplary embodiments, the lumens are configured such that a cannula with
an adjustable sealing device can be deployed without compromising either the flow within the
principle lumen of the cannula or the seal between the cannula and the structure within which
the cannula lies. Moreover, a disclosed example of a cannula is provided with a trough within
the cannula body at its distal end in which the adjustable sealing device member lies such that,
when undeployed during insertion and withdrawal, there is a smooth interface between the

                                                  6
external cannula wall and the undeployed sealing device, allowing for smoother, easier, and
safer insertion and withdrawal.
[0019] Moreover, existing designs for balloon cannulae are unable to provide a truly
symmetrical placement of an inflated balloon around a central lumen of standard diameter. The
asymmetry that results with conventional balloon inflation is sufficient to displace the lumen
from the true center of the endovascular lumen in which the balloon cannula is placed, resulting
in unpredictable and suboptimal flow characteristics therethrough. The altered hemodynamics
of such flow with an existing balloon cannula increases the likelihood of intimal vascular injury
and clot or plaque embolization. Vascular cannulae disclosed herein may at least achieve the
surprising result of having the flow characteristics of a non-balloon cannula by maintaining the
preferred laminar flow characteristics of a circular main lumen of consistent diameter,
positioned and maintained in or near the center of vascular flow by an adjustable sealing device
originally provided within a recessed trough in the exterior wall of the cannula, with accessory
lumens contained within an externally circular cannular wall. This allows for better seal, less
vascular trauma, and easier vascular ingress and egress.
[0020] In addition, vascular cannulae may be provided with retractable stabilizing elements to
anchor the inflated balloon within a vessel lumen during use. Such stabilizing elements further
make use of the trough within the cannula body, with the stabilizing elements retracting into this
trough during insertion and removal, allowing for smooth and trauma-free entry and egress of
the cannula.
[0021] Certain embodiments are directed towards novel designs for salable endovascular
implant grafts, and methods for their use for the treatment of aortic aneurysms and other
structural vascular defects or for heart valve replacements. Various embodiments as
contemplated herein may include any combination of exemplary elements as disclosed herein or
in the co-pending patent applications referenced above.
[0022] In an exemplary embodiment, a salable vascular endograft system for placement in a
vascular defect is provided, comprising an elongated main implant delivery catheter with an
external end and an internal end for placement in a blood vessel with internal walls. In such an
exemplary embodiment, the main implant delivery catheter further comprises a main implant
delivery catheter sheath that may be openable or removable at the internal end and a main
implant delivery catheter lumen containing within a compressed or folded endovascular implant.

                                                  7
Further, in such an exemplary embodiment, an endovascular implant comprises a non-elastic
tubular implant body with an accommodating proximal end terminating in a proximal salable
circumferential collar that may be expanded by the operator to achieve a fluid-tight seal between
the proximal salable circumferential collar and the internal walls of the blood vessel proximal
to the vascular defect. Moreover, in such an exemplary embodiment, an endovascular implant
may further comprises a non-elastic tubular implant body with an accommodating distal end
terminating in a distal salable circumferential collar controlled by a distal variable sealing
device, which may be expanded by the operator to achieve a fluid-tight seal between the distal
salable circumferential collar and the internal walls of the blood vessel distal to the vascular
defect.
[0023] In a further exemplary embodiment, an implant interface is provided for a salable
attachment of an implant to a wall within the lumen of a blood vessel or other anatomic conduit.
[0024] In a yet further exemplary embodiment, an implant gasket interface is provided for a
salable attachment of an implant to a wall within the lumen of a blood vessel or other anatomic
conduit, wherein the salable attachment provides for auto-adjustment of the seal while
maintaining wall attachment to accommodate post-implantation wall remodeling.
[0025] Still other exemplary embodiments of endografts and endograft delivery systems serve
as universal endograft cuffs, being first placed to offer their advantageous anatomic
accommodation capabilities, and then serving as a recipient vessel for other endografts,
including conventional endografts.
[0026] Furthermore, exemplary embodiments of endografts and endograft delivery systems may
be provided with a mechanism to permit transfer of torque or other energy from a remote
operator to an adjustment member comprising a salable, adjustable circumferential assembly
controlled by an adjustment tool, which may be detachable therefrom and may further cause the
assembly to lock upon detachment of the tool. In some exemplary embodiments, the variable
sealing device may be provided with a re-docking element that may be recaptured by subsequent
operator interaction, allowing redocking and repositioning and/or resealing of the endograft at a
time after its initial deployment.
[0027] Moreover, the various exemplary embodiments as disclosed herein may constitute
complete endograft systems, or they may be used as components of a universal endograft system

                                                   8
as disclosed in co-pending patent applications that may allow the benefits of the present to be
combined with the ability to receive other endografts.
[0028] Finally, embodiments disclosed herein encompass salable devices that may be used in
other medical devices such as adjustable vascular cannulas or other medical or surgical devices
or implants, such as aortic valves.
[0029] Embodiments of a surgical implant including an implant body and a selectively
adjustable assembly attached to the implant body, having adjustable elements, and operable to
cause a configuration change in a portion of the implant body and, thereby, permit implantation
of the implant body within an anatomic orifice to effect a seal therein under normal
physiological conditions.
[0030] The preceding description is presented only as an exemplary application of the devices
and methods embodied herein.
[0031] Although various embodiments illustrated and described herein as embodied in surgical
implant devices and methods for their manufacture and use, it is, nevertheless, not intended to
be limited to the details shown because various modifications and structural changes may be
made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range
of equivalents of the claims. Additionally, well-known elements of exemplary embodiments
will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details.
[0032] Additional advantages and other features characteristic of embodiments will be set forth
in the detailed description that follows and may be apparent from the detailed description or may
be learned by practice of exemplary embodiments. Still other advantages may be realized by any
of the instrumentalities, methods, or combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.

[0074] Herein various embodiments of the present invention are described. In many of the
different embodiments, features are similar. Therefore, to avoid redundancy, repetitive

[0075] Described now are exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Referring now to
the figures of the drawings in detail and, first, particularly to FIG. 1 thereof, there is shown a
perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the proximal aspect of a salable endograft
system 1000 according to the present invention, in which the endograft is in a relatively
expanded form. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the embodiment of the proximal aspect of a
salable endograft system 1000 according to the present invention of FIG. 1, showing the
endograft in a relatively contracted form. This exemplary endograft system 1000 has the ability
to be selectively expanded and contracted to a diameter selected by the implanting physician. In
general, the endograft system 1000 has, along its intermediate extent and, possibly, also at its
distal portion (at the downstream end of the prosthesis), a relatively constant diameter portion.
At its proximal portion (at the upstream end of the prosthesis), the endograft system 1000 is able
to impart a configuration change to selectively adjustable portion of the implant. Features of the
inventive controllable endograft system 1000 are described in further detail in U.S. Patent
Application Serial Nos. 11/888,009, filed July 31, 2007, and 12/822,291, filed June 24, 2010,
which have been incorporated herein and detail of which is not replicated herein for the sake of
brevity.
[0076] The exemplary salable endograft system 1000 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 comprises a
hollow tubular endograft body 1005 having an accommodating proximal cuff 1010 and an

                                                 15
intermediate, substantially rigid, tubular member 1015. The distal end of such an endograft (not
shown in FIGS. 1 and 2) may be any or all of accommodating, elastic, rigid, stent-laden, or even
replicate the proximal end, depending upon the various exemplary embodiments according to
the present invention. A selectively adjustable circumferential assembly 1020 is disposed at the
proximal cuff 1010. Contained in one exemplary embodiment of the circumferential assembly
1020 is a circumferential channel enclosing an adjustment member 1025 (indicated only
diagrammatically with a solid line). The adjustment member 1025 causes the
expansion/contraction of the accommodating proximal cuff 1010 by looping around the
perimeter and by being lengthened or shortened, respectively. The adjustment member 1025,
for example, interacts with a control device 1030 that is operable to cause an increase or
decrease in the circumference of the circumferential loop 1025 by the application of rotational
torque to the distal aspect of an adjustment tool 1035 emerging from the control device 1030.
The adjustment member 1025 can be integral with the adjustment tool 1035 in an exemplary
embodiment of the circumferential assembly 1020, or can be removable as shown, for example,
in FIG. 10A.
[0077] Such an adjustment member 1025 may take many forms in the present invention. In one
exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, the adjustment member 1025 is a
micro-threaded cable that is fixed at one end to the control device 1030, which is in the form of
a microcylinder, and the adjustment tool 1035 threads through a threaded aspect of the
microcylinder 1030 in order to effect a change in the circumference of the proximal cuff 1010.
A forwardly imposed torque on the adjustment tool 1035 cause expansion of the adjustment tool
1035. Expansion of the adjustment member 1025 in its circumferential extent has the effect of
expanding the proximal aspect of the salable endograft system 1000 to allow for precise sealing
of the salable endograft system 1000 within a recipient blood vessel such as the aorta (not
shown in FIGS. 1 or 2). Conversely, reverse torque on the adjustment tool 1035 has the effect
of decreasing the circumference of the circumferential loop of the adjustment member 1025 and,
thus, contracting the proximal aspect of the salable endograft system 1000, allowing for re
positioning as needed. In FIGS. 1 and 2, the adjustment tool 1035 may extend distally through
the lumen of the salable endograft system 1000. Alternatively, the adjustment tool 1035 may
extend distally through a separate lumen provided in the salable endograft system 1000 (not
shown in FIGS. 1 or 2).
[0078] FIGS. 3 and 4A to 4C are perspective views of yet another exemplary embodiment of a
proximal aspect of a salable endograft system 1000 according to the present invention that

                                                   16
further incorporates a stent or lattice structure 1041 (which, in another embodiment, can be a
compressible foam gasket). The lattice structure 1041 is provided with a lattice interruption
1045 to allow for variations in the circumference of the proximal aspect of the endograft. This
lattice interruption 1045 may take the form of a V-shape as shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C or may
be otherwise configured. As in FIGS. 1 and 2, the salable endograft system 1000 of FIG. 3
also has an accommodating proximal cuff 1010 which encloses the terminal lattice structure
1040 as shown and also encloses an adjustment member 1025 that loops through a control
device 1030 that is provided to allow increase or decrease in the circumference of the, e.g.,
circumferential loop of the adjustment member 1025 by the application of rotational torque to
the distal aspect of the adjustment tool 1035 emerging from the control device 1030. The
progression of FIGS. 4A to 4C shows the endograft in a relatively contracted form in FIG. 4A,
in a partially expanded form in FIG. 4B, and in a fully expanded form in FIG. 4C. As the lattice
interruption 1045 is closed in FIGS. 3 and 44, it can be seen only in FIGS. 4B and 4C. One
exemplary configuration for the lattice interruption 1045 can be a woven material that is
stretched in the expanded state and attached to the lattice 1041 and, when allowed to reduce, the
woven material resist buckling. This configuration allows the diameter to increase beyond the
maximum diameter that the graft will allow with the stent alone.
[0079] FIG. 5A shows an exemplary embodiment of the control device 1030 in the form of a
microcylinder locking mechanism 1050. This locking mechanism 1050 is changed from a
locked state to an unlocked state by an adjustment tool 1060, which comprises a tool sheath
1062 having a keyed collar portion 1065. The adjustment tool 1060 is fixed, in both the
longitudinal and radial extents, to the remote adjustment tool 1035. The progression of FIGS.
5A to 5C show how the locking mechanism 1050 is changed from the locked state (in which
adjustment of the adjustment member 1025 is prohibited) to the unlocked state (in which
adjustment of the adjustment member 1025 is permitted), and, then, back to the locked state.
[0080] Before explaining the change between states, the configuration of an exemplary
embodiment of the locking mechanism 1050 is described further. The exterior of the locking
mechanism 1050 is comprised of a microcylinder 1052 having a set of circumferentially spaced
apart, interior striations 1055. The locking mechanism 1050 is longitudinally and rotationally
fixed to the proximal cuff 1010. A guide bullet 1070 is received within the hollow, internally
striated microcylinder 1052. The guide bullet 1070 has a longitudinal threaded bore that
received therein (in a threaded manner) the adjustment member 1025. The adjustment member
1025 completely traverses the bore of the guide bullet 1070 and terminates distally of the guide

                                                  17
bullet 1070 in a keyed block 1075 that is rotationally fixed to the adjustment member 1025. The
guide bullet 1070 has at least two opposing, flexible tines 1072 that extend radially outward, in a
natural state that, together, has a diameter greater than the internal diameter of the locking
microcylinder 1052 (the tines can, as well, be spring loaded outwardly). The tines 1072 have a
terminal portion that is shaped to fit within a corresponding shaped of each striation 1055 within
the microcylinder 1052. As such, when the tines 1072 are compressed and the guide bullet 1070
is placed within the microcylinder with the adjustment member 1025 threaded therewithin, the
tines 1072 press outwardly against the internal surface of the microcylinder 1052 and, when
appropriately rotated therein, the tines 1072 each lock within a respective opposing one of the
striations 1055. In such a state, the tines 1072 both form-fittingly and force-fittingly lock within
inner striations 1055 when unconstrained. If, for example, there were three tines 1072 separated
by 120 degrees each, then the tines 1072 would each lock within a respective one of the
striations 1055 that are, also, 120 degrees apart along the interior surface of the microcylinder
1052. The frictional force of the tines 1072 against the inside surface of the microcylinder 1052
is sufficiently strong to prevent longitudinal movement of the guide bullet 1070, even if the
keyed block 1075 is rotated unless the tines 1072 are removed from their locked position against
the interior surface of the microcylinder. In such a configuration, the microcylinder 1052 and
the guide bullet 1070 prevent rotation of the adjustment member 1025 without, not only a
particular external force applied thereto, but also a removal of the tines 1072 from the interior
surface of the microcylinder 1052.
[0081] Rotation of the adjustment member 1025, therefore, is carried out with the adjustment
tool 1060. The adjustment tool 1060 provides both the ability to rotate the keyed block 1075 but
also the ability to separate the tines 1072 from the interior surface of the microcylinder 1052.
To carry out these functions, the tool sheath 1062 has a sufficient cylindrical length to slide
between the tines 1072 and the interior surface of the microcylinder 1052 anywhere the tines
1072 are contacting the interior surface. As such, the longitudinal length of the tool sheath 1062
can be, but does not necessarily have to be, as long as the microcylinder 1052. FIG. 5A shows
the microcylinder 1052 with the guide bullet 1070 in a locked position, prior to interface by the
remote adjustment tool 1060. When the adjustment tool 1060 is slid into the microcylinder
1052, as shown in the progression of FIGS. 5A to 5B, the smooth interior surface of the tool
sheath 1062 first slides along the outer surface of the tines and, then, along and past the distal
ends of the tines 1072, at which time the tines 1072 no longer contact the interior surface of the
microcylinder 1052. The orientation of the microcylinder locking mechanism 1050 and the

                                                  18
adjustment tool 1060 in FIG. 5B now allows for repositioning of the adjustment member 1025
and relocation of the guide bullet 1070 within the microcylinder 1052.
[0082] The keyed collar portion 1065 has a distal taper 1067 that reduces the outer diameter of
the tool sheath 1062 inwards to such an extent that it acts as a funnel to direct the keyed block
1075 directly into the radial center of the keyed collar portion 1065. At the proximal-most end
of the collar portion 1065 is an internal key 1069 having an internal circumferential shape
corresponding to an external circumferential shape of the keyed block 1075. As such, when the
adjustment tool 1060 is inserted into the microcylinder 1052 and releases the tines 1072 from
the interior surface thereof, the tool sheath 1062 can pass the tines 1072 (wherever they may be
inside the microcylinder 1052) sufficiently far to permit the keyed block 1075 to slide along the
interior distal taper 1067 and press against the internal bore of the key 1069. With slight
rotation either way of the adjustment tool 1060 (by rotation of the adjustment tool 1035), the
keyed block 1075 will fall into the internal bore of the key 1069 in a form-fit, thereby enabling
rotation of the adjustment member 1025 (via keyed block 1075) in a corresponding manner to
any rotation of the adjustment tool 1035 by a user.
[0083] The locking mechanism 1050 is longitudinally and rotationally fixed to the
circumferential assembly 1020 such that rotation of the locking mechanism 1050 in a first
direction causes a contraction of the circumferential assembly 1020 and rotation of the locking
mechanism 1050 in the opposition direction causes an expansion of the circumferential
assembly 1020. As can be seen in FIGS. 5B and 5C, the keyed block 1075 is rotated to cause
the guide bullet 1070 to advance towards the keyed block 1075. FIG. 5C shows the
microcylinder locking mechanism 1050 with the adjustment tool 1060 after adjustment and
disengagement of the microcylinder locking mechanism 1050 by the adjustment tool 1060 with
a fixed repositioning of the guide bullet 1070 and a distal lengthening of the adjustment member
1025 with respect to the microcylinder 1052. As the final position of the keyed block 1075 is
further away from the microcylinder 1052, and because the microcylinder 1052 is fixed to the
control device 1030 of the circumferential assembly 1020, this exemplary movement of the
adjustment member 1025 indicates that the circumferential assembly 1020 has reduced in
diameter.
[0084] Various alternative embodiments of this locking mechanism are envisioned where a
number of the individual parts are fixed or moving with respect to other ones of the parts of the
circumferential assembly 1020, the control device 1030, the locking mechanism 1050, and/or

                                                    19
the adjustment tool 1060. In one alternative embodiment of the microcylinder locking
mechanism 1050, the collar portion 1065 of the remote adjustment tool 1060 can contains inner
striations (similar to or different from the striations 1055 of the microcylinder 1052) that allow it
to capture and turn the guide bullet 1070 through removable fixation of the tines 1072 therein
(see FIG. 6E). In such a configuration, the guide bullet 1070 can be fixed rotationally to the
adjustment member 1025.
[0085] The inner striations 1055 of the microcylinder 1052 may be grooves, threads, detents,
slots, or other surface features sufficient to allow capture of the tines 1072 upon their release as
shown in further detail, for example, in the cross-sections of FIGS. 6A to 6G. FIG. 6A is a
cross-section along section line A-A of the microcylinder 1052 and guide bullet 1070 of FIG.
5A, in which the tines 1072 having an exemplary triagonal cross-sectional shape are caught
within two striations 1055 having an exemplary rectangular cross-sectional shape. FIG. 6B is a
cross-section along section line B-B of the tool sheath 1062 of FIG. 5A and illustrates the
relatively smooth outer surface of the tool sheath 1062. FIG. 6C is a cross-section along section
line C-C of the microcylinder 1052 of FIG. 5B without the adjustment member 1025 depicted.
FIG. 6D is a cross-section along section line D-D of the microcylinder 1052, the guide bullet
1070, and the tool sheath 1062 of FIG. 5B, in which the tool sheath 1062 captures the guide
bullet 1070 and collapses the tines 1072, thereby removing the tines 1072 from the striations
1055 of the microcylinder 1052.
[0086] FIG. 6E shows a cross-sectional view of a variation of another exemplary embodiment
of the locking mechanism 1050' with the adjustment tool sheath 1062' also having striations
1055' with an exemplary rectangular cross-sectional shape. The tines 1072 are illustrated as
expanded within two opposing striations 1055' of the tool sheath 1062'. As the tool sheath
1062' has a smooth exterior, the tool sheath 1062' can rotate without friction within the
microcylinder 1052'.
[0087] FIGS. 6F and 6G show cross-sectional views of yet another variation of an exemplary
embodiment of the microcylinder locking mechanism 1050" and adjustment tool 1060". The
locking mechanism 1050" has a microcylinder 1052" with striations 1055" having an
exemplary triangular cross-sectional shape. The adjustment tool sheath 1062" has a smooth
exterior and interior to slide within the microcylinder 1052" and to slidably capture the tines
1072"', respectively. The tines 1072" are illustrated as expanded within two opposing

                                                20
triangular striations 1055" of the microcylinder 1052" in FIG. 6F and are captured within the
tool sheath 1062" in FIG. 6G.
[0088] FIGS. 7A and 7B show longitudinal cross-sectional details of one exemplary
embodiment of a locking mechanism 1110 for the adjustment tool 1035 according to the present
invention. FIG. 7A shows a locking mechanism 1110 comprising a controllable catch 1115 in a
disengaged stated. FIG. 6B shows the locking mechanism 1110 with the controllable catch
mechanism 1115 engaged. Once the adjustment member catch 1120 is within the target range
1117 of the locking mechanism, the user can engage a non-illustrated catch deployment device
to capture the adjustment member catch 1120.
[0089] FIGS. 8A to 8C show details of still another embodiment of a microcylinder locking
mechanism 1150 according to the present invention, in which internal locking tines 1152, 1154
of unequal length are employed to prevent back rotation from torque buildup upon detachment
of the remote adjustment tool 1060. FIG. 8A shows the locking mechanism 1150 comprised of
a microcylinder 1151 and a guide bullet 1153 with internal locking tines 1152, 1154 of unequal
length and an associated adjustment tool 1160 having a tool sheath 1164 prior to engagement of
the microcylinder locking mechanism 1150 by the tool sheath 1164. FIG. 8B shows the tool
sheath 1164 of FIG. 8A engaged with the microcylinder locking mechanism 1150 to deflect the
tines 1152, 1154 away from the interior surface of the microcylinder 1151. FIG. 8C shows the
microcylinder locking mechanism 1150 in a locking position different from FIG. 8A after
adjustment has occurred and the tool sheath 1164 has been disengaged from the microcylinder
1151.
[0090] FIGS. 9A and 9B show two aspects of details of sheathable retention tines 1130 and a
compressible foam sealing gasket 1140 for the proximal terminal aspect of some exemplary
embodiments of endografts according to the present invention. FIG. 9A is an axial cross section
showing sheathable retention tines 1130 sheathed by an expanded compressible foam gasket
1040 in an exemplary proximal aspect of a salable endograft system 1000 according to the
present invention. FIG. 9B is a perspective view showing sheathable retention tines 1130
exposed and deployed through the compressible foam sealing gasket 1140 disposed at an
expanded proximal cuff 1010 in an exemplary endograft according to the present invention. In
some exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the direct pressure of the adjustment
member 1025 on the footplate 1145 of the tines may be used to extend the sheathable tines 1130
through the compressible foam gasket 1040 and into the wall of a recipient blood vessel. In yet

                                                   21
other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, direct pressure of the adjustment
member 1025 may exert force on non-illustrated footplate bands that may be attached to or
adjacent the footplates 1145 of the tines 1130 and may be used to extend the sheathable tines
1130 through the compressible foam gasket 1040 and into the wall of a recipient blood vessel.
Such footplate bands may, themselves, be the base of the sheathable tines 1130 in certain
exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Not shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, the
adjustment member 1025 may course though eyelets, other brackets or may otherwise be
moveably connected to the footplates 1145 to maintain equal pressure and desired orientation
upon expansion of the adjustment member loop.
[0091] In the various embodiments of salable endograft systems according to the present
invention, the distal attachment of the endograft to the aortic wall distal to the aneurysm sac may
be accomplished in a conventional manner using an expandable lattice component at the distal
cuffs, or variations on the adjustable, salable mechanism disclosed herein may be employed to
secure distal seals. The distal seals are subject to lower pressure demands, and the anatomic
constraints of sufficient aortic neck distally are generally less problematic than for the proximal
seal.
[0092] FIGS. 10 to 13 provide anatomic views of another exemplary embodiment of an
endograft implant according to the present invention in which the implant is a universal
proximal cuff endovascular implant for treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Endografts
with the features shown in the various embodiments of the present invention have unique
abilities to accommodate to anatomic variations that would preclude or compromise use of
conventional endograft systems. The universal proximal cuff implants of the present invention
allow an operator to make use of their ability to securely seal and attach in anatomic sites where
conventional endografts cannot be securely placed, and then allow a conventional endograft to
securely dock with the universal proximal cuff endovascular implants distally.
[0093] Universal proximal cuff endovascular implants of the present invention may be provided
with any of the elements disclosed in the present and the incorporated co-pending applications
referenced herein. Such elements include, but are not limited to, attachment of radio-opaque
monitoring clip assemblies on the outer surfaces of endografts to allow post-implantation
monitoring of slippage or endoleak formation by plain radiographs, steerable delivery systems to
permit delivery and seal of an endograft in an anatomically angulated or irregular site, and/or
auto-accommodation for post-implantation aortic remodeling,

                                                 22
[0094] FIG. 1 OA is an axial cross-sectional view of an exemplary endovascular universal
interface cuff 1155 of the present invention to be implanted into an aorta having an aneurysm
sac 1170 and an aortic wall 1175. The universal endovascular interface cuff 1155 has been
positioned over an endovascular guidewire 1160 to a desired recipient site A-A' proximal to the
aortic aneurysm sac 1170. The endovascular universal interface cuff 1155 further comprises an
accommodating proximal cuff 1010 and a rigid distal cuff 1200. FIG. 1OB provides a transverse
cross-sectional view of the exemplary endovascular interface cuff 1155 of FIG. 1OA at the level
of A-A' in FIG. 10A. In FIGS. 1OA and 1OB, the compressible foam gasket 1140 is
uncompressed and, therefore, covers the retention tines 1165.
[0095] In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. lOB, the adjustment member 1025 courses
in a circumferential loop through eyelets 1180 attached to a series of compression footplates
1185. The compression footplates 1185, among other functions, serve to maintain an orientation
of the expanding circumferential loop 1035 in a plane transverse to the aortic lumen 1190, and
present a broader pressure contact with the underlying aortic wall 1175 when the circumferential
assembly is expanded. The compression footplates 1185 may abut, be attached to, or be
contiguous with the retention tines 1165, which are displaced through the compressed
compressible foam gasket 1140 and allowed to enter the aortic wall 1175 for overall device
stabilization and retention. While four retention tines 1165 and footplates 1185 are shown, this
embodiment is merely exemplary and can be any number.
[0096] FIG. 11 A shows the same axial cross-sectional view of the endovascular universal
interface cuff 1155 of FIG. 1OA but after the universal endovascular interface cuff 1155 has
expanded to achieve a seal in the aortic wall 1175. Due to the expansion of the cuff, the foam
gasket 1140 becomes compressed, allowing the retention tines 1165 to protrude radially outward
to engage the aortic wall 1175 in the desired recipient site A-A' proximal to the aortic aneurysm
sac 1170. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1 IB, the adjustment member 1025 has
expanded to move the eyelets 1180 attached to the footplates 1185 outwards. As is evident, the
interior lumen of the circumferential assembly 1020 shown in FIG. 11 B has increased
substantially as compared to the state shown in FIG. lOB. In FIG. 1 IB, the compression of the
foam gasket 1140 and the engagement of the aortic wall 1175 by the retention tines 1165 creates
a firm seal between the universal endovascular interface cuff 1155 and the aortic wall 1175.
[0097] FIG. 12 shows the same axial cross-sectional axial of the universal endovascular
interface cuff 1155 of the present invention as in FIGS. 1OA and 11 A but with delivery of a

                                                 23
conventional endograft 1300 into the aortic wall 1175, which endograft 1300 has been secured
within the rigid distal cuff 1200 of the universal endovascular interface cuff 1155. The
endograft 1300 can include an expandable lattice 1310. FIG. 13 shows the same cross-sectional
axial view of an exemplary universal endovascular interface cuff 1155 of the present invention
as FIG. 12 but after removal of the endovascular guidewire 1160 and detachment and removal
of the adjustment member 1025. Such removal and detachment can be carried out by a release
mechanism 1037. The distal attachment of the conventional endograft is not shown in FIGS. 12
and 13, but can be accomplished in the usual manner for conventional endograft implantation
sufficient to prevent backfill of the aneurysm sac 1170 from the distal aorta or the iliac vessels.
[0098] As shown in FIGS. 10A, 11 A, 12, and 13, the rigid distal cuff 1200 includes, at its
exterior, exemplary radio-opaque monitoring clip assemblies 1225 to allow post-implantation
monitoring of slippage or endoleak formation and/or auto-accommodation for post-implantation
aortic remodeling. Likewise, the rigid distal cuff 1200 can be provided with interior graft
retention tines 1227 that add to securing, without leaks, the endograft 1300 to the interior of the
rigid distal cuff 1200.
[0099] The tubular endograft body 1005, the proximal cuff 1010, the rigid distal cuffs 1200, and
the endograft body 1300 as described herein may be constructed of solid, woven, non-woven, or
mesh materials such as, but not limited to, natural or synthetic rubbers, nylon, GORE-TEX@,
elastomers, polyisoprenes, polyphosphazenes, polyurethanes, vinyl plastisols, acrylic polyesters,
polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyurethane interpolymers, butadiene rubbers, styrene-butadiene rubbers,
rubber lattices, DACRON@, PTFE, malleable metals, other biologically compatible materials or
a combination of such biologically compatible materials in a molded, woven, or non-woven
configuration, coated, non-coated, and other polymers or materials with suitable resilience and
pliability qualities. In certain exemplary embodiments according to the present invention, it is
desirable for the non-elastic tubular member 1015 and corresponding structures to be pliable to
allow for folding or compressibility without allowing elasticity. In certain exemplary
embodiments according to the present invention, it is desirable for the accommodating proximal
cuff 1010 and corresponding structures to have plasticity and be compressible or foldable. In
any given exemplary embodiment, the non-elastic tubular implant body 1015, the endograft
body 1300, the accommodating proximal cuff 1010, and corresponding structures may be
constructed of the same material of varying elasticity, or these structures may be constructed of
different, but compatible materials.

                                                  24
[0101] The adjustment members 1025, the retention tines 1130, 1165, and the microcylinders
1030 and other mechanical components as disclosed herein and in all other embodiments of the
present invention may be fabricated of any suitably strong biocompatible material, including,
but not limited to titanium, stainless steel, cobalt chromium alloys, other metals, other metal
alloys, nitinol, plastics, or ceramics. Similarly, the adjustment members 1025, the retention
tines 1130, 1165, and the microcylinders 1030 and other mechanical components may be milled,
laser cut, lathed, molded, or extruded.
[0100] The compressible foam gaskets 1140 as disclosed herein may be any biocompatible
foam material of either an open or closed cell structure with sufficient compressibility and
resilience to allow rapid recovery in a non-compressed state. In various exemplary
embodiments according to the present invention, such foam materials may be viscoelastic foam
with a compressible cellular material that has both elastic (spring-like) and viscous (time
dependent) properties. Viscoelastic foam differs from regular foam by having time-dependent
behaviors such as creep, stress relaxation, and hysteresis.
[0102] FIGS. 14A and 14B show an alternate exemplary embodiment of a salable endograft
system 2000 according to the present invention in two different states. In the view of FIG. 14A,
a hinged lattice structure 2100 is attached to an internal or external surface of at least the
proximal portion 2210 of an endograft body 2200 (the "lattice" in these figures is only
diagrammatic and is not intended to imply that the only possible number of rings of lattice is
greater than one). Either the lattice structure 2100 or the endograft body 2200 can be provided
with radially displaced retention tines 2105 that, in a non-distended state of the proximal portion
2210, can be covered within a compressible foam gasket 2300. In the embodiment shown in
FIG. 14A, the distal portion 2220 of the endograft body 2200 comprises a non-distensible
material and the proximal portion 2210 of the endograft body 2200 is an accommodating cuff
comprising a distensible material forming the proximally terminal aspect of the salable
endograft system 2000 and enclosing the terminal hinged lattice structure 2100 therewithin.
[0103] A control system 2400 or jack screw shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B is provided to expand
and contract the lattice structure 2100. In particular, a torque wire 2410 can be fixed at two
points 2420, 2430 longitudinally separate from one another on the lattice structure 2100. This
torque wire 2410 has exterior threads that correspond to threaded bores of one of the two points
2420, 2430. Accordingly, when the torque wire 2410 is rotated, the two points 2420, 2430 of
the lattice either approach one another (to expand the proximal portion 2210) or retreat from one

                                                  25
another (to contract the proximal portion 2210) this imparts motion to all contiguously
interconnected lattice elements. It is preferred to have the proximal end point 2430 be bored for
rotation but fixed longitudinally. In this case, a smooth-bored collar 2440 is fixed to the wall of
the graft 2200, for example, on an interior surface distal of the lattice structure 2100. When the
adjustment tool 1035 is rotated, the torque wire 2410 correspondingly rotates to expand or
contract the proximal portion 2210 of the endograft 2200. In this manner, in comparison to self
expanding prior art stent structures (e.g., made of nitinol) passively open to their greatest extent
when relieved from radially inward compression, the lattice structure of the present invention is
able to actively open according to the desire of the user surgeon implanting the prosthesis. As
such, the opening performed by prior art self-expanding stent structures in endograft prosthesis
are referred to herein as "passive opening" or "passive expansion". In contrast thereto, the
expansion performed by the inventive controllable, hinged, lattice structure of the present
invention for the disclosed endograft prostheses is referred to herein as "active control" or
"active expansion" because it can be actively controlled in both the expansion and contraction
directions according to the desire of the user. This is further in contrast to expansion of stent
structures using balloon, which case is referred to as "balloon opening" or "balloon expansion"
because it occurs only in one direction (expansion) without any ability to contract actively. The
single embodiment of the jack screw shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B can be replicated any
number of times about the circumference of the lattice structure 2100
[0104] In a non-illustrated alternative to the configuration of the system shown in FIG. 14B, the
configuration shown in FIGS. 1OA to 11 B can be incorporated into the system of FIGS. 14A and
14B to create a hybrid system. The circumferential assembly 1020 can be positioned at the
proximal end of the endograft and action of the circumferential loop 1035 within the proximal
cuff 1010, can be used to expand and contract the latticework 2100.
[0105] FIG. 15A is a lateral view of an exemplary embodiment of an adjustable vascular
cannula 1230 according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 15A, such an adjustable
vascular cannula 1230 is a generally tubular structure with external cannula walls 1235 defining
a cannula lumen 1240, and comprises a port end 1245, a cannula body 1250, and a cannula tip
1255. As further shown in FIG. 15A, the cannula body 1250 is further provided with a delivery
recess 1260 in its external wall structure at or near the junction of the cannula tip 1255. Further
still, the adjustable vascular cannula 1230 of FIG. 15A comprises an adjustable seal device 1265
attached to an adjustment member 1025 such as a torque wire that extends beyond the port end
1245 of the adjustable vascular cannula 1230 as shown in FIG. 15B. The adjustment member

                                                 26
1025 may course through the cannula lumen 1240, or it may course through an accessory lumen
(not shown in FIGS. 15A or 15B) within the cannula wall 1235 substantially parallel to the
cannula lumen 1240, or it may course externally to the adjustable vascular cannula 1230 as
shown partially within and partially outside the lumen 1240 in FIG. 15B. When in a non
deployed state, as shown in FIG. 15B, the adjustable seal device 1265 is substantially flush with
the outer diameter of the cannula walls 1235 within the delivery recess 1260 of the cannula body
1250.
[0106] FIG. 15C shows the adjustable seal device 1265 in a deployed state, which is the result
of torque applied externally to the adjustment member 1025 by a user. As shown in FIG. 15C,
the adjustable seal device 1265 further comprises a hinged adjustable latticework 1270 covered
by a sealing cuff 1275 which is constructed of a distensible material. The adjustment member
1025 terminates, for example, in a circumferential loop 1035 within the sealing cuff 1275, where
it may be further covered by a compressible foam gasket 1140. The adjustment member 1025
may further pass through a locking mechanism 1050 as disclosed elsewhere herein which serves
to regulate the torque applied to the circumferential loop 1035. The hinged adjustable
latticework 1270 may further be provided with one or more retention tines 1130, 1165, which
are radially displaced from the terminal aspect of the hinged adjustable latticework 1270, and
which are enclosed within and covered by the compressible foam gasket 1140 when the
adjustable seal device 1265 is not distended. When torque is applied to the adjustment member
1025 by a user, the diameter of the circumferential loop 1035 is increased, displacing the hinged
adjustable latticework 1270 as shown in FIG. 15C until the compressible foam gasket 1140 and
the sealing cuff 1275 is able to firmly engage the inner wall 1190 of a recipient blood vessel
1175. A slight additional amount of torque applied to the adjustment member 1025 is, then,
sufficient to compress the compressible foam gasket 1140 and allow the retention tines 1130,
1165 to engage the wall 1190 of the recipient blood vessel 1175, thus preventing slippage of the
cannula during use. In various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the retention
tines 1130, 1165 may be provided to engage the vessel wall 1190 in a substantially straight
manner or at angles varying from about 1 degree to about 179 degrees. The retention tines
1130, 1165 may be angled axially or longitudinally in various embodiments according to the
present invention. After the use of the cannula is completed, the torque of the adjustment
member 1025 may be reversed, collapsing the adjustable seal device 1165, and allowing the
compressible foam gasket 1140 to re-expand, thus withdrawing the retention tines 1165 from the
vessel wall 1175 and covering the retention tines 1165 to allow atraumatic cannula withdrawal.
