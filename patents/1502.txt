   Field of the Invention
   The present invention generally relates to gaming apparatus and methods of
   gaming. A particular embodiment of the present invention relates to competitive
 5 gaming using gaming machines.
   Background of the Invention
   With the increase of gambling at gaming venues has come increased
   competition between gaming venues to obtain a larger share of the total
   gambling spend. Gaming venue operators have therefore continuously looked
10 for new variations and types of games in order to attract both new and return
   customers to their venues.
   In response to this need, suppliers of gaming devices and systems have
   attempted to provide the sought after variety, while still developing games that
   comply with the relevant regulations in the jurisdiction of the gaming venue
is operator. Suppliers of gaming machines therefore are faced with restrictions on
   the types of games and gaming apparatus that are allowable, both in terms of
   the prevailing regulations and in terms of providing a return on investment to
   the gaming venue operators.
   In addition, it is important that a player be able to understand the operation of a
20 game quickly so that the player can start to quickly play the game and therefore
   extract maximum entertainment from the game.
   One method for providing potentially increased entertainment from a game is to
   offer one or more progressive prizes and/or one or more other special prizes
   separate from those specified by the pay table of a game played on a gaming
25 machine. When such prizes are paid, the designer and/or operator of the
   9673994_1
         (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                                    2
   gaming machines must determine when and how each special prize is to be
   paid.
   A special prize may be able to be won by a number of linked gaming machines.
   In this case, the designer and/or operator of the gaming machines must
 5 determine a fair way for each gaming machine to win the special prize. It is an
   ongoing problem to find new ways of offering special prizes on gaming
   machines.
   Summary of the Invention
io According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method
   of competitive bonus gaming for use with a gaming networking having a game
   processor and a plurality of gaming machines, the method including:
                receiving a first wager at a said gaming machine for a first game;
                detecting occurrences of a first outcome during play of said first game
15 among the gaming machines;
                identifying each of said gaming machines that have detected the
   occurrence of a first outcome;
                entering at least one of the identified said plurality of gaming machines
   into a competition mode in response to an event having been triggered;
20              in a first round of competition in said competition mode, determining, via
   the game processor, a first score for each of said identified gaming machines
   dependent on a number of occurrences of said first outcome on the respective
   said identified gaming machine prior to said event having been triggered;
                progressing each of said identified gaming machines to a next round of
25 competition in response to a respective said score being within a range;
                in said next round of competition, determining a second score for each of
   said identified gaming machines that have progressed into said next round
   dependent on a number of occurrences of said first outcome prior to said event
   having been triggered;
30              awarding an award to a said gaming machine that progresses through all
   rounds of the competition; and
                displaying representations the competition.
   In an embodiment, each of said gaming machines continues play of the first
   9673994_1 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                                  3
    game while in the competition mode.
    In an embodiment, the step of displaying representations further comprises:
                 displaying a character to represent each score of a said identified
  5 gaming machine; and
                 removing said character from said displaying in a subsequent round in
    response to said score being outside said range.
    In an embodiment, the method further comprises displaying an animation of
    said character being removed from said competition in response to said score
io  being outside said range.
    In an embodiment, the method further comprises displaying an animation of
    said character progressing in said competition in response to said score being
    within said range.
15
    In an embodiment, said character from a said gaming machine is
    distinguishable from any other character from another said gaming machine.
    In an embodiment, the method further comprises determining a plurality of said
20  first scores wherein the number of scores is dependent on a number of
    occurrences of said first outcome for at least one gaming machine, and wherein
    said at least one gaming machine progresses from said first round of
    competition to said next round of competition based on any one score of said
    plurality of scores.
25
    In an embodiment, when a gaming machine progresses in the competition, the
    number of scores determined for the next round is dependent on the number of
    scores that are of a value so as to progress the gaming machine to that next
    round.
30
    In an embodiment, a number of first scores are determined for each gaming
    machine in the first round, said first scores being dependent on the number of
    first outcomes of said each gaming machine that have occurred prior to said
    event having been triggered.
35
    In an embodiment, the number of scores determined for each gaming machine
    in the first round is dependent on the number of first outcomes of said each
    9673994_1 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                                      4
   gaming machine that have occurred.
   In an embodiment, the trigger event occurs when a number of first outcomes
   has occurred, the number being measured by the number of occurrences on
 5 any one of the gaming machines or by the total number of occurrences across
   the plurality of gaming machines.

   Detailed Description
   In Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, one example of a gaming machine
   suitable for implementing the present invention is generally referenced by arrow
   10.
 5 The gaming machine 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which is
   displayed representations of a game 16, that can be played by a player. A mid
   trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a
   player to play the game 16. The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 including a coin input chute 24A and a bill collector 24B. A top
io box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example, pay tables and details of
   bonus awards and other information or images relating to the game. Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on the front panel 29 of the console
   12. A coin tray 30 is mounted beneath the console 12 for cash payouts from the
   gaming machine 10.
15 The display 14 shown in Figure 1 is in the form of a video display unit,
   particularly a cathode ray tube screen device. Alternatively, the display 14 may
   be a liquid crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit,
   or the visible portion of an electromechanical device. The top box 26 may also
   include a display, for example a video display unit, which may be of the same
20 type as the display 14, or a different type of display.
   Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a gaming apparatus, generally referenced
   by arrow 100, suitable for implementing the present invention. The gaming
   apparatus 100 may, for example, operate as a standalone gaming machine of
   the type shown in Figure 1. However, the gaming apparatus 100 may
25 alternatively operate as a networked gaming machine, communicating with
   other network devices, such as one or more servers or other gaming machines.
   The gaming apparatus 100 may also have distributed hardware and software
   components that communicate with each other directly or through a network.
   Accordingly, different reference numerals have been used in Figure 2 from
30 Figure 1 for components that may be equivalent.
   9673994_1 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                            6
   The gaming apparatus 100 includes a game controller 101, which in the
   illustrated example includes a computational device 102, which may be a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device or other suitable
   device. Instructions and data to control operation of the computational device
 5 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data communication with or forms
   a part of the computational device 102. Typically, the gaming apparatus 100 will
   include both volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each type
   of memory, with such memories being collectively represented by the memory
   103. The instructions to cause the game controller 101 to implement the
10 present invention will be stored in the memory 103.
   The gaming apparatus may include hardware meters 104 for the purposes of
   regulatory compliance and also include an input/output (1/O) interface 105 for
   communicating with the peripheral devices of the gaming apparatus 100. The
   input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may be intelligent
15 devices with their own memory for instructions and data.
   In the example shown in Figure 2, the peripheral devices that communicate with
   the controller are one or more displays 106, user input devices 107, a card
   and/or ticket reader 108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
   mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111. One or more of the displays
20 106 may include a touch screen 106A, forming part of the user input devices
   107. Additional devices may be included as part of the gaming machine 100, or
   devices omitted as required for the specific implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a communications interface,
   for example a network card 112. The network card, may for example, send
25 status information, accounting information or other information to a central
   controller, server or database and receive data or commands from the central
   controller, server or database. One or more of the peripheral devices, for
   example the card/ticket reader 108 may be able to communicate directly with
   the network card 112.
   9673994_1 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                         7
   The game controller 101 may also include a random number generator 113,
   which generates a series of random numbers that determine the outcome of a
   series of random game events played as part of a game on the gaming
   apparatus 100. As explained in more detail in relation to Figure 4, the
 5 computational device 102 may include two or more controllers or processors,
   which may be local or remote from each other and the displays 106.
   Figure 3 shows an exemplary block diagram of the main components of the
   memory 103. The RAM 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the computational controller 102 and related data. The EPROM
10 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain some system or game
   related code. The mass storage device 103C is typically used to store game
   programs, the integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by the
   computational controller 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B or
   elsewhere.
15 Figure 4 shows a gaming system 200. The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network. Gaming devices
   202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of two gaming devices 202 in Figure 4,
   are connected to the network 201. The gaming devices 202 may be gaming
   machines 10, as shown in Figure 1 or form part or all of another gaming
20 apparatus 100. Single gaming devices 202 and banks 203 containing three or
   more gaming devices 202 may also be connected to the network 201.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the network 201. The
   displays 204 may, for example, be associated with a bank 203 of gaming
   devices. The displays 204 may be used to display representations associated
25 with game play on the gaming devices 202, and/or used to display other
   representations, for example promotional or informational material.
   Servers may also be connected to the network 201. For example, a game
   server 205 may generate game outcomes for games played on the gaming
   devices 202, a database management server 206 may manage the storage of
30 game programs and associated data for downloading or access by the gaming
   9673994_1 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                             8
   devices 202 in a database 206A, and a jackpot server 207 may control one or
   more jackpots associated with the gaming devices 202.
   Further servers may be provided to assist in the administration of the gaming
   system 200, including for example a gaming floor management server 208, and
 5 a licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses to particular games. An
   administrator terminal 210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network. The various servers
   described in the gaming 200 may be separate physical servers or individual
   server processes run on the same physical device.
10 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming systems, other
   local networks, for example a corporate network and/or a wide area network
   such as the Internet through a firewall 211.
   Figures 5 to 9 show process flow diagrams of a process performed in
   accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The process may be
15 performed by and within the network gaming system 200, in which the gaming
   devices 202 may each include part or all of a gaming apparatus 100 and the
   following description assumes this implementation. However, those skilled in
   the relevant arts will appreciate that the process will also be able to be
   implemented by other gaming systems.
20 The process is described with reference to a game that is a spinning reel game
   of the type well known in the gaming industry. However, the present invention
   has application to other types of games including card and dice games.
   Figure 5 shows a process flow diagram of play of a game 16, during the play of
   which the gaming system 200, suitably the game controller 101 associated with
25 each gaming device 202, monitors for the occurrence of a first event and a
   second event. A definition of these events may be stored in the memory 103.
   In the following example, the first event is the spinning up of a special symbol in
   a spinning reel game. However, other events may be used, including the
   9673994_1
         (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                               9
   passage of a randomly determined period of time or a recurring event related to
   game play of the game, for example a particular turnover on the gaming
   machine. The event may be determined dynamically, so that for example for
   every game play results in a 1/100 chance of the event occurring. A
 5 combination of two or more events may be used, the occurrence of either one
   of them resulting in advantage in the competition mode.            Although in some
   embodiments it may be possible for a player to lose special symbols, for
   example by spinning a losing symbol, the preferred embodiment does not have
   this function.
10 The player may be required to make a payment, qualify through the
   achievement of a qualification criterion or set of criteria, or otherwise become
   eligible before monitoring for the first event occurs.
   For example, the player may have to place an ante-bet to be eligible for
   recognition of the special symbol as a first event. The special symbol could be
is 'special' solely for the reason that it is recognised as the first event. Alternatively
   the designated special symbol may have other particular characteristics, such
   as operating as a WILD symbol.
   Instead, the first event may only occur when the player has qualified or
   otherwise become eligible. For example, when there is a 1 in 100 chance of
20 occurrence of the first event when the player is eligible, the gaming controller
   101 may simply not make the determination of whether the event occurs unless
   the player is eligible.
   The player may be given the option to purchase a special symbol, in which
   case the first event includes that purchase. For example, the player may
25 purchase a special symbol, which may then be displayed on a display 106 as if
   it was spun up on a reel. Alternatively, the player may only be given the option
   to purchase a special symbol when it is spun up on a spinning reel, so that if
   the player does not purchase the special symbol they do not get the benefit of
   the special symbol when the competition mode is entered and if the player does
30 purchase the special symbol, then they do get the benefit of the symbol.
   9673994_1 (GHMatter) P88224.AU.4

                                             10
   In the following example, the second event is the occurrence of a particular
   number of the first event during a gaming session on a gaming device 202. The
   particular number may be evaluated           against each     gaming device 202
   individually, or against a plurality of gaming devices 202 collectively. However,
 5 other events may be used, including the occurrence of a particular combination
   of symbols in a game played on a gaming device 202, the passage of a
   randomly determined period of time, being long enough so that it is likely that
   one or more occurrences of the first event can be expected to have happened
   during the period, an event related to game play of games on the gaming
io devices 202, for example collective turnover on the gaming devices 202, or the
   value of a linked progressive prize.
   Occurrence of the first event is preferably dependent on game play at a gaming
   device 202, but the second event may be initiated either due to play of the
   game 16, or due to a game system parameter that does not distinguish
15 between gaming devices 202. The definition of the first event may vary between
   gaming devices 202. It may be advantageous from a perspective of ease of
   game design that the first event occurs with equal probability on each gaming
   device 202, particularly in embodiments where there is competition between the
   gaming devices 202 for an award.
20 The process commences at step 50 and a bonus controller is initialised and
   network communications between the bonus controller and the gaming devices
   202 are established. The bonus controller may be the jackpot server 207, which
   then effectively forms part of a game controller 101 for a gaming device 202.
   Initialisation of the bonus controller may include setting a jackpot pool to a seed
25 value, and clearing any counters associated with game play. Once the
   initialisation procedures have been completed, the process proceeds to step
   51, in which a game 16 is implemented on a gaming device 202. Figures 5 to 8
   show the process as implemented from the viewpoint of a particular gaming
   device 202, which is referred to herein as "machine A".
   96739941 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                            11
    In step 51, a player on machine A makes a wager of x credits and commences
   a game play of the game 16. The player may indicate the wager by operating
   the user interface 107.
    Machine A records the value of the amount bet and communicates this to the
 5 jackpot server 207 using its network card 112. The jackpot server 207 receives
   the communication and increments a jackpot pool associated with machine A
    by, in this example, 5% of the value of the wager. The computation of the
    increment amount may alternatively be made locally and communicated to the
   jackpot server 207.
10  Following play of the game play commenced at step 51, machine A evaluates if
   the player has won a prize (step 53). In the case of a spinning reel game, a
    prize may be won by the spinning up of a winning combination of symbols in a
    pay line that the player has purchased by placing their wager. In this case,
    machine A looks up the winning combination in a pay table and pays the
is appropriate prize (step 54) and then proceeds to step 55. If the player of
    machine A did not win a prize, then the process proceeds directly from step 53
   to step 55.
    In step 55, machine A evaluates whether the player has acquired a special
   symbol. Special symbols may be acquired when they appear on the displayed
20  part of a reel in a spinning reel game played on the gaming device 202. The
   special symbols may need to appear on a pay line that has been purchased by
   the player of the gaming device 202, or may be acquired regardless of whether
   they appear on a purchased pay line. The accumulation of the special symbol
    may be related to the number of credits bet per pay line. For example, if two
25  bets are made per line, then a single occurrence of a special symbol may result
    in two         special symbols being accumulated. Alternatively, the expected
   accumulation rate per game play may be independent of the bet size. When the
   accumulation rate is independent of the bet size, in some embodiments one or
    more of the prizes available to be won from the competition mode may be
   96739941 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                              12
   varied, for example multiplied by the wager made per line in a spinning reel
   game.
   The special symbols may be any identifiable symbol in the game. If the player
   has not acquired a special symbol, the process returns to step 51 and play of
 5 the game 16 continues. If the player has acquired one or more special symbols,
   each acquired special symbol is displayed on machine A, for example in a
   section of the display 14, or in a display provided in the top box 26 (step 56).
   The special symbol is also displayed on an overhead display associated with
   machine A, suitably a display 204. The images displayed on the display 204
io may be controlled by the jackpot controller 207, whereas the display of the
   symbol on machine A may be either controlled by the jackpot controller 207 or
   controlled by a graphics controller local to the gaming device 202.
   Special symbols may optionally only be able to be acquired for eligible game
   plays.        Eligible game plays may be game plays in which a certain minimum
15 wager has been staked, game plays in which the player has wagered an ante
   bet, game plays during a period defined by an operator or otherwise.
   Alternatively, the special symbols could be acquired, but the gaming device 202
   may not be eligible to enter the competition (see herein below), and may
   display a message that a competition would have been able to have been
20 entered if they had played in a manner to make them eligible. The gaming
   device 202 could then play a bonus game the outcome of which is not
   dependent on the acquisition of special symbols, the potential awards from this
   other bonus game, if provided, preferably being small in comparison to the
   awards available in the competition. This may encourage participation in the
25 competition, participation in which may increase the enjoyment of a player of
   the gaming device 202.
   In step 58, the game controller 101 evaluates whether competition mode has
   been triggered. Competition mode is triggered either by machine A, or by
   another gaming device 202,           linked with machine A by virtue of also
30 communicating with the jackpot controller 207 and contributing to the same
   96739941 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                             13
   jackpot as machine A, acquiring a certain number of special symbols, which
    may be the maximum number that can be acquired. If machine A is not in
   competition mode, the process returns to step 51, otherwise the process
    proceeds to B (see figure 6). If competition mode was triggered by another
 5 gaming device 202 (one that is not also controlled by the game controller 101)
   or by a system event, the game controller 101 monitors for receipt of a signal at
    its network card 112 that indicates this occurrence.
    If machine A is to enter competition mode due to acquiring the required number
   of special symbols itself, it communicates the acquisition of the special symbols
io to the jackpot controller 207. The jackpot controller 207 then takes control of a
   display 106 to provide the competition mode, and instructs other gaming
   devices 202 linked to machine A by virtue of contributing to the same jackpot
    pool (refer to step 52) to enter into competition mode. Alternatively the jackpot
   controller 207 could inform the gaming machine 100 of which the gaming
15 device 202 is a part, that the competition mode is to be entered, in which case
   control of the display 106 may be retained by the game controller 101 of that
   gaming machine instead of by a separate controller in the jackpot controller
   207.
    Referring now to Figure 6, after a competition has been triggered, the game
20 controller 101 evaluates whether machine A is eligible to participate in the
   competition (step 59). Eligibility may be determined by machine A currently
    being played and having acquired a certain number of special symbols, for
   example one or more special symbols. If machine A is not eligible, then the
    process returns to step 51 to continue game play without participating in the
25 competition. If machine A is eligible, the process proceeds to step 60, in which
   a display 106 of the gaming device 202 is controlled to display the competition
   screen to provide entertainment to the player and provide visual feedback as to
   the result of the competition.
   Alternatively all of the linked gaming devices 202 that are currently being played
30  may be eligible, for example with those not having acquired any special
   96739941 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                           14
   symbols having one entry to the competition (see herein below), and those that
   have acquired special symbols having more, perhaps substantially more,
   entries.
   The competition may also be implemented as a spinning reel game, but may be
 5 otherwise implemented, for example as a dice game, card game, a numbers
   game or a pin and ball type game. In step 61, a message is displayed to the
   player to spin the reels (or stop the reels if they are already spinning). The
   number of reels that are spun (n) may be variable and determined dependent
   on the number of acquired special symbols. For example, if the player of
10 machine A acquired only one special symbol, only one reel may spin, whereas
   acquiring five special symbols may result in five reels spinning. Although a one
   to one relationship between the number of special symbols acquired and the
   number of reels that are spun is described in this example, this is not
   necessary. Alternatively the number of reels could be fixed, with the outcome of
15 the reel being multiplied by an amount specified by the number of acquired
   special symbols.
   After the player presses a competition button in the user interface 107, or after
   a predetermined short time period expires, the n reels spin (step 62) and then
   stop to display one or more symbols that are used to determine one or more
20 scores for the game play (step 63). The score may be indicated by a number
   that is spun up on each of the reels or a number associated with a symbol that
   is spun up on the reels. The score may be the sum of the scores from the reels,
   or alternatively the game play could result in a number of scores, one for each
   reel. The exemplary process shown in Figures 6 to 8 assume that the game
25 play results in a score for each acquired special symbol, so that there are n
   scores S1, S2, ... Sn. Alternative methods of computing a score from the game
   may be used.
   Next, in step 64, the score or scores resulting from the reel spin are displayed
   on the display 106 of machine A and on the display 204. The scores resulting
30 from special symbols acquired at other gaming devices 202 linked to machine A
   96739941 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                            15
   may also be displayed on the display 204 and/or on the display 106. This may
   be performed by displaying a representation of a character for each special
   symbol and displaying above the character its score. Characters associated
   with different gaming devices 202 may be distinguished from each other, for
 5 example by being represented as dressed in different colour clothes. The
   characters may participate in a game scenario, which is affected by the
   outcome of the competition.
   The scores of machine A are ranked in relation to the scores of other machines
   to which machine A is linked (step 65). A determination is then made whether
io any score, Si, of machine A is one of the top three ranked scores. If it is, the
   process proceeds to C (see Figure 7). If not, a prize is paid to the player of
   machine A (step 67). The prize may be determined in a number of ways and
   may be a fixed monetary prize, which is optionally multiplied by the number of
   special symbols that were acquired, may be a prize depending on where in the
is ranking the score or scores of machine A were situated, may be a split of a
   consolation prize of fixed value or consolation jackpot incremented at a lower
   rate than the jackpot pool contributed to in step 52, or other prize. Alternatively
   no consolation prize is paid. In addition or alternatively, play in the competition
   may result in awards being awarded, such awards having no influence on the
20 outcome of the competition.
   Following payment of the consolation prize (if any), the acquired special
   symbols associated with machine A are removed from the display 106 of
   machine A and the display 204 (step 68), and the process returns to A (see
   Figure 5). In the case that the gaming device 202 has two displays 106 one
25 display may be used to allow continued game play, and the other used to
   display the normal game or games provided by the gaming device 202, allowing
   the player of machine A to view the result of the competition and continue
   playing a game, which may allow them to enter the next competition if they
   acquire the required number of special symbols. This may also allow longer
30 period competition modes without substantially reducing the time available for
   players to play the game underlying the competition mode.
   96739941 (GHMatter) P88224.AU.4

                                            16
   If at least one of the scores of machine A is determined to be one of the top
   ranked scores in step 66, the player of machine A enters into a second round of
   the competition. This second round is shown in Figure 7. In step 69, the existing
   scores of the special symbols that have proceeded through to this round are
 5 removed from the display. The characters or other representations of the
   special symbols that have been eliminated from the competition are removed
   from the displays 106 and 204 and a consolation prize may be awarded to the
   player of machine A for each eliminated special symbol even if machine A has
   progressed to the second round. This leaves r special symbols represented for
10 machine A, r being the number of scores that were in the top 3 scores as
   determined in step 66 and representations of the r special symbols are
   displayed on displays 106, 204 (step 70). r may be equal to three or may be
   greater than three because of the possibility of a plurality of scores from the
   same or different gaming devices 202 having the same value. In one
15 embodiment, the range of available scores is specifically selected so that r is
   greater than three often.
   A message is then displayed for the player to initiate the spin or stopping of
   reels (step 71) and the player initiates the game play (step 72). The number of
   reels that are spun, r, depends on the number of special symbols that the
20 player has in this next round. When the reels stop, r scores S1, S2,... Sr are
   determined, one for each special symbol in the second round (step 73) and
   these scores are displayed (step 74) and ranked in relation to the scores of
   other special symbols (step 75). Steps 71 to 75 may therefore be similar to
   steps 61 to 65 completed in the first round of the competition.
25 In step 76, the jackpot controller 207 or other controller in the gaming system
   200 identifies the top two scores. If none of the special symbols of machine A
   resulted in one of the top two scores, the process proceeds to steps 77 and 78,
   in which case a consolation prize may be paid and the special symbols of
   machine A are removed from the displays 106, 204 and the process returns to
30 A (see Figure 5). If a special symbol of machine A is in the top two scores, the
   96739941 (GHMatters)P88224.AU.4

                                            17
   process proceeds to D (see Figure 8), representing a final round of the
   competition.
   Referring now to Figure 8, if the machine A enters into the final round, the
   scores are again removed from the special symbols (step 79), eliminated
 5 special symbols are removed from the displays 106 and 204 (with optional
   associated payment of a consolation prize), leaving p special symbols,
   including at least one symbol of machine A competing in the final round.
   Representations of the p special symbols are displayed on the displays 106,
   204 (step 80). The final round of play is completed in steps 81 to 84 in the same
io manner as for game play in steps 61 to 64 and 71 to 74.
   In step 85, the jackpot controller 207 evaluates whether the special symbols of
   machine A represent the highest score and if so the process proceeds to steps
   86 and 87 in which the jackpot prize that was contributed to in step 52 (see
   Figure 5) is paid to the player of machine A, the special symbols are removed
15 from the screens and the process returns to A (see Figure 5). The jackpot prize
   may optionally be multiplied by the credits bet per pay line by the player of
   machine A in the game that immediately preceded the triggering of the
   competition mode.
   If the special symbols of machine A do not represent the highest score, the
20 process proceeds to step 88 in which the jackpot controller evaluates whether
   there has been a tie between the special symbols of machine A and the special
   symbols of another gaming device 202. If there has been a tie, the process
   returns to steps 79 and another final round is played. If there is not a tie, this
   means that machine A has been defeated in the final round, in which case a
25 consolation prize may be paid in step 89, the special symbols are removed from
   the displays 106, 204 (step 87) and the process returns to A (see Figure 5).
   Figures 10 to 13 show schematic representations of four possible screen shots
   S1-S4 respectively that may be displayed on one or more displays 106 (see
   Figure 2) and/or on one or more displays 204 of the gaming system 200 (see
   96739941 (GHMaters) P88224.AU.4

                                           18
   Figure 4). The screen shots S1-S4 may be displayed as part of an animation or
   series of animations depicting how the competition plays out.
   Figure 10 shows a screen shot S1 as it may appear at step 60 in Figure 6. At
   this stage six special symbols have been accumulated through the play of four
 5 different gaming devices 202. Characters C1-C4 representing these special
   symbols are included in the screen shot S1. Two special symbols occurred on a
   first gaming device 202 since the last competition and is therefore allocated two
   characters C1. A second and a third gaming device 202 both had a single
   occurrence of a special symbol and are therefore allocated characters C2 and
10 C3 respectively. A fourth gaming device 202 had two occurrences of a special
   symbol and therefore is allocated two characters C4.
   Screen shot S1 may continue to be displayed while steps 61 to 63 are
   completed, with the reels involved in these steps displayed on the individual
   gaming devices 202 on a different screen to the screen shot S1 if the screen
15 shot S1 is displayed on a display 106 of the gaming device 202. Alternatively
   the display may change during this process to represent the competition, for
   example to show a race between the characters.
   The screen shot S1 includes a sidewalk 300 on which the characters C1-C4 are
   located and a road 301 next to the sidewalk. On the road 301 is shown two cars
20 302.
   Referring to Figure 11, screen shot S2 may be displayed at step 64. The scores
   resulting from step 63 are displayed above each character C1-C4. In the
   example the two characters C1 achieved scores of 90 and 70, characters C2
   and C3 achieved scores of 40 and 80 respectively and the two characters C4
25 achieved scores of 60 and 80. Therefore, in step 66 it is determined that both
   characters C1, character C3 and one of the characters C4 have the top 3
   ranked scores. These four characters progress to the next round whereas
   character C2 and one of the characters C4 do not progress. The display of the
   scores may be omitted in some embodiments.
   96739941 (GHMatters) P88224.AU.4

                                            19
   Referring to Figure 12, screen shot S3 may be displayed following step 66. The
   characters not progressing are shown to enter one of the cars 302, which may
   drive off screen, leaving only the characters that progress to the next round. If a
   consolation prize is paid at step 67, images representing this may be displayed,
 5 for example the characters taking a small money bag with them into the cars
   302.
   Referring to Figure 13, screen shot S4 may be displayed at the end of the
   competition. All but one of the remaining characters enter a car 302, optionally
   taking a consolation prize with them, which may be represented as larger than
10 the prize, if any, shown in screen shot S2. The cars 302 in subsequent rounds
   may be larger or otherwise visibly more valuable than the cars 302 displayed in
   earlier rounds.
   The winning character C4 is the only one left on the display and the main prize
   is paid to the fourth gaming device 202, being the gaming device 202 on which
15 the special symbol occurred that is represented by the character C4. The main
   prize may be, but is not necessarily, a progressive prize. A further animation
   may indicate the winner. For example a limousine may be shown to pick up the
   character C4. In some embodiments more than one winner may be possible, for
   example if there is no provision to break a tie in the last round of the
20 competition, or if a tie-breaker process still results in a tie. In this embodiment
   the main prize may be selected to be divisible and may be shared between the
   players.
   While the example screen shots S1-S4 show the progressing characters
   remaining in place, in an alternative implementation the progressing players
25 could enter the cars and travel to a new location, where the next round of the
   competition is played. The locations and/or the cars transporting the player may
   become progressively more exclusive through the rounds. The characters that
   do not progress may not be animated, or alternatively could be animated as
   travelling off screen by 'walking' along the sidewalk 300, taking any consolation
30 prize with them.

                                           20
   The process shown in Figures 5 to 8 implements a gaming system where
   players of gaming devices compete against each other for the jackpot prize.
   However, alternatively, a player of a gaming device 202 may compete against
   the gaming venue for a prize without regard to the outcomes for any other
 5 players. In this alternative, steps 50 to 58 (see Figure 5) are completed as
   described herein above and the bonus controller may as described above be
   the game controller 101, which may include the jackpot server 207, depending
   on the particular implementation and depending on whether multiple linked
   gaming machines can win the same jackpot prizes.
10 When competition mode has been determined to have been triggered in step
   58, the process proceeds to step 90 (see Figure 9). The machine A displays n
   special symbols, dependent on the number accumulated through game play
   and the display changes to the competition screen (step 91). Steps 92 to 94 are
   played in the same manner as for steps 61 to 63 (see Figure 6). In step 95 the
15 bonus controller matches the scores, or a single score, which may be the
   highest score S1, S2, ... Sn, a sum, product or other mathematical combination
   of the scores S1, S2, ... Sn or a score that is otherwise determined with a
   plurality of scores or ranges of scores associated with a corresponding plurality
   of prizes. For example a score between 1 -10 may result in a first prize, a score
20 between 11 and 20 a second level prize and so on. Depending on the score
   achieved, the matching award is then awarded (step 96).
