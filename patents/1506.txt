                                            ABSTRACT
         A method for controllably linking propulsion units in a vehicle consist includes
transmitting a linking signal having an identity of a lead propulsion unit. A remote propulsion
unit is remotely controlled by the lead unit when the identity matches a designated identity stored
onboard the remote unit. A de-linking signal is transmitted from the lead unit when the lead unit
is to be decoupled from the vehicle consist.       The de-linking signal includes a replacement
identity of a replacement propulsion unit. A replacement linking signal is transmitted from a
second lead unit. The remote propulsion unit allows the second lead propulsion unit to remotely
control the operations of the remote propulsion unit when replacement identity stored onboard
the remote propulsion unit matches an identity that is communicated in the replacement linking
signal.

               SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATED ESTABLISHMENT
                                    OF A VEHICLE CONSIST
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]          The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
Application No. 2013211559, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]          Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate to operations of a
vehicle system.    Other embodiments relate to establishing distributed power operations of a
vehicle consist.
BACKGROUND
[0003]          Trains with distributed power systems can be operated in different modes.    One
mode is where all locomotives in the train operate at the same notch command. For example, if a
lead locomotive is commanding motoring at notch 8 ("N8"), all units in the train will be
commanded to generate motoring at N8 power. Another mode of operation is "independent"
control. In this mode, locomotives or sets of locomotives distributed throughout the train can be
operated at different motoring or braking powers. For example, as a train crests a mountaintop,
the lead locomotives (on the down slope of mountain) may be placed in braking, while the
locomotives in the middle or at the end of the train (on the up slope of mountain) may be in
motoring. This is done to minimize tensile forces on the mechanical couplers that connect the
railcars and locomotives.
[0004]          When operating in distributed power, an operator, usually located in the lead
locomotive, can control operating functions of remote locomotives in the remote consists via a
control system, such as a distributed power control element. Thus, when operating in distributed
power, the operator can command each locomotive consist to operate at a different notch power
level (or one consist could be in motoring and other could be in braking), or each individual
locomotive in the locomotive consist operates at the same notch power.
                                                 1

[0005]          Currently, a train having locomotives that may operate in distributed power are
set up manually, usually at a rail yard. Operators must physically enter each locomotive to enter
data into the distributed power system aboard the locomotive to enable "linking" of the
locomotives so that distributed power operations may commence.            For example, suppose
locomotives are included in a train where the locomotives may be facing different directions,
meaning that some may be facing forward whereas others may be facing backward.                 The
operator must physically enter each locomotive and select the direction the locomotive should
motor. The operator must also initiate and attempt to complete the linking process prior to any
unforeseen problems with equipment or systems in the train being detected. Train operators and
owners may realize a financial savings and reduction in manpower from remotely setting up,
linking, and testing distributed power operations of a train.
[0006]          Additionally, if the lead locomotive experiences one or more faults (e.g., in
communication with the other locomotives that are linked with the lead locomotive in a
distributed power arrangement), the lead locomotive may need to be decoupled from the train
and replaced with another lead locomotive. In order to do this, the replacement lead locomotive
is coupled to the train and an operator may need to manually enter each remote locomotive along
the length of the train to manually input the change in lead locomotive into control systems of
the remote locomotives so that these control systems know to receive commands from the
replacement lead locomotive, and not the previous lead locomotive that has been removed. For
relatively long trains and/or trains having several remote locomotives, this process can consume
a significant amount of time.

is not to be taken as an admission that that document or matter was known or that the
information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00381          Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the inventive subject
matter, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the
same reference numerals used throughout the drawings refer to the same or like parts.
[00391          Embodiments of the inventive subject matter solve at least some of the problems
in the art by providing a system, method, and computer software code for determining and
implementing an automated set-up of a vehicle system, such as a distributed power train or other
vehicle consist. An apparatus, such as a data processing system, including a CPU, memory, I/O,
program storage, a connecting bus, and other appropriate components, could be programmed or
otherwise designed to facilitate the practice of the method of the inventive subject matter. Such
a system would include appropriate program for executing the method of the inventive subject
matter.
[0040]          Also, an article of manufacture, such as a pre-recorded disk or other similar
computer program product for use with a data processing system, could include a storage
medium (e.g., a tangible and non-transitory computer readable storage medium) and program
(e.g., one or more sets of instructions for directing a processor to perform one or more
operations) recorded thereon for directing the data processing system to facilitate the practice of
a method of the inventive subject matter. Such apparatus and articles of manufacture also fall
within the spirit and scope of the embodiments of the inventive subject matter.
[0041]          Broadly speaking, at least one technical effect of the inventive subject matter
provides for a method, system, and computer software code for automated set-up of a vehicle
system, such as a distributed power train or other vehicle consist. To facilitate an understanding
of the embodiments of the inventive subject matter, it is described hereinafter with reference to
specific implementations thereof. Embodiments of the invention may use program modules that
may include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular
tasks or implement particular abstract data types.     For example, the software programs that
                                                 14

underlie embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be coded in different languages for
use with different platforms.
[0042]          Though one or more embodiments of the inventive subject matter are disclosed
below as operating with hand-held devices, other embodiments may be practiced with other
computer system configurations, including multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or
programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.
Embodiments of the inventive subject matter may also be practiced in distributed computing
environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a
communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be
located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.
These local and remote computing environments may be contained entirely within the
locomotive, or adjacent locomotives in consist, or off-board in wayside or central offices where
wireless communication is used.
[0043]          Throughout this document the term vehicle consist is used. A vehicle consist is a
group of two or more vehicles that are mechanically coupled to travel together along a route. A
vehicle consist may have one or more propulsion-generating units (e.g., vehicles capable of
generating propulsive force, which also are referred to as propulsion units) in succession and
connected together so as to provide motoring and/or braking capability for the vehicle consist.
The propulsion units may be connected together with no other vehicles or cars between the
propulsion units.    One example of a vehicle consist is a locomotive consist that includes
locomotives as the propulsion units. Other vehicles may be used instead of or in addition to
locomotives to form the vehicle consist. A vehicle consist can also include non-propulsion units,
such as where two or more propulsion units are connected with each other by a non-propulsion
unit, such as a rail car, passenger car, or other vehicle that cannot generate propulsive force to
propel the vehicle consist. A larger vehicle consist, such as a train, can have sub-consists.
Specifically, there can be a lead consist (of propulsion units), and one or more remote consists
(of propulsion units), such as midway in a line of cars and another remote consist at the end of
the train. The vehicle consist may have a lead propulsion unit and a trail or remote propulsion
unit. The terms "lead," "trail," and "remote" are used to indicate which of the propulsion units
control operations of other propulsion units, and which propulsion units are controlled by other
                                                 15

propulsion units, regardless of locations within the vehicle consist.        For example, a lead
propulsion unit can control the operations of the trail or remote propulsion units, even though the
lead propulsion unit may or may not be disposed at a front or leading end of the vehicle consist
along a direction of travel. A vehicle consist can be configured for distributed power operation,
wherein throttle and braking commands are relayed from the lead propulsion unit to the remote
propulsion units by a radio link or physical cable.      Toward this end, the term vehicle consist
should be not be considered a limiting factor when discussing multiple propulsion units within
the same vehicle consist.
[0044]          Referring now to the drawings, embodiments of the inventive subject matter will
be described. FIG. 1 depicts an embodiment of a system for remotely setting up, linking, and
testing operations of a vehicle consist. In one embodiment, the system may set up, link, and/or
test distributed power operations of a vehicle consist such as a train. At a location, or remote
location, such as away from a vehicle consist 5, such as in a tower 7, a setup unit 10 is provided
for an operator to use. The setup unit 10 can be a unit that sets up the vehicle consist 5 for
distributed power operations or for other operations. In another embodiment, an operator aboard
a vehicle consist, such as located in a lead propulsion unit 21 of the vehicle consist 5, may use
the setup unit 10 to remotely setup remote propulsion units 22 in the vehicle consist 5 for
operations, such as distributed power operations.      While the propulsion units 21, 22 may be
referred to as lead and remote locomotives, respectively, alternatively the units 21, 22 may
represent other vehicles capable of generating propulsive force to propel the vehicle consist 5.
[0045]          FIG. 2 depicts an embodiment of a setup unit. The setup unit 10 has a computer,
or processor, 12 with a display 14 and operator input device 15, such as but not limited to a
mouse and/or a keyboard. As disclosed herein, the setup unit 10 may be a hand-held device. A
first communication interface 18 is also connected to the setup unit 10. As further illustrated in
FIG. 1, the first communication interface 18 is able to communicate with a distributed power
system 20 on the propulsion units 21, 22.
[0046]          At the vehicle consist 5, a second communication interface 24 is provided to
receive and send communications between itself and the first communication interface 18 at the
setup unit 10. The first communication interface 18 at the setup unit 10 is in communication
                                                 16

with the distributed power system 20 so that the setup unit 10 can receive information from the
distributed power system 20 and send commands to the distributed power system 20. Examples
of the distributed power system include, but are not limited to Assignee's LOCOTROL*
Locomotive System Integration (LSI) Electronics, or System, and/or other systems/equipment
that functions with the LSI system.
[00471          In an example use of the inventive subject matter, an operator may use the setup
unit 10 to input such information as, but not limited to, road numbers of the lead propulsion unit
21 and all remote propulsion units 22 within the vehicle consist 5 to be linked (or other
identifying information), the orientation of each propulsion unit 21, 22 within the vehicle consist
5 (e.g., whether the short hood or long hood of the respective propulsion unit 21, 22 is forward),
and the like. By doing so, the propulsion units will know which direction is forward since each
of the propulsion units 21, 22 may have either its respective short hood or long hood facing the
direction that the vehicle consist 5 will move.
[0048]          The setup unit 10 may transmit this information to each distributed power
generating unit 21, 22 in the vehicle consist 5, or to the lead propulsion unit 21, which in turn can
communicate with the remote propulsion units 22. In one embodiment, the on-board distributed
system 20 only accepts such data when the propulsion units 21, 22 are not already linked. In
another embodiment, the operator may override a prior link of the propulsion units 21, 22 with
new information.
[0049]          The on-board distributed system 20 may accept the data and proceed with linking
the propulsion units 21, 22. The linking process could continue through completion of a test that
confirms proper linking of the locomotives. The complete linking process could be completed
without human intervention aboard any of the propulsion units 21, 22 and prior to operators
physically entering the vehicle consist 5.
[0050]          For example, with the LOCOTROL* LSI system, in an embodiment, information
that may be provided on a display of the LSI system is also provided on a display on the setup
unit 10. Based on how the LSI system functions, the remote propulsion units 21, 22 in a vehicle
consist 5 are set up first. The lead propulsion unit 21 of the vehicle consist 5 is only set after all
setups for the remote propulsion units 22 are completed. The distributed power operations can
                                                  17

also be shutdown using an embodiment of the inventive subject matter. As discussed in more
detail below with respect to FIG. 3, the lead propulsion unit 21 may report a status back to the
setup unit 10, either confirming the linking process was successful or reporting a failure and
identifying what step in the process detected the failure along with any information, or data, as to
what could have caused the failure.
[0051]           As further illustrated in FIG. 2, the setup unit may be accessible by other remote
locations 30, such as a dispatch location and/or a repair depot. This remote location will know
when the vehicle consist 5 is properly linked. If the linking process is not completed due to a
failure, this information can also be forwarded.
[0052]           In an embodiment, connections between the setup unit 10 and the distributed
power system 20 may be via radio and/or any other form of wireless communication. In another
embodiment, communication may take place via a wired connection. Communications between
the setup unit 10 and the remote facility 7 may be via wireless communications and/or wired
communications.      For example, communications may occur using the Internet where dial-in
connections, cable modems, special high-speed IDSN lines, networks such as local area
networks, wide area networks, etc. may be utilized. Furthermore when the setup unit 10 is used
aboard the vehicle consist 5, such aboard the lead propulsion unit 21, the unit 10 may be directly
interfaced into the distributed power system 20 aboard the lead propulsion unit 21.
[00531           In addition to the parts of the setup unit 10 disclosed above, the setup unit 10 may
also have a mass storage device 32 and memory 33. The setup unit 10 may store information
regarding linking processes that are completed so that data about prior linking processes may be
later communicated to a remote facility.
[0054]           FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of a method for remotely setting up, linking, and
testing operations of a vehicle consist. As discussed above and illustrated in the flowchart 50,
the method includes receiving data remotely from a distributed power system on a propulsion
unit, at 52. This data may be specific to the propulsion unit that receives the data. The data is
sent remotely to the distributed power system on the propulsion unit pertaining to distributed
power settings in order to configure the propulsion unit for distributed power operations, at 54.
A confirmation is made as to whether the propulsion unit is configured for distributed power
                                                    18

operations, at 56. As discussed above, if the propulsion unit 21, 22 is already configured for
distributed power operations, the method may refuse the sent data, at 58. Additionally, data may
be saved and/or transmitted regarding the establishment, or inability to establish, distributed
power operations, at 60. As discussed above, the data may be sent back to the setup unit 10. If a
failure occurs the data may include, but is not limited to, what step in the process detected the
failure including data as to what could have caused the failure.
[0055]          FIG. 4 is a schematic illustration of another embodiment of a system 400 (e.g., a
communication system) for controllably linking propulsion units 402 in a vehicle consist 404.
The vehicle consist 404 includes one or more propulsion units 402 (e.g., vehicles that generate
propulsive force to propel the vehicle consist 404). In the illustrated embodiment, the vehicle
consist 404 includes three propulsion units 402A, 402B, 402C, but alternatively may include two
propulsion units 402 or more than three propulsion units 402. The vehicle consist 404 is shown
as a train, but alternatively may represent another system of vehicles that are connected with
each other to travel together along a route 408, such as a track, road, waterway, and the like. The
propulsion units 402 may represent rail vehicles that are powered to propel the vehicle consist
404, such as propulsion units.      Alternatively, the propulsion units 402 may represent other
vehicles that generate propulsive force, such as other rail vehicles, other off-highway vehicles,
automobiles, marine vessels, and the like.        The vehicle consist 404 includes several non
propulsion units 410, such as vehicles that do not generate propulsive force to propel the vehicle
consist 404. Examples of such non-propulsion units 410 include, but are not limited to, rail cars,
passenger cars, and the like.
[0056]          The communication system 400 allows for the propulsion units 402 of the vehicle
consist 404 to be controllably linked with each other.         When the propulsion units 402 are
controllably linked, at least one of the propulsion units 402 (referred to herein as a lead
propulsion unit) can remotely control operations of other propulsion units 402 (referred to herein
as trail or remote propulsion units). When the propulsion units 402 are not controllably linked,
the lead propulsion unit 402 may not be able to control operations of the remote propulsion units.
The communication system 400 is shown as including antennas of the propulsion units 402 that
wirelessly communicate with each other, but alternatively or additionally may include one or
more wired connections, such as by using communications through one or more cables, buses,
                                                  19

trainlines, conductors used for communications with electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP)
brakes, conductors used for communications within an electric multiple unit (MU cable), and the
like.
[00571          The terms "lead" and "remote" are meant to indicate which propulsion units 402
control operations of other propulsion units 402, and does not necessarily indicate relative
locations of the propulsion units 402 in the vehicle consist 404. By "remotely" control, it is
meant that the operations of the remote propulsion unit 402 are controlled from a location that is
outside of the remote propulsion unit 402, although not necessarily far away from the remote
propulsion unit 402. In one embodiment, the communication system 400 controllably links the
propulsion units 402 in a distributed power system so that the lead propulsion unit 402 remotely
controls the tractive efforts (e.g., propulsive forces) generated by the remote propulsion units
402.
[0058]          The remote propulsion units 402 can prevent a lead propulsion unit 402 from
remotely controlling operations of the remote propulsion units 402 unless the lead propulsion
unit 402 and the remote propulsion unit 402 are controllably linked with each other. Several
remote propulsion units 402 (e.g., propulsion units 402B, 402C) may be controllably linked with
a single lead propulsion unit 402 (e.g., propulsion unit 402A). Alternatively, one or more remote
propulsion units 402 can be controllably linked with more than one lead propulsion unit 402.
[0059]          In order to controllably link propulsion units 402 with each other, such as in a
distributed power system, a linking process may be performed. The linking process described
herein is used to associate (e.g., controllably link) a single lead propulsion unit 402 with a single
remote propulsion unit 402. The process may be used, however, to controllably link the lead
propulsion unit 402 with several remote propulsion units 402.
[0060]          FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate a flowchart of one embodiment of a method or process
500 for controllably linking propulsion units of a vehicle consist. The method 500 can represent
the linking process that is used to controllably link or couple a remote propulsion unit 402
(shown in FIG. 4) with a first lead propulsion unit 402, to communicatively de-couple the remote
propulsion unit 402 from the first lead propulsion unit 402, and then to controllably link the
remote propulsion unit 402 with another, replacement lead propulsion unit 402. The linking of
                                                   20

the remote propulsion unit 402 with the replacement lead propulsion unit 402 can be performed
without requiring a human operator to enter into the remote propulsion unit 402 after the remote
propulsion unit 402 is first controllably linked with the first lead propulsion unit 402.
[0061]           At 502, a remote propulsion unit 402B (shown in FIG. 4) is mechanically coupled
with the vehicle consist 404 (shown in FIG. 4).           The remote propulsion unit 402B can be
sequentially coupled with other propulsion units 402 and/or non-propulsion units 410 (shown in
FIG. 4).
[0062]           At 504, an identity of the first lead propulsion unit 402A is provided to the remote
propulsion unit 402B. For example, an operator may enter into the remote propulsion unit 402B
and manually input the identity of the first lead propulsion unit 402A into a setup unit of the
remote propulsion unit 402B. The propulsion units 402 may be associated with unique identities
that allow the remote propulsion unit 402B to differentiate between the different propulsion units
402. These identities may be alphanumeric strings, numeric strings, letter strings, or the like.
The identity of the lead propulsion unit 402A that is provided to the remote propulsion unit 402B
is referred to herein as a designated identity, as the identity may be designated by a person,
component, device, or system other than the lead propulsion unit 402A.
[0063]           At 506, a linking signal is transmitted from the lead propulsion unit 402A to the
remote propulsion units 402. For example, a communication interface of the lead propulsion unit
402A may transmit or broadcast signals to the remote propulsion units 402 of the vehicle consist
404. The linking signal includes an identity of the lead propulsion unit 402A that transmitted the
linking signal.     A communication interface onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B may
receive the linking signal and extract the identity of the lead propulsion unit 402A from the
linking signal.
[0064]           At 508, a determination is made as to whether the identity that is included in the
received linking signal corresponds to the designated identity that is locally stored at the remote
propulsion unit 402B. For example, a setup unit onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B can
compare the identity in the received linking signal with the locally stored designated identity to
see if the identities both represent the same lead propulsion unit 402A. If the identity input at the
remote propulsion unit 402B and the identity communicated in the received linking signal do not
                                                    21

both represent the same lead propulsion unit 402A, then the remote propulsion unit 402B
determines that the linking signal was sent from a propulsion unit 402 that is not the same
propulsion unit 402 identified by the identity provided to the remote propulsion unit 402B. As a
result, flow of the method 500 proceeds to 510.        If both identities represent the same lead
propulsion unit 402A, then the remote propulsion unit 402B determines that the linking signal
was sent from the lead propulsion unit 402A previously identified by the operator. As a result,
flow of the method 500 proceeds to 512.
[0065]         At 510, the remote propulsion unit 402B does not controllably link with the lead
propulsion unit 402A that transmitted the linking signal and command or control signals that are
sent by the lead propulsion unit 402A to the remote propulsion unit 402B are ignored by the
remote propulsion unit 402B.
[0066]         At 512, the remote propulsion unit 402B is controllably linked with the lead
propulsion unit 402A. For example, once a setup unit onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B
confirms that the lead propulsion unit 402A is identified by both the designated identity stored
onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B and the identity sent in the linking signal, then the
setup unit may controllably link with the lead propulsion unit 402A. The lead propulsion unit
402A may then remotely control operations of the remote propulsion unit 402B.
[00671         At 514, a determination is made as to whether the lead propulsion unit 402A is to
be removed from the vehicle consist 404 or remain in the vehicle consist 404. For example, one
or more faults may occur during operation of the lead propulsion unit 402A, such as faults in the
communication interface of the lead propulsion unit 402A. As a result, the lead propulsion unit
402A may be unable to remotely control the remote propulsion units 402. If the lead propulsion
unit 402A does not need to be decoupled from the vehicle consist 404 and replaced with another
lead propulsion unit 402, flow of the method 500 may proceed to 516. If the lead propulsion unit
402A does need to be decoupled from the vehicle consist 404 and replaced, then flow of the
method 500 can continue to 518.
[0068]         At 516, the lead propulsion unit 402A remotely controls operations of the remote
propulsion unit 402B during movement of the vehicle consist 404 along the route 408 (shown in
FIG. 4). For example, the lead propulsion unit 402A can direct the tractive efforts, braking
                                                 22

efforts, and the like, that are provided by the remote propulsion unit 402B during travel of the
vehicle consist 404.
[0069]          At 518, the lead propulsion unit 402A is to be removed from the vehicle consist
404 and, as a result, transmits a de-linking signal to the remote propulsion unit 402B. The de
linking signal may be transmitted before or after the lead propulsion unit 402A is removed from
the vehicle consist 404. The de-linking signal notifies the remote propulsion unit 402B that the
lead propulsion unit 402A is being removed and replaced by another, replacement propulsion
unit 402.
[00701          FIG. 6 schematically illustrates removal of the lead propulsion unit 402A from the
vehicle consist 404 in accordance with one embodiment. The lead propulsion unit 402A can be
mechanically de-coupled from the vehicle consist 404 and moved away from the vehicle consist
404. FIG. 7 schematically illustrates coupling of a replacement lead propulsion unit 402D with
the vehicle consist 404 in accordance with one embodiment. The replacement lead propulsion
unit 402D can be mechanically coupled with the vehicle consist 404 after the lead propulsion
unit 402A is removed from the vehicle consist 404.
[00711          Returning to the discussion of the method 500 shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the de
linking signal also can include an identity of the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D (referred
to herein as a replacement identity). An operator may input the replacement identity into a setup
unit onboard the lead propulsion unit 402A.        Alternatively, the replacement identity may be
communicated to the lead propulsion unit 402A from a remote location.
[0072]          At 520 (shown in FIG. 5B), the identity of the replacement lead propulsion unit
402D is stored onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B. For example, the setup unit disposed
onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B can locally store the replacement identity in an onboard
memory.
[0073]          At 522, the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D is mechanically coupled with
the vehicle consist 404, as shown in FIG. 7. At 524, a linking signal (also referred to herein as a
replacement linking signal) is transmitted from the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D to the
remote propulsion unit 402B.       Similar to the linking signal transmitted by the previous lead
                                                  23

propulsion unit 402A, the replacement linking signal may include the identity of the replacement
propulsion unit 402D.
[0074]         At 526, a determination is made as to whether the identity that is included in the
replacement linking signal corresponds to the replacement identity that is locally stored at the
remote propulsion unit 402B. For example, the setup unit onboard the remote propulsion unit
402B can compare the identity in the received replacement linking signal with the locally stored
replacement identity to see if the identities both represent the same replacement lead propulsion
unit 402D. If the identities do not both represent the same replacement lead propulsion unit
402D, then the remote propulsion unit 402B determines that the replacement linking signal was
sent from a propulsion unit 402 that is not the same propulsion unit 402 identified by the
replacement identity provided to the remote propulsion unit 402B in the de-linking signal sent by
the previous lead propulsion unit 402A. As a result, flow of the method 500 proceeds to 528.
[00751         If both identities represent the same replacement lead propulsion unit 402D, then
the remote propulsion unit 402B determines that the replacement linking signal was sent from
the same replacement lead propulsion unit 402D previously identified by the de-linking signal
from the previous lead propulsion unit 402A. As a result, flow of the method 500 proceeds to
530.
[0076]         At 528, the remote propulsion unit 402B does not controllably link with the
replacement lead propulsion unit 402D that transmitted the replacement linking signal.
Consequently, command or control signals that are sent by the replacement lead propulsion unit
402D to the remote propulsion unit 402B are ignored by the remote propulsion unit 402B.
[00771         At 530, the remote propulsion unit 402B is controllably linked with the
replacement lead propulsion unit 402D.        For example, once a setup unit onboard the remote
propulsion unit 402B confirms that the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D is identified by
both the replacement identity stored onboard the remote propulsion unit 402B and the identity
sent in the replacement linking signal, then the setup unit may controllably link with the
replacement lead propulsion unit 402D.
[0078]         At 532, the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D remotely controls operations
                                                  24

of the remote propulsion unit 402B. For example, the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D
can direct the tractive efforts, braking efforts, and the like, that are provided by the remote
propulsion unit 402B during travel of the vehicle consist 404.
[00791          FIG. 8 is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of a propulsion unit 800.
The propulsion unit 800 may represent one or more of the propulsion units 402 shown in FIGS.
4, 6, and 7. For example, the propulsion unit 800 may represent the lead propulsion unit 402A,
the remote propulsion unit 402B, and/or the replacement lead propulsion unit 402D.
[0080]          The propulsion unit 800 includes a propulsion system 802 that generates
propulsive force to propel the propulsion unit 800. The propulsion system 802 may include or
represent one or more engines, alternators, generators, energy storage devices (e.g., batteries,
flywheels, and the like), catenaries, shoes, traction motors, and the like.
[0081]          The propulsion system 802 is controlled by a controller 804. The controller 804
includes or represents one or more processors, input devices, output devices, and the like, that is
used to control operations of the propulsion system 802. The controller 804 may receive input
from an operator disposed onboard the propulsion unit 800 to control the propulsion system 802.
Alternatively or additionally, the controller 804 may be remotely controlled by another
propulsion unit 800. For example, if the controller 804 is disposed onboard a remote propulsion
unit that is controllably linked with a lead propulsion unit in a distributed power system, the
controller 804 may receive control signals or commands from the lead propulsion unit. The
controller 804 may then implement the commands from the lead propulsion unit to control
operations of the propulsion system 802.
[0082]          A setup unit 806 disposed onboard the propulsion unit 800 may be similar to the
setup unit 10 shown in FIG. 2. As described above, the setup unit 806 can include or represent a
processor, output device (e.g., a display), and an input device.      The setup unit 806 can be a
portable, hand-held device that is capable of being moved by an average human being within the
propulsion unit 800 and/or outside of the propulsion unit 800 without mechanical assistance to
lift and carry the setup unit 806.     Alternatively, the setup unit 806 may be fixed within the
propulsion unit 800, such as by being mounted to a surface within the propulsion unit 800.
                                                   25

[00831          The setup unit 806 is operably connected with a communication interface 808,
which may be similar to the communication interface 18 shown in FIG. 2. The communication
interface 808 can include circuitry and associated hardware and/or software for allowing the
propulsion unit 800 to communicate with one or more other propulsion units 800 or other
locations.    The communication interface 808 includes an antenna 810 that wirelessly
communicates with other propulsion units 800. Additionally or alternatively, the communication
interface 808 can be connected with a conductive pathway 812 that is joined with the
communication interface 808 of another propulsion unit 800. The communication interfaces 808
can communicate with each other over this conductive pathway 812. The conductive pathway
812 can represent one or more cables, buses, and the like, such as an ECP line, a trainline, an
eMU line, or the like.
[0084]          A memory 814 is disposed onboard the propulsion unit 800 and is accessible to
the controller 804, setup unit 806, and/or communication interface 808. The memory 814 can
represent a tangible and non-transitory computer readable storage medium, such as a computer
hard drive or other volatile or non-volatile memory. The memory 814 can store one or more sets
of instructions (e.g., software) that directs the setup unit 806 and/or controller 804 to perform one
or more operations. As described herein, the memory 814 can be used to store identities of
propulsion units 800.       For example, where the propulsion unit 800 represents a remote
propulsion unit 800 (e.g., the remote propulsion unit 402B in FIG. 4), the setup unit 806 can be
used to receive an operator-designated identity of a first lead propulsion unit and to store the
designated identity in the memory 814. The setup unit 806 can then compare the designated
identity in the memory 814 with an identity that is received by the communication interface 806
via a linking signal, as described above.         When a replacement identity is received by the
communication interface 806, the setup unit 806 can store the replacement identity in the
memory 814, also as described above.
[00851          In one embodiment, the propulsion units described herein may be interchangeable
in that one or more propulsion units may be capable of operating as lead propulsion units and
remote propulsion units. For example, a first propulsion unit may operate as a lead propulsion
unit in a vehicle consist to control operations of other propulsion units in the vehicle consist
during a first time period. During a different, second time period (e.g., during the same or
                                                   26

different trip of the vehicle consist), the first propulsion unit may operate as a remote propulsion
unit so that operations of the first propulsion unit are controlled by another propulsion unit in the
vehicle consist.
[0086]          FIGS. 9 through 11 illustrate schematic diagrams of one embodiment of a first
propulsion unit 900 (e.g., "Propulsion Unit #1") operating in different modes.              The first
propulsion unit 900 may represent one or more of the propulsion units described herein.           The
first propulsion unit 900 includes a control unit 902, which may represent the setup unit 806,
controller 804, and/or communication interface 806 (shown in FIG. 8). The first propulsion unit
900 also can include a memory 1100 (shown in FIG. 11) similar to the memory 814 (shown in
FIG. 8). Also shown in Figures 9 through 11 are second and third propulsion units 904, 1000
(e.g., "Propulsion Unit #2" and "Propulsion Unit #3," respectively), which may represent one or
more of the propulsion units described herein. The second and third propulsion units 904, 1000
also can include control units 906, 1002 and/or memories 910, similar to the first propulsion unit
900.    In one embodiment, the control units 902, 906, 1002 of the first, second, and third
propulsion unit 900, 904, 1000 may interchangeably switch between operating modes to switch
which of the propulsion units 900, 904, 1000 operate as a lead propulsion unit (e.g., that
remotely controls operations of other propulsion units in a vehicle consist) and which of the
propulsion units 900, 904, 1000 operate as a remote propulsion unit. While the discussion herein
focuses on the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 switching between different
operations modes, the discussion also may apply to the control units 906 and/or 1002 of the
second and/or third propulsion units 904, 1000.
[00871           FIG. 9 illustrates the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 operating in
a first mode of operation where the first propulsion unit 900 is to controllably link with the
second propulsion unit 904 to control operations of the second propulsion unit 904. As described
above, the control unit 902 transmits a first linking signal 908 to the control unit 906 of the
second propulsion unit 904. The first linking signal 908 includes or represents an identity of the
control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 (and/or an identity of the first propulsion unit
900). The control unit 906 compares this identity to a designated identity stored in the memory
910 (or received from an operator, received from an off-board location, or the like), as described
above. If the received identity of the first linking signal 908 matches the designated identity,
                                                    27

then the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 is controllably linked with the control
unit 906 of the second propulsion unit 904 in order to remotely control operations of the second
propulsion unit 904.
[0088]           FIG. 10 illustrates the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 operating in
a different, second mode of operation where the first propulsion unit 900 de-links from the
second propulsion unit 904. The control unit 902 transmits a first de-linking signal 1004 to the
control unit 906 of the second propulsion unit 904 when the first propulsion unit 900 is to be
mechanically decoupled from the vehicle consist that includes the first and second propulsion
units 900, 904. The first de-linking signal 1004 includes a first replacement identity of the third
propulsion unit 1000 that is to be mechanically coupled to the vehicle consist to replace the first
propulsion unit 904.      The control unit 1002 of the third propulsion unit 1000 can transmit a
second linking signal 1006 to the control unit 906 of the second propulsion unit 1000 that
includes or represents an identity of the control unit 1002 (and/or an identity of the third
propulsion unit 1000). As described above, the third propulsion unit 1000 can be joined with the
vehicle consist to control the second propulsion unit 904 if the first replacement identity that is
received in the de-linking signal 1004 matches or otherwise corresponds to the identity that is
communicated in the linking signal 1006.
[0089]           FIG. 11 illustrates the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 operating in
a different, third mode of operation where the first propulsion unit 900 can operate as a remote
propulsion unit. Similar to as described above, the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit
900 can receive a third linking signal 1102 from the control unit 906 of the second propulsion
unit 904. The control unit 902 can compare an identity that is communicated in the third linking
signal 1102 with a designated identity that is stored in the memory 1100 of the first propulsion
unit 900 (or received from an operator, received from an off-board source, or the like). If the
identities match, then the control unit 902 may be controllably linked with the control unit 906 of
the second propulsion unit 904 such that the control unit 906 of the second propulsion unit 904
remotely controls operations of the first propulsion unit 900.
[0090]           In the third mode, the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 can receive
a second de-linking signal 1104 from the control unit 906 of the second propulsion unit 904. As
                                                   28

described above, the de-linking signal 1104 may be transmitted when the second propulsion unit
904 is to separate from the vehicle consist that includes the first propulsion unit 900. The second
de-linking signal 1104 can include a replacement identity of a control unit on another propulsion
unit.
[0091]          The control unit 1002 of the third propulsion unit 1100 transmits a fourth linking
signal 1106 to the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 when the third propulsion unit
1100 is to connect with the vehicle consist as a lead propulsion unit. The fourth linking signal
1106 includes an identity of the control unit 1002 of the third propulsion unit 1100 and/or an
identity of the third propulsion unit 1100. The control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900
compares the identity that is received via the fourth linking signal 1106 with the replacement
identity that is received via the de-linking signal 1104.       If the identities match or otherwise
correspond with each other (e.g., by identifying the same control unit and/or propulsion unit),
then the control unit 902 of the first propulsion unit 900 can be controllably linked with the
control unit 1002 of the third propulsion unit 1100 such that the control unit 1002 can remotely
control operations of the first propulsion unit 900.
[0092]          In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for controllably linking propulsion units, or
propulsion units, in a vehicle consist) includes transmitting a linking signal from a first lead
propulsion unit of a vehicle consist to a remote propulsion unit of the vehicle consist. The
linking signal includes a first identity of the first lead propulsion unit. The remote propulsion
unit and the first lead propulsion unit are controllably linked with each other when the first
identity of the first lead propulsion unit in the linking signal corresponds to a designated identity
that is stored onboard the remote propulsion unit. The remote propulsion unit allows the first
lead propulsion unit to remotely control operations of the remote propulsion unit when the first
lead propulsion unit and the remote propulsion unit are controllably linked. The method also
includes transmitting a de-linking signal from the first lead propulsion unit to the remote
propulsion unit when the first lead propulsion unit is to be mechanically decoupled from the
vehicle consist. The de-linking signal includes a replacement identity of a propulsion unit other
than the first lead propulsion unit that is to be mechanically coupled to the vehicle consist to
replace the first lead propulsion unit. The method further includes transmitting a replacement
linking signal from a second lead propulsion unit to the remote propulsion unit. The replacement
                                                   29

linking signal includes a second identity of the second lead propulsion unit.           The remote
propulsion unit and the second lead propulsion unit are controllably linked when the second
identity of the second lead propulsion unit corresponds to the replacement identity received at the
remote propulsion unit. The remote propulsion unit allows the second lead propulsion unit to
remotely control the operations of the remote propulsion unit when the second lead propulsion
unit and the remote propulsion unit are controllably linked.
[0093]          In one aspect, the remote propulsion unit prevents the first lead propulsion unit
from remotely controlling operations of the remote propulsion unit when the remote propulsion
unit is not controllably linked with the first lead propulsion unit.
[0094]          In one aspect, the remote propulsion unit prevents the second lead propulsion unit
from remotely controlling operations of the remote propulsion unit when the remote propulsion
unit is not controllably linked with the second lead propulsion unit.
[0095]          In another aspect, transmitting the linking signal occurs when both the first lead
propulsion unit and the remote propulsion unit are mechanically coupled with the vehicle consist.
[0096]          In another aspect, the method also includes inputting the designated identity into a
memory disposed onboard the remote propulsion unit.

identity in the linking signal to the replacement identity that is received onboard the remote
propulsion unit, and transmitting a confirmation signal from the remote propulsion unit to the
second lead propulsion unit that confirms that the second lead propulsion unit can control the
operations of the remote propulsion unit.
[0098]          In another aspect, at least one of transmitting the linking signal, transmitting the
de-linking signal, or transmitting the replacement linking signal occurs over a wireless
connection between the remote propulsion unit and one or more of the first lead propulsion unit
or the second lead propulsion unit.
[0099]          In another aspect, at least one of transmitting the linking signal, transmitting the
                                                   30

de-linking signal, or transmitting the replacement linking signal occurs over a wired connection
between the remote propulsion unit and one or more of the first lead propulsion unit or the
second lead propulsion unit.
[00100]         In another aspect, the method also includes storing the replacement identity in a
memory disposed onboard the remote propulsion unit so that the replacement identity in the de
linking signal can be compared to the second identity in the replacement linking signal when the
replacement linking signal is received.
[00101]         In another aspect, the remote propulsion unit and the second lead propulsion unit
are controllably linked in a distributed power system when the second identity in the replacement
linking signal corresponds to the replacement identity in the de-linking signal.
[00102]         In another aspect, transmitting the de-linking signal to the remote propulsion unit
notifies the remote propulsion unit that the first propulsion unit is to be mechanically decoupled
from the vehicle consist.

unit with a lead propulsion unit in a vehicle consist) includes receiving a linking signal from a
first lead propulsion unit of a vehicle consist at a remote propulsion unit of the vehicle consist.
The linking signal includes a first identity of the first lead propulsion unit. The method also
includes transmitting a first confirmation signal from the remote propulsion unit to the first lead
propulsion unit to controllably link the remote propulsion unit with the first lead propulsion unit.
The first confirmation signal is transmitted when the first identity of the first lead propulsion unit
in the linking signal corresponds to a designated identity that is stored onboard the remote
propulsion unit. The remote propulsion unit allows the first lead propulsion unit to remotely
control operations of the remote propulsion unit when the first lead propulsion unit and the
remote propulsion unit are controllably linked.
[00104]         The method further includes receiving a de-linking signal from the first lead

identity of a propulsion unit other than the first lead propulsion unit that is to be mechanically
                                                 31

coupled to the vehicle consist to replace the first lead propulsion unit. The method also includes
receiving a replacement linking signal from a second lead propulsion unit at the remote
propulsion unit, the replacement linking signal including a second identity of the second lead
propulsion unit, and transmitting a second confirmation signal from the remote propulsion unit to
the second lead propulsion unit to controllably link the remote propulsion unit with the second
lead propulsion unit, the second confirmation signal transmitted when the second identity of the
second lead propulsion unit corresponds to the replacement identity in the de-linking signal that
is received at the remote propulsion unit. The remote propulsion unit allows the second lead
propulsion unit to remotely control the operations of the remote propulsion unit when the second
lead propulsion unit and the remote propulsion unit are controllably linked.
[00105]        In another aspect, receiving the linking signal occurs when both the first lead
propulsion unit and the remote propulsion unit are mechanically coupled with the vehicle consist.
[00106]        In another aspect, the method also includes receiving the designated identity into
a memory disposed onboard the remote propulsion unit.
[001071        In another aspect, the method also includes confirming that the second lead
propulsion unit can control the operations of the remote propulsion unit by comparing the second
identity in the linking signal to the replacement identity that is received onboard the remote
propulsion unit, wherein transmitting the second confirmation signal is performed when the
second identity corresponds to the replacement identity.
[00108]        In another aspect, at least one of receiving the linking signal, receiving the de
linking signal, or receiving the replacement linking signal occurs over a wireless connection
between the remote propulsion unit and one or more of the first lead propulsion unit or the
second lead propulsion unit.
[00109]        In another aspect, at least one of receiving the linking signal, receiving the de
linking signal, or receiving the replacement linking signal occurs over a wired connection
between the remote propulsion unit and one or more of the first lead propulsion unit or the
second lead propulsion unit.
[00110]        In another aspect, the method further includes storing the replacement identity in
                                                 32

a memory disposed onboard the remote propulsion unit so that the replacement identity can be
compared to the second identity in the replacement linking signal when the replacement linking
signal is received.
[00111]         In another aspect, the remote propulsion unit and the second lead propulsion unit
are controllably linked in a distributed power system when the second identity in the replacement
linking signal corresponds to the replacement identity in the de-linking signal.
[00112]         In another aspect, the de-linking signal notifies the remote propulsion unit that the
first propulsion unit is to be mechanically decoupled from the vehicle consist.
[00113]         In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for de-linking a lead propulsion unit from a
remote propulsion unit in a vehicle consist) includes, in the vehicle consist having plural
propulsion units configured to propel the vehicle consist, transmitting a linking signal from a

mechanically decoupled from the vehicle consist. The de-linking signal includes a replacement
identity of a propulsion unit other than the first lead propulsion unit that is to be mechanically
