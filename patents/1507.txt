   Figure 7 is a flow chart of an embodiment; and
   Figures 8A to 8C are exemplary screen shots showing how
 5 the modified pay table can be applied in a scenario where
   the prizes for which the winning symbol combinations are
   modified are jackpot prizes.
   Detailed Description
10
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming machine
   having components that enable the implementation of a game
   where, in certain circumstances, the symbol combinations
   required to win at least one prize change for at least one
15 evaluation of a game outcome. In an advantageous
   embodiment, the gaming machine is arranged so that the
   symbol combination required to win the prize changes
   progressively over a series of game outcomes to become
   more likely to result in a winning outcome. In an
20 embodiment, the number of the series of game outcomes is
   determined by a random process. Longer series of game
   outcomes have a greater chance of the prize being won and
   the chance of the prize being won is higher towards the
   end of the series of game outcomes.
25
   General construction of gaming machine
   The gaming machine can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
30 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
35 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
                                            9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 6
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
 5 architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
10
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
15 gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
20 skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming machine has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
25 60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
30 outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
35 and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
                                             9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
 5 that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
10 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
15 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
20 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
25 A stand alone gaming machine 10 is illustrated in Figure
   2. The gaming machine 10 includes a console 12 having a
   display 14 on which are displayed representations of a
   game 16 that can be played by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of
   the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of buttons 22 for
30 enabling a player to interact with the gaming machine, in
   particular during game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses
   a credit input mechanism 24 which in this example includes
   a coin input chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.                Other
   credit input mechanisms may also be employed, for example,
35 a card reader for reading a smart card, debit card or
   credit card.   Other gaming machines may configure for
   ticket in such that they have a ticket reader for reading
                                             9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 8
   tickets having a value and crediting the player based on
   the face value of the ticker.   A player marketing module
    (not shown) having a reading device may also be provided
   for the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
 5 example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
10 by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
   to insertion of the player tracking device.

   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
20 panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
25 liquid crystal display.   The display 14 may any other
   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                       The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
30 Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
35 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
                                             9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               -  9
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
 5 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
10 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
15 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
20 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
25 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
30 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
35 the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
                                              9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 10
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
 5 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
10 controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
15 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
20 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
25 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
30 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
35 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
                                             9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 11
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
 5 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
10 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
15 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
20 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
25 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform

   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
35 provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
                                            9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.   In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
 5 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
10 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
15 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.    An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
20 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
25 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
30 separate server may be provided.    For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
35 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   Further detail of the gaming machine
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
 5 a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
   and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
   from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
   spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's wager
10 to be made up of a selection as to how the game outcome
   will be evaluated by specifying what parts of the game
   outcome will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier
   that will apply to each winning outcome. For example, a
   player's wager may be based on how many lines they play in
15 each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and an amount per line - e.g. one, two or five credits.
   Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
20 based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
25 symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
30 outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
35 embodiments, the player may select a number of reels to
   play or play a fixed number of reels. Games of this type
   are marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by
                                            9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 14
   Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and are also known
   as "ways" to win games. The selection of the reel means
   that each displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted
   for a symbol at one or more designated display positions.
 5 In other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
   positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
   form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
10 display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
15 number of active display positions of each reel, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
   the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
20
   In one embodiment, the display positions of the symbol
   display are arranged in a rectangular matrix comprising a
   plurality of columns and a plurality of rows. However,
   other arrangements are known in the gaming industry and
25 could be employed in embodiments of the invention. For
   example, in some arrangements there are more symbols in
   some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4-3 arrangement of
   seventeen display positions corresponding to respective
   ones of five reels. In such arrangements, the columns of
30 four symbols can be arranged so that they are off-set or
   staggered relative to the columns having three symbols so
   that the middle two symbols in the columns of four symbols
   share boundaries with two symbols of each neighbouring
   reel.
35
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 of the
   gaming machine 1 is shown implementing a number of modules
                                            9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 15
   based on program code and data stored in memory 64.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that one or
   more of the modules could be implemented in some other
   way, for example by a dedicated circuit.
 5
   In the embodiment of Figure 6, a player places a wager by
   selecting a number of lines to play and an amount to wager
   per line.  The outcome of a base game is generated by
   selecting symbols.  In this example, by selecting three
10 symbols to display in each of five columns from five reels
   of symbols corresponding to the respective reels. The
   symbols are displayed so as to form a matrix of symbol
   display positions.
15 In one example, the symbol selector 622A uses random
   number generator 621 to randomly select a stopping
   position for each of the five reels.
   In an example, the outcome evaluator 623 evaluates the
20 selected symbols to determine whether one or more winning
   symbol combinations can be found on a bought pay line.
   That is, a pay line which forms part of the player's
   selection of pay lines.  In an example, the outcome
   evaluator 623 does this by evaluating the symbols from
25 left to right relative to the defined pay lines.
   The pay table 642 defines the winning combinations of
   symbols associated with respective prizes.      For example,
   some prizes may require a player to have five of the same
30 symbol, others may require 4 of the same symbol, others
   may require three of the same symbol and others may
   require two of the same symbol to appear on a winning pay
   line.  The pay table 642 may also define scatter wins
   which are awarded for a defined number of symbols
35 independently of the position at which the symbols appear.
   In an example embodiment, the pay table 642 includes three
                                            9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                                - 16
    jackpot prizes which, in the base game, will be awarded by
    the outcome evaluator 623 if the outcome generator
    generates five of the specific jackpot symbols associated
    with the specific jackpot prizes on a bought pay line. For
  5 example, the pay table 642 may define an award for five
    grand jackpot symbols, five major jackpot symbols, and
    five minor jackpot symbols.    Depending on the embodiment,
    value of the jackpot prizes may either be fixed or may
    vary.    For example, one or more jackpot prizes may be a
10  progressive prize that is altered based on turnover of the
    gaming machine.   It will be appreciated that in order for
    such prizes to be awarded, each of the reels must include
    at least one jackpot prize symbol.
15  The symbols of the base game reels 641A specified by reel
    data 641 may include a WILD or a substitute symbol that
    substitutes for other symbols in some or all winning
    combinations.   For example, in an embodiment, a WILD
    symbol cannot substitute in a jackpot prize.
20
    In an embodiment, as shown in Figure 6, the gaming machine
    includes a free game controller 624 having a trigger
    determiner 624A which determines for every play of the
    game whether to award a series of free games using a value
25  obtained from random number generator 621.        In an example,
    the odds of a series of free games being triggered by the
    trigger determiner 624A are dependent on the amount
    wagered.   For example, the odds set out in Table 1 can
    apply.

     1 in 25 on bet 20 per line
    In an example as shown in Figure 6, the free game
    controller 624 also has a game round determiner 624B that
    randomly determines a number of game rounds to be
  5 conducted if the free games are awarded. That is, game
    round determiner 624B uses random number generator 624 to
    select a number of game rounds that will be conducted.                        In
    each game round a game outcome by selecting symbols from
    free game reels 641B.  In an example, the number of free
10  games conducted is randomly selected from the range of 3
    to 10 free games or "spins".
    In an example, the number of spins awarded is weighted
    based on the bet per line such that different average
15  numbers of spins will result from different wagers as set
    out in Table 2.
    Table 2
     Average of 3.88 spins on bet 1 per line
     Average of 4.10 spins on bet 2 per line
     Average of 4.23 spins on bet 3 per line
     Average of 4.52 spins on bet 5 per line
     Average of 4.66 spins on bet 10 per line
     Average of 5.57 spins on bet 20 per line
20
    In an example, once the number of game rounds is set, this
    is set as the initial value of counter 624C and the free
    game controller 624 causes the outcome generator 622 to
    repeatedly generate game outcomes until the counter
25  reaches "0".
    In an embodiment, the pay table modifier 627 is arranged
    to modify the pay table 642 before each spin of the series
    of spins.
30
                                              9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 18
   In an embodiment, the modifications are cumulative such
   that the modifications to the pay table 642 increase with
   the number of spins.
 5 In one example, there are four winning combinations that
   can be modified depending on the number of spins awarded.
   In an embodiment, the number of symbols required to win
   the respective prizes is progressively modified by the pay
   table modifier 627 as set out in Table 3.

   As indicated above, between 3 and 10 game rounds can be
   awarded and all the prizes are available in the base game.
   During the series of spins, free game reels 641B are used.
15 In an example, the outcome evaluator 623 only awards
   prizes for jackpot symbols. In an embodiment, in order to
   control the probability of jackpot prizes being awarded
   different reel sets of free game reels 641B are used for
   each free spin.
20
   As can be seen in the first round, the first jackpot (J1)
   combination has been reduced from a required 5 symbols to
   4 symbols while the number of symbols required of the
   other three jackpots remains the same.      Progressively, a
                                                9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 19
   further symbol is removed from the number of symbols
   required to have a winning combination in each of the game
   rounds in the manner defined by Table 1. Initially the
   symbols are removed in the sequence of the first jackpot,
 5 the second jackpot, the third jackpot and the fourth
   jackpot before reverting to the first jackpot such that a
   further symbol is removed from that jackpot in the fifth
   game round.   In the ninth round, rather than an additional
   symbol being removed from the first jackpot it is removed
10 by the pay table modifier 627 from the fourth jackpot and
   then in the last round, from the third jackpot.               In this
   example, the first jackpot is the highest prize and the
   fourth jackpot is the lowest prize.
15 In this way, the odds of a player winning a prize are
   increased dependent on the number of free spins that are
   awarded. Further, it is also more likely that should an
   award be made, it will be made in a later one of the game
   outcomes.
20
   In another embodiment, the game may have another feature
   game that involves conducting a number of free normal
   games using the base game reels 641A or a further set of
   reel.  In one example of such an embodiment, the free game
25 controller 624 is configured to determine whether to award
   a series of the jackpot free spins within each of those
   free games.
   Turning to Figure 7, there is shown a flowchart 700 of a
30 method of operating a gaming machine of the embodiment.
   In an embodiment, the gaming machine is in a waiting state
   until it receives a wager 705.   The gaming machine then
   conducts a base game and determines 715 whether to trigger
   the award of a series of free spins.    If it does not
35 trigger, it returns to a waiting state.     If it does
   trigger 715, the gaming machine determines a number of
   free spins  (N) and sets a counter to  (N) 720.         The pay
                                              9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 20
   table modifier 725 modifies the pay table 642 to apply to
   the first game outcome of the free spins.      The method then
   involves generating a free game outcome 730.          If the free
   game outcome is evaluated by the outcome evaluator 623 as
 5 including a winning outcome, then the gaming machine
   awards the relevant prize from the pay table. In this
   example, the relevant jackpot prize.   The counter is then
   reduced 745 by 1.   The gaming machine determines 770
   whether the counter has reached "0" and if it has not, a
10 further modification is made to the pay table 725 before a
   further free game outcome is generated.    The method 700
   involves repeating the relevant steps until the counter
   equals "0", at which time the game concludes.
15 Referring to Figures 8A -  8C there is shown a series of
   screen shots 800A, 800B and 800C of an example of how the
   application of modifications to the pay table can be
   effectively communicated to the player such that the
   player can quickly understand the current state of game
20 play.  A flame character 810A appears on the display over
   the reels when a trigger condition is satisfied.                The
   gaming machine displays a grand prize 820 and five dollar
   symbols 821-825 which indicate the number of symbols
   currently required to win the grand jackpot 820.                The
25 amount of the award of the grand jackpot is shown in box
   829.  Similarly, for major prize 830, dollar symbols 831
   835 indicate the number of symbols required to win the
   major jackpot prize 839.   Again, dollar symbols 841 -                   845
   indicate the number of symbols required to win the minor
30 jackpot prize 840 which has a display value 849 of $300.
   When the flame symbol 810A appears this communicates to
   the player that a trigger  condition has been met and that
   the number of symbols required to win one of the prizes is
35 going to be adjusted by the pay table modifier 627 for at
   least one game outcome. As is shown in Figure 8B, the
   flame symbol moves on the display to position 810B where
                                             9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 21
   it overlays the dollar symbols of major jackpot prize 830.
   The flame symbol is animated as burning away some of the
   dollar symbols.  The resultant outcome is shown in Figure
   8C where only dollar symbols 841 and 842 remain and blank
 5 spaces 843A, 844A, 845A are shown where the dollar symbols
   843, 844, 845 were previously displayed.    The flame
   character 810C is placed next to the prize for the major
   jackpot to further indicate to the player that this prize
   has been modified.
10
   Accordingly, it will be apparent that in the example of
   Figure 8, three symbols are removed at once.         Thus it will
   be appreciated that a number of different modifications
   can be applied to the symbol combinations required to win
15 prizes.
   Typically, a winning outcome will result in some form of
   award being made such as an award of credits. Such an
   award may never actually be physically received by a
20 player. For example, many gaming systems provide a player
   with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the player
   can double or forfeit their credits before commencing
   another play of the game or cashing out. Further, as
   credits are fungible, once credits have been added to the
25 credit meter it is not possible to distinguish between
   credits which exist because the player has input cash or
   the like and credits resulting from an award.
   Further aspects of the method of operating a gaming
30 machine will be apparent from the above description of the
   gaming machine. It will be appreciated that at least part
   of the method will be implemented electronically, for
   example, digitally by a processor executing program code
   such as in the above description of a game controller. In
35 this respect, in the above description certain steps are
   described as being carried out by a processor m, it will
   be appreciated that such steps will often require a number
                                            9814775_1 (GHMatters) P104332.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 22
   of sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
 5 may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
10 ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
15 be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
20 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
