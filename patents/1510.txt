FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[002]   The present invention relates to a hair styling device. In particular, but not by way of
limitation, the present invention relates to a hair styling device adapted to both straighten and
curl hair.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[003]   Existing straightening and curling hair-styling devices only perform a single function
they either straighten or curl hair. It is expensive and inconvenient to own two types of devices.
For example, each device may cost upwards of $100 or more and the space taken up by the two
devices is substantial, especially in small bathrooms with minimal storage space. Furthermore,
having multiple hair-styling devices creates a cluttered look, even in a professional hair styling
booth. Additionally, since many bathrooms and professional hair styling booths only contain a
single power outlet, having two devices that require power from a single outlet may create an
electrical hazard and may overload an electrical circuit.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[004]   Embodiments of the device disclosed herein are differentiated from prior art devices by
curling the hair from about the scalp to about the tips of the hair in a single sliding motion of
the device and comprises a single device to both straighten and curl hair.
                                                    1

[005]   One embodiment of the inventions comprises a hair styling device comprising a first
blade section, a second blade section, and a fin. One first blade section comprises an inner
blade surface and at least one first blade section heating element one of coupled to and
integrated with at least a portion of inner blade surface. The second blade section may be
rotatably coupled to the first blade section and the second blade section may comprise at least
one second blade section heating element substantially opposing the at least one first blade
section heating element. The at least one second blade section heating element may comprise
a substantially flat surface and at least one outer surface. The fin at least one of coupled and
integrated to the at least one outer surface.
[006]   Another embodiment of the invention comprises a method of styling hair. One such
method comprises positioning a first opening of a hair styling device comprising a first
heating element and a second heating element in a generally vertical position. A second
opening of the hair styling device may be placed in a generally horizontal position, with the
second opening comprising a generally perpendicular opening as compared to the first
opening. The hair may then be placed in the hair styling device and the hair styling device
may be moved along the hair. The first heating element and the second heating element may
contact the hair one of before and after the hair travels through the second opening, at which
point one of straightening and curling the hair occurs.
[007]   Yet another embodiment of the invention comprises a hair straightening/curling
device. One such device comprises a casing, at least one pair of substantially opposing
heating elements coupled to the casing, and at least one fin at least one of coupled and
integrated to the casing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[009] Turning first to FIG. 1, seen is one embodiment of a hair styling device 100 in a
closed position. One closed position may comprise a first device position. One hair styling
device 100 comprises a first blade section 102 and a second blade section 104. Each of the
first blade section 102 and the second blade section 104 may comprise a heating element 106,
which may also be referred to herein as a heating element pair. One such heating element
pair 506 runs about half the length 108 of the device, from a proximal device end 501 to a
center portion 503 of the device 500, as seen the open device position seen in FIG. 5. The
device 100 may also comprise a distal end 151, as seen in FIG. 1. As seen in FIG. 5, the
                                                 4

heating element pair 506 may comprise opposing substantially flat surfaces and may be
adapted to apply heat to hair. Furthermore, the heating element pair 506 may be one of
coupled and integrated to an inner surface 519 of each device section 502, 504. The inner
surface 519 may also be referred to herein as an inner blade surface. The portion of the inner
blade surface which the heating element pair 506 is coupled to may comprise a first portion
521 and at least part of the inner surface 519 may also comprise a substantially flat surface.
One heating element 506 may comprise a heating element distal end 557.
[0010] It is contemplated that throughout the application, the term "coupled" or any other
similar term may refer to attaching distinctly individual items to one another through a
coupling mechanism such as, but not limited to, a nut/bolt system, magnetic coupling
mechanism, or any other system known in the art. The term "integrate" or any other similar
term may refer to a single unitary embodiment, where appropriate.
[0011] Turning now to FIGS. 8A-8D, seen are cross-sectional views taken of the second
blade section 904 at varying locations seen in FIG. 9. For example, FIG. 8A shows the cross
sectional view of line 8A-8A in FIG. 9, located proximal the pivoting device 917. As seen in
FIG. 8A, the inner blade surface 819 of the second blade section 804 along line 8A-8A is a
substantially flat inner blade surface extending from a first outer surface location 823 to a
second outer surface location 827. At least a portion of the first blade section 802 may
comprise a correspondingly similar inner blade surface 819 and outer blade surface 877 as
those shown in FIGS. 8A-8D. Turning now to FIG. 8B, seen is a cross-sectional view of line
8B-8B of FIG. 9. As seen, instead of extending from the first outer surface location 823 of
FIG. 8A the inner blade surface 819 along line 8B-8B in FIG. 9 extends from a third outer
surface location 829. The third outer surface location 829 is located counter-clockwise
circumferentially as compared to the first outer surface location 823 in FIG. 8A.
Additionally, a tip of a device fin 840 may be formed at cross-section 8B-8B. Furthermore,
                                                5

the second outer surface location 827 has changed relative to FIG. 8A to the fourth outer
surface location 831, with the fourth outer surface location 831 being located at a counter
clockwise circumferential distance from the second outer surface location 827. There may
also be a curve 833 in the inner blade surface 819 near the fourth outer surface location 831.
As seen in FIG. 8C, along cross-sectional line 8C-8C in FIG. 9, the device fin 840 is larger
and there is a smaller curve 833 in the inner blade surface 819, while at section 8D-8D, the
full length 853 and size of the fin 840 is present and the inner surface 819 extends from an
inner fin base 837 to a fifth outer blade surface 839 in a substantially flat manner. A similar
cross-sectional view as the view seen along line 8D-8D may also be found to about the
proximal device end 901 in one embodiment.
[0012] Returning now to FIG. 1, one device 100 may be used to straighten curly hair and to
curl straight hair by sliding hair through the device 100 from about the base of the hair at or
near the scalp to the end of the hair at or near the tips, or wherever the sliding motion begins
and ends along the length of the hair. Seen in FIG. 2 is one embodiment of the device 200
being used with a first method to straighten hair 220. In order to implement the FIG. 2
method to straighten hair, and as seen in FIGS. 7A - 7D, a user may first change the device
700 from the substantially closed position seen in FIG. 7A to an of the first, second or third
open positions seen in FIGS. 7B-7D, respectively, in order to place hair between the heating
elements 506, as seen in FIG. 5. In moving the device 700 from the substantially closed
position seen in FIG. 7A to one of the open positions seen in FIGS. 7B-7D, the first blade
section 702 and/or the second blade section 704 may pivot about a distal device end 251,
using a pivoting device 217 as seen in FIG. 2.
[0013] As seen in the first open device position of FIG. 7B, the proximal end 701 of the
device 700 may be aligned to an x-y co-ordinate system. In opening the device 700, the first
blade section 704 and the second blade section 702 may be separated by a first x-distance 707
                                                  6

and a first y-distance 709 at the proximal end 701. The angle 711 at which the two sections
separate, as seen in the second open device position of FIG. 7C may be determined by the
angle 713 which the pivoting device 717 is one of coupled and integrated to at least one of
the first blade section 702 and the second blade section 704, as seen in the third open device
position of FIG. 7D. For example, the angle 713 may be the angle at which the distal end 251
rotates relative to an extension surface 747. One extension surface 747 may comprise an
inner surface on fin 740 and may be substantially perpendicular to an outer surface of the
heating element 706 on the second blade section 704. One heating element outer surface 569
may be seen in FIG. 5, with the FIG. 5 heating element outer surface 569 comprising a first
section 502 heating element 506. It is also contemplated that at least one of the one or more
fin dimensions (length, thickness, etc.) and the angle 711, 713 may affect one or more curl
features such as, but not limited to size, shape, direction, fullness, etc.
[0014] Upon opening the device 700 to, for example, the position seen in FIG. 7D, a person's
hair such as, but not limited to the hair 220 seen in FIG. 2 may be placed between the first
blade section 202 and the second blade section 204 and the device 200 may be returned to the
closed position seen in FIG. 7A. In one method, the device 200 may be placed at or near a
first end 212 of the hair 220, wherein the first end 212 of the hair 220 comprises a hair end
proximal a person's head or scalp. The hair may extend away from the person's head and
through the first opening 110 of the device, as seen in FIG. 1. The hair may then extend
between the heating element pair 106 and exit the device 100 through a second opening 130.
Returning now to FIG. 2, upon placing the hair 220 in the device 200 in such a manner, the
device 200 may then be pulled away from the person's head and towards a second end 214 of
the hair. One second end of the hair comprise and end of the hair 220 distal a person's head.
In one embodiment, the first opening 210 may be placed in a vertically upward position, as
seen in FIG. 2
                                                 7

[0015] Moving the hair 220 through the device 200 in such a manner - first between the
heating elements 206 and then proximal the inner surface 867 of the fin 840 as seen in FIG.
8D may straighten a person's hair - thereby changing hair from curly or wavy hair to
substantially or generally straight hair. As seen in FIG. 1, as the hair travels next to the fin
140, the hair may be pressed against the fin by an outer portion 149 of the first blade section
102. Straightening the hair 220 with the device 200 is performed by applying heat to the hair
220 prior to the device fin 140 contacts the hair 220. As seen in FIG. 1, the fin 140 may be
integrated to an outer surface 177 of the second blade section 104 and extends substantially
perpendicularly away from the second bade section heating element 106. However, other
angles are also contemplated.
[0016] Turning now to FIG. 3, seen is an example of curling hair in a first direction, wherein
one first direction comprises curling hair in a direction towards a person - where the curls
open towards a person's head. Similar to the FIG. 2 method of straightening a person's hair
with the device 200, in the FIG. 3 method of curling a person's hair 320 with the device 300,
the device 300 may first couple to the hair at or near the first end 312 of the hair. However,
in contrast to the straightening method of FIG. 2, the hair may enter the device 300 through
the second opening 130 seen in FIG. 1, extending between the heating element pair, and exit
the device 100 through the first opening 110 with the first opening 110 facing the person, as
seen by the first arrow 341 in FIG. 3. Upon placing the hair 320 in the device 300 in such a
manner, the device may then be pulled away from the person's head and towards the second
end 314 of the hair 320 in the direction seen by the second arrow 343. Pulling the device 300
away from the head moves the hair 320 through the device 300, which may curl a person's
hair - thereby changing hair from substantially or generally straight hair to substantially or
generally curly or wavy hair. Curling the hair 320 with the device 300 is performed by
                                                 8

applying heat to the hair 320 after the hair 320 enters the second opening 330 and contacts
the device fin 140, as seen in FIG. 1.
[0017] Turning now to FIGS. 4A and 12, seen is an example of curling hair 420, 1220 in a
second direction, wherein one second direction comprises creating hair curls where the curls
fall away or open away from a person's head. Similar to the FIG. 3 method of curing a
person's hair with the device 300, in the FIGS. 4A and 12 method of curling a person's hair
420, 1220 with the device 400, 1200, the hair 420, 1220 to be curled may be placed in the
device 400, 1200 between the heating elements 106 seen in FIG. 1, at or near the first end
412, 1212 of the hair. Further similar to the curling method of FIG. 3, the hair 420, 1220 may
enter the device 400, 1200 through the second opening 430 seen in FIG. 4B, extending
between the heating element pair, and exit the device 400 through the first opening 410. The
second opening 430 may be facing away from the person in FIGS. 4A and 12, as seen by the
first arrow 441, 1221. Therefore, the direction of the second opening 430, 1230 in the FIGS.
4A and 12 method may oppose the direction of the second opening 330 in the FIG. 3 method.
In one embodiment, the direction of the curl may be dependent upon the direction of the
second opening 430, 330, 1230. For example, in the FIGS. 4A and 12 method, the second
opening 430, 1230 may open away from a person and creates curls in a similar direction,
which opposes the direction of the curls with the FIG. 3 method - towards the person.
Therefore, it is contemplated that additional curl directions beyond towards a person and
away from a person as seen in FIGS. 3, 4A, and 12, respectively, are contemplated. In FIGS.
4A and 12, upon placing the hair 420, 1220 in the device 400, 1200 in such a manner, the
device 400, 1200 may then be pulled away from the first end 412, 1212 of the hair and
towards the second end 414, 1214 of the hair 400, 1200 in the direction shown by the second
arrow 443, 1243, thereby sliding the hair through the openings 410, 1210 and 430, 1230. Fig.
4B comprises a close-up of the placement of the device 400 when the FIGS. 4A and 12
                                                9

method are undertaken. The position of the device seen in FIG. 4B may comprise a second
device position.
[0018] Turning now to FIG. 5, seen is one embodiment of the device 500 in an open position,
as opposed to the closed position seen in FIGS. 1-4B. In order to open the device, in one
embodiment, at least one of the first blade section 502 may rotatably slide generally in a first
direction 160, 460, and/or the second blade section 504 may rotatable slide generally in a
second direction 170, 470 as seen in FIGS. 1 and 4B. Upon reaching the open position, a
person's hair 220, 320, 420 may be placed in the device between the heating elements 506
and at least one of the first blade section 502 and second blade section 504 may rotate in a
third direction and fourth direction substantially opposing the first direction 160, 460 and
second direction 170, 470 seen in FIGS. 1 and 4, thereby returning the device 100, 400 to the
closed position, at which point the methods described with reference to FIGS. 2-4B may be
implemented to straighten and/or curl the hair 220, 320, 420. It is also contemplated that the
first blade section 502 and/or the second blade section 504 may open in one or more non
rotatable manners known in the art such as, but not limited to, a clasping manner.
[0019] Turning now to FIG. 6, seen is an end view of one embodiment of a device 600. For
example, FIG. 6 is a representation of the device as seen from looking at the proximal end
101, 601 of the device 100, 600, as seen in FIGS. 1 and 6. As seen in FIG. 6, the device 600
may comprise a space 680 between the fin 640 and the first section 602, although the size of
the space 680 may be greater than or less than the space 680 seen in FIG. 6.
[0020] Turning now to FIG. 11, seen is a method 1185 of styling hair. The method starts at
1105 and at 1115 comprises positioning a first opening of a hair styling device in a generally
vertical position. Such a hair styling device may comprise the device 100 seen in FIG. 1 and
described herein. Such a vertical position may comprise a position where the first opening
110 generally faces upward or downward. At 1125, the method 1185 comprises positioning a
                                                 10

second opening of a hair styling device in a generally horizontal position, wherein the second
opening is generally perpendicular to the first opening. For example, the second opening 140
may generally towards or away from a user of the device, depending on whether the first
opening 110 is upwardly facing or downwardly facing. At step 1135, a person's hair may
then be placed in the device, similar to the images seen in FIGS. 2-4A. At step 1145, the
method 1185 comprises moving the hair styling device along the hair. For example, the
arrows 242, 343, 443 seen in FIGS. 2-4A show a direction the device may be moved along
the hair after coupling the device to the hair between the heating elements. At step 1155, the
method 1185 comprises contacting the hair with the first heating element and the second
heating element one of before and after the hair travels through the second opening. For
example, as seen in FIG. 3, the hair 320 contacts the heating elements 306 after traveling
through the second opening 330 as the device 300 is pulled in the direction shown by the
arrow 343, whereas in FIG. 2, the hair 220 contacts the heating elements 206 before traveling
through the second opening 230 as the device 200 is pulled in the direction shown by the
arrow 243. At step 1165, the method 1185 comprises one of straightening and curling the
hair. The method 1185 ends at 1175. In one embodiment, contacting the hair with the first
heating element and the second heating element before the hair travels through the second
opening, as seen in FIG. 2 may enable the device to straighten the hair.
[0021] One method 1185 may further comprise additional steps. One such step may
comprise pivotably separating the first heating element and the second heating element prior
to placing the hair in the hair styling device. For example, a first blade section 102 may
rotatably slide in the first direction 160 about the pivoting device 117 while the second blade
section 104 may rotatably slide in the second direction 170 about the pivoting device 117.
One device 110 may also rotate in only one of the first direction 160 and second direction
170.
                                                 11

[0022] In another method 1185, positioning the first opening 310 in a generally vertical
position may comprise positioning the first opening 110 in a generally upward vertical
position, as seen in FIG. 3. Furthermore, positioning a second opening 330 in a generally
horizontal position may comprise positioning the second opening 330 towards the person's
head, as also seen in Fig. 3. The curls created with such a configuration may comprise curls
opening towards the person's head. Through multiple applications of such a method, a
plurality of curls may be created in the hair 320, with each of the curls opening towards the
person's head.
[0023] As seen in FIG. 1, it is further contemplated that the first opening 110 and the second
opening 130 are separated by an angle 161 and the second opening may comprise an opening
proximal a device fin 140 having a length 853 and a width 863, as seen in FIG. 8D. The fin
840 may also comprise one or more shapes. For example, in FIG. 8D, the fin 840 comprises
a substantially flat inner surface 867 and a generally rounded outer surface 862 meeting at a
point 871. However, each of these features may comprise different shapes or dimensions.
Regardless, it is contemplated that at least one of one or more fin dimensions and the angle
161 may affect the curl dimensions, size, shape, and any other curl feature. Similarly,
positioning a first opening 110 in a generally downward vertical position and positioning a
second opening 130 generally away from the person's head, as seen in FIG. 4A may
comprise creating curls in the hair that open away from the person's head.
[0024] Turing now to FIG. 10, seen is a hair styling device 1000 with an inner blade surface
1067 having a first inner blade surface portion 1083, a second inner blade surface portion
1082, and a third inner blade surface portion 1081. Each of the first inner blade surface
portion 1083, second inner blade surface portion 1082, and third inner blade surface portion
