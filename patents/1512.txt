[0001] The invention is directed to image scanning systems and, more particularly, to
optical scanning systems which scan images of objects as they are transported along a
conveying system and methods of such scanning.

                                  Background Description
[0002] Line scan imaging of objects transported on a conveying system typically
requires that the optical components, e.g., sensing element of a camera, be parallel to
the surface of the object that is being scanned. In conveyor applications, this forces
the optical components to be mounted directly below the equipment, for bottom
scanned images. However, the environment below the conveying system is full of
airborne debris that is difficult to manage, which coats the camera optics and mirror.
To this end, bottom scan applications require frequent cleaning, which over time
degrades the mirrors and optical elements and hence eventually degrades the quality
of the images acquired by the system.
[0003] To account for the airborne debris, previous efforts have focused on reducing
the airborne debris. This includes shielding panels to protect the optical components.
However, shielding panels are difficult to install, are costly and obstruct many of the
components for maintenance. Another solution is to use transparent plates as viewing
ports. These plates, though, become loaded with debris, typically get scratched and
                                               1

 1002030151
become hazy, and add cost. Another approach is to use vacuum or air knife systems.
These systems require additional power, controls and maintenance, in addition to
adding costs and contributing to noise within the facility.
 [0004] Top scan applications, on the other hand, require the optical elements, e.g.,
sensing element of the camera, to be placed directly over the conveying system.
Maintenance and adjustments are difficult to perform particularly while the objects
are moving on the conveying system. In fact, with top scan applications, maintenance
requires the conveying system to be stopped, or provide some means of safe access
while the conveying system is running. There is also the issue of glare reduction,
which can be reduced by angling the "scan line plane". Such angling of the scan line
plane, though, requires additional conveyor length for top scan applications; whereas,
for bottom scanning applications, the angle reduces the effective viewing slot for light
to pass through such that a wider gap between adjacent belts or other conveyances
may be needed.

       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
[0015] The invention is directed to image scanning systems and, more particularly, to
optical scanning systems which scan images of objects as they are transported along a
conveying system and methods of such scanning. In embodiments, the image
scanning system includes an optical system comprising a combination of a mirror and
camera oriented such that the scan line can be tilted above and/or below the optimal
focus points, while still acquiring an acceptably focused image. This allows the image
scanning system (e.g., camera and/or mirror) to be moved away from the conveying
system and, more particularly, away from directly beneath or above the conveyor
system.
                                            4

1002030151
[0016] As one of skill in the art would understand, the projected scan line typically
has to be parallel to the surface being scanned so that every pixel on the sensor is at
the optimal focus and of uniform scale. Any tilting off the surface being scanned will
cause the spatial resolution to change as a gradient from smaller (pixels that are
further from the surface) to larger (pixels that are closer to the surface). In a tilted
configuration, with the center pixel in perfect focus, the further the pixel is from this
"optimal focus pixel", the more the focus will degrade.
[0017] However, implementations of the present invention use cameras with large
depths of focus which no longer have to be constrained in the above manner and, in
accordance with aspects of the invention, can now be positioned such that the scan
lines can be tilted as described herein. That is, in embodiments, the ends of the scan
line can be tilted off the focal plane. In combination with using distortion correction
algorithms, it is possible to correct for resolution variations that may result from the
titled scan lines. For example, dynamic rescaling of images, as is known to those of
skill in the art, can be used to correct for gradient compression distortion. The
distortion correction for a dynamic focusing application would also correct for any
trapezoidal perspective effect.
[0018] Thus, given the improvements in sensor sensitivity, e.g., the depth of focus of
camera systems can be increased by using tighter apertures, the scan line can be tilted
above and/or below the optimal focus points, and still acquire an acceptably focused
image. This orientation, in embodiments, can remove the camera and mirror
configuration from below the conveyor system. More specifically, in embodiments,
the mirror and camera system can be positioned above, below or on a side of the
                                               5

1002030151
object to be scanned, and the scan line can be tilted (e.g., further from the optimal
focus points) while still acquiring an acceptably focused image. In embodiments, any
distortion that may result from the positioning of the image scanning system is similar
to the perspective distortion that currently exists and which can be corrected for with
rescaling operations known to those of skill in the art.
[0019] Advantageously, for bottom scanned imaging applications, the placement of
the mirror and camera system allows the camera and/or mirrors to reside in a much
cleaner environment, reducing maintenance, e.g., cleaning. The placement of the
mirror and camera system will also eliminate the need for additional, costly
equipment to filter the debris from the air below the conveyor system. Also, this
allows a narrower gap so that smaller objects will not fall within the gaps or jump
when crossing the gap thus enabling improved image capture, e.g., a more stable
image. In top scan applications, the positioning of the mirror and camera system will
allow shorter conveying systems and the placement is better suited for maintenance
without having to stop the conveying system or provide means of safe access while
the belts or other conveyances are running.
[0020] FIGS. la and lb show a bottom scanning image system according to aspects
of the present invention. In particular, the bottom scanning image system 100 includes
a camera 110 and a mirror 120 positioned such that the projected scan line 140 is
provided at an angle "x" with respect to a conveying system 130, e.g., scan line titled
at about 200 in one embodiment. In embodiments, the projected scan line 140 can be
titled at other angles "x" such as, e.g., +/- 450 as a non-limiting illustrative example,
relative to a plane of an imaged surface. Accordingly, in embodiments, the ends of the
                                               6

1002030151
scan line can be tilted off the focal plane. In embodiments, the scanning plane 140a is
also perpendicular to the conveyor surface 130.
[0021] In further embodiments of the bottom scanning application, the tilting of the
scan line allows the camera 110 and the mirror 120 to be positioned on a side of the
conveyor system 130 to minimize any debris falling on the optical components. That
is, the camera 110 and the mirror 120 can be positioned away from a gap or space
130a formed between belts of the conveying system 130. It should also be understood
that multiple cameras and mirrors can be positioned on different sides of the conveyor
system 130 as represented in dashed lines of FIG. la.
[0022] In addition, in bottom side applications, the positioning of the scanning image
system, e.g., camera 110 and mirror 120, will allow more light to be driven through a
gap or spacing 130a between adjacent belts of the conveying system 130 making the
camera 110 easier to align. In this way, the projected scan line 140 can project
through a narrower gap or spacing 130a (see, e.g., FIG. lb) between adjacent belts or
other conveyances of the conveying system 130 (compared to conventional systems).
For example, the gap or spacing 130a can be less than an inch; although, this spacing
can be dependent on the type of conveyances used, e.g., knife edge belts vs. large
diameter rollers.
[0023] Also, by having the camera 110 and the mirror 120 offset from the conveying
system 130, the cameras and other optics are much more accessible for setup and
maintenance, compared to being positioned directly below the conveying system 130.
Moreover, glare can be considerably reduced as a direct result of the tilted view, e.g.,
the "glare reduction angle" is maintained from the side.
                                              7

1002030151
[0024] FIG. 2 shows a top scanning image system according to aspects of the present
invention. In embodiments, the top scanning image system 200 can be combined with
the bottom scanning image system 100 shown in FIGS. la and 1b, as represented in
dashed lines of FIG. 2.
[0025] The image system 200 includes a camera 110 and a mirror 120 positioned to
the side of the conveying system 130, rather than directly over the conveying system.
In additional or alternative embodiments, the mirror 120 can be positioned above the
conveying system 130. In embodiments, the scan line can be provided at an angle "x",
e.g., scan line tilted at about 200; although other angles "x" are also contemplated by
the invention as already described herein. In embodiments, the scanning plane 140a is
also perpendicular to the conveyor surface 130.
[0026] The ability to have the scanning plane perpendicular to the conveyor surface
creates additional opportunities. For example, in top side scanning applications, less
conveyance length is required to scan taller vs. shorter items (compared to
conventional systems). That is, in the configuration shown in FIG. 2, for example,
because the glare angle is accomplished by the side angle tilt, it allows the scan line
plane to be perpendicular to the surface, which minimizes the necessary conveyor
length. With this flexibility, the cameras and mirrors can also be placed at the side of
the conveyor, where they are easier to access. In addition, the mounting structures,
representatively shown at reference numeral 150, can be less complicated, since they
do not have to span over the conveyor system 130.
[0027] As representatively shown in FIG. 3, if a "folding mirror" is used to redirect
the scanning plane, the triangular scanning plane's bisector segments would typically
                                              8

1002030151
have to form a plane that remains orthogonal to the scanning plane. While this is not
required, it simplifies aligning the scan line with the surface being imaged. If the scan
line is allowed to tilt off of the plane, of the surface being imaged, then the orientation
and location of the mirror is much more flexible.
[0028] FIG. 4 shows a side view of a gap 130a between conveyance systems 130 in
accordance with aspects of the invention. FIG. 4 shows a conventional glare angle 170
and a glare angle 180 enabled by aspects of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 4,
the glare angle 180 allows more light into the available gap 130a. As the present
invention enables light to be illuminated from the side of the conveying system, it is
now possible to take advantage of the full available width of the gap 130a, compared
to being underneath the conveying system which does not provide the same
advantages.
[0029] FIG. 5a shows an implementation of a side scanning image system according
to aspects of the present invention. In particular, in this implementation, the side
scanning image system 200' includes a camera 110 positioned to the side of the
conveying system 130, with a tilted scan line 140. In embodiments, the scanning
plane 140a may be perpendicular to the conveyor surface 130. In this embodiment,
as well as other embodiments implementing aspects of the present invention, the
mirror can be eliminated thus significantly decreasing system costs and maintenance.
In further embodiments, by implementing aspects of the present invention it is
possible to image a top and sides of the object with a single camera.
[0030] FIG. 5b shows a comparison of a conventional side scanning image system
300, without a mirror, and the side scanning image system 200' in accordance with
                                               9

1002030151
aspects of the invention, without a mirror. As shown in this comparison, the
conventional system 300 includes a camera 110' which is positioned farther away
from the object being scanned than that of the side scanning image system 200' of the
present invention. In a non-tilted scan line implementation without the use of a
mirror, as shown in the conventional system 300, this is needed in order to provide a
larger scan projection (e.g., standoff distance) to capture the entire object. In
comparison, though, by providing a side scanning image system 200', a shorter
standoff distance is required for full object coverage. Accordingly, by implementing
the side scanning image system 200', there is no longer a need to include a mirror,
which would otherwise be required for folding the scan projection for a conventional
system, so as to minimize it's interference with surrounding equipment and aisle
ways.
[0031] In this way, the side scanning image system 200' of the present invention can
be as compact as a conventional system which uses a folding mirror. In addition,
limited space or, alternatively, costly space, in many facilities would have to be used,
as a conventional system 300, without a folding mirror, would require the camera 110
to be in an aisle or even require an increased ceiling height.

purpose of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present
invention. While the present invention has been described with reference to
