                                     AN ADDITIVE FOR POLYMER
FIELD
The invention claims an additive for polymer A, and by the components of the additive composition,
polymer compositions, and their use as light stabilizers.
BACKGROUND
The benzotriazole compound is widely applied to field of polymer additive can be used for light stabilizer
that is known to be a different method to synthesize, primarily from azobenzene compound as raw material,
carrying out cyclization according to different reduction technique. the existing reduction method with
hydrazine hydrate reduction method, zinc powder reducing method, sulphide reduction method and so on.
Obtain the benzotriazole light stabilizer taking hydrazine hydrate as reducing agent to one-step method,
patent reporter with US4001266, DE2454889, FR2292708, and so on; the other one kind of method is
hydrazine hydrate-zinc powder. is azobenzene compound as raw material, using the hydrazine hydrate as
the reducing agent, reducing the azobenzene compound into intermediate. benzotriazole nitrogen, then
using zinc powder as reducing agent to the intermediate benzotriazole nitrogen oxides is benzotriazole light
stabilizer. patent of reporter JP53063379, patent CN1455773A.
Another method is the hydrazine hydrate-insurance powder method, the method is the azobenzene
compound as raw material takes hydrazine hydrate as reducing agent, reducing the azobenzene compound
into intermediate benzotriazole nitrogen, then using sodium hydrosulfite as reducing agent to the
intermediate benzotriazole nitrogen oxides is benzotriazole light stabilizer. patent of the reporter with
CN101029032A.
The benzotriazole compound as an additive for polymer, and generally for light stabilizer, when melt
molding heat treatment, before processing and after processing with a characteristic viscosity property
changes the problem that the physical property change caused by the unevenness of the mechanical
physical property change or quality of the obtained molded product. Therefore, strong desires to acquire
stability of people can make said heating processing, that maintain high levels of polymer stability. by the
inventor through large research surprisingly discovered that when specific content of
phosphorus-containing substance is added in the benzotriazole compound, it can make the corresponding
polymer-retention stability is obviously improved.
SUMMARY
The purpose of the invention is to provide an additive A for the polymer, the additive A by adding micro
phosphorus-containing substance in the benzotriazole compound, and it can evidently improve the retention
stability of the polymeric articles.
