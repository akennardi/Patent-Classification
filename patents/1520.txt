               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[0006]       A load frame indicated generally at 10 in FIG. I is shown schematically and is used
for loading a test specimen also shown schematically at 11. The specimen I1 is located in the
interior of an environmental chamber 12 forming an enclosure with a pair of end walls 13 (FIG.
2). The chamber 12 can be disposed within another enclosure 17. The chamber 12 is supported
relative to the load frame 10 in any desired manner, the details of which are not pertinent to the
present invention disclosure. As illustrated, the load frame 10 has a base 14, a pair of upright
columns 15 and a cross head 16. The cross head 16 supports a test specimen holder 20 having
aspects of the present disclosure. A similar, if not identical, test specimen holder 21 is illustrated
at a lower end of the environmental chamber 12. In the embodiment illustrated, the test specimen

                                                  -4
 holder 21 is coupled to an actuator (indicated schematically at 19) that is located in the base 14 to
 apply loads or displacements. Such actuators are well known, the details of which are not
pertinent to the present disclosure. A load cell 18 is often provided to measure applied loads.
 [00071      At this point, it should be noted aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to the
 load frame 10 of the exemplary embodiment, nor are aspects of the present disclosure limited to
only applying loads to the test specimen 11, although aspects of the present disclosure are
particularly advantageous when loads are applied since such loads are applied through the test
specimen holders 20 and 21.
 [00081      Environmental chambers are commonly used to subject the test specimen 11 to high
temperature environments in order to obtain measurements indicative of properties of the test
specimen 11. Since at least portions of the test specimen holders 20 and 21 are also subjected to
the same or similar environment as the test specimen, the test specimen holders 20 and 21 must
perform satisfactory when subjected to the high temperature environment. In the case of load
frames such as load frame 10, the test specimen holders 20, 21 transmit or impart loads to the test
specimen 11; and therefore, they must impart these loads when the holders 20, 21 are also
operating in the high temperature environment. In some cases, a user may want to perform a test
at a temperature that exceeds the operating temperature of the test specimen holders 20 and/or,
21, of the operating temperature being defined by the materials upon which they are made from.
 [0009]     An aspect of the present disclosure provides test specimen holders 20, 21 that can be
used to hold a test specimen 11 when it is desired to subject the test specimen 11 and at least
portions of the test specimen holders 20 and/or 21 to a temperature that would otherwise not be
practical, or even possible, given the material that the portion of the test specimen holders 20, 21
are made from.
[0010]      Referring to test specimen holder 21 illustrated in FIG. 3 by way of example, the
holder 21 includes a specimen engaging portion 30 that is configured to selectively engage the
test specimen 11. A temperature modifying structure 32 is coupled to and/or is formed part of the
specimen engaging portion 30. The temperature modifying structure 32 can include one or more
of the features described hereinafter.
[0011]      One aspect of the temperature modifying structure 32 can include one or more shields
34 disposed at least proximate to at least a part of specimen engaging portion 32. In the
embodiment illustrated, the shield 34 is coupled to the specimen engaging portion 32. The shield

                                                 -5
34 can be disposed at least proximate the specimen engaging portion 30 so as to form a cavity or
gap 36 herein, by way of example an annular cavity about the specimen engaging portion 30
formed between an inwardly facing surface of the shield 34 and an outwardly facing surface of
the specimen engaging portion 30 (herein extension 70).
 [0012]      In the embodiment illustrated, the shield 34 is fixedly attached to the specimen
engaging portion 30. A gap passageway 38 can be provided to allow fluid flow out of the gap or
cavity 36. In the embodiment illustrated, the gap passageway 38 comprises one or more ports
provided through the material of the shield 34. If a plurality of gap passageways 38 are provided,
typically, such passageways 38 are disposed in the shield 34 at angular intervals about the
specimen engaging portion 30.
 [0013]      In the embodiment illustrated, a second shield 39 is provided and is also at least
disposed proximate to a part of the specimen engaging portion 30, herein, being fixedly attached
thereto by way of example by being coupled to shield 34. Preferably, a second gap or cavity 40 is
formed between surfaces of the shields 34 and 39. Herein, the second cavity or gap 40 is also
annular with respect to the specimen engaging portion 30. A second gap passageway 42 allows
fluid flow out of the second gap or cavity 40. In this example, the second gap passageway 42
comprises a continuous annular opening about the specimen engaging portion 30 formed from
the fact that the second shield 39 is coupled to the first shield 34 only at one end 43 proximate to
the test specimen 11.
[00141      In FIG. 3, an alternative to the open gap passageway 42 is illustrated at 42A.         A
cavity 42A is created by sealing the ends 49 and 51 and pulling a vacuum on the space which
removes the air from the cavity 42. The cavity 42 under vacuum contains no, or substantially no,
matter, and therefore is a barrier to the passage of heat. It is also contemplated to fill the cavity
with a gas, such as argon, that does not readily transfer heat. It is contemplated that the sealed
cavity 42A could be used in conjunction with the gap passageways 38 and/or 42 or as a
replacement for some or all gap passageway 38 and/or 42.
[0015]      In the embodiment illustrated, the shield 34 engages or otherwise is held closely
proximate to the specimen engaging portion 30 at an end 44 remote from the test specimen 11
and end 43. This construction is provided so as to cause most if not all of fluid flow through the
gap passageway(s) 38.

                                                  -6
 [0016]      However, it should be noted that an annular opening similar to gap passageway 42
can be provided between the shield 34 and the specimen engaging member 30 in addition, or in
the alternative, to the gap passageway 38 herein illustrated. For instance, a gap passageway
comprising an annular opening between shield 34 and the specimen engaging portion 30 in a
manner similar to gap passageway 42 may be desired when only a single shield 34 is being used.
[0017]       Use of passageways, such as the annular opening 42, is particularly advantageous for
this structure and causes fluid flow out of the cavity connected thereto to be directed away from
the test specimen 11. It should be understood that the annular opening 42 located at the end or
proximate to the end of the shield 34 and/or 39 is not limited to a continuous annular opening,
but rather, can be one or more port openings if one or more portions of the shield at end 44
remote from the test specimen 11 are coupled to the specimen engaging portion 30 directly or
through another shield.
[0018]       At this point it should be noted the specimen engaging portion 30 is disposed within
the environmental chamber 12, while a portion thereof or another portion of the test specimen
holder 21, extends through an opening 50 provided in the wall 13 of the environmental chamber
12 as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, one or more of the
gap passageways 38, 42 (if more than one shield is provided) is disposed so as to cause fluid
flow to be directed at the opening 50 or otherwise cause fluid flow through the opening 50. In the
embodiment illustrated, the wall 13 of the chamber 12 is disposed about the shield 39 so that
fluid flow out of the gap passageway 42 is external to the interior of the chamber 12 where the
test specimen 11 is located.
[0019]      Another aspect of the present invention includes causing fluid to flow from the gap or
cavity 36 and/or 40 out through the corresponding gap passageway where the fluid is expelled
into the environment surrounding the test specimen holder 21. In a particularly advantageous
embodiment, fluid is provided to the gap(s) or cavity (cavities) 36 and/or 40 through an internal
passageway 74 provided in the specimen engaging portion 30 or a portion of the test specimen
holder 21 connected thereto.
[0020]      The test specimen holder 21 includes an extension 70 that extends from a base portion
72 of the test specimen holder 21, commonly located outside of the chamber 12. The extension
70 supports the test specimen engagement portion 30 on the base 72. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the

                                                 -7
extension 70 can extend through the opening 50 provided in the chamber 12. Cavity 36 is fluidly
coupled to an internal passage 74 of the extension 70.
 [0021]      The internal passageway 74 also extends through the opening 50 and is fluidly
coupled to a fluid supply source 78. The fluid supply source 78 can take any number of forms
including a pressurized container, pump, fan, or the like. In the embodiment illustrated, the
 internal passageway 74 is fluidly coupled to a passageway 80 in base 72 wherein an inlet port is
provided at 82.
 [0022]      An aspect of the disclosure includes is using fluid flowing through the internal
passageways of the extension 70 and/or flowing through the gap(s) 36, 40 and/or other
passageways to cool or lower the temperature of the specimen engaging portion 30 and/or
extension 70 so that they can be used in environmental chambers 12 heated to a temperature in
excess of what these components could otherwise operate without such measures taken given the
materials that they are made of.
 [0023]      Referring to FIG. 2, commonly testing of a test specimen includes heating a portion
(e.g. center portion 81) to a desired temperature.     In many tests, a temperature gauge 91 is
provided so as to monitor the temperature. In addition to achieving the desired temperature, in
many cases it is also necessary that the temperature be constant over an axial length (between the
holders 20, 21) of the portion 81 of the test specimen under test. In other words, it is often
desired that a certain temperature gradient be obtained over the portion 81 under test, typically a
very small gradient.
[0024]       To control the temperature in an environmental chamber 12, the environmental
chamber 12 commonly includes a plurality of heating elements to emit radiant heat energy. In
one form of environment chamber 12, three heating elements 83A, 83B and 83C (schematically
illustrated) are provided where a center heating element 83B is disposed proximate the test
specimen 11 and in particular the portion 81 under test, while end heating elements 83A and 83C
are disposed so as contribute heat at the end portions of the environmental chamber 12 proximate
the ends of the test specimen holders 20, 21.
[0025]       Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, it has been found that using one or more of the
temperature modifying structures      32 herein described, and in particular, fluid flow from the
supply 78 through the gap(s) 36, 40 can be used to maintain the temperature of the specimen
engaging portion 30 and/or extension 70 or other components of the holder 21 in the chamber 12

                                                  -8
 so as to operate (herein transfer or impart desired load), whereas the portion 81 of the test
 specimen 1 is heated (maintaining a desired temperature gradient) to a temperature in excess of
 the temperature of the specimen engaging portion 30, etc.
 [0026]       For example, it has been found that the portion 81 can be heated to 1200'C, while the
 specimen engaging portion 30, the extension 70, etc. does not exceed 1000'C by flowing fluid
 through gap(s) 36, 40 and connected passageways. Typically, the fluid is a gas, for example but
 not limited to air, inert gases, etc. The degree or extent of the cooling provided to the specimen
 engaging portion 30, extension 70, etc. can be varied by varying the type fluid, the temperature
 of the fluid into the holder 21 and the rate at which the fluid is provided. If desired, the fluid can
 even be provided from the source 78 as a liquid, wherein energy is absorbed and a change in
 state to a gas occurs, where gas is emitted from the passageway(s) 38, 42.
 [00271       Referring to FIG. 8, a controller 95, that is schematically illustrated, commonly is
provided. The controller 95 can receive data indicative of the test specimen II during the test.
 With the load frame 10, such inputs data can include a measurement of load 200 applied to the
test specimen I1 from the load cell 18 and/or a measure of displacement indicative of extension
 or compression of the test specimen 11 under load from an extensometer, not shown. These are
 but merely examples and may or may not form part of the present invention.
 [0028]       As indicated above, the controller 95 can also receive a first temperature input 202
from temperature gauge 91. If desired, each of the holders 20, 21 can also include temperature
gauges 98A, 98B, respectively, each of which provides a temperature input 204, 206,
respectively, to controller 95 indicative of the temperature of the corresponding holder 20, 21,
and in one embodiment the specimen engaging portion 30 of each. Such temperature gauges are
well known.
 [0029]       Controller 95 can be configured to provide control signals 208 to supply 78 to adjust
any of the aforementioned parameters (e.g. temperature of fluid, rate of flow, pressure, etc.). In
one embodiment, a user can operate a user interface of controller 95 so as to manually adjust one
or more of these parameters based on any one or more of the temperature inputs received, for
example, the temperatures of the specimen 11 or the holders 20, 21 at 210, 212 and 214,
respectively. In a further embodiment, controller 95 can automatically adjust one or more of
these parameters based on parameters based on any one or more of the temperature inputs

                                                 -9
received, for example, the temperatures of the holders 20, 21.       The controller 95 also can be
configured to send a signal 216 to the actuator in response to the signal 200.
[00301      FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary method 200 for automatic adjustment of the supply 78
so as to maintain the desired temperature on each of the holders 20, 21. At step 202, the desired
temperature for the test portion 81 is entered into controller 95, for example, through a suitable
user interface. At step 204, the controller 95 can operate heaters 83A, 83B and 83C to obtain the
desired temperature. Throughout method 200, controller 95 receives temperature signals from
the aforementioned temperature gauges 91, 98A, and 98B.          The controller 95 then remains in
step 206 where the heaters 83A, 83B and 83C are operated, if necessary, to maintain the desired
temperature of the portion 81. More importantly though, controller 95 adjusts parameters of the
fluid provided to the holders 20, 21 and in particular to gap(s) 36, 40 in order to maintain the
temperature of the holder 20, 21 at a desired temperature within the operating range of each
holder 20, 21, which is less than the temperature of the portion 81. By controlling the parameters
of the fluid provided to the holders 20, 21 the temperature of the holders 20, 21 can be precisely
adjusted.
 [0031]     It is important to note that in a one embodiment, the controller 95 does not merely
controlled the supply 78 so as to obtain any desired temperature that is less than the temperature
that the holder 20, 21 should operate below. Rather, the controller 95 controls the supply 78
and/or heaters 83A, 83B and 83C so as to obtain a temperature of the holder 20, 21 that is within
the desired operating range, but does not cool the specimen engaging portion 30 so as to cause an
undesired temperature gradient across the portion 81 of the test specimen 11.
 [00321     Referring to FIG. 3, although not required, the test specimen holder 21 comprises an
 actuatable assembly for selectively gripping and releasing the test specimen 11. As illustrated in
the exemplary embodiment, the base 72 comprises an actuator (e.g. manually operated, hydraulic
 or pneumatic, etc.) that has an outer cylinder body section 100 with an actuator end cap 101 held
thereon to form an internal chamber 102 in which a piston 103 and extending rod portion 104 are
 mounted. The piston 103 has a second rod portion 105 (which can be a separate part or integral
with piston 103 being formed of a single unitary body) that extends out through an opening in
the base of the cylinder body 100. Rod portion 105 is connected through suitable connections
 such as a threaded connection to a rod of the actuator 19 that is mounted in the base 14 of the
 load frame 10.

                                                -10
[0033]       Generally, a fluid passageway 80 is provided from port 82 in base 72 to passageway
74 so as to be fluidly coupled to cavity or gap 36. In the embodiment illustrated, internal
passageway 74 in extension 70 includes an inner bore 110 and lateral passageways 112 which
fluidly couple the inner bore 110 with the gap or cavity 36. Rod 104 also includes internal
passageways 116 that fluidly couple the inner bore 110 to the port 82.
[0034]       It should be understood that this is but one embodiment, the particular structure of
which however has advantages when the specimen holder 21 includes the actuator component. In
particular, cylinder body 100 moves relative to piston 103 in order to cause specimen engaging
portion 30 to engage or release the test specimen 11. Extension 70 is fixedly coupled or formed
integral with cylinder body 100 as a single unitary body, so that extension 70 moves with
cylinder body 100 relative to rod 104.
[00351       In the embodiment illustrated, specimen engaging portion 30 includes a test specimen
receiver 101 that can be selectively compressed to engage the test specimen 11. Extension 70
includes an inwardly extending annular flange 107 that engages the test specimen receiver 105.
The test specimen receiver 105 and annular flange 107 are configured such that displacement of
the extension 70 (in FIG. 3 downwardly) compresses the test specimen receiver 105 so as to grip
the test specimen 11 without imparting tension in the test specimen 11 between the holders 20
and 21. It should be understood that the test specimen receiver 105 can take other configurations.
[0036]       Referring to FIGS. 3 and 5 where similar or identical parts have been identified with
the same reference number, test specimen receiver 101' includes wedges 109 that move laterally
toward and away from the test specimen 11 to selectively engage the test specimen 11. Again,
operation of test specimen receiver 101' occurs with movement of the extension 70 and cylinder
body 100 relative to rod 104. Other forms of test specimen receivers are illustrated in US Patent
5,095,757 as other displaceable wedges and clamping collets. These and other forms of test
specimen receivers can be used with aspects of the present invention herein described and/or
illustrated.
[0037]       It should be noted that it is common for cooling to be provided for the base 72 of test
specimen holder 21 via base cooling passageways schematically indicated at 120, which in turn
are fluidly coupled to inlet and outlet ports (not shown). In a particularly advantageous
embodiment, the fluid provided to cavity or gap 36 and various passageways connected thereto
are separate and isolated from cooling passageways 120.

                                                -11
 [00381     Another aspect of the present disclosure, in particular, the temperature modifying
structure 32, includes one or more of the exterior surfaces of the holder 20, 21 exposed to heat in
the environmental chamber 12 such as test specimen receiver 101, extension 70, shields 34, 39,
and/or other components forming part of specimen engaging portion 30 comprising a material
that inhibits heat absorption or heat transfer via conduction, convection and/or radiation. The
material can comprise the entire component or one or more layers over a base material (metal or
non-metal). A thermal barrier material such as but not limited to a ceramic inhibits the
conduction or absorption of heat from the environmental chamber 12 to the specimen engaging
portion 30. By way of example, any surface (e.g. outwardly facing surface 132 and/or inwardly
facing surface 134 of the shields 34 and 39, outer surfaces of test specimen receiver 105 and/or
extension 70 ) or the component in its entirety, can comprise a thermal barrier material that helps
prevent the transmission of heat to the specimen engaging portion 30.
 [0039]     It has also been found that low emissivity thermal materials such as but not limited to
thin coatings of metals or coatings having metal particles provided on or otherwise forming
selected surfaces of the shields 34 and 39 also inhibits heat transfer to the specimen engaging
portion 30. For instance, inwardly facing surfaces 134 of shields 34 and/or 39 can be provided
with a low emissivity thermal coating so as to minimize radiant heat energy from being emitted
therefrom. It should also be noted both thermal barrier materials and low emissivity thermal
materials can be combined on the same component.
 [0040]     FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate another holder 180 having aspects of the present disclosure.
Those components having similar or same functions as described above have been identified
with like reference numbers. In this embodiment, shield 39 further includes top plate portions
39A and 39B that cover much if not if not all of specimen receiver 105. Plate portions 39A and
39B are secured to shield 39 using pins 182 that are inserted into apertures of upstanding flange
portions 184, the flange portions 184 extending through apertures 186 in plate portions 38A,
38B.
 [00411     Additional pins 192 are provided proximate an end 44 of the shield 39. When the
shield 39 is disposed over the extension 70, apertures 188 are disposed on each side of an annular
flange 190 on rod 104. Pins 192 (for example, made from ceramic) are inserted in the apertures
 188 so as to inhibit axial movement of the shield 39 by contact with the annular flange 190. In
view of the presence of annular flange 190, passageway 42 comprises vent outlets 194.

 [0042]      It should be noted that controller 95 is illustrated only schematically in FIG. 8,
wherein functionality of this component may be implemented on one or more computing
devices. For example, in one embodiment, the controller 95 can comprise a user operated
terminal, system controller and a servo controller. The servo controller provides control signals
to operate the actuator 19 based on commands provided from a system controller. The system
controller typically receives actual responses as feedback in a response to a drive provided as
 input to the servo controller. The user operated terminal provides overall command signals to the
system controller.
 [0043]      The controller 95, user operated terminal, servo controller or system controller,
discussed above can each be implemented, at least in part, on a digital and/or analog computer.
FIG. 8 and the related discussion provide a brief, general description of a suitable computing
environment comprising a general computing device. Although not required, the general
computing device will be described, at least in part, in the general context of computer
executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer 302.
 [0044]      Generally, program modules include routine programs, objects, components, data
structures, etc., which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Those
skilled in the art can implement the description below and/or block diagrams to computer
executable instructions storable on a computer readable medium. Moreover, those skilled in the
art will appreciate that the disclosure may be practiced with other computer system
configurations,    including multi-processor systems,      networked   personal   computers,   mini
computers, main frame computers, and the like. Aspects of the disclosure may also be practiced
in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices
that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computer environment,
program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.
 [0045]      The computer 302 illustrated in FIG. 9 comprises a conventional computer having a
central processing unit (CPU) 327, memory 333 and a system bus 335, which couples various
system components, including memory 333 to the CPU 327. System bus 335 may be any of
several types of bus structures including a memory bus or a memory controller, a peripheral bus,
and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The memory 333 includes read only
memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). A basic input/output (BIOS) containing the
basic routine that helps to transfer information between elements within the computer 302, such

                                                 -13
 as during start-up, is stored in ROM. Storage devices 337, such as a hard disk, a floppy disk
drive, an optical disk drive, etc., are coupled to the system bus 335 and are used for storage of
 programs and data. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of
 computer readable media that are accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash
memory cards, digital video disks, random access memories, read only memories, and the like,
may also be used as storage devices. Commonly, programs are loaded into memory 333 from at
 least one of the storage devices 337 with or without accompanying data.
 [0046]     Input devices such as a keyboard 341 and pointing device (mouse) 343, or the like,
allow the user to provide commands to the computer 302. A monitor 345 or other type of output
device is further connected to the system bus 335 via a suitable interface and provides feedback
to the user. If the monitor 345 is a touch screen, the pointing device 343 can be incorporated
therewith.
[0047]      Interfaces 349 on each of the controller 95, servo controller or system controller allow
communication. Interface 349 also represents circuitry used to send signals or receive signals as
described above. Commonly, such circuitry comprises digital-to-analog (D/A) and analog-to
digital (A/D) converters as is well known in the art. The controller 95 can also comprise an
analog controller with or without digital supervision as is well known.
[0048]      Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred
embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and
detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
