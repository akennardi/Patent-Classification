                            TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
               [001]  The present invention relates to solid state forms, for example, crystalline and
      amorphous forms, of N-[2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4
 5    oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods therewith.
                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
               [0021  CFTR is a cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel that is expressed in a variety of
   cells types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux across
 0 the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia cells,
   nonnal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport throughout
   the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of approximately 1480
   amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains, each
   containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. The two transmembrane
25 domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain with multiple phosphorylation sites
   that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.
               [0031  The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See Gregory, R. J.
    et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J. R.
    et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR resulting
30  in cystic fibrosis ("CF"), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic fibrosis
    affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the general United
    States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective gene without
                                                  - 1-

        WO 2007/079139                                                           PCT/US2006/049421
 5 apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated gene suffer
   from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung disease.
               1004]   In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in
   respiratory epithelia leads to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance in ion and fluid
   transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus accumulation
 D in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients.
   In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal problems and
   pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the majority of males
   with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among females with cystic fibrosis. In
   contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene, individuals with a single
 5 copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration
   resulting from diarrhea - perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within
   the population.
               1005]    Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a
   variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M.
 0  et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S
    et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, > 1000 disease causing
    mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/).       The most
    prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid
    sequence, and is commonly referred to as AF508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately
25  70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease.
               [0061      The deletion of residue 508 in AF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein
    from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and
    traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is
    far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking,
30  the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in
    the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading to
    defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), FASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies have
    shown, however, that the reduced numbers of AF508-CFTR in the membrane are functional,
    albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526-528; Denning
35  et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In addition to AF508
                                                   -2-

 5 CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result in defective trafficking, synthesis,
   and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to alter anion secretion and modify disease
   progression and/or severity.
               [007]    Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it is
   clear that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism of
 0 transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial Na*
   channel, ENaC, Na*/2Cl~/K co-transporter, Na*-K*-ATPase pump and the basolateral membrane
   K* channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell.
               [008]     These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the
   epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption
 5 takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and
   the Na*-K*-ATPase pump and Cl- channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the cell.
   Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of
   intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via Cl- channels, resulting in a
   vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na*/2Cl~/K co-transporter, Na*-K*-ATPase pump and the
 0 basolateral membrane K* channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side
   coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably
   never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial osmotic
   gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride.
               [009]    In addition to cystic fibrosis, modulation of CFTR activity may be beneficial
25 for other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as secretory diseases- and other
   protein folding diseases mediated by CFTR. These include, but are not limited to, chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sj6gren's Syndrome.            COPD is
   characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible. The airflow
   limitation is due to mucus hypersecretion, emphysema, and bronchiolitis. Activators of mutant
30 or wild-type CFTR offer a potential treatment of mucus hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary
   clearance that is common in COPD. Specifically, increasing anion secretion across CFTR may
    facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimized
   periciliary fluid viscosity. This would lead to enhanced mucociliary clearance and a reduction in
   the symptoms associated with COPD. Dry eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear
35  aqueous production and abnormal tear film lipid, protein and mucin profiles. There are many
                                                   -3-

       WO 2007/079139                                                           PCT/US2006/049421
 5 causes of dry eye, some of which include age, Lasik eye surgery, arthritis, medications,
   chemical/thermal bums, allergies, and diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Sjbgrens's syndrome.
   Increasing anion secretion via CFTR would enhance fluid transport from the comeal endothelial
   cells and secretory glands surrounding the eye to increase corneal hydration. This would help to
   alleviate the symptoms associated with dry eye disease. Sjbgrens's syndrome is an autoimmune
 0 disease in which the immune system attacks moisture-producing glands throughout the body,
   including the eye, mouth, skin, respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. Symptoms, include, dry
   eye, mouth, and vagina, as well as lung disease. The disease is also associated with rheumatoid
   arthritis, systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymypositis/dermatomyositis. Defective
   protein trafficking is believed to cause the disease, for which treatment options are limited.
 5 Modulators of CFTR activity may hydrate the various organs afflicted by the disease and help to
   elevate the associated symptoms.
               [0101  As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in AF508
   CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this mutant
   protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient amounts of
 0 the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within epithelial
   tissues is significantly reduced. Infact, this cellular phenomenon of defective ER processing of
   ABC transporters by the ER machinery, has been shown to be the underlying basis not only for
   CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The two ways that the
   ER machinery can malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER export of the proteins leading
25 to degradation, or by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded proteins [Aridor M, et
   al., Nature Med., .(7), pp 745- 751 (1999); Shastry, B.S., et al., Neurochem. International, 43,
   pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, J., et al., Swiss Med Wkly, 132, pp 211-222 (2002); Morello, JP et
   al., TIPS, 2, pp. 466- 469 (2000); Bross P., et al., Human Mut., 14, pp. 186-198 (1999)]. The
    diseases associated with the first class of ER malfunction are cystic fibrosis (due to misfolded
30 AF508-CFTR as discussed above), hereditary emphysema (due to al-antitrypsin; non Piz
    variants), hereditary hemochromatosis, hoagulation-fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as protein C
    deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, lipid processing deficiencies, such as familial
    hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, abetalipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage
    diseases, such as I-cell disease/pseudo-Hurler, Mucopolysaccharidoses (due to lysosomal
35  processing enzymes), Sandhof/Tay-Sachs (due to p-hexosaminidase), Crigler-Najjar type II (due

    (due to insulin receptor), Laron dwarfism (due to growth hormone receptor), myleoperoxidase
    deficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism (due to preproparathyroid hormone), melanoma (due to
    tyrosinase). The diseases associated with the latter class of ER malfunction are Glycanosis CDG
    type 1, hereditary emphysema (due to cl-Antitrypsin (PiZ variant), congenital hyperthyroidism,
 0  osteogenesis imperfecta (due to Type I, 11, IV procollagen), hereditary hypofibrinogenemia (due
    to fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (due to al-antichymotrypsin), Diabetes insipidus (DI),
    neurophyseal DI (due to vasopvessin hormone/V2-receptor), neprogenic DI (due to aquaporin
    II), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome (due to peripheral myelin protein 22), Perlizaeus-Merzbacher
    disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease ( due to    PAPP   and presenilins),
 5  Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's
    disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders asuch as Huntington, spinocerebullar
    ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and myotonic
    dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
    (due to prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (due to lysosomal a-galactosidase A) and
 ,0 Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (due to Prp processing defect).
              [0111   In addition to up-regulation of CFTR activity, reducing anion secretion by
    CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which epithelial
    water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride transport.
    The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR.
25            10121   Although there are numerous causes of diarrhea, the major consequences of
    diarrheal diseases, resulting from excessive chloride transport are common to all, and include
    dehydration, acidosis, impaired growth and death.
              [0131    Acute and chronic diarrheas represent a major medical problem in many areas
    of the world. Diarrhea is both a significant factor in malnutrition and the leading cause of death
30  (5,000,000 deaths/year) in children less than five years old.
              [0141    Secretory diarrheas are also a dangerous condition in patients of acquired
    immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 16 million
    travelers to developing countries from industrialized nations every year develop diarrhea, with
    the severity and number of cases of diarrhea varying depending on the country and area of travel.

 5            1015]   Diarrhea in barn animals and pets such as cows, pigs and horses, sheep, goats,
   cats and dogs, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals. Diarrhea can
   result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement, as well as in response
   to a variety of bacterial or viral infections and generally occurs within the first few hours of the
   animal's life.
 0            [0161   The most common diarrheal causing bacteria is enterotoxogenic E.coli (ETEC)
   having the K99 pilus antigen. Common viral causes of diarrhea include rotavirus and
   coronavirus. Other infectious agents include cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and salmonella,
   among others.
              [0171   Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces, dehydration
 5 and weakness. Coronavirus causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals, and has a
   higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be infected
   with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial microorganisms at one
   time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease.
              [0181   Accordingly, there is a need for stable polymorphic forms of modulators of
 0 CFTR activity, such as Compound 1, that can be used to modulate the activity of CFTR in the
   cell membrane of a mammal.
              10191   There is a need for methods of treating CFTR-mediated diseases using such
   modulators of CFTR activity.

    described herein.
             10781  As used herein, the term "amorphous" refers to a solid material having no long
    range order in the position of its molecules Amorphous solids are generally supercooled
    liquids in which the molecules are arranged in a random manner so that there is no well
30  defined arrangement, e.g., molecular packing, and no long range order. Amorphous solids are
    generally isotropic, i.e. exhibit similar properties in all directions and do not have definite
    melting points. For example, an amorphous material is a solid material having no sharp
    characteristic crystalline peak(s) in its X-ray power diffraction (XRPD) pattern (i.e., is not
    crystalline as determined by XRPD). Instead, one or several broad peaks (e.g., halos) appear in

   2004/0006237 for a comparison of XRPDs of an amorphous material and crystalline material.
             [079]  As used herein, the phrase "substantially amorphous Compound 1" is used
   interchangeably with the phrase "amorphous Compound 1 substantially free of crystalline
   Compound 1." In some embodiments, substantially amorphous Compound 1 has less than
 0 about 30% crystalline Compound 1, for example, less than about 30% of crystalline Compound
   1, e.g., less than about 25% crystalline Compound 1, less than about 20% crystalline
   Compound 1, less than about 15% crystalline Compound 1, less than about 10% crystalline
   Compound 1, less than about 5% crystalline Compound 1, less than about 2% crystalline
   Compound 1. In some preferred embodiments, Compound 1 has less than about 15%
 5 crystalline compound 1. Some embodiments include a preparation of substantially amorphous
   Compound 1, for example having the degree of crystalline Compound 1 as described above.
             10801  As used herein "crystalline solids" refers to compounds or compositions where
   the structural units are arranged in fixed geometric patterns or lattices, so that crystalline solids
   have rigid long range order. The structural units that constitute the crystal structure can be
 0  atoms, molecules, or ions. Crystalline solids show definite melting points.
             [081]  As used herein, a "dispersion" refers to a disperse system in which one
    substance, the dispersed phase, is distributed, in discrete units, throughout a second substance
    (the continuous phase or vehicle). The size of the dispersed phase can vary considerably (e.g.
    colloidal particles of nanometer dimension, to multiple microns in size). In general, the
25  dispersed phases can be solids, liquids, or gases. In the case of a solid dispersion, the dispersed
    and continuous phases are both solids. In pharmaceutical applications, a solid dispersion can
    include a crystalline drug (dispersed phase) in an amorphous polymer (continuous phase), or
    alternatively, an amorphous drug (dispersed phase) in an amorphous polymer (continuous
    phase). In some embodiments an amorphous solid dispersion includes the polymer constituting
30  the dispersed phase, and the drug constitute the continuous phase. In some embodiments, the
    dispersion includes amorphous Compound 1 or substantially amorphous Compound 1.
              10821 The term "solid amorphous dispersion" generally refers to a solid dispersion of
    two or more components, usually a drug and polymer, but possibly containing other
    components such as surfactants or other pharmaceutical excipients, where Compound 1 is
35  amorphous or substantially amorphous (e.g., substantially free of crystalline Compound 1), and

   the other components.
           [0831   A solid dispersion as provided herein is a particularly favorable embodiment of
   this invention. Solid dispersions typically include a compound dispersed in an appropriate
   carrier medium, such as a solid state carrier. In one embodiment, a carrier according to this
 3 invention comprises a polymer, preferably, a water-soluble polymer or a partially water
   soluble polymer. It would be understood that one or more than one water-soluble polymer
   could be used in a solid dispersion of this invention.
            [0841  An exemplary solid dispersion is a co-precipitate or a co-melt of N-[2,4-bis(1,1
   dimethylethyl)-5-hydroxyphenyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide          with at least one
 5 polymer. A "Co-precipitate" is a product after dissolving a drug and a polymer in a solvent or
   solvent mixture followed by the removal of the solvent or solvent mixture. Sometimes the
   polymer can be suspended in the solvent or solvent mixture. The solvent or solvent mixture
   includes organic solvents and supercritical fluids. A "co-melt" is a product after heating a drug
    and a polymer to melt, optionally in the presence of a-solvent or solvent mixture, followed by
 0 mixing, removal of at least a portion of the solvent if applicable, and cooling to room
    temperature at a selected rate. In some cases, the solid dispersions are prepared by adding a
    solution of a drug and a solid polymer followed by mixing and removal of the solvent. To
    remove the solvent, vacuum drying, spray drying, tray drying, lyophilization, and other drying
    procedures may be applied. Applying any of these methods using appropriate processing
25  parameters, according to this invention, would provide N-[2,4-bis(l, 1-dimethylethyl)-5
    hydroxyphenyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide in an amorphous state in the final
    solid dispersion product.

             [01171 In one embodiment, a polymer is able to dissolve in aqueous media. The
    solubility of the polymers may be pH-independent or pH-dependent. The latter include one or
  5 more enteric polymers. The term "enteric polymer" refers to a polymer that is preferentially
    soluble in the less acidic environment of the intestine relative to the more acid environment of
    the stomach, for example, a polymer that is insoluble in acidic aqueous media but soluble when
    the pH is above 5-6. An appropriate polymer should be chemically and biologically inert. In
    order to improve the physical stability of the solid dispersions, the glass transition temperature
  0 (Tg) of the polymer should be as high as possible. For example, preferred polymers have a
    glass transition temperature at least equal to or greater than the glass transition temperature of
    the drug (e.g., Compound 1). Other preferred polymers have a glass transition temperature that
    is within about 10 to about 15 *C of the drug (e.g., Compound 1). Examples of suitable glass
    transition temperatures of the polymers include at least about 90 *C, at least about 95 *C, at
?.5 least about 100 *C, at least about 105 *C, at least about 110 *C, at least about 1.15 "C, at least
     about 120 0C, at least about 125 'C, at least about 130 "C, at least about 135 'C, at least about
     140 *C, at least about 145 *C, at least about 150 *C, at least about 155 *C, at least about 160
     'C, at least about 165 *C, at least about 170 *C, or at least about 175 *C (as measured under
     dry conditions). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the underlying
30   mechanism is that a polymer with a higher Tg generally has lower molecular mobility at room
     temperature, which can be a crucial factor in stabilizing the physical stability of the amorphous
     solid dispersion.
              [0118] Additionally, the hygroscopicity of the polymers should be as low, e.g., less
     than about 10%. For the purpose of comparison in this application, the hygroscopicity of a
35   polymer or composition is characterized at about 60% relative humidity. In some preferred

 i embodiments, the polymer has less than about 10% water absorption, for example less than
   about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less
   than about 4%, less than about 3%, or less than about 2% water absorption. The
   hygroscopicity can also affect the physical stability of the solid dispersions. Generally,
   moisture adsorbed in the polymers can greatly reduce the Tg of the polymers as well as the
 ) resulting solid dispersions, which will further reduce the physical stability of the solid
   dispersions as described above.
            [01191 In one embodiment, the polymer is one or more water-soluble polymer(s) or
   partially water-soluble polymer(s). Water-soluble or partially water-soluble polymers include
   but are not limited to, cellulose derivatives (e.g., hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),
 5 hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC)) or ethylcellulose; polyvinylpyrrolidones (PVP); polyethylene
    glycols (PEG); polyvinyl alcohols (PVA); acrylates, such as polymethacrylate (e.g., Eudragit@
    E); cyclodextrins (e.g., p-cyclodextin) and copolymers and derivatives thereof, including for
    example PVP-VA (polyvinylpyrollidone-vinyl acetate).
             [01201 In some preferred embodiments, the polymer is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
 0  (HPMC), such as HPMC E50, HPMCE15, or HPMC60SH50).
             [01211 As discussed herein, the polymer can be a pH-dependent enteric polymer. Such
    pH-dependent enteric polymers include, but are not limited to, cellulose derivatives (e.g.,
    cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP)), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalates (HPMCP),
    hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)
25  or a salt thereof (e.g., a sodium salt such as (CMC-Na)); cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT),
    hydroxypropylcellulose acetate phthalate (HPCAP), hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose acetate
    phthalate (HPMCAP), and methylcellulose acetate phthalate (MCAP), or polymethacrylates
    (e.g., Eudragit@ S). In some preferred embodiments, the polymer is hydroxypropyl methyl
    cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS).
30           [01221 In yet another embodiment, the polymer is a polyvinylpyrrolidone co-polymer,
     for example, avinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate co-polymer (PVP/VA).
             [01231 In embodiments where Compound 1 forms a solid dispersion with a polymer,
     for example with an HPMC, HPMCAS or PVP/VA polymer, the amount of polymer relative to

   dispersion are given in weight percentages. The amount of polymer is typically at least about
   20%, and preferably at least about 30%, for example, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at
   least about 45%, or about 50% (e.g., 49.5%). The amount is typically about 99% or less, and
   preferably about 80% or less, for example about 75% or less, about 70% or less, about 65% or
   less, about 60% or less, or about 55% or less. In one embodiment, the polymer is in an amount
 ) of up to about 50% of the total weight of the dispersion (and even more specifically, between
   about 40% and 50%, such as about 49%, about 49.5%, or about 50%). HPMC and HPMCAS
   are available in a variety of grades from ShinEtsu, for example, HPMCAS is available in a
   number of varieties, including AS-LF, AS-MF, AS-HF, AS-LG, AS-MG, AS-HG. Each of
   these grades vary with the percent substitution of acetate and succinate.
 5           101241 In some preferred embodiments, Compound 1 and polymer are present in
   roughly equal amounts, for example each of the polymer and the drug make up about half of
   the percentage weight of the dispersion. For example, the polymer is present in about 49.5%
    and the drug is present in about 50%.
             101251 In some preferred embodiments, the dispersion further includes other minor
 0  ingredients, such as a surfactant (e.g., SLS). In some preferred embodiments, the surfactant is
    present in less than about 10% of the dispersion, for example less than about 9%, less than
    about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less
    than about 3%, less than about 2%, about 1%, or about 0.5%.
              [01261 In embodiments including a polymer, the polymer should be present in an
25  amount effective for stabilizing the solid dispersion. Stabilizing includes inhibiting or
    preventing, the crystallization of Compound 1. Such stabilizing would inhibit the conversion
    Compound 1 from amorphous to crystalline form. For example, the polymer would prevent at
     least a portion (e.g., about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%,
     about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%,
30   about 75%, or greater) of Compound 1 from converting from an amorphous to a crystalline
     form. Stabilization can be measured, for example, by measuring the glass transition
     temperature of the solid dispersion, measuring the rate of relaxation of the amorphous material,
     or by measuring the solubility or bioavailability of Compound 1.

    form a solid dispersion such as an amorphous solid dispersion, should have one or more of the
    following properties:
            101281 The glass transition temperature of the polymer should have a temperature of no
    less than about 10-15 *C lower than the glass transition temperature of Compound 1.
 ). Preferably, the glass transition temperature of the polymer is greater than the glass transition
    temperature of Compound 1, and in general at least 504C higher than the desired storage
    temperature of the drug product. For example, at least about 100 *C, at least about 105 *C, at
    least about 105 *C, at least about 110 *C, at least about 120 'C, at least about 130 *C, at least

 5          [01291 The polymer should be relatively non-hygroscopic. For example, the polymer
    should, when stored under standard conditions, absorb less than about 10% water, for example,
    less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, or less than
    about 5%, less than about 4%, or less than about 3% water. Preferably the polymer will, when
    stored under standard conditions, be substantially free of absorbed water.
 D           [01301 The polymer should have similar or better solubility in solvents suitable for
     spray drying processes relative to that of Compound 1. In preferred embodiments, the polymer
    will dissolve in one or more of the same solvents or solvent systems as Compound 1. It is
    preferred that the polymer is soluble in at least one non-hydroxy containing solvent such as
    methylene chloride, acetone, or a combination thereof.
 5           [01311 The polymer, when combined with Compound 1, for example in a solid
     dispersion or in a liquid suspension, should increase the solubility of Compound 1 in aqueous
     and physiologically relative media either relative to the solubility of Compound 1 in the
     absence of polymer or relative to the solubility of Compound 1 when combined with a
     reference polymer. For example, the polymer could increase the solubility of amorphous
30   Compound 1 by reducing the amount of amorphous Compound 1 that converts to crystalline
     Compound 1, either from a solid amorphous dispersion or from a liquid suspension.
             [01321 The polymer should decrease the relaxation rate of the amorphous substance.
             [01331 The polymer should increase the physical and/or chemical stability of
     Compound 1.

25  prepare Compound 1. For example, Compound 1 can be prepared using a method to provide
    crystalline Compound 1, such as Form A or Form B, or Compound 1 can be prepared using a

   for example spray drying a solution of Compound 1 to provide amorphous Compound 1, e.g.,
   as a neat solid or as a component of a solid dispersion, said method utilizing spray-drying
   means to effect said conversion. For example, Amorphous Compound 1 can be made by
   converting a form of Compound 1, e.g., a crystalline form of Compound 1, such as Form A or
 5 Form B, into a substantially amorphous form of Compound 1 by dissolving Compound into a
   solution and spray drying the solution of Compound 1, thereby converting a form of
   Compound 1, such as crystalline Compound 1, into amorphous Compound 1. An exemplary
   process for making amorphous Compound 1 by converting Form B into a substantially
   amorphous form of Compound 1 is recited in the examples.

   including, for example, those described in US 2003/0186952 (see the documents cited therein
    at paragraph 1092) and US 2003/0185891). In general, methods that could be used include
   those that involve rapid removal of solvent from a mixture or cooling a molten sample. Such
25 methods include, but are not limited to, rotational evaporation, freeze-drying (i.e.,
    lyophilization), vacuum drying, melt congealing, and melt extrusion. However, a preferred
    embodiment includes amorphous Compound 1, such as a neat preparation or a solid dispersion
    obtained by spray-drying. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the amorphous product
    obtained by spray-drying is further dried, for example, to remove residual solvent.

    obtained by spray-drying a mixture comprising Compound 1, a suitable polymer, and an
    appropriate solvent. Spray drying is a method that involves atomization of a liquid mixture
    containing, e.g., a solid and a solvent, and removal of the solvent. Atomization can be done,

 5          [0157] Spray drying is a process that converts a liquid feed to a dried particulate form.
   Optionally, a secondary drying process such as fluidized bed drying or vacuum drying, may be
   used to reduce residual solvents to pharmaceutically acceptable levels. Typically, spray-drying
   involves contacting a highly dispersed liquid suspension or solution, and a sufficient volume of
   hot air to produce evaporation and drying of the liquid droplets. The preparation to be spray
 0 dried can be any solution, coarse suspension, slurry, colloidal dispersion, or paste that may be
   atomized using the selected spray-drying apparatus. In a standard procedure, the preparation is
   sprayed into a current of warm filtered air that evaporates the solvent and conveys the dried
   product to a collector (e.g., a cyclone). The spent air is then exhausted with the solvent, or
   alternatively the spent air is sent to a condenser to capture and potentially recycle the solvent.
 5 Commercially available types of apparatus may be used to conduct the spray-drying. For
   example, commercial spray dryers are manufactured by Buchi Ltd. and Niro (e.g., the PSD line
   of spray driers manufactured by Niro) (see, US 2004/0105820; US 2003/0144257).
            [0158] Spray-drying typically employs solids loads of material from about 3% to about
   30% by weight, (i.e., drug plus and excipients), for example about 4% to about 20% by weight,
 0 preferably at least about 10%. In general, the upper limit of solids loads is governed by the
   viscosity of (e.g., the ability to pump) the resulting solution and the solubility of the
   components in the solution. Generally, the viscosity of the solution can determine the size of
   the particle in the resulting powder product.
             [01591 Techniques and methods for spray-drying may be found in Perry's Chemical
25 Engineering Handbook, 6th Ed., R.H. Perry, D.W. Green & J.O. Maloney, eds.), McGraw-Hill
   book co. (1984); and Marshall "Atomization and Spray-Drying" 50, Chem. Eng. Prog. Monogr.
    Series 2 (1954). In general, the spray-drying is conducted with an inlet temperature of from
    about 60 "C to about 200 "C, for example, from about 95 "C to about 185 "C, from about 110
    *C to about 182 *C, from about 96 *C to about 108 *C, e.g., about 175 *C. The spray-drying is
30  generally conducted with an outlet temperature of from about 30 *C to about 80 "C, for
    example from about 31 "C to about 72 *C, about 37 *C to about 41 "C e.g., about 60 *C. The
    atomization flow rate is generally from about 4 kg/h to about 12 kg/h, for example, from about
    4.3 kg/h to about 10.5 kg/h, e.g., about 6 kg/h or about 10.5 kg/h. The feed flow rate is
    generally from about 3 kg/h to about 10 kg/h, for example, from about 3.5 kg/h to about 9.0

 5 kg/h, e.g., about 8 kg/h or about 7.1 kg/h. The atomization ratio is generally from about 0.3 to
   1.7, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5, e.g., about 0.8 or about 1.5.
            [01601 Removal of the solvent may require a subsequent drying step, such as tray
   drying, fluid bed drying (e.g., from about room temperature to about 100 *C), vacuum drying,
   microwave drying, rotary drum drying or biconical vacuum drying (e.g., from about room
 0 temperature to about 200 *C).
            [0161] In one embodiment, the solid dispersion is fluid-bed dried.
            101621 In preferred processes, the solvent includes a volatile solvent, for example a
   solvent having a boiling point of less than about 100 "C. In some embodiments, the solvent
   includes a mixture of solvents, for example a mixture of volatile solvents or a mixture of
 5 volatile and non-volatile solvents. Where mixtures of solvents are used, the mixture can
   include one or more non-volatile solvents, for example, where the non-volatile solvent is
   present in the mixture at less than about 15%, e.g., less than about 12%, less than about 10%,
   less than about 8%, less than about 5%, less than about 3%, or less than about 2%.
            [0163] Preferred solvents are those solvents where Compound 1 has a solubility of at
 0 least about 10 mg/ml (e.g., at least about 15 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 35 mg/ml,
   40 mg/ml, 45 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, or greater). More preferred solvents include those where
   Compound 1 has a solubility of at least about 50 mg/ml.
            [01641 Exemplary solvents that could be tested include acetone, cyclohexane,

            [01651 The particle size and the temperature drying range may be modified to prepare
   an optimal solid dispersion. As would be appreciated by skilled practitioners, a small particle
 0 size would lead to improved solvent removal. Applicants have found however, that smaller
   particles can lead to fluffy particles that, under some circumstances do not provide optimal
   solid dispersions for downstream processing such as tabletting. At higher temperatures,

     administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,
     intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an
     oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In
  0O certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or
     parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about
      1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain

              [01901 Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,
1-5  pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and
     elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents
     commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and
     emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl
     alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in
30   particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,

 5         [01911 Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous
   suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting
   agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable
   solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for
   example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may
 3 be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In
   addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.
   For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or
   diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of
   injectables.
 5          101921 The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through
   a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
   compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable
   medium prior to use.
            [0193] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often
 0 desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular
   injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or
   amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then
   depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline
    form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is
25 accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot
    forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable
   polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to
   polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can
   be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and
30  poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound
    in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.

       a Bruker Apex II diffractometer that was equipped with a sealed copper X-ray tube and Apex
       II CCD detector. Initially, 3 sets of 40 frames were collected to determine a preliminary unit
  0    cell. Subsequently a full data set consisting of 15 scans and 6084 frames was acquired. Data
       collection was performed at 100 K. Data were integrated and scaled using Apex II software
       from Bruker AXS. Integration and scaling resulted in 7528 reflections, 3071 of which were
      unique [R(int)) = 0.0466]. Structure was solved by direct methods in space group P2iusing
       SHELXTL software. Refinement was performed with full-matrix least-square method on F2
,5    using SHELXTL software as well. Altogether 375 parameters were used in refinement
      resulting in reflection to parameter ratio of 8.19. The final refinement afforded a chiral
      structure with a Flack parameter of 0.0(3). The final refinement index was wR2 = 0.1242 and
