                     COMPLETE SPECIFICATION
                        INNOVATION PATENT
                         PLATE CARRIER
The following statement is a full description of the invention, including the
                best method of performing it known to me:

                                                 1
                                     PLATE CARRIER
   In the entertainment or catering industries for instance, for the delivery and serving
   of prepared food or meals, new technology Regen ovens and Cook-Chill style
   technology is allowing the final preparation of large numbers of meals, ready to
   serve, in a very short time. It is critical therefore, that the food is delivered from
 5 the kitchen to the customer quickly and efficiently. This will minimise the waiting
   time for the consumer or customer and maximize the delivery capability of the
   people delivering and serving the food. This is especially important when there
   are a large number of customers who need to be served simultaneously. Inefficient
   delivery methods do not allow best practice for staff utilization or high quality
 0 customer focus. Current methods of delivery either lack the ability to carry,
   deliver and serve large numbers easily, quickly and efficiently, or are not adaptable
   enough to cope with a variety of plate sizes and types.
   The conventional method of delivery of plates of prepared food is to hand carry the
   plates, or to carry them on a tray, or to use a carrying device that is limited in its
 5 ability to hold a large number of plates at any one time. This results in slow
   delivery, inefficient service and poor utilisation of serving and waiting staff. The
   result is inefficiency and poor customer service.
   It is therefore the primary and preferred object of the invention to provide a plate
   carrying device that allows the quick and efficient loading, carrying and serving of
 O a large number of plates simultaneously.
   Typical devices used to carry plates of prepared food have been designed to carry a
   specific size, shape and design of plate. Each new size, shape and design of plate
   requires the device to be re-designed and constructed anew. Using an existing
   device for alternative size, shape and designs does not allow the plates to be carried
25 safely without slipping or tipping during loading, carrying or serving.
   It is therefore another preferred objective of the invention to provide a device that
   is able to carry a large variety of size, shape and designed plates, such that the
   device can be utilised by a very wide variety of service providers in the
   entertainment and catering industries, without the need for re-design or
30 modification.

                                               2
   Typical devices that can carry a variety of plate sizes are limited because of the
   design and materials used and therefore do not provide an anti-slip surface
   designed to firmly retain a wide variety of plates.
   It is therefore another preferred objective of the invention to provide a device that
 5 is able to carry a large variety of size and shaped plates without the possibility of
   slipping within the device while the plates are being loaded, carried, delivered and
   served.
   Typical devices used to carry plates are limited by the materials used and
   construction methods.
 0 It is therefore another preferred objective of the invention to provide a device such
   that it is robust, dishwasher safe, meets industry food hygiene standards for the
   materials used, is easily cleaned and can be cleaned in industrial dishwashers.
   Broadly the invention comprises a device with a handle that is connected to two
   rods that run vertically down from the handle. Five, or more as required, plate
 5 holders are connected to the two rods laterally and at right angles to the rods such
   that the plate holders sit horizontally. Two additional vertical rods are located
   equidistance from each rod, and connected to the plate holders to form the third
   and fourth connected rod. The four rods and the plate holders are designed to
   retain the plates in a secure position within the device. The four rods are spaced to
 0 provide open access at both the front and rear of the device, allowing the removal
   and insertion of plates from either side, without losing any retention properties of
   the device as a whole. The rear open access area is designed to allow easy loading
   and unloading from that side while the front quadrant is also open and shaped to
   provide the best possible carrying position and best loading, unloading and serving
25 access for the staff.
   The invention may be better understood with reference to the accompanying
   drawings, which show one example of the invention.
   The drawings depict the application from a holistic context. In order that the
   invention may be readily understood and put into practical effect, preferred
30 embodiments are described by way of example with reference to accompanying
   drawings as stated.

                                               3
   Figure 1 is an isometric view of the entire plate carrying device. This figure
   depicts the invention for clarity, without specifying preferred embodiments. The
   device is lifted by the handle (1). The handle is connected to the two vertical rods
   (2). Two additional rods (3) are connected to the plate holders (4) to provide
 5 rigidity and a method of retention of the plates when carried. This Figure also
   demonstrates that the device can be placed on a horizontal surface and remain
   stable and upright. There are caps (5) on the top of the two rods to minimise dirt or
   food trapping (3) and a pair of feet (6) shown on the bottom of the rods. These
   feet (6) ensure the best stability during the loading and serving phases of the
 o delivery process and provide additional stability.
   Figure 2 is a plan view of the entire plate carrying device showing the relative
   position of the four vertical rods ((2, 3) and the connections to the plate holders (4).
   This view also depicts the relative position of the handle (1) such that the device,
   when carried, is upright with the plate holders horizontally located, ensuring the
 5 best plate retention possible. This view also highlights the shaped first quadrant
   (7) which allows the device to be in closer lateral proximity to the legs of the
   person carrying the device, ensuring ease of carriage and greatest carriage stability.
   In addition, this view demonstrates the use of shaped and raised nodules (8) that
   allow carriage of large and small round and square plates within the same device,
 0 without alteration, while maximising the retention and anti-slip properties of the
   device. These nodules provide fixed points that the corners or edges of plates are
   retained against. As there are only two sets of four nodules in the quadrants
   adjacent to the serving access area, they slightly elevate the plate in those
   quadrants and provide even greater plate lateral stability and plate anti-slip
25 properties for the device.
   Figure 3 is a truncated isometric view of two of the plate holders (4) separate from
   the entire device. Also evident is the centre opening (9) of the plate holder, which
   is large enough to accommodate a wide variety of plates and their underside shape
   and design, including ridging, which is typical of most varieties of plates in use in
30 the industry. This figure clearly demonstrates the concave shape of the plate
   holder (4), providing excellent plate retention and stability for a large variety of
   plate size, shape and design. Also evident are the sets of raised nodules (8) that

                                              4
  enhance the anti-slip properties and increase the lateral stability while providing
  excellent retention for plates of different shape, size and design.
   Figure 4 is an isometric view of the entire device with a typical round plate in
  location on each plate holder, clearly demonstrating the devices' ability to carry
5 plates of various size, shape and design.
  Figure 5 is an isometric view of the entire device with a typical square plate in
  location on each plate holder, clearly demonstrating the devices' ability to carry
  plates of various size, shape and design.
  It is readily apparent to the skilled observer that the present invention provides a
o plate carrying device therefore, which has many advantages over the prior
  arrangements.
  Various changes and modifications may be made to the embodiments described
  and illustrated without departing from the present invention defined in the
  appended claims.
