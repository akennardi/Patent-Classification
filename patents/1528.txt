                                           ABSTRACT
A reversible ventilation slide inhibitor adapted to be positioned on a sliding member,
including: a lockable body with first and second passages, a locking barrel located between
the first and second passages capable of being rotated between a locked and unlocked
position, and a reversible stop piece with first and second pins. Each of the pins adapted to be
inserted into either of the passages, thereby making the reversible stop piece reversible
between an active and an inactive position. The reversible stop piece in the active position
abuts a sliding member, to prevent movement of the sliding member beyond a fixed point on
a track on which the sliding member is adapted to slide. When in the inactive position allows
the sliding member to bypass the reversible stop piece to an unrestricted opening distance.

                        REVERSIBLE VENTILATION SLIDE INHIBITOR
[0001] TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a window or door opening restrictor. More
specifically, the present disclosure relates to a restrictor for restricting movement of sliding
windows or doors.
[0003] BACKGROUND
[0004] Various window opening restrictors have been developed to limit window opening
distance and address window safety concerns associated with an increase in high density,
multi-storey living.
[0005] Window restrictors are used to prevent a window sash opening beyond a fixed point
on the window track. While it may be desirable in some circumstances to open a window to
its full extent, a fully opened window may pose a risk of inadvertent falls from heights,
particularly by children. It is therefore desirable to provide a window restrictor that allows the
user the flexibility to fully open a window or restrict a window opening depending on their
individual circumstances and applications.
[0006] In relation to sliding windows, traditional vent stops and other physical inhibitors of
window openings are typically installed inside the elongate window track at the top or bottom
of the window frame, or over the window sill. The moveable window frame can slide freely
along the window track until further movement is inhibited by abutment with the installed
window restrictor, thereby limiting window opening distance.
[0007] There are many different types and sizes of windows available and it is a limitation of
existing vent stops that may not be appropriate in size or function for all sliding windows or
doors.
[0008] In some circumstances, the window track at the top or bottom of a window frame may
be too narrow to accommodate vent stops that are designed to sit within the window track
itself.
[0009] Alternatively, in the case of vent stops designed to be positioned on the window sill,
the sill itself may be too thick or interior design elements, such as tiles, may render the
window sill unusable.
[0010] In some cases, safety and/or legislative requirements require window restrictors to be
installed on whole buildings with many tens or hundreds of windows. In such circumstances,

                                                  2
the installation of existing vent stops comprising multiple components each requiring
individual securing devices can be cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive.
[0011] The present disclosure seeks to overcome at least some of the deficiencies of existing
sliding window restrictors, or to at least provide an alternative.
[0012] SUMMARY
[0013] The present disclosure provides a reversible ventilation slide inhibitor, which may be
used or applied on windows that slide vertically or horizontally and are typically installed at a
fixed point along the track along which a sliding member moves. Window restrictors, and in
particular ventilation stops, typically limit the extent to which the window may be opened by
inhibiting contact between the stop device and the sliding member. This enables the sash to
be opened to a safe ventilation distance.
[0014] The present disclosure provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use alternative to existing
vent stops for sliding windows and doors, particularly in circumstances where the window or
door track and/or window or door sill cannot accommodate a vent stop due to size or physical
limitations to installation. The reversible stop piece of the current disclosure may limit the
opening distance of a window or door by physically blocking further movement of the sliding
sash or sliding member of the window/door when the reversible stop piece is in the active
position. The reversible stop piece of the current disclosure may allow the window or door to
bypass the reversible stop piece and fully open when the reversible stop piece is in the
inactive position.
[0015] The current disclosure will herein be described in terms of installation and use on
sliding windows, however it should be appreciated that the reversible ventilation slide
inhibitor disclosed herein is not limited to application on sliding windows only and may also
be used to limit the opening distance of other window and door types and other sliding
members.
[0016] The present disclosure provides a reversible ventilation slide inhibitor with reversible
stop piece including a lockable body with first and second passages, a locking barrel located
between the first and second passages within the lockable body and capable of being rotated
between a locked and unlocked position, a reversible stop piece with first and second pins,
whereby each of the first and second pins of the reversible stop piece are adapted to be
inserted into either of the first and second passages of the lockable body, thereby making the
reversible stop piece reversible between an active position and an inactive position. In some

                                                  3
embodiments, the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor is adapted to be positioned on a
window sill onto which a sliding member is installed.
[0017] In some embodiments, the reversible stop piece in the active position abuts a sliding
member movement from further movement beyond a fixed point on a track on which the
sliding member is adapted to slide, and when in the inactive position the reversible stop piece
allows the sliding member to bypass the reversible stop piece to an unrestricted opening
distance.
[0018] According to some embodiments, each of the first and second passages of the
lockable body includes a top opening and a bottom opening, whereby each top opening is
larger than the bottom opening to allow a securing device to be inserted through the top
opening of each passage and to be captured by the smaller bottom opening.
[0019] In some embodiments, the first passage of the lockable body is substantially parallel
to the second passage of the lockable body. In some embodiments, each of the first and
second passages of the lockable body is adapted to receive either the first pin or second pin of
the reversible stop piece.
[0020] In some embodiments, the first passage comprises an aperture through which the
locking barrel is able to rotate between the locked position and the unlocked position.
[0021] In some embodiments, the locking barrel is positioned between the first and second
passages and accessed via a keyhole located at a front side of the lockable body.
[0022] In some embodiments, the locking barrel is capable of being rotated between the
locked position and the unlocked position, whereby the locking barrel engages with the first
pin of the reversible stop piece that is inserted into the first passage when in the locked
position to capture the reversible stop piece and prevent its removal from the lockable body.
[0023] In some embodiments, the reversible stop piece consists of a first and a second
substantially identical, parallel pins.
[0024] In some embodiments, both the first and second pins are secured to an underside of a
stop bracket.
[0025] In some embodiments, the stop bracket comprises a shelf vertically projecting from
one edge of the stop bracket to form a stop ledge.
[0026] In some embodiments, each of the first and second pins are adapted to be positioned
in either of the first or second passages, thereby making the reversible stop piece reversible.
[0027] In some embodiments, once inserted into the lockable body, the pin contained within
the first passage of the lockable body engages with the locking barrel when in the locked
position to capture the reversible stop piece and prevent its removal from the lockable body.

                                                 4
[0028] In some embodiments, once inserted into the lockable body, the pin contained in the
second passage of the lockable body stabilises the reversible stop piece and prevents
rotational movement of the reversible stop piece upon contact with the sliding member.
[0029] In some embodiments, the stop bracket is configured such that when in the active
position the stop ledge will protrude over the elongated track of the sliding member and limit
the opening of the sliding member beyond a fixed point on the track.
[0030] In some embodiments, the stop bracket is reversed and inserted into the lockable body
in the inactive position such that the stop ledge protrudes away from the track of the sliding
member, thereby allowing the sliding member to bypass the stop ledge and move beyond a
fixed point on the track to an unrestricted open position.

[0039] DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0040] Figure 1 is an isometric view of the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor in accordance
with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. The reversible ventilation slide inhibitor is
comprised primarily of a lockable body 1, a locking barrel 2 and a reversible stop piece 3.
The disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary and are not intended to be limited to the
structural and functional details described herein. Terms such as front, back, top and bottom
will be used with reference to orientation of the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor in the
drawings. In real life applications, the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor may be installed in
any orientation required by the specific application.
[0041] Figure 1 depicts the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor with the reversible stop piece
3 inserted into the lockable body 1 such that the stop ledge 4 extends over the back side of the
lockable body 1 with the locking barrel 2 facing the front. This particular exemplary
embodiment is herein described as the active position. In the alternative, inactive position
(not shown), the reversible stop piece 3 may be removed from the lockable body 1 and re
inserted in the reverse position such that the stop ledge 4 extends over the front side of the
lockable body 1.
[0042] In some embodiments, the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor may be adapted to be
positioned on a first sliding member, when movement and opening distance of a second
adjacent sliding member is sought to be restricted.
[0043] Referring to Figure 2, the lockable body 1 includes a first passage 5 and a second
passage 6. Each of passages 5 and 6 is adapted to receive a fastening means, such as screws
12 (Fig. 3), for fastening the device to a secure structure (see screws 12 in Fig 3). Each of the
first and second passages is also adapted to receive either one of the first pin 7 or second pin
8 of the reversible stop piece 3 depending on the orientation of the reversible stop piece 3.
The first passage 5 and second passage 6 are substantially parallel. The first passage 5 and
second passage 6 differ only in that the first passage 5 may be in contact with an aperture 9.
Locking barrel 2 may be inserted into aperture 9 and may be rotated with a use of a key (not
shown) between the locked position, in which the curved edge 10 of the locking barrel 2 will
protrude through aperture 9 into first passage 5, and the unlocked position, in which the
concave edge 10 of the locking barrel 2 will align with the aperture 9 in the first passage 5,
such that locking barrel 2 will not protrude through aperture 9 into first passage 5.
[0044] The reversible stop piece 3 is comprised of a first and second substantially identical
pins. In some embodiments, the first and second pins may be positioned in parallel to one
another. Making the stop piece reversible requires the first pin 7 and the second pin 8 to be

                                                 6
substantially identically formed and separated by a distance corresponding to the distance
between first passage 5 and second passage 6 of the lockable body 1. Both the first pin 7 and
the second pin 8 are secured to the stop bracket 11. The stop bracket 11 may also extend
along a portion of one edge of stop bracket 11 into a raised stop ledge 4, which projects
vertically up and then away from the stop bracket 11. In some embodiments, stop bracket 11
may comprise a shelf vertically projecting from one edge of the stop bracket 11 to form stop
ledge 4. The height and length of the said stop ledge 4 may be manufactured to variable
dimensions depending on the dimensions required for different applications, e.g., different
window/door sill widths.
[0045] The locking barrel 2 is designed to rotate by use of a key (not shown) between a
locked position and an unlocked position. In the locked position the curved edge 10 of the
locking barrel 2 protrudes through the aperture 9 into the first passage 5 such that it can
engage with the pin inserted into the first passage 5 to capture the reversible stop piece 3 and
prevent its removal from the lockable body 1. In the unlocked position, the concave edge 10
of the locking barrel 2 aligns with the aperture in the first passage 5. In this position, there is
no protrusion through the aperture 9 and consequently no contact between the reversible stop
piece 3 and the locking barrel 2, thereby allowing the reversible stop piece to be inserted and
removed freely from the lockable body 1.
[0046] Referring to Figure 3, the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor is depicted showing
screws 12, inserted through both the first passage 5 and second passage 6 and captured by an
opening at the bottom of each passage for fastening the device to a secure structure. In some
embodiments other fastening means may be used instead of screws, such as bolts, glue, rivets
nails and the like. In some embodiments, the diameter of the bottom opening, which is
located at the bottom side of each passage is smaller compared to the diameter of the top
opening of each passage, which is located at each of the passages' upper side. The reversible
stop piece 3 is then shown inserted into the lockable body 1 above the screws 12, e.g.,
through the top opening of each of passages 5 and 6, which are of a larger diameter compared
to the diameter of the bottom side opening. The locking barrel 2 is depicted in the locked
position to demonstrate how the curved edge 10 of the locking barrel 2 protrudes through the
aperture 9 and engages with the concave portion 7A of the first pin 7 inserted into the first
passage 5. In this position the locking barrel 2 is in the locked position and the reversible stop
piece 3 is captured and unable to be removed from the lockable body 1.
[0047] Referring to Figure 4A, the locking barrel 2 is depicted in the unlocked position. The
locking barrel may be rotated by use of a key (not shown) such that the concave edge 10 of

                                                  7
the locking barrel 2 will align with aperture 9 of the first passage. In this position the locking
barrel 2 does not protrude through the aperture 9 and does not engage with the pin inserted
into the first passage 5. In the absence of any physical inhibition to its removal, the reversible
stop piece 3 can be lifted freely and removed from the lockable body 1 as shown by Figure
4B.
[0048] The substantially similar configuration of both the first pin 7 and second pin 8 enable
the locking barrel 2 to engage either the first pin 7 or the second pin 8 depending on the
orientation of the reversible stop piece 3 inserted into the lockable body such that the locking
mechanism described herein can capture the reversible stop piece 3 in either the active or the
inactive position. That is, in the active position, first pin 7 would be inserted into first passage
5 (while second pin 8 would be inserted into second passage 6), thereby enabling locking
barrel 2 to engage the concave portion 7A of first pin 7 such to capture stop piece 3 in its
active orientation. In the inactive position of stop piece 3, it is second pin 8 that is inserted to
first passage 5 (while first pin 7 would be inserted into second passage 6), thereby enabling
locking barrel 2 to engage the concave portion 8A of second pin 8 such to capture stop piece
3 in its opposite inactive orientation.
[0049] Figure 5A depicts a real-life application of the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor
fastened to a secure structure. In this exemplary embodiment, reversible ventilation slide
inhibitor is fastened onto window sill 13 onto which a sliding member is installed. With the
reversible stop piece 3 in the active position such that the stop ledge 4 traverses the window
sill 13 of a sliding member, e.g., a window 15, to extend over the track 14. In this position a
window sash, may move freely until abutment with the stop ledge 4 will inhibit further
movement beyond the fixed restricted opening position.
[0050] Figure 5B depicts the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor installed in the same
position on window sill 13 but with the reversible stop piece 3 in the reversed inactive
position such that the stop ledge 4 extends over the front side of the reversible ventilation
slide inhibitor and away from the window 15. In the inactive position the sliding member
(e.g., window 15 of Fig. 5A) can bypass the stop ledge 4 and move to an unrestricted open
position beyond the reversible ventilation slide inhibitor.
