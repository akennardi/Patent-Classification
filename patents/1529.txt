        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5      The present invention relates to preparing a pharmaceutical intermediate method
   which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates to hormone
   intermediate androst-17a- methyl- 17p-alcohol-3-ketone synthesis method.
        GENERAL BACKGROUND
10      Androst-17a- methyl-17p-alcohol-3-ketone as a hormone intermediate is mainly
   used for the synthesis of metandienone. The metandienone's protein synthesis is
   similar to testosterone, but its protein assimilation effect is stronger than the male
   hormone, masculine effect is weaker, it can makes nitrogen, potassium, sodium,
   calcium, phosphorus, chlorine retention, weight gains, promotes bone formation and
15 body growth and development, it is used for osteoporosis and comminuted fracture
   due to application of cortisone drugs treatment, pain relief after menopause, chronic
   wasting disease and recovery after surgery, excessive loss of nitrogen in the severe
   burns, and promotes the growth and development premature infants and immature
   delay, such as dwarfism. Existing synthesis methods use chrome oxide, concentrated
20 sulfuric acid as reactants, because of chrome oxide's high pollution to the
   environment, the concentrated sulfuric acid as reactant will increase the risk of
   reaction coefficient, and the synthesis process is complex, so it is necessary to put
   forward a new synthesis method.
