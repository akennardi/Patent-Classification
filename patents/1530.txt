[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
      2013407260, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0002] This invention is directed to a dispensing container and to a method of
      dispensing a liquid from a container. More particularly, this invention is directed to
      a dispensing container where the dip tube is provided with a decorative feature
      which also provides an additional function. The decorative feature may optionally
      coordinate with a design on the front or rear of the container.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0003] Dispensing containers with dip tubes are used to store and dispense a range of
      personal care products. These include hand soaps, hand and body lotions, shampoos
      and body cleansing gels. There is a constant need to enhance the appearance of these
      containers. Various prior patent specifications disclose structures intended to
      enhance the appearance of the container, and some exhibit a dynamic, moving
      feature which is operable during dispensing. A recent example is the Applicant's
      WO-A1-2013/019207.           Furthermore, such personal care products often include
      fragrance. The fragrance intensity or bloom can be detrimentally reduced as a result
      of the personal care products being stored in the dispensing container.
[0004] The present invention aims to improve the appearance of a container and its
      product during use.
[0005] The present invention also aims to provide a simple and reliable structure which
      can be dynamically operated by the user during product dispensing.
[0006] The present invention further aims to provide a dispensing container for a
      personal care product which can enhance the fragrance intensity or bloom when the
      product is dispensed.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in
      nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.
[0023] As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every
      value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the
      terminus of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby
      incorporated by referenced in their entireties.     In the event of a conflict in a
      definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present
      disclosure controls.
[0024] The invention will be disclosed in its preferred embodiments with reference to
      the Figures in the drawings. The dispensing container has an enhanced appearance
      before and during use by a consumer to dispense the product contained within the
      container.
[0025] Figures 1, 2 and 3 show a dispensing container 10 with the enhanced appearance.
      The dispensing container is comprised of a body portion 12 and a neck portion 14.
                                              4
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

      The neck portion 14 has closure 16. Mounted in the closure is a pump mechanism 18
      with a dip tube 22 at one end and an actuator 20 with a dispensing channel exiting at
      a pump outlet 24. The dip tube 22 extends downwardly from the pump mechanism
      18 into the body portion 12 which contains a liquid L to be dispensed. The liquid
      may be, for example, selected from hand soaps, hand and body lotions, shampoos
      and body cleansing gels. When the pump mechanism 18 is activated by manual
      depression of the dispensing activator 20, liquid in body portion 12 travels up a
      central bore 21 of the dip tube 22, through the pump mechanism 18 and then
      through outlet 24. The pump mechanism 18 is a conventional self-priming pump
      mechanism well known in the art.
[0026] A dropper 26 is fitted to or integral with the dip tube 22 so as to be coupled to the
      dip tube 22. The dropper 26 comprises a transparent vial 28 sealed at one end 30
      and provided with a one-way pressure relief valve 27 to permit flow of liquid L into
      the end 20 of the dropper 26 to displace liquid within the drop[per 26 as that liquid
      is dispensed from the dropper 26. A capillary tube 32 extends from the other end 34
      of the vial 28 and the lower end 36 of the capillary tube 32 remote from the vial 28
      connects with the dip tube 22 via an orifice 42. The capillary tube 32 is transparent.
      The dropper 26 is downwardly oriented towards the lower end 36. A fragrance oil
      38 is disposed within the vial 28 which acts as a reservoir 40 for the fragrance oil 38.
      The fragrance oil 38 is colored with a dye or pigment so that the fragrance oil 38 is
      visible from the exterior of the dispensing container 10. At least a part of the body
      portion 12 is transparent and the liquid L is typically transparent or translucent. In
      the embodiment of Figure 1, at least a portion of the dip tube 22 adjacent to the
      orifice 42 is transparent and is visible from an exterior of the container.
[0027] In the illustrated embodiment, the dropper 26 is integral with an upper end part
      44 of the dip tube 22. The upper end part 44 of the dip tube 22 comprises a tubular
      portion 46 which is fitted, by bonding or a compression fitting, at its upper portion
      48 to the pump mechanism 18 and at its lower portion 50 to an elongate tubular
      lower end part 52 of the dip tube 22. The upper end part 44 of the dip tube 22 may
                                                  5
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

      be a molded section, such as being formed by injection or blow molding. The lower
      end part 52 of the dip tube 22 is typically flexible and may be formed by extrusion to
      an elongated form.
[0028] The lower portion 50 may optionally be fitted with a one way valve (not shown)
      to prevent or inhibit siphoning of liquid fragrance oil 38 from reservoir 40 through
      the orifice 42 and down into the dip tube 22.
[0029] A decorative element, not shown, may be fitted to or integral with the vial 28.
      The decorative element may have a visual association with the fragrance, for
      example illustrating a flower when the fragrance is a floral fragrance.
[0030] When the pump mechanism 18 is activated by manual depression of the
      dispensing activator 20, this imparts upward liquid flow through the dip tube 22
      during the dispensing operation. As the liquid flows past the lower end 36 of the
      capillary tube 32, drops of fragrance oil are successively introduced into the liquid
      flow from the orifice 42 at the lower end 36 of the capillary tube 32. Depending on
      the liquid properties and the dispensing mechanism, the liquid flow may generate
      shear forces to pull a drop out of the capillary tube 32 and/or a reduced pressure in
      the liquid flow may suck a drop out of the capillary tube 32. The fragrance oil is
      gravity fed from the reservoir 40 to the lower end 36 of the capillary tube 32. This
      provides a constant supply of fragrance oil at the orifice 42.
[0031] The orifice 42 typically has a cross-sectional area so as not to exceed the surface
      tension of the fragrance oil in the liquid L so that drops of fragrance oil only enter
      the liquid L as a result of liquid flow past the orifice 42.
[0032] Since the fragrance oil is introduced dropwise into the liquid flow, this effect
      may be seen by a user. Also, over a period of time, as a result of plural successive
      dispensing operations, the volume of oil in the reservoir 40 is diminished. The
      diminishing volume of fragrance oil may also be visible to a user. Accordingly, the
      dropper and the visible fragrance oil therein provide a decorative effect visible from
      an exterior of the container 10.
                                                 6
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

[0033] Furthermore, the fragrance oil is stored in the reservoir 40 rather than in the
      liquid to be dispensed. Such separate storage of the fragrance oil in the reservoir 40
      provides that the fragrance oil is exposed to a minimum amount or concentration of
      oxygen or air prior to dispensing. In turn, this provides that the fragrance intensity
      or bloom is maximized during product dispensing, because the fragrance oil is
      introduced into the liquid immediately prior to dispensing. Prior to dispensing, the
      fragrance oil is retained in the reservoir 40, and the vial 28 seals the fragrance oil
      against contact with the liquid or air apart from at the narrow bore orifice 42 of the
      capillary tube 32.
[0034] The pump mechanism 18 may include a screen or air chamber, or other pump
      parts, as are known in the art, such as a foamer mechanism, which would function
      to shear the fragrance and mix together the fragrance oil 38 and the liquid L during
      dispensing to provide a uniform mixture exiting outlet 24.
[0035] In an alternative embodiment, not illustrated, the dropper 26 can be vertically
      oriented so that the orifice 42 is upwardly directed. When the liquid L is pumped, a
      reduced pressure above the orifice 42 would tend to pump fragrance oil 38 up the
      capillary tube 32 and into the flow of liquid L. This modification has the advantage
      that fragrance oil 38 is less likely to be released inadvertently into liquid L as a result
      of shaking the container 10 because the fragrance oil 38 is held by gravity as well as
      surface tension in the reservoir 40.
[0036] A second embodiment of a dispensing container is shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6.
[0037] In this embodiment, the dispensing container 10 is similar to that of the first
      embodiment. The dispensing container is comprised of a body portion 12 and a
      neck portion 14. The neck portion 14 has closure 16. Mounted in the closure is a
      pump mechanism 18 with a dip tube 22 at one end and an actuator 20 with a
      dispensing channel exiting at a pump outlet 24. The dip tube 22 extends
      downwardly from the pump mechanism 18 into the body portion 12 which contains
      a liquid L to be dispensed. The liquid may be, for example, selected from hand
      soaps, hand and body lotions, shampoos and body cleansing gels. When the pump
                                                   7
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

      mechanism 18 is activated by manual depression of the dispensing activator 20,
      liquid in body portion 12 travels up a central bore 21 of dip tube 22, through the
      pump mechanism 18 and then through outlet 24. The pump mechanism 18 is a
      conventional self-priming pump mechanism well known in the art.
[0038] In this embodiment, a flexible bulb 60 is fitted to the dip tube 22. The flexible
      bulb 60 defines a basin 62 between the outer bulb wall 64, which is flexible, and a
      central tubular element 66. The outer bulb wall 64 comprises a transparent film,
      typically composed of a polymer. An upper edge 68 of the outer bulb wall 64 is
      fitted, by bonding or a compression fitting, to an upper end 70 of the central tubular
      element 66 and a lower edge 72 of the outer bulb wall 64 is fitted, by bonding or a
      compression fitting, to a lower end 74 of the central tubular element 66. The upper
      end 70 is fitted, by bonding or a compression fitting, to the pump mechanism 18 and
      the lower end 74 is fitted, by bonding or a compression fitting, to the upper end 76
      of an elongate tubular lower end part 78 of the dip tube 22. The central tubular
      element 66 may be a molded section, such as being formed by injection or blow
      molding. The lower end part 78 of the dip tube 22 is typically flexible and may be
      formed by extrusion to an elongated form.
[0039] At least one capillary orifice 80 is provided in the lower end 74 of the central
      tubular element 66, which communicates the basin 62 to the central tube 82 of the
      central tubular element 66 and thereby connects the basin 62 with the dip tube 22.
      The orifice(s) 80 again may be dimensioned so as each to have a cross-sectional area
      so as to provide drops of fragrance oil into the liquid L only as a result of liquid flow
      past the orifice(s) 80.
[0040] A fragrance oil 84 is disposed within the basin 62 which acts as a reservoir 86 for
      the fragrance oil 84. As for the first embodiment, the fragrance oil 84 is colored with
      a dye or pigment so that the fragrance oil 84 in the basin 62 is visible from the
      exterior of the dispensing container 10. At least a part of the body portion 12 is
      transparent and the liquid L is typically transparent or translucent.
                                                8
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

[0041] A decorative element, not shown, may be fitted to or integral with the flexible
      bulb 60. The decorative element may have a visual association with the fragrance,
      for example illustrating a flower when the fragrance is a floral fragrance.
[0042] When the pump mechanism 18 is activated by manual depression of the
      dispensing activator 20, this imparts upward liquid flow through the dip tube 22
      during the dispensing operation. As the liquid flows past the capillary orifice(s) 80,
      drops of fragrance oil are successively introduced into the liquid flow from the
      orifice(s) 80 at the lower end of the basin 62 containing the fragrance oil 84.
      Depending on the liquid properties and the dispensing mechanism, the liquid flow
      may generate shear forces to pull a drop out of the capillary orifice(s) 80 and/or a
      reduced pressure in the liquid flow may suck a drop out of the capillary orifice(s) 80.
      The fragrance oil is gravity fed from the reservoir 86 to the capillary orifice(s) 80.
      This provides a constant supply of fragrance oil at the orifice(s) 80.
[0043] Since the fragrance oil is introduced dropwise into the liquid flow, this effect
      may be seen by a user if at least the lower part of the central tubular element 66 is
      transparent. Also, over a period of time, as a result of plural successive dispensing
      operations, the volume of oil in the reservoir 86 is diminished. Figure 4 shows the
      flexible bulb 60 initially full of fragrance oil and Figure 5 shows the flexible bulb 60
      after some amount of fragrance oil has been dispensed, and the corresponding
      reduction in the volume of the flexible bulb 60 can readily be seen.
[0044] The diminishing volume of fragrance oil may also be visible to a user. Since the
      bulb 60 is flexible, the bulb volume also is diminished as a result of plural successive
      dispensing operations, which is visible to a user. Accordingly, the flexible bulb 60
      and the visible fragrance oil therein provide a decorative effect visible from an
      exterior of the container 10.
[0045] Furthermore, as for the first embodiment, the fragrance oil is stored in the
      reservoir 86 rather than in the liquid to be dispensed and the fragrance oil is
      introduced into the liquid immediately prior to dispensing. Prior to dispensing, the
      fragrance oil is retained in the reservoir 86, and the flexible bulb 60 seals the
                                                  9

      fragrance oil against contact with the liquid or air apart from at the capillary
      orifice(s) 80.
[0046] A further dispensing mechanism is shown in Figure 7, in accordance with a third
      embodiment of the invention, which is a modification of the embodiment of Figures
      1 to 3. The dispensing mechanism 82 is disposed in a dispensing container (not
      shown) which is the same container as in the other embodiments. The dispensing
      mechanism 82 comprises a vial 83 containing a liquid, such as a fragrance oil F, to be
      introduced dropwise into the liquid L in the body of the container, as discussed
      hereinbefore. The vial 83 is upwardly oriented and a straw-like tube 84 extends
      downwardly into the vial 83 through a sealed upper surface 85 of the vial 83. The
      straw-like tube 84 connects to a side port 86 of a three-way connector 87 at the top of
      the dip tube 88 and beneath the pump 89. A one way valve 90 may be provided in
      the straw-like tube 84 to prevent liquid in the dip tube 88 from flowing back into the
      vial 83.             The vial 83 may have flexible walls and be compressible, in a manner
      similar to the basin of the previous embodiment, and/or a one way valve 92 may be
      provided in the vial 83 to permit pressure equalization between the interior of the
      vial 83 and the container body.
[0047] In this embodiment, instead of gravity feeding the fragrance oil into the dip tube
      through capillary orifice(s), a straw-like tube 84 is provided which communicates
      between the vial 83 and the dip tube 88. Liquid flow through the dip tube 88 sucks
      liquid from the vial up the straw-like tube 84 and into the three-way connector 87
      where the liquids are blended together.
[0048] In a further embodiment, the basin of Figures 4 to 6 incorporates an upwardly
      oriented straw-like tube therein, similar to the straw-like tube of Figure 7, rather
      than capillary orifices, for controllably delivering the liquid in the basin dropwise
      into the dip tube or the pump mechanism as a result of liquid flow through the dip
      tube.
[0049] Referring to Figures 8 and 9, in a further embodiment the dispensing container
      10 is similar to that of the previous embodiments.             The dispensing container is
                                                       10
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

      comprised of a body portion 12 and a neck portion 14. The neck portion 14 has
      closure 16. Mounted in the closure is a pump mechanism 18 with a dip tube 22 at
      one end and an actuator 20 with a dispensing channel exiting at a pump outlet 24.
      The dip tube 22 extends downwardly from the pump mechanism 18 into the body
      portion 12 which contains a liquid L to be dispensed. The liquid may be, for
      example, selected from hand soaps, hand and body lotions, shampoos and body
      cleansing gels. When the pump mechanism 18 is activated by manual depression of
      the dispensing activator 20, liquid in body portion 12 travels up a central bore 21 of
      dip tube 22, through the pump mechanism 18 and then through outlet 24. The pump
      mechanism 18 is a conventional self-priming pump mechanism well known in the
      art.
[0050] In this embodiment, the dip tube 22 incorporates a wick element 100 which is
      pre-loaded with a fragrance oil 102. The wick element 100 typically comprises a tube
      of transparent or translucent porous material, such as a porous polymeric open
      cellular foam, which contains fragrance oil 102 infused therein. The wick element
      100 is surrounded by an impermeable layer 104, for example a transparent
      polymeric film, which prevents the fragrance oil 102 from leaching out of the dip
      tube 22 into the body portion 12 which contains the liquid L to be dispensed. The
      impermeable layer 104 may be provided with a one way valve at the bottom thereof,
      in order to equilibrate the pressure in the wick element 100 and liquid L, to prevent
      fragrance oil from leaching into the liquid L. The wick element 100 typically has a
      thickness dependent upon the desired liquid storage capacity of the wick element
      100.
[0051] The wick element 100 acts as a reservoir 106 for the fragrance oil 102. As for the
      previous embodiments, the fragrance oil 102 is colored with a dye or pigment so that
      the fragrance oil 102 in the wick element 100 is visible from the exterior of the
      dispensing container 10. At least a part of the body portion 12 is transparent and the
      liquid L is typically transparent or translucent.
                                                11
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

[0052] A decorative element, not shown, may be fitted to or integral with the wick
      element 100.                 The decorative element may have a visual association with the
      fragrance, for example illustrating a flower when the fragrance is a floral fragrance.
[0053] When the pump mechanism 18 is activated by manual depression of the
      dispensing activator 20, this imparts upward liquid flow through the dip tube 22
      during the dispensing operation. As the liquid flows through the wick element 100,
      fragrance oil 102 is introduced into the liquid flow from the pores of the wick
      element 100 containing the fragrance oil 102.
[0054] The wick element 100 may have a hollow core in order to allow the liquid L to
      pass freely up the center of the wick element 100 and control fragrance dispensing
      into the liquid L.
[0055] Over a period of time, as a result of plural successive dispensing operations, the
      volume of fragrance oil in the wick element 100 is diminished. The diminishing
      volume of fragrance oil may also be visible to a user, as a result of reduced intensity
      of the color of the reduced concentration of the fragrance oil in the wick element 100.
      Accordingly, the wick element 100 and the visible fragrance oil therein provide a
      decorative effect visible from an exterior of the container 10.
[0056] Furthermore, as for the previous embodiments, the fragrance oil is stored in the
      reservoir 106 rather than in the liquid to be dispensed and the fragrance oil is
      introduced into the liquid immediately prior to dispensing. Prior to dispensing, the
      fragrance oil is retained in the reservoir 106, and the impermeable layer 104 seals the
      fragrance oil against contact with the liquid or air apart from in the interior tubular
      bore 106 of the wick element 100.
[0057] The container may be made of essentially any substantially transparent plastic.
      Glass may also be used. Useful plastics are polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene
      terephthalate. The dip tube and the associated parts may be produced from any
      plastic that can be extruded, and optionally blow-molded, or injection molded. Such
      polymers include homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene and propylene, vinyl
                                                        12
9667039 1 (GHMatters) P103042.AU.1

      compound homopolymers and copolymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, and
      polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate.
[0058] The container may be provided with a label. The label can be shaped or partially
      transparent to reveal at least the reservoir, for example providing a window through
      which the reservoir may be viewed. The label may be applied by in-mold labeling or
      the use of a shrink film.
[0059] Front and/or rear labels may be composed of any substantially clear plastic. The
      preferred plastics are thermoplastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene including
      biaxially               oriented polypropylene,  polyvinyl chloride and  polyethylene
      terephthalate. The front and rear labels are typically printed. In-mold labels and
      shrink film labels may be composed of a wide range of monolayer and laminate
      materials, such as thermoplastic polymers.
[0060] Other modifications to the illustrated embodiments will be apparent to those
      skilled in the art and are within the scope of the present invention as defined in the
      appended claims.
