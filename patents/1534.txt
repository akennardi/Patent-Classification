15          FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The field of this invention relates to compositions of antigen binding proteins
   including antibodies capable of binding CD27L, as well as related methods.
   BACKGROUND
20          CD27L (CD70, TNFSF7) is a type II integral membrane protein whose expression
   on normal tissues is highly restricted to a subset of activated T and B cells, dendritic
   cells and to a small subset of cells in the thymic epithelium. The biological functions of
   CD27L, which include augmentation or regulation of the immune response, are mediated
   via binding to its receptor, CD27, which is expressed predominately on lymphoid cells.
25 CD27L/CD27 interactions regulate B-cell proliferation and differentiation and T-cell
   costimulation/activation. Disruption of the CD27L/CD27 interaction in mice deficient
   for CD27 does not result in any phenotype in the absence of an immune challenge.
   (Grewal, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 12, 341-351 (2008)).
            In addition to its very restricted expression on normal tissues, CD27L is expressed
30 at relatively high levels in some B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) tumor sub
   types, in pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and in B cell type-chronic
   lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Aberrant expression of CD27L is also observed in renal
   cell carcinoma (RCC) but not in normal kidney or other normal tissues. Thus, CD27L
   comes close to exhibiting properties consistent with those of a "tumor specific antigen"
35 (Grewal, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 12, 341-351 (2008)).

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5          Each year, of the approximately 49,000 patients that will develop RCC, a little
   over 40,000 of those will be diagnosed with ccRCC in the US (American Cancer Society:
   Cancer Facts and Figures final (2008). While some newer therapeutics have been
   approved for RCC over the last 4 years, the 5 year survival rate for patients with
   metastatic RCC remains dismal at 10- 2 0 % (National Caner Institute. SEER cancer
10 statistics fact sheet: cancer of the kidney and renal pelvis -- accessed 2008) and
   significant unmet medical need remains. The projected yearly number of newly
   diagnosed ccRCC patients (U.S.) that are expected to express CD27L is approximately
   36,000. There are an estimated 64,000 ccRCC patients currently with active disease.
            Of the B-cell malignancies reported to aberrantly express CD27L, the B-NHL
15 subsets of diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL)
   show the highest incidence of expression ranging from 33% for FL to 71% for DLBCL as
   assessed by IHC on frozen sections using a validated antibody (Lens et al., Brit. J.
   Hematol. 106, 491-503 (1999). 50-89 % of B-CLL tumors also express CD27L as
   assessed by IHC on frozen tumor sections or by flow cytometry on circulating tumor cells
20 (Ranheim et al., Blood 85, 3556-3565 (1965); Trentin et al., CancerRes. 57, 4940-4947
   (1997)).
            Of the 127,000 patients in the US currently with active B-NHL, approximately
   50% of these patients present with the DLBCL (intermediate grade) sub-type (Morton et
   al., Blood 107, 265-276 (2002)). Despite Rituxan plus cyclophosphamide, adriamycin,
25 vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) standard of care therapy for DLBCL patients, almost
   50% relapse. Therefore an unmet medical need remains in this disease as well.

   CD27L
            The antigen binding proteins bind to CD27L, which is also known as CD70 and
   TNFSF7. CD27L was first described in US Pat. No. 5,573,924. An exemplary human
   CD27L amino acid sequence is provided herein as SEQ ID NO: 1, which corresponds to
15 NCBI Reference Sequence NP_001423.1 (GI:4507605). In certain embodiments, the
   antigen binding protein blocks the interaction of CD27L with its receptor CD27. An
   exemplary CD27 amino acid sequence is provided as SEQ ID NO:2, which corresponds
   to Swiss-Prot: P26842.2 (GI:269849546). A mature CD27 amino acid sequence
   corresponds to amino acids 20-260 of SEQ ID NO:2.
20 CD27L Antigen Binding Proteins
            The present invention provides antigen binding proteins that specifically bind
   CD27L. Embodiments of antigen binding proteins comprise peptides and/or
   polypeptides that specifically bind CD27L. Such peptides or polypeptides may
   optionally include one or more port-translational modification. Embodiments of antigen
25 binding proteins comprise antibodies and fragments thereof, as variously defined herein,
   that specifically bind CD27L. These include antibodies that specifically bind human
   CD27L, including those that inhibit CD27L from binding and/or activating CD27.
            The antigen binding proteins of the invention specifically bind to CD27L.
   "Specifically binds" as used herein means that the antigen binding protein preferentially
30 binds CD27L over other proteins. In some embodiments "specifically binds" means the
   CD27L antigen binding protein has a higher affinity for CD27L than for other proteins.
   CD27L antigen binding proteins that specifically bind CD27L may have a binding
   affinity for human CD27L of less than or equal to 1 x 10-7 M, less than or equal to 2 x 10

   x 10-1 M, less than or equal to 7 x 10-1 M, less than or equal to 8 x 10-1 M, or less than
   or equal to 9 x 10-12 M. Methods of measuring the binding affinity of an antigen binding
   protein are well known in the art. Example I provides an exemplary method.
           It is understood that when reference is made to the various embodiments of the
25 CD27L-binding antibodies herein, that it also encompasses CD27L-binding fragments
   thereof. A CD27L-binding fragment comprises any of the antibody fragments or
   domains described herein that retains the ability to specifically bind to CD27L. The
   CD27L-binding fragment may be in any of the scaffolds described herein.
           In certain therapeutic embodiments, a CD27L antigen binding protein inhibits
30 binding of CD27L to CD27 and/or inhibits one or more biological activities associated
   with the binding of CD27L to CD27, e.g., CD27-mediated signaling. Such antigen
   binding proteins are said to be "neutralizing." In certain embodiments, the neutralizing
   CD27L antigen binding protein specifically binds CD27L and inhibits binding of CD27L
   to CD27 from anywhere between 10% to 100%, such as by at least about 20, 21, 22, 23,

   for neutralizing ability by determining the ability of the antigen binding protein to block
   binding of CD27-Fc to MP-1 cells (Slack et al, Int. Immunol. (1995) 7(7): 1087-1092)).

           The antigen binding proteins of the invention comprise the scaffolds of traditional

 5 including various combinations of the CDRs, may be grafted into any of the following
   scaffolds.
            As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to the various forms of monomeric or
   multimeric proteins comprising one or more polypeptide chains that specifically binds to
   an antigen, as variously described herein. In certain embodiments, antibodies are
10 produced by recombinant DNA techniques. In additional embodiments, antibodies are
   produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of naturally occurring antibodies. In
   another aspect, the antibody is selected from the group consisting of: a) a human
   antibody; b) a humanized antibody; c) a chimeric antibody; d) a monoclonal antibody; e)
   a polyclonal antibody; f) a recombinant antibody; g) an antigen-binding fragment; h) a
15 single chain antibody; i) a diabody; j) a triabody, k) a tetrabody, 1) a Fab fragment; m) a
   F(ab') 2 fragment, n) an IgA antibody, o) an IgD antibody, p) an IgE antibody, q) an IgGI
   antibody, r) an IgG2 antibody, s) an IgG3 antibody, t) an IgG4 antibody, and u) an IgM
   antibody.
            A variable region comprises at least three heavy or light chain CDRs embedded
20 within a framework region (designated framework regions FRI, FR2, FR3, and FR4).
   Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences ofProteins ofImmunological Interest, Public Health
   Service N.I.H., Bethesda, MD. Traditional antibody structural units typically comprise a
   tetramer. Each tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide
   chains, each pair having one "light" and one "heavy" chain. The amino-terminal portion
25 of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids
   primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each
   chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light
   chains are classified as kappa or lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu,
   delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA,
30 and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited to IgGI,
   IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses, including, but not limited to IgMI and IgM2.
   Embodiments of the invention include all such classes and subclasses of antibodies that
   incorporate a variable domain or CDR of the antigen binding proteins, as described
   herein.
                                                 29

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5          Some naturally occurring antibodies, such as those found in camels and llamas,
   are dimers consisting of two heavy chains and include no light chains. The invention
   encompasses dimeric antibodies of two heavy chains, or fragments thereof, that can bind
   to CD27L.
            The variable regions of the heavy and light chains typically exhibit the same
10 general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three
   hypervariable regions, i.e., the complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The
   CDRs are primarily responsible for antigen recognition and binding. The CDRs fromt eh
   two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a
   specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise
15 the domains FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The assignment of amino
   acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat.
            CDRs constitute the major surface contact points for antigen binding. The CDR3
   or the light chain and, particularly, CDR3 of the heavy chain may constitute the most
   important determinants in antigen binding within the light and heavy chain variable
20 regions. In some antibodies, the heavy chain CDR3 appears to constitute the major area
   of contact between the antigen and the antibody. In vitro selection schemes in which
   CDR3 alone is varied can be used to vary the binding properties of an antibody or
   determine which residues contribute to the binding of an antigen.
            Naturally occurring antibodies typically include a signal sequence, which directs
25 the antibody into the cellular pathway for protein secretion and which is typically not
   present in the mature antibody. A polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention
   may encode a naturally occurring a signal sequence or a heterologous signal sequence as
   described below.
            In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein is a antibody comprising from
30 one to six of the exemplary CDRs described herein. The antibodies of the invention may
   be of any type including IgM, IgG (including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgD, IgA, or IgE
   antibody. In a specific embodiment the antigen biding protein is an IgG type antibody,
   e.g., a IgGI antibody.
            In some embodiments, for example when the antigen binding protein is an
35 antibody with complete heavy and light chains, the CDRs are all from the same species,
                                                30

   WO 2013/043933                                                          PCT/US2012/056429
 5 e.g., human. Alternatively, for example in embodiments wherein the antigen binding
   protein contains less than six CDRs from the sequences outlined above, additional CDRs
   may be either from other species or may be different human CDRs than those depicted in
   the exemplary sequences. For example, HCDR3 and LCDR3 regions from the
   appropriate sequences identified herein may be used with HCDR1, HCDR2, LCDR1, and
10 LCDR2 being optionally selected from alternate species or different human antibody
   sequences, or combinations thereof. For example, the CDRs of the invention can replace
   the CDR regions of commercially relevant chimeric or humanized antibodies.
            Specific embodiments utilize scaffold components of the antigen binding proteins
   that are human components. In some embodiments, however, the scaffold components
15 can be a mixture from different species. As such, if the antigen binding protein is an
   antibody, such antibody may be a chimeric antibody and/or humanized antibody. In
   general, both "chimeric antibodies" and humanized antibodies" refer to antibodies that
   combine regions from more than one species. For example, "chimeric antibodies"
   traditionally comprise variable region(s) from a mouse (or rat, in some casaes) and the
20 constant region(s) from a human.
            "Humanized antibodies" generally refer to non-human antibodies that have had
   the variable domain framework regions swapped for sequences found in human
   antibodies. Generally, in a humanized antibody, the entire antibody, except one or more
   CDRs, is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such an antibody
25 except within one or more CDRs. The CDRs, some or all of which are encoded by
   nucleic acids originating in a non-human organism, are grafted into the beta-sheet
   framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody, the specificity of
   which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described
   in, e.g., WO 92/11018, Jones 1986, Nature 321:522-525, Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science
30 239:1534-1536. Humanized antibodies can also be generated using mice with a
   genetically engineered immune system. Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639
   654. In the exemplary embodiments described herein, the identified CDRs are human,
   and thus both humanized and chimeric antibodies in this context include some non
   human CDRs; for example, humanized antibodies may be generated that comprise the
                                                31

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5 HCDR3 and LCDR3 regions, with one or more of the other CDR regions being of a
   different species origin.
            In one embodiment, theCD27L antigen binding protein is a mutlispecific
   antibody, and notably a bispecfic antibody, also sometimes referred to as "diabodies."
   These are antibodies that bind to two or more different antigens or different epitopes on a
10 single antigen. In certain embodiments, a bispecific antibody binds CD27L and an
   antigen on a human effector cell (e.g., T cell). Such antibodies are useful in targeting an
   effector cell response against a CD27L expressing cells, such as a tumor cell. In
   preferred embodiments, the human effector cell antigen is CD3. U.S. Pat. No. 7,235,641.
   Methods of making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. One such method involves
15 engineering the Fc portion of the heavy chains such as to create "knobs" and "holes"
   which facilitate heterodimer formation of the heavy chains when co-expressed in a cell.
   U.S. 7,695,963. Another method also involves engineering the Fc portion of the heavy
   chain but uses electrostatic steering to encourage heterodimer formation while
   discouraging homodimer formation of the heavy chains when co-expressed in a cell. WO
20 09/089,004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
            In one embodiment, the CD27L antigen binding protein is a minibody.
   Minibodies are minimized antibody-like proteins comprising a scFv joined to a CH3
   domain. Hu et al., 1996, CancerRes. 56:3055-3061.
            In one embodiment, the CD27L antigen binding protein is a domain antibody; see,
25 for example U.S. Patent No. 6,248,516. Domain antibodies (dAbs) are functional binding
   domains of antibodies, corresponding to the variable regions of either the heavy (VH) or
   light (VL) chains of human antibodies. dABs have a molecular weight of approximately
   13 kDa, or less than one-tenth the size of a full antibody. dABs are well expressed in a
   variety of hosts including bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cell systems. In addition,
30 dAbs are highly stable and retain activity even after being subjected to harsh conditions,
   such as freeze-drying or heat denaturation. See, for example, US Patent 6,291,158;
   6,582,915; 6,593,081; 6,172,197; US Serial No. 2004/0110941; European Patent

            In one embodiment, the CD27L antigen binding protein is an antibody fragment,
35 that is a fragment of any of the antibodies outlined herein that retain binding specificity to

   limited to, a F(ab), F(ab'), F(ab')2, Fv, or a single chain Fv fragments. At a minimum, an
   antibody, as meant herein, comprises a polypeptide that can bind specifically to CD27L
   comprising all or part of a light or heavy chain variable region, such as one or more
   CDRs.
10          Further examples of CD27L-binding antibody fragments include, but are not
   limited to, (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CHI domains, (ii) the Fd
   fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains, (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the
   VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward et al., 1989,
   Nature 341:544-546) which consists of a single variable, (v) isolated CDR regions, (vi)
15 F(ab') 2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single
   chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a
   peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site
   (Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426, Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
   85:5879-5883), (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix)
20 "diabodies" or "triabodies", multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene
   fusion (Tomlinson et. al., 2000, Methods Enzymol. 326:461-479; W094/13804; Holliger
   et al., 1993, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-6448). The antibody fragments may
   be modified. For example, the molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of
   disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al., 1996, Nature Biotech.
25 14:1239-1245). Aspects of the invention include embodiments wherein the non-CDR
   components of these fragments are human sequences.
            In one embodiment, the CD27L antigen binding protein is a fully human
   antibody. In this embodiment, as outlined above, specific structures comprise complete
   heavy and light chains depicted comprising the CDR regions. Additional embodiments
30 utilize one or more of the CDRs of the invention, with the other CDRs, framework
   regions, J and D regions, constant regions, etc., coming from other human antibodies.
   For example, the CDRs of the invention can replace the CDRs of any number of human
   antibodies, particularly commercially relevant antibodies
            Single chain antibodies may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable
35 domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in

 5 a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) have been prepared by fusing
   DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain
   polypeptides (VL and VH). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to
   form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or
   tetramers), depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains
10 (Kortt et al., 1997, Prot. Eng. 10:423; Kortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By
   combining different VL and VH-comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs
   that bind to different epitopes (Kriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40).
   Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those
   described in U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423; Huston et al., 1988,

25         In one embodiment, the CD27L antigen binding protein is an antibody fusion
   protein (sometimes referred to herein as an "antibody conjugate"). The conjugate partner
   can be proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous; the latter generally being generated using
   functional groups on the antigen binding protein and on the conjugate partner. In certain
   embodiments, the antibody is conjugated to a non-proteinaceous chemical (drug) to form
30 an antibody drug conjugate. Exemplary antibody drug conjugates and methods of
   making such conjugates are discussed below.
           In one embodiment, the CD27L antigen binding protein is an antibody analog,
   sometimes referred to as "synthetic antibodies." For example, a variety of work utilizes
   either alternative protein scaffolds or artificial scaffolds with grafted CDRs. Such
35 scaffolds include, but are not limited to, mutations introduced to stabilize the three

   consisting for example of biocompatible polymers. See, for example, Korndorfer et al.,
   2003, Proteins:Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics,Volume 53, Issue 1:121-129.
   Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654. In addition, peptide antibody
   mimetics ("PAMs") can be used, as well as work based on antibody mimetics utilizing
10 fibronection components as a scaffold.
           By "protein," as used herein, is meant at least two covalently attached amino
   acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. In some
   embodiments, the two or more covalently attached amino acids are attached by a peptide
   bond. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide
15 bonds, for example when the protein is made recombinantly using expression systems
   and host cells, as outlined below. Alternatively, the protein may include synthetic amino
   acids (e.g., homophenylalanine, citrulline, ornithine, and norleucine), or peptidomimetic
   structures, i.e., "peptide or protein analogs", such as peptoids (see, Simon et al., 1992,
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:9367, incorporated by reference herein), which can be
20 resistant to proteases or other physiological and/or storage conditions. Such synthetic
   amino acids may be incorporated in particular when the antigen binding protein is
   synthesized in vitro by conventional methods well known in the art. In addition, any
   combination of peptidomimetic, synthetic and naturally occurring residues/structures can
   be used. "Amino acid" also includes imino acid residues such as proline and
25 hydroxyproline. The amino acid "R group" or "side chain" may be in either the (L)- or
   the (S)-configuration. In a specific embodiment, the amino acids are in the (L)- or (S)
   configuration.
           In certain aspects, the invention provides recombinant antigen binding proteins
   that bind a CD27L and, in some embodiments, a recombinant human CD27L or portion
30 thereof. In this context, a "recombinant protein" is a protein made using recombinant
   techniques using any techniques and methods known in the art, i.e., through the
   expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein. Methods and techniques
   for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art. Embodiments of
   the invention include recombinant antigen binding proteins that bind wild-type CD27L
35 and variants thereof.

   sequence and still retain biological activity, as described herein.
            In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention are isolated
   proteins or substantially pure proteins. An "isolated" protein is unaccompanied by at
10 least some of the material with which it is normally associated in its natural state, for
   example constituting at least about 5%, or at least about 50% by weight of the total
   protein in a given sample. It is understood that the isolated protein may constitute from 5
   to 99.9% by weight of the total protein content depending on the circumstances. For
   example, the protein may be made at a significantly higher concentration through the use
15 of an inducible promoter or high expression promoter, such that the protein is made at
   increased concentration levels. The definition includes the production of an antigen
   binding protein in a wide variety of organisms and/or host cells that are known in the art.
            For amino acid sequences, sequence identity and/or similarity is determined by
   using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local
20 sequence identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Adv. Apple. Math. 2:482, the
   sequence identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol.
   48:443, the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Nat. A cad.
   Sci. U.S.A. 85:2444, computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT,
   FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer
25 Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), the Best Fit sequence program described by
   Devereux et al., 1984, Nucl. Acid Res. 12:387-395, preferably using the default settings,
   or by inspection. Preferably, percent identity is calculated by FastDB based upon the
   following parameters: mismatch penalty of 1; gap penalty of 1; gap size penalty of 0.33;
   and joining penalty of 30, "Current Methods in Sequence Comparison and Analysis,"

            An example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple
   sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise
   alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the
35 alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng &
                                                     36

 5 Doolittle, 1987, J. Mol. Evol. 35:351-360; the method is similar to that described by
   Higgins and Sharp, 1989, CABIOS 5:151-153. Useful PILEUP parameters including a
   default gap weight of 3.00, a default gap length weight of 0.10, and weighted end gaps.
           Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described in:
   Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res.
10 25:3389-3402; and Karin et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:5873-5787. A
   particularly useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program which was obtained
   from Altschul et al., 1996, Methods in Enzymology 266:460-480. WU-BLAST-2 uses
   several search parameters, most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable
   parameters are set with the following values: overlap span=1, overlap fraction=0. 125,
15 word threshold (T)=II. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are
   established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular
   sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of
   interest is being searched; however, the values may be adjusted to increase sensitivity.
           An additional useful algorithm is gapped BLAST as reported by Altschul et al.,
20 1993, Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Gapped BLAST uses BLOSUM-62 substitution
   scores; threshold T parameter set to 9; the two-hit method to trigger ungapped extensions,
   charges gap lengths of k a cost of 10+k; Xu  1 set to 16, and Xg set to 40 for database search
   stage and to 67 for the output stage of the algorithms. Gapped alignments are triggered
   by a score corresponding to about 22 bits.
25         Generally, the amino acid homology, similarity, or identity between individual
   variant CDRs are at least 80% to the sequences depicted herein, and more typically with
   preferably increasing homologies or identities of at least 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%,
   94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, and almost 100%. In a similar manner, "percent (%)
   nucleic acid sequence identity" with respect to the nucleic acid sequence of the binding
30 proteins identified herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotide residues in a
   candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotide residues in the coding sequence
   of the antigen binding protein. A specific method utilizes the BLASTN module of WU
   BLAST-2 set to the default parameters, with overlap span and overlap fraction set to 1
   and 0.125, respectively.

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5         Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology, similarity, or identity between the
   nucleotide sequences encoding individual variant CDRs and the nucleotide sequences
   depicted herein are at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing
   homologies or identities of at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%,
   89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%, and almost 100%.
10         Thus, a "variant CDR" is one with the specified homology, similarity, or identity
   to the parent CDR of the invention, and shares biological function, including, but not
   limited to, at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%,
   92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the specificity and/or activity of the
   parent CDR.
15         While the site or region for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is
   predetermined, the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, in order to
   optimize the performance of a mutation at a given site, random mutagenesis may be
   conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antigen binding protein CDR
   variants screened for the optimal combination of desired activity. Techniques for making
20 substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well
   known, for example, M13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Screening of the
   mutants is done using assays of antigen binding protein activities, such as CD27L
   binding.
           Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues; insertions usually will
25 be on the order of from about one (1) to about twenty (20) amino acid residues, although
   considerably larger insertions may be tolerated. Deletions range from about one (1) to
   about twenty (20) amino acid residues, although in some cases deletions may be much
   larger.
           Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof may be used to
30 arrive at a final derivative or variant. Generally these changes are done on a few amino
   acids to minimize the alteration of the molecule, particularly the immunogenicity and
   specificity of the antigen binding protein. However, larger changes may be tolerated in
   certain circumstances. Conservative substitutions are generally made in accordance with
   the following chart depicted as TABLE 1.

            Substantial changes in function or immunological identity are made by selecting
   substitutions that are less conservative than those shown in TABLE 1. For example,
   substitutions may be made which more significantly affect: the structure of the
10 polypeptide backbone in the area of the alteration, for example the alpha-helical or beta
   sheet structure; the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site; or the bulk
   of the side chain. The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest
   changes in the polypeptide's properties are those in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, e.g.,
   seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, e.g., leucyl, isoleucyl,
15 phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other
   residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g., lysyl, arginyl, or histidyl,
   is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, e.g., glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a
   residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not
   having a side chain, e.g., glycine.
20          The variants typically exhibit the same qualitative biological activity and will
   elicit the same immune response as the naturally-occurring analogue, although variants

 5 also are selected to modify the characteristics of the antigen binding protein proteins as
   needed. Alternatively, the variant may be designed such that the biological activity of the
   antigen binding protein is altered. For example, glycosylation sites may be altered or
   removed as discussed herein.
            Other derivatives of CD27L antibodies within the scope of this invention include
10 covalent or aggregative conjugates of CD27L antibodies, or fragments thereof, with other
   proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins
   comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a CD27L
   antibody polypeptide. For example, the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal
   (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha-factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope
15 tag. CD27L antibody-containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to
   facilitate purification or identification of the CD27L antibody (e.g., poly-His). A CD27L
   antibody polypeptide also can be linked to the FLAG peptide as described in Hopp et al.,
   Bio/Technology 6:1204, 1988, and U.S. Patent 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly
   antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody
20 (mAb), enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein.
   Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a
   given polypeptide are commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
            Oligomers that contain one or more CD27L antibody polypeptides may be
   employed as CD27L antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently-linked or
25 non-covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two
   or more CD27L antibody polypeptides are contemplated for use, with one example being
   a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers, homotrimers, heterotrimers,

                    One embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple CD27L
30 antibody polypeptides joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide
   moieties fused to the CD27L antibody polypeptides. Such peptides may be peptide
   linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization.
   Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides
   that can promote oligomerization of CD27L antibody polypeptides attached thereto, as
35 described in more detail below.

   WO 2013/043933                                                           PCT/US2012/056429
 5                 In particular embodiments, the oligomers comprise from two to four
   CD27L antibody polypeptides. The CD27L antibody moieties of the oligomer may be in
   any of the forms described above, e.g., variants or fragments. Preferably, the oligomers
   comprise CD27L antibody polypeptides that have CD27L binding activity.
                   In one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived
10 from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous
   polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc
   domain) has been described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535; Byrn
   et al., 1990, Nature 344:677; and Hollenbaugh et al., 1992 "Construction of
   Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins", in CurrentProtocols in Immunology, Suppl. 4, pages
15 10.19.1 - 10.19.11.
                   One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer
   comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing a CD27L binding fragment of a CD27L
   antibody to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example,
   inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector,
20 expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression
   vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody
   molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield
   the dimer.
                   The term "Fc polypeptide" as used herein includes native and mutein
25 forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of
   such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are
   included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom)
   offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or
   Protein G columns.
30                 One suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151
   (hereby incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N
   terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG antibody.
   Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Patent 5,457,035 and in
   Baum et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is
35 identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/1015 1, except that amino
                                                41

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5 acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to
   Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced
   affinity for Fc receptors.
                    In other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains
   of a CD27L antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy
10 and/or light chain.
                   Alternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple CD27L
   antibody polypeptides, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the
   suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Patents 4,751,180 and 4,935,233.
            Another method for preparing oligomeric CD27L antibody derivatives involves
15 use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote
   oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally
   identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759),
   and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine
   zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize.
20 Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins
   are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung
   surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al., 1994, FEBS Letters 344:191,
   hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for
   stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al.,
25 1994, Semin. Immunol. 6:267-78. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins
   comprising CD27L antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are
   expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric CD27L antibody fragments or
   derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.
            Covalent modifications of antigen binding proteins are included within the scope
30 of this invention, and are generally, but not always, done post-translationally. For
   example, several types of covalent modifications of the antigen binding protein are
   introduced into the molecule by reacting specific amino acid residues of the antigen
   binding protein with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with
   selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues.
                                                 42

   WO 2013/043933                                                              PCT/US2012/056429
 5          Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with a-haloacetates (and
   corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give
   carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are
   derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, a-bromo-p-(5-imidozoyl)propionic
   acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2
10 pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7
   nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.
            Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5
   7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para
   bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M
15 sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.
            Lysinyl and amino terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic
   acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge
   of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing
   residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate; pyridoxal phosphate;
20 pyridoxal; chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylisourea; 2,4
   pentanedione; and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.
            Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional
   reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and
   ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in
25 alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group.
   Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine
   epsilon-amino group.
            The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular
   interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic
30 diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and
   tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives,
   respectively. Tyrosyl residues are iodinated using     125I or mI to prepare labeled proteins
   for use in radioimmunoassay, the chloramine T method described above being suitable.
            Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction
35 with carbodiimides (R'-N=C=N--R'), where R and R' are optionally different alkyl
                                                  43

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5 groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4
   azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues
   are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.
           Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for crosslinking antigen binding
   proteins to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in a variety of methods.
10 Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1 -bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane,
   glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic
   acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'
   dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), and bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N
   maleimido-1,8-octane. Derivatizing agents such as methyl-3-[(p
15 azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate yield photoactivatable intermediates that are capable of
   forming crosslinks in the presence of light. Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble
   matrices such as cyanogen bromide-activated carbohydrates and the reactive substrates
   described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,969,287; 3,691,016; 4,195,128; 4,247,642; 4,229,537; and
   4,330,440 are employed for protein immobilization.
20         Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the
   corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively. Alternatively, these residues
   are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues falls within
   the scope of this invention.
           Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation
25 of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the a-amino groups of
   lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and
   Molecular Properties, W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, 1983, pp. 79-86), acetylation
   of the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.
           Another type of covalent modification of the antigen binding protein included
30 within the scope of this invention comprises altering the glycosylation pattern of the
   protein. As is known in the art, glycosylation patterns can depend on both the sequence
   of the protein (e.g., the presence or absence of particular glycosylation amino acid
   residues, discussed below), or the host cell or organism in which the protein is produced.
   Particular expression systems are discussed below.
                                                 44

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5          Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked
   refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine
   residue. The tri-peptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine,
   where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic
   attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence
10 of either of these tri-peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation
   site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N
   acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose, to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly
   serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.
           Addition of glycosylation sites to the antigen binding protein is conveniently
15 accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the
   above-described tri-peptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration
   may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine
   residues to the starting sequence (for O-linked glycosylation sites). For ease, the antigen
   binding protein amino acid sequence is preferably altered through changes at the DNA
20 level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the target polypeptide at preselected
   bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.
           Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antigen
   binding protein is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the protein. These
   procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the protein in a
25 host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N- and O-linked glycosylation.
   Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and
   histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine,
   (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e)
   aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide
30 group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11,
   1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, 1981, CRC Crit.Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306.
            Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the starting antigen binding protein
   may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation requires
   exposure of the protein to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent
35 compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking
                                                 45

   WO 2013/043933                                                               PCT/US2012/056429
 5 sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the polypeptide
   intact. Chemical deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et al., 1987, Arch.
   Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al., 1981, Anal. Biochem. 118:131. Enzymatic
   cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a
   variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., 1987, Meth.
10 Enzymol. 138:350. Glycosylation at potential glycosylation sites may be prevented by
   the use of the compound tunicamycin as described by Duskin et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem.
   257:3105. Tunicamycin blocks the formation of protein-N-glycoside linkages.
            Another type of covalent modification of the antigen binding protein comprises
   linking the antigen binding protein to various nonproteinaceous polymers, including, but
15 not limited to, various polyols such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or
   polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689;
   4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337. In addition, as is known in the art, amino
   acid substitutions may be made in various positions within the antigen binding protein to
   facilitate the addition of polymers such as PEG.
20          In some embodiments, the covalent modification of the antigen binding proteins
   of the invention comprises the addition of one or more labels.
            The term "labelling group" means any detectable label. Examples of suitable
   labelling groups include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or
   radionuclides (e.g., 3 H, 1C,     N,  5S, 90Y, 99Tc, mIn,     , mI), fluorescent groups (e.g.,
25 FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic groups (e.g., horseradish peroxidase,
   B-galactosidase,  luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent groups, biotinyl
   groups, or predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g.,
   leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding
   domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, the labelling group is coupled to the
30 antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric
   hindrance. Various methods for labelling proteins are known in the art and may be used
   in performing the present invention.
            In general, labels fall into a variety of classes, depending on the assay in which
   they are to be detected: a) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes; b)
35 magnetic labels (e.g., magnetic particles); c) redox active moieties; d) optical dyes;

 5 enzymatic groups (e.g. horseradish peroxidase,    p-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline
   phosphatase); e) biotinylated groups; and f) predetermined polypeptide epitopes
   recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for
   secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags, etc.). In some embodiments,
   the labelling group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various
10 lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labelling proteins are
   known in the art and may be used in performing the present invention.
           Specific labels include optical dyes, including, but not limited to, chromophores,
   phosphors and fluorophores, with the latter being specific in many instances.
   Fluorophores can be either "small molecule" fluores, or proteinaceous fluores.
15         By "fluorescent label" is meant any molecule that may be detected via its inherent
   fluorescent properties. Suitable fluorescent labels include, but are not limited to,

20          In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the isolated nucleic acid is
   a component of an antigen binding protein that binds CD27L.
            Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequences described
   herein, to be used as probes or primers for the isolation of nucleic acids or as query
   sequences for database searches, can be obtained by "back-translation" from the amino
25 acid sequences, or by identification of regions of amino acid identity with polypeptides
   for which the coding DNA sequence has been identified. The well-known polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) procedure can be employed to isolate and amplify a DNA sequence
   encoding a CD27L antigen binding proteins or a desired combination of CD27L antigen
   binding protein polypeptide fragments. Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini
30 of the combination of DNA fragments are employed as 5' and 3' primers. The
   oligonucleotides can additionally contain recognition sites for restriction endonucleases,
   to facilitate insertion of the amplified combination of DNA fragments into an expression
   vector. PCR techniques are described in Saiki et al., Science 239:487 (1988);

            Nucleic acid molecules of the invention include DNA and RNA in both single
   stranded and double-stranded form, as well as the corresponding complementary
   sequences. DNA includes, for example, cDNA, genomic DNA, chemically synthesized
10 DNA, DNA amplified by PCR, and combinations thereof. The nucleic acid molecules of
   the invention include full-length genes or cDNA molecules as well as a combination of
   fragments thereof. The nucleic acids of the invention are preferentially derived from
   human sources, but the invention includes those derived from non-human species, as
   well.
15          An "isolated nucleic acid" is a nucleic acid that has been separated from adjacent
   genetic sequences present in the genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid was
   isolated, in the case of nucleic acids isolated from naturally-occurring sources. In the
   case of nucleic acids synthesized enzymatically from a template or chemically, such as
   PCR products, cDNA molecules, or oligonucleotides for example, it is understood that
20 the nucleic acids resulting from such processes are isolated nucleic acids. An isolated
   nucleic acid molecule refers to a nucleic acid molecule in the form of a separate fragment
   or as a component of a larger nucleic acid construct. In one preferred embodiment, the
   nucleic acids are substantially free from contaminating endogenous material. The nucleic
   acid molecule has preferably been derived from DNA or RNA isolated at least once in
25 substantially pure form and in a quantity or concentration enabling identification,
   manipulation, and recovery of its component nucleotide sequences by standard
   biochemical methods (such as those outlined in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning:A
   LaboratoryManual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY
   (1989)). Such sequences are preferably provided and/or constructed in the form of an
30 open reading frame uninterrupted by internal non-translated sequences, or introns, that
   are typically present in eukaryotic genes. Sequences of non-translated DNA can be
   present 5' or 3' from an open reading frame, where the same do not interfere with
   manipulation or expression of the coding region.
            The present invention also includes nucleic acids that hybridize under moderately
35 stringent conditions, and more preferably highly stringent conditions, to nucleic acids
                                                  51

 5 encoding CD27L antigen binding proteins as described herein. The basic parameters
   affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable
   conditions are set forth by Sambrook,, Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A
   Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.,
   chapters 9 and 11; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, Ausubel et al.,
10 eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4), and can be readily determined
   by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length and/or base
   composition of the DNA. One way of achieving moderately stringent conditions
   involves the use of a prewashing solution containing 5 x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA
   (pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of about 50% formamide, 6 x SSC, and a hybridization
15 temperature of about 55 degrees C (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as one
   containing about 50% formamide, with a hybridization temperature of about 42 degrees
   C), and washing conditions of about 60 degrees C, in 0.5 x SSC, 0.l1% SDS. Generally,
   highly stringent conditions are defined as hybridization conditions as above, but with
   washing at approximately 68 degrees C, 0.2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. SSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M
20 NaCl, 10 mM NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4, and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for
   SSC (1xSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash
   buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes after hybridization is complete. It should
   be understood that the wash temperature and wash salt concentration can be adjusted as
   necessary to achieve a desired degree of stringency by applying the basic principles that
25 govern hybridization reactions and duplex stability, as known to those skilled in the art
   and described further below (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989). When hybridizing a
   nucleic acid to a target nucleic acid of unknown sequence, the hybrid length is assumed
   to be that of the hybridizing nucleic acid. When nucleic acids of known sequence are
   hybridized, the hybrid length can be determined by aligning the sequences of the nucleic
30 acids and identifying the region or regions of optimal sequence complementarity. The
   hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length
   should be 5 to 10.degrees C less than the melting temperature (Tm) of the hybrid, where
   Tm is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base
   pairs in length, Tm (degrees C)   = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of #G + C bases). For hybrids
35 above 18 base pairs in length, Tm (degrees C)    = 81.5 + 16.6(logio [Na*]) + 0.41(% G +

   of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na+] for 1xSSC       =  0.165M). Preferably, each
   such hybridizing nucleic acid has a length that is at least 15 nucleotides (or more
   preferably at least 18 nucleotides, or at least 20 nucleotides, or at least 25 nucleotides, or
   at least 30 nucleotides, or at least 40 nucleotides, or most preferably at least 50
10 nucleotides), or at least 25% (more preferably at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least
   70%, and most preferably at least 80%) of the length of the nucleic acid of the present
   invention to which it hybridizes, and has at least 60% sequence identity (more preferably
   at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least
   84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at
15 least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least
   97%, at least  9 8 %, or at least 9 9 %, and most preferably at least 99 .5%) with the nucleic
   acid of the present invention to which it hybridizes, where sequence identity is
   determined by comparing the sequences of the hybridizing nucleic acids when aligned so
   as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps as described in
20 more detail above.
            The variants according to the invention are ordinarily prepared by site specific
   mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding the antigen binding protein, using
   cassette or PCR mutagenesis or other techniques well known in the art, to produce DNA
   encoding the variant, and thereafter expressing the recombinant DNA in cell culture as
25 outlined herein. However, antigen binding protein fragments comprising variant CDRs
   having up to about 100-150 residues may be prepared by in vitro synthesis using
   established techniques. The variants typically exhibit the same qualitative biological
   activity as the naturally occurring analogue, e.g., binding to CD27L, although variants
   can also be selected which have modified characteristics as will be more fully outlined
30 below.
            As will be appreciated by those in the art, due to the degeneracy of the genetic
   code, an extremely large number of nucleic acids may be made, all of which encode the
   CDRs (and heavy and light chains or other components of the antigen binding protein) of
   the present invention. Thus, having identified a particular amino acid sequence, those
35 skilled in the art could make any number of different nucleic acids, by simply modifying
                                                   53

   WO 2013/043933                                                              PCT/US2012/056429
 5 the sequence of one or more codons in a way which does not change the amino acid
   sequence of the encoded protein.
            The present invention also provides expression systems and constructs in the form
   of plasmids, expression vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at
   least one polynucleotide as above. In addition, the invention provides host cells
10 comprising such expression systems or constructs.
            Typically, expression vectors used in any of the host cells will contain sequences
   for plasmid maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide
   sequences. Such sequences, collectively referred to as "flanking sequences" in certain
   embodiments will typically include one or more of the following nucleotide sequences: a
15 promoter, one or more enhancer sequences, an origin of replication, a transcriptional
   termination sequence, a complete intron sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice
   site, a sequence encoding a leader sequence for polypeptide secretion, a ribosome binding
   site, a polyadenylation sequence, a polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid
   encoding the polypeptide to be expressed, and a selectable marker element. Each of these
20 sequences is discussed below.
            Optionally, the vector may contain a "tag"-encoding sequence, i.e., an
   oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5' or 3' end of the CD27L antigen binding protein
   coding sequence; the oligonucleotide sequence encodes polyHis (such as hexaHis), or
   another "tag" such as FLAG, HA (hemaglutinin influenza virus), or myc, for which
25 commercially available antibodies exist. This tag is typically fused to the polypeptide
   upon expression of the polypeptide, and can serve as a means for affinity purification or
   detection of the CD27L antigen binding protein from the host cell. Affinity purification
   can be accomplished, for example, by column chromatography using antibodies against
   the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally, the tag can subsequently be removed from the
30 purified CD27L antigen binding protein by various means such as using certain
   peptidases for cleavage.
            Flanking sequences may be homologous (i.e., from the same species and/or strain
   as the host cell), heterologous (i.e., from a species other than the host cell species or
   strain), hybrid (i.e., a combination of flanking sequences from more than one source),
35 synthetic or native. As such, the source of a flanking sequence may be any prokaryotic or
                                                  54

   WO 2013/043933                                                              PCT/US2012/056429
 5 eukaryotic organism, any vertebrate or invertebrate organism, or any plant, provided that
   the flanking sequence is functional in, and can be activated by, the host cell machinery.
            Flanking sequences useful in the vectors of this invention may be obtained by any
   of several methods well known in the art. Typically, flanking sequences useful herein
   will have been previously identified by mapping and/or by restriction endonuclease
10 digestion and can thus be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate
   restriction endonucleases. In some cases, the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking
   sequence may be known. Here, the flanking sequence may be synthesized using the
   methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or cloning.
            Whether all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known, it may be
15 obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or by screening a genomic library
   with a suitable probe such as an oligonucleotide and/or flanking sequence fragment from
   the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known, a fragment of
   DNA containing a flanking sequence may be isolated from a larger piece of DNA that
   may contain, for example, a coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation
20 may be accomplished by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA
   fragment followed by isolation using agarose gel purification, Qiagen* column
   chromatography (Chatsworth, CA), or other methods known to the skilled artisan. The
   selection of suitable enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to one
   of ordinary skill in the art.
25          An origin of replication is typically a part of those prokaryotic expression vectors
   purchased commercially, and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector in a host
   cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site, one may be
   chemically synthesized based on a known sequence, and ligated into the vector. For
   example, the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs,
30 Beverly, MA) is suitable for most gram-negative bacteria, and various viral origins (e.g.,
   SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, vesicular stomatitus virus (VSV), or papillomaviruses such
   as HPV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin
   of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (for example,
   the SV40 origin is often used only because it also contains the virus early promoter).
                                                  55

   WO 2013/043933                                                               PCT/US2012/056429
 5          A transcription termination sequence is typically located 3' to the end of a
   polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. Usually, a transcription
   termination sequence in prokaryotic cells is a G-C rich fragment followed by a poly-T
   sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even purchased
   commercially as part of a vector, it can also be readily synthesized using methods for
10 nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein.
            A selectable marker gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival and growth
   of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes
   encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin,
   tetracycline, or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells; (b) complement auxotrophic
15 deficiencies of the cell; or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex or
   defined media. Specific selectable markers are the kanamycin resistance gene, the
   ampicillin resistance gene, and the tetracycline resistance gene. Advantageously, a
   neomycin resistance gene may also be used for selection in both prokaryotic and
   eukaryotic host cells.
20          Other selectable genes may be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed.
   Amplification is the process wherein genes that are required for production of a protein
   critical for growth or cell survival are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of
   successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable selectable markers for
   mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and promoterless thyrnidine
25 kinase genes. Mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein
   only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of the selectable gene
   present in the vector. Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformed cells
   under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is
   successively increased, thereby leading to the amplification of both the selectable gene
30 and the DNA that encodes another gene, such as an antigen binding protein antibody that
   binds to CD27L polypeptide. As a result, increased quantities of a polypeptide such as an
   CD27L antigen binding protein are synthesized from the amplified DNA.
            A ribosome-binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of rnRNA
   and is characterized by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or a Kozak sequence
35 (eukaryotes). The element is typically located 3' to the promoter and 5' to the coding
                                                   56

   WO 2013/043933                                                              PCT/US2012/056429
 5 sequence of the polypeptide to be expressed. In certain embodiments, one or more coding
   regions may be operably linked to an internal ribosome binding site (IRES), allowing
   translation of two open reading frames from a single RNA transcript.
             In some cases, such as where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell
   expression system, one may manipulate the various pre- or prosequences to improve
10 glycosylation or yield. For example, one may alter the peptidase cleavage site of a
   particular signal peptide, or add prosequences, which also may affect glycosylation. The
   final protein product may have, in the -1 position (relative to the first amino acid of the
   mature protein) one or more additional amino acids incident to expression, which may
   not have been totally removed. For example, the final protein product may have one or
15 two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage site, attached to the amino
   terminus. Alternatively, use of some enzyme cleavage sites may result in a slightly
   truncated form of the desired polypeptide, if the enzyme cuts at such area within the
   mature polypeptide.
             Expression and cloning vectors of the invention will typically contain a promoter
20 that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to the molecule encoding the
   CD27L antigen binding protein. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located upstream
   (i.e., 5') to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp)
   that control transcription of the structural gene. Promoters are conventionally grouped
   into one of two classes: inducible promoters and constitutive promoters. Inducible
25 promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in
   response to some change in culture conditions, such as the presence or absence of a
   nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters, on the other hand, uniformly
   transcribe gene to which they are operably linked, that is, with little or no control over
   gene expression. A large number of promoters, recognized by a variety of potential host
30 cells, are well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA encoding
   heavy chain or light chain comprising an CD27L antigen binding protein of the invention
   by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and
   inserting the desired promoter sequence into the vector.
             Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art. Yeast
35 enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters for use

10         An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase transcription of
   DNA encoding light chain or heavy chain comprising a CD27L antigen binding protein
   of the invention by higher eukaryotes. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA,
   usually about 10-300 bp in length, that act on the promoter to increase transcription.
   Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found at
15 positions both 5' and 3' to the transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available
   from mammalian genes are known (e.g., globin, elastase, albumin, alpha-feto-protein and
   insulin). Typically, however, an enhancer from a virus is used. The SV40 enhancer, the
   cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer, and adenovirus
   enhancers known in the art are exemplary enhancing elements for the activation of
20 eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be positioned in the vector either 5' or 3'
   to a coding sequence, it is typically located at a site 5' from the promoter. A sequence
   encoding an appropriate native or heterologous signal sequence (leader sequence or
   signal peptide) can be incorporated into an expression vector, to promote extracellular
   secretion of the antibody. The choice of signal peptide or leader depends on the type of
25 host cells in which the antibody is to be produced, and a heterologous signal sequence
   can replace the native signal sequence. Examples of signal peptides that are functional in
   mammalian host cells include the following: the signal sequence for interleukin-7 (IL-7)
   described in US Patent No. 4,965,195; the signal sequence for interleukin-2 receptor
   described in Cosman et al., 1984, Nature 312:768; the interleukin-4 receptor signal
30 peptide described in EP Patent No. 0367 566; the type I interleukin-1 receptor signal
   peptide described in U.S. Patent No. 4,968,607; the type II interleukin-1 receptor signal
   peptide described in EP Patent No. 0 460 846.
           The vector may contain one or more elements that facilitate expression when the
   vector is integrated into the host cell genome. Examples include an EASE element
35 (Aldrich et al. 2003 Biotechnol Prog. 19:1433-38) and a matrix attachment region
                                                  59

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5 (MAR). MARs mediate structural organization of the chromatin and may insulate the
   integrated vactor from "position" effect. Thus, MARs are particularly useful when the
   vector is used to create stable transfectants. A number of natural and synthetic MAR
   containing nucleic acids are known in the art, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,239,328; 7,326,567;
   6,177,612; 6,388,066; 6,245,974; 7,259,010; 6,037,525; 7,422,874; 7,129,062.
10         Expression vectors of the invention may be constructed from a starting vector
   such as a commercially available vector. Such vectors may or may not contain all of the
   desired flanking sequences. Where one or more of the flanking sequences described
   herein are not already present in the vector, they may be individually obtained and ligated
   into the vector. Methods used for obtaining each of the flanking sequences are well
15 known to one skilled in the art.
           After the vector has been constructed and a nucleic acid molecule encoding light
   chain, a heavy chain, or a light chain and a heavy chain comprising an CD27L antigen
   binding sequence has been inserted into the proper site of the vector, the completed
   vector may be inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and/or polypeptide
20 expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an CD27L antigen binding
   protein into a selected host cell may be accomplished by well known methods including
   transfection, infection, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation,
   microinjection, lipofection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, or other known
   techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to be
25 used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled artisan,
   and are set forth, for example, in Sambrook et al., 2001, supra.
           A host cell, when cultured under appropriate conditions, synthesizes an CD27L
   antigen binding protein that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium (if
   the host cell secretes it into the medium) or directly from the host cell producing it (if it is
30 not secreted). The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various factors,
   such as desired expression levels, polypeptide modifications that are desirable or
   necessary for activity (such as glycosylation or phosphorylation) and ease of folding into
   a biologically active molecule. A host cell may be eukaryotic or prokaryotic.
           Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art
35 and include, but are not limited to, immortalized cell lines available from the American
                                                  60

 5 Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and any cell lines used in an expression system known
   in the art can be used to make the recombinant polypeptides of the invention. In general,
   host cells are transformed with a recombinant expression vector that comprises DNA
   encoding a desired anti- CD27L antibody polypeptide. Among the host cells that may be
   employed are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram
10 negative or gram positive organisms, for example E. coli or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic
   cells include insect cells and established cell lines of mammalian origin. Examples of
   suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells
   (ATCC CRL 1651) (Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, 293 cells, C127 cells,
   3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or their derivatives
15 such as Veggie CHO and related cell lines which grow in serum-free media (Rasmussen
   et al., 1998, Cytotechnology 28: 31), HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and
   the CVI/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI
   (ATCC CCL 70) as described by McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10: 2821, human
   embryonic kidney cells such as 293, 293 EBNA or MSR 293, human epidermal A431
20 cells, human Colo205 cells, other transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells,
   cell strains derived from in vitro culture of primary tissue, primary explants, HL-60,
   U937, HaK or Jurkat cells. Optionally, mammalian cell lines such as HepG2/3B, KB,
   NIH 3T3 or S49, for example, can be used for expression of the polypeptide when it is
   desirable to use the polypeptide in various signal transduction or reporter assays.
25 Alternatively, it is possible to produce the polypeptide in lower eukaryotes such as yeast
   or in prokaryotes such as bacteria. Suitable yeasts include Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces strains, Candida, or any yeast strain
   capable of expressing heterologous polypeptides. Suitable bacterial strains include
   Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, or any bacterial strain
30 capable of expressing heterologous polypeptides. If the polypeptide is made in yeast or
   bacteria, it may be desirable to modify the polypeptide produced therein, for example by
   phosphorylation or glycosylation of the appropriate sites, in order to obtain the functional
   polypeptide. Such covalent attachments can be accomplished using known chemical or
   enzymatic methods. The polypeptide can also be produced by operably linking the
35 isolated nucleic acid of the invention to suitable control sequences in one or more insect
                                                  61

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5 expression vectors, and employing an insect expression system. Materials and methods
   for baculovirus/insect cell expression systems are commercially available in kit form
   from, e.g., Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif., U.S.A. (the MaxBac@ kit), and such methods
   are well known in the art, as described in Summers and Smith, Texas Agricultural
   Experiment Station Bulletin No. 1555 (1987), and Luckow and Summers,
10 Bio/Technology 6:47 (1988). Cell-free translation systems could also be employed to
   produce polypeptides using RNAs derived from nucleic acid constructs disclosed herein.
   Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and
   mammalian cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (Cloning Vectors: A
   LaboratoryManual, Elsevier, New York, 1985). A host cell that comprises an isolated
15 nucleic acid of the invention, preferably operably linked to at least one expression control
   sequence, is a "recombinant host cell".
           In certain embodiments, cell lines may be selected through determining which cell
   lines have high expression levels and constitutively produce antigen binding proteins
   with CD27L binding properties. In another embodiment, a cell line from the B cell
20 lineage that does not make its own antibody but has a capacity to make and secrete a
   heterologous antibody can be selected.
   Antibody Drug Conjugates
25         Embodiments of the invention include antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).
   Generally the ADC comprises an antibody conjugated to a chemotherapeutic agent, e.g.,
   a cytotoxic agent, a cytostatic agent, a toxin, or a radioactive agent. A linker molecule
   can be used to conjugate the drug to the antibody. A wide variety of linkers and drugs
   useful in ADC technology are known in the art and may be used in embodiments of the
30 present invention. (See US20090028856; US2009/0274713; US2007/0031402;
   W02005/084390; W02009/099728; US5208020; US5416064; US5475092; 5585499;
   6436931; 6372738; and 6340701, all incorporated herein by reference).
           The antibody drug conjugates may be prepared by in vitro methods. In order to
   link a drug or prodrug to the antibody, a linking group is used. Suitable linking groups
35 are well known in the art and include disulfide groups, acid labile groups, photolabile
                                                 62

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5 groups, peptidase labile groups, and esterase labile groups. Preferred linking groups are
   disulfide groups. For example, conjugates can be constructed using a disulfide exchange
   reaction between the antibody and the drug or prodrug. The drug molecules also can be
   linked to a cell binding agent through an intermediary carrier molecule such as serum
   albumin.
10          In certain embodiments, the cell binding agent is modified by reacting a
   bifunctional crosslinking reagent with the cell binding agent, thereby resulting in the
   covalent attachment of a linker molecule to the cell binding agent. As used herein, a
   "bifunctional crosslinking reagent" or "linker" is any chemical moiety that covalently
   links a cell binding agent to a drug, such as the drugs described herein. In a particular
15 embodiment of the invention, a portion of the linking moiety is provided by the drug. In
   this respect, the drug comprises a linking moiety that is part of a larger linker molecule
   that is used to join the cell binding agent to the drug. For example, to form the
   maytansinoid DM1, the side chain at the C-3 hydroxyl group of maytansine is modified
   to have a free sulfhydryl group (SH). This thiolated form of maytansine can react with a
20 modified cell-binding agent to form a conjugate. Therefore, the final linker is assembled
   from two components, one of which is provided by the crosslinking reagent, while the
   other is provided by the side chain from DM1.
   Any suitable bifunctional crosslinking reagent can be used in connection with the
   invention, so long as the linker reagent provides for retention of the therapeutic, e.g.,
25 cytotoxicity, and targeting characteristics of the drug and the cell binding agent,
   respectively. Preferably, the linker molecule joins the drug to the cell binding agent
   through chemical bonds (as described above), such that the drug and the cell binding
   agent are chemically coupled (e.g., covalently bonded) to each other.          Linkers
            In certain embodiments, the ADC comprises a linker made up of one or more
30 linker components. Preferably the drug is linked to a cell binding agent through a
   disulfide bond. The linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group that can react
   with the cell binding agent. Preferred reactive chemical groups for reaction with the cell
   binding agent are N-succinimidyl esters and N-sulfosuccinimidyl esters. Additionally the
   linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group, preferably a dithiopyridyl group,
35 that can react with the drug to form a disulfide bond. Exemplary linker molecules
                                                  63

   WO 2013/043933                                                              PCT/US2012/056429
 5 include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) (see, e.g.,
   Carlsson et al., Biochem. J., 173, 723-737 (1978)), N-succinimidyl 4-(2
   pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304) and N-succinimidyl
   4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) (see, e.g., CAS Registry number 341498-08
   6).Additional exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl,
10 maleimidopropanoyl, valine-citrulline, alanine-phenylalanine, p
   aminobenzyloxycarbonyl, and those resulting from conjugation with linker reagents,
   including, but not limited to, N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate ("SPP"), N
   succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane- 1 carboxylate ("SMCC," also referred
   to herein also as "MCC"), and N-succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate ("SIAB").
15          Linkers may be a "cleavable" linker or a "non-cleavable" linker (Ducry and
   Stump, Bioconjugate Chem. 2010, 21, 5-13; incorporated herein by reference in its
   entirety) Cleavable linkers are designed to release the drug when subjected to certain
   environment factors, e.g., when internalized into the target cell. Cleavable linkers
   include acid labile linkers, protease sensitive linkers, photolabile linkers, dimethyl linker
20 or disulfide-containing linkers. Non-cleavable linkers tend to remain covalently
   associated with at least one amino acid of the antibody and the drug upon internalization
   by and degradation within the target cell. A non-cleavable linker is any chemical moiety
   that is capable of linking a drug, such as a maytansinoid (e.g., DM1, and the like), a
   taxane, or a CC-1065 analog, to a cell binding agent in a stable, covalent manner. Thus,
25 non-cleavable linkers are substantially resistant to acid-induced cleavage, light-induced
   cleavage, peptidase-induced cleavage, esterase-induced cleavage, and disulfide bond
   cleavage, at conditions under which the drug or the cell binding agent remains active.
            Suitable crosslinking reagents that form non-cleavable linkers between a drug and
   the cell-binding agent are well known in the art. Examples of non-cleavable linkers
30 include linkers having an N-succinimidyl ester or N-sulfosuccinimidyl ester moiety for
   reaction with the cell binding agent, as well as a maleimido- or haloacetyl-based moiety
   for reaction with the drug. Crosslinking linker reagents comprising a maleimido-based
   moiety include N-succinimidyl 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (SMCC),
   N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane- 1-carboxy-(6-amidocaproa- te),

   (SMPH), N-succinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate (SMPB), and N-(p
10 maleimidophenyl)isocyanate (PMPI). Cross-linking reagents comprising a haloacetyl
   based moiety include N-succinimidyl-4-(iodoacetyl)-aminobenzoate (SIAB), N
   succinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA), N-succinimidyl bromoacetate (SBA), and N
   succinimidyl 3-(bromoacetamido)propionate (SBAP). An exemplary preferred non
   cleavable linker is MCC.
15         Other crosslinking reagent linkers lacking a sulfur atom that form non-cleavable
   linkers can also be used in the inventive method. Such linkers can be derived from
   dicarboxylic acid based moieties. Suitable dicarboxylic acid based moieties include, but
   are not limited to, alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids of the general formula (IX):
20         HOOC--X1--Y,--Zm--COOH                                 (IX),
   wherein X is a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group having 2 to 20 carbon
   atoms, Y is a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group bearing 3 to 10 carbon atoms, Z is a
   substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group bearing 6 to 10 carbon atoms, or a substituted
25 or unsubstituted heterocyclic group wherein the hetero atom is selected from N, 0 or S,
   and wherein 1, m, and n are each 0 or 1, provided that 1, m, and n are all not zero at the
   same time.
           Many of the non-cleavable linkers disclosed herein are described in detail in U.S.
   Patent Application Publication 2005/0169933 Al.
30 Examples of suitable cleavable linkers include disulfide linkers, acid labile linkers,
   photolabile linkers, peptidase labile linkers, and esterase labile linkers. Disulfide
   containing linkers are linkers cleavable through disulfide exchange, which can occur
   under physiological conditions. Acid labile linkers are linkers cleavable at acid pH. For
   example, certain intracellular compartments, such as endosomes and lysosomes, have an
35 acidic pH (pH 4-5), and provide conditions suitable to cleave acid labile linkers. Photo

           Drug Loading
20         An ADC may have 1 to 20 chemotherapeutic agents per antibody. Compositions
   of ADCs may be characterized by the average number of drug moieties per antibody
   molecule in the composition. The average number of drug moieties may be determined
   by conventional means such as mass spectrometry, immunoassay, and HPLC. In some
   instances, a homogeneous ADC population may be separated and purified by means of
25 reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Thus, pharmaceutical ADC compositions may
   contain a heterogeneous or homogeneous population of antibodies linked to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7 or more drug moieties.
           In preferred embodiments, the ADC comprises as antibody conjugated to one or

10 Effector Function-Enhanced Antibodies
           One of the functions of the Fc portion of an antibody is to communicate to the
   immune system when the antibody binds its target. This is considered "effector
   function." Communication leads to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),
   antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and/or complement dependent
15 cytotoxicity (CDC). ADCC and ADCP are mediated through the binding of the Fc to Fc
   receptors on the surface of cells of the immune system. CDC is mediated through the
   binding of the Fc with proteins of the complement system, e.g., Clq.
           The IgG subclasses vary in their ability to mediate effector functions. For
   example IgGI is much superior to IgG2 and IgG4 at mediating ADCC and CDC. Thus,
20 in embodiments wherein a cell expressing CD27L is targeted for destruction, an anti
   CD27L IgGI antibody would be preferred.
           The effector function of an antibody can be increased, or decreased, by
   introducing one or more mutations into the Fc. Embodiments of the invention include
   antigen binding proteins, e.g., antibodies, having an Fc engineered to increase effector
25 function (U.S. 7,317,091 and Strohl, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 20:685-691, 2009; both
   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). . Exemplary IgGI Fc molecules having
   increased effector function include (based on the Kabat numbering scheme) those have
   the following substitutions: S239D/1332E

           Further embodiments of the invention include antigen binding proteins, e.g.,
   antibodies, having an Fe engineered to decrease effector function. Exemplary Fc
   molecules having decreased effector function include (based on the Kabat numbering
20 scheme) those have the following substitutions:
   N297A (IgGI)
   L234A/L235A (IgGI)

30
          Another method of increasing effector function of IgG Fc-containing proteins is
   by reducing the fucosylation of the Fc. Removal of the core fucose from the biantennary
   complex-type oligosachharides attached to the Fc greatly increased ADCC effector
   function without altering antigen binding or CDC effector function. Several ways are
35 known for reducing or abolishing fucosylation of Fc-containing molecules, e.g.,
                                               71

   WO 2013/043933                                                                   PCT/US2012/056429
 5 antibodies. These include recombinant expression in certain mammalian cell lines
   including a FUT8 knockout cell line, variant CHO line Lee13, rat hybridoma cell line
   YB2/0, a cell line comprising a small interfering RNA specifically against the FUT8
   gene, and a cell line coexpressing B-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and Golgi
   a-mannosidase II. Alternatively, the Fc-containing molecule may be expressed in a non
10 mammalian cell such as a plant cell, yeast, or prokaryotic cell, e.g., E. coli. Thus, in
   certain embodiments of the invention, a composition comprises an antibody, e.g., Abl,
   Ab2, Ab3, Ab4, Ab5, Ab6, Ab7, or Ab8, having reduced fucosylation or lacking
   fucosylation altogether.

   limited to, liquid, frozen, and lyophilized compositions.
           Preferably, formulation materials are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and
   concentrations employed. In specific embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions
25 comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a CD27L antigen binding protein, e.g, a
   CD27L-binding ADC, are provided.

   solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such
   as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as
15 pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate, triton,
   tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as
   sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides, preferably
   sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients
   and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. See, REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL
20 SCIENCES, 18" Edition, (A. R. Genrmo, ed.), 1990, Mack Publishing Company.
           In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be
   determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of
   administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, REMINGTON'S
   PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra. In certain embodiments, such compositions
25 may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo
   clearance of the antigen binding proteins of the invention. In certain embodiments, the
   primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non
   aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection,
   physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with
30 other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered
   saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In specific
   embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or
   acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, and may further include sorbitol or a suitable
   substitute therefor. In certain embodiments of the invention, CD27L antigen binding
35 protein compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition

 5 having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (REMINGTON'S
   PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an
   aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, the CD27L antigen binding protein
   product may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.
            The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be selected for parenteral
10 delivery. Alternatively, the compositions may be selected for inhalation or for delivery
   through the digestive tract, such as orally. Preparation of such pharmaceutically
   acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art. The formulation components are
   present preferably in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In
   certain embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or
15 at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.
            When parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for
   use in this invention may be provided in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally
   acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired CD27L antigen binding protein in a
   pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral
20 injection is sterile distilled water in which the CD27L antigen binding protein is
   formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the
   preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as
   injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic
   acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, that may provide controlled or sustained
25 release of the product which can be delivered via depot injection. In certain
   embodiments, hyaluronic acid may also be used, having the effect of promoting sustained
   duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices
   may be used to introduce the desired antigen binding protein.
            Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated for inhalation.
30 In these embodiments, CD27L antigen binding proteins are advantageously formulated as
   a dry, inhalable powder. In specific embodiments, CD27L antigen binding protein
   inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In
   certain embodiments, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration and
   formulation methods therefore are further described in International Patent Application

 5 No. PCT/US94/001875, which is incorporated by reference and describes pulmonary
   delivery of chemically modified proteins.
            It is also contemplated that formulations can be administered orally. CD27L
   antigen binding proteins that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or
   without carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as
10 tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule may be designed to release the
   active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when
   bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional
   agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the CD27L antigen binding protein.
   Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending
15 agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed.
            Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art,
   including formulations involving CD27L antigen binding proteins in sustained- or
   controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other
   sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible
20 microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the
   art. See, for example, International Patent Application No. PCT/US93/00829, which is
   incorporated by reference and describes controlled release of porous polymeric
   microparticles for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Sustained-release
   preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles,
25 e.g., films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters,
   hydrogels, polylactides (as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and European Patent
   Application Publication No. EP 058481, each of which is incorporated by reference),
   copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 1983,
   Biopolymers 2:547-556), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., 1981, J.
30 Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:167-277 and Langer, 1982, Chem. Tech. 12:98-105), ethylene
   vinyl acetate (Langer et al., 1981, supra) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European
   Patent Application Publication No. EP 133,988). Sustained release compositions may
   also include liposomes that can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art.

            Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically
   provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration through
   sterile filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this
10 method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.
   Compositions for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a
   solution. Parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile
   access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable
   by a hypodermic injection needle.
15          Aspects of the invention includes self-buffering CD27L antigen binding protein
   formulations, which can be used as pharmaceutical compositions, as described in
   international patent application WO 06138181A2 (PCT/US2006/022599), which is
   incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.
            As discussed above, certain embodiments provide CD27L antigen binding
20 proteins protein compositions, particularly pharmaceutical CD27L antigen binding
   protein compositions, that comprise, in addition to the CD27L antigen binding protein,
   one or more excipients such as those illustratively described in this section and elsewhere
   herein. Excipients can be used in the invention in this regard for a wide variety of
   purposes, such as adjusting physical, chemical, or biological properties of formulations,
25 such as adjustment of viscosity, and or processes of the invention to improve
   effectiveness and or to stabilize such formulations and processes against degradation and
   spoilage due to, for instance, stresses that occur during manufacturing, shipping, storage,
   pre-use preparation, administration, and thereafter.
            A variety of expositions are available on protein stabilization and formulation
30 materials and methods useful in this regard, such as Arakawa et al., "Solvent interactions
   in pharmaceutical formulations," Pharm Res. 8(3): 285-91 (1991); Kendrick et al.,
   "Physical stabilization of proteins in aqueous solution," in: RATIONAL DESIGN OF
   STABLE PROTEIN FORMULATIONS: THEORY AND PRACTICE, Carpenter and
   Manning, eds. Pharmaceutical Biotechnology. 13: 61-84 (2002), and Randolph et al.,
35 "Surfactant-protein interactions," Pharm Biotechnol. 13: 159-75 (2002), each of which is

   WO 2013/043933                                                               PCT/US2012/056429
 5 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, particularly in parts pertinent to
   excipients and processes of the same for self-buffering protein formulations in
   accordance with the current invention, especially as to protein pharmaceutical products
   and processes for veterinary and/or human medical uses.
            Salts may be used in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention to, for
10 example, adjust the ionic strength and/or the isotonicity of a formulation and/or to
   improve the solubility and/or physical stability of a protein or other ingredient of a
   composition in accordance with the invention.
            As is well known, ions can stabilize the native state of proteins by binding to
   charged residues on the protein's surface and by shielding charged and polar groups in the
15 protein and reducing the strength of their electrostatic interactions, attractive, and
   repulsive interactions. Ions also can stabilize the denatured state of a protein by binding
   to, in particular, the denatured peptide linkages (--CONH) of the protein. Furthermore,
   ionic interaction with charged and polar groups in a protein also can reduce
   intermolecular electrostatic interactions and, thereby, prevent or reduce protein
20 aggregation and insolubility.
            Ionic species differ significantly in their effects on proteins. A number of
   categorical rankings of ions and their effects on proteins have been developed that can be
   used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention. One
   example is the Hofmeister series, which ranks ionic and polar non-ionic solutes by their
25 effect on the conformational stability of proteins in solution. Stabilizing solutes are
   referred to as "kosmotropic." Destabilizing solutes are referred to as "chaotropic."
   Kosmotropes commonly are used at high concentrations (e.g., >1 molar ammonium
   sulfate) to precipitate proteins from solution ("salting-out"). Chaotropes commonly are
   used to denture and/or to solubilize proteins ("salting-in"). The relative effectiveness of
30 ions to "salt-in" and "salt-out" defines their position in the Hofmeister series.
            Free amino acids can be used in CD27L antigen binding protein formulations in
   accordance with various embodiments of the invention as bulking agents, stabilizers, and
   antioxidants, as well as other standard uses. Lysine, proline, serine, and alanine can be
   used for stabilizing proteins in a formulation. Glycine is useful in lyophilization to
35 ensure correct cake structure and properties. Arginine may be useful to inhibit protein
                                                   77

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5 aggregation, in both liquid and lyophilized formulations. Methionine is useful as an
   antioxidant.
            Polyols include sugars, e.g., mannitol, sucrose, and sorbitol and polyhydric
   alcohols such as, for instance, glycerol and propylene glycol, and, for purposes of
   discussion herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and related substances. Polyols are
10 kosmotropic. They are useful stabilizing agents in both liquid and lyophilized
   formulations to protect proteins from physical and chemical degradation processes.
   Polyols also are useful for adjusting the tonicity of formulations.
            Among polyols useful in select embodiments of the invention is mannitol,
   commonly used to ensure structural stability of the cake in lyophilized formulations. It
15 ensures structural stability to the cake. It is generally used with a lyoprotectant, e.g.,
   sucrose. Sorbitol and sucrose are among preferred agents for adjusting tonicity and as
   stabilizers to protect against freeze-thaw stresses during transport or the preparation of
   bulks during the manufacturing process. Reducing sugars (which contain free aldehyde
   or ketone groups), such as glucose and lactose, can glycate surface lysine and arginine
20 residues. Therefore, they generally are not among preferred polyols for use in
   accordance with the invention. In addition, sugars that form such reactive species, such
   as sucrose, which is hydrolyzed to fructose and glucose under acidic conditions, and
   consequently engenders glycation, also is not among preferred polyols of the invention in
   this regard. PEG is useful to stabilize proteins and as a cryoprotectant and can be used in
25 the invention in this regard.
            Embodiments of the CD27L antigen binding protein formulations further
   comprise surfactants. Protein molecules may be susceptible to adsorption on surfaces
   and to denaturation and consequent aggregation at air-liquid, solid-liquid, and liquid
   liquid interfaces. These effects generally scale inversely with protein concentration.
30 These deleterious interactions generally scale inversely with protein concentration and
   typically are exacerbated by physical agitation, such as that generated during the shipping
   and handling of a product.
            Surfactants routinely are used to prevent, minimize, or reduce surface adsorption.
   Useful surfactants in the invention in this regard include polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80,
35 other fatty acid esters of sorbitan polyethoxylates, and poloxamer 188.
                                                   78

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5         Surfactants also are commonly used to control protein conformational stability.
   The use of surfactants in this regard is protein-specific since, any given surfactant
   typically will stabilize some proteins and destabilize others.
           Polysorbates are susceptible to oxidative degradation and often, as supplied,
   contain sufficient quantities of peroxides to cause oxidation of protein residue side
10 chains, especially methionine. Consequently, polysorbates should be used carefully, and
   when used, should be employed at their lowest effective concentration. In this regard,
   polysorbates exemplify the general rule that excipients should be used in their lowest
   effective concentrations.
           Embodiments of CD27L antigen binding protein formulations further comprise
15 one or more antioxidants. To some extent deleterious oxidation of proteins can be
   prevented in pharmaceutical formulations by maintaining proper levels of ambient
   oxygen and temperature and by avoiding exposure to light. Antioxidant excipients can be
   used as well to prevent oxidative degradation of proteins. Among useful antioxidants in
   this regard are reducing agents, oxygen/free-radical scavengers, and chelating agents.
20 Antioxidants for use in therapeutic protein formulations in accordance with the invention
   preferably are water-soluble and maintain their activity throughout the shelf life of a
   product. EDTA is a preferred antioxidant in accordance with the invention in this regard.
           Antioxidants can damage proteins. For instance, reducing agents, such as
   glutathione in particular, can disrupt intramolecular disulfide linkages. Thus,
25 antioxidants for use in the invention are selected to, among other things, eliminate or
   sufficiently reduce the possibility of themselves damaging proteins in the formulation.
           Formulations in accordance with the invention may include metal ions that are
   protein co-factors and that are necessary to form protein coordination complexes, such as
   zinc necessary to form certain insulin suspensions. Metal ions also can inhibit some
30 processes that degrade proteins. However, metal ions also catalyze physical and
   chemical processes that degrade proteins.
           Magnesium ions (10-120 mM) can be used to inhibit isomerization of aspartic
   acid to isoaspartic acid. Ca+2 ions (up to 100 mM) can increase the stability of human
   deoxyribonuclease. Mg+2 , Mn+2, and Zn+2, however, can destabilize rhDNase. Similarly,
                                                 79

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5 Ca+2 and Sr+2 can stabilize Factor VIII, it can be destabilized by Mg+2 , Mn+2 and Zn+2,
   Cu+2 and Fe+2 , and its aggregation can be increased by AlV3 ions.
            Embodiments of the CD27L antigen binding protein formulations further
   comprise one or more preservatives. Preservatives are necessary when developing multi
   dose parenteral formulations that involve more than one extraction from the same
10 container. Their primary function is to inhibit microbial growth and ensure product
   sterility throughout the shelf-life or term of use of the drug product. Commonly used
   preservatives include benzyl alcohol, phenol and m-cresol. Although preservatives have
   a long history of use with small-molecule parenterals, the development of protein
   formulations that includes preservatives can be challenging. Preservatives almost always
15 have a destabilizing effect (aggregation) on proteins, and this has become a major factor
   in limiting their use in multi-dose protein formulations. To date, most protein drugs have
   been formulated for single-use only. However, when multi-dose formulations are
   possible, they have the added advantage of enabling patient convenience, and increased
   marketability. A good example is that of human growth hormone (hGH) where the
20 development of preserved formulations has led to commercialization of more convenient,
   multi-use injection pen presentations. At least four such pen devices containing
   preserved formulations of hGH are currently available on the market. Norditropin (liquid,
   Novo Nordisk), Nutropin AQ (liquid, Genentech) & Genotropin (lyophilized--dual
   chamber cartridge, Pharmacia & Upjohn) contain phenol while Somatrope (Eli Lilly) is
25 formulated with m-cresol.
            Several aspects need to be considered during the formulation and development of
   preserved dosage forms. The effective preservative concentration in the drug product
   must be optimized. This requires testing a given preservative in the dosage form with
   concentration ranges that confer anti-microbial effectiveness without compromising
30 protein stability.
            As might be expected, development of liquid formulations containing
   preservatives are more challenging than lyophilized formulations. Freeze-dried products
   can be lyophilized without the preservative and reconstituted with a preservative
   containing diluent at the time of use. This shortens the time for which a preservative is in
35 contact with the protein, significantly minimizing the associated stability risks. With
                                                  80

   WO 2013/043933                                                               PCT/US2012/056429
 5 liquid formulations, preservative effectiveness and stability should be maintained over
   the entire product shelf-life (.about. 18 to 24 months). An important point to note is that
   preservative effectiveness should be demonstrated in the final formulation containing the
   active drug and all excipient components.
            CD27L antigen binding protein formulations generally will be designed for
10 specific routes and methods of administration, for specific administration dosages and
   frequencies of administration, for specific treatments of specific diseases, with ranges of
   bio-availability and persistence, among other things. Formulations thus may be designed
   in accordance with the invention for delivery by any suitable route, including but not
   limited to orally, aurally, opthalmically, rectally, and vaginally, and by parenteral routes,
15 including intravenous and intraarterial injection, intramuscular injection, and
   subcutaneous injection.
            Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in
   sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, crystal, or as a dehydrated or
   lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in
20 a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration. The invention also
   provides kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits of the invention
   may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container
   having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments of this invention, kits containing
   single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are
25 provided.
            The therapeutically effective amount of a CD27L antigen binding protein
   containing pharmaceutical composition to be employed will depend, for example, upon
   the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   appropriate dosage levels for treatment will vary depending, in part, upon the molecule
30 delivered, the indication for which the CD27L antigen binding protein is being used, the
   route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or
   condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the
   clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the
   optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 pg/kg to up to
35 about 30 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In specific
                                                   81

   WO 2013/043933                                                            PCT/US2012/056429
 5 embodiments, the dosage may range from 1.0 pg/kg up to about 20 mg/kg, optionally
   from 10 pg/kg up to about 10 mg/kg or from 100 pg/kg up to about 5 mg/kg.
            A therapeutic effective amount of a CD27L antigen binding protein preferably
   results in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, in increase in frequency or duration
   of disease symptom-free periods or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the
10 disease affliction. For treating CD27L-expressing tumors, a therapeutically effective
   amount of CD27L antigen binding protein, e.g. an anti-CD27L ADC, preferably inhibits
   cell growth or tumor growth by at least about 20%, at least about 40%, at least about
   50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90%
   relative to untreated patients. The ability of a compound to inhibit tumor growth may be
15 evaluated in an animal model predictive of efficacy in human tumors.

   Methods of Diagnosing or Treating a CD27L-associated Disease or Disorder
            The CD27L antigen binding proteins of the invention are particularly useful for
   detecting CD27L in a biological sample. In certain embodiments, a biological sample
25 obtained from a patient is contacted with a CD27L antigen binding protein. Binding of
   the CD27L antigen binding protein to CD27L is then detected to determine the presence
   or relative amount of CD27L in the sample. Such methods may be useful in diagnosing
   or determining patients that are amenable to treatment with a CD27L antigen binding
   protein, e.g., an anti-CD27L ADC.
30          In certain embodiments, a CD27L antigen binding protein of the invention is used
   to diagnose, detect, or treat an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder. In treating
   autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, the CD27L antigen binding protein may target
   CD27L-expressing cells of the immune system for destruction and/or may block the
   interaction of CD27L with the receptor CD27.

   WO 2013/043933                                                             PCT/US2012/056429
 5          CD27L interaction with CD27 is thought to play a role in cell-mediated
   autoimmune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
   (Nakajima et al. (2000) J. Neuroimmunol. 109:188-96). This effect is thought to be
   mediated in part by an inhibition of TNF-a production. Furthermore, blocking of CD27L
   signaling inhibits CD40-mediated clonal expansion of CD8+ T-cells and reduces the
10 generation of CD8+ memory T-cells (Taraban et al. (2004) J. Immunol. 173:6542-6). As
   such, the CD27L antigen binding proteins can be used to treat a subject with an
   autoimmune disorder, e.g., a disorder characterized by the presence of B-cells expressing
   CD27L including, for example, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additional
   autoimmune disorders in which the antibodies of this disclosure can be used include, but
15 are not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), insulin dependent diabetes
   mellitus (IDDM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (including Crohn's Disease,
   ulcerative colitis and Celiac disease), multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, autoimmune
   thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, the cd27L
   antigen binding protein compositions of this disclosure can be used for inhibiting or
20 preventing transplant rejection or in the treatment of graft versus host disease (GVHD).
           Additionally, the interaction of CD27L with CD27 has also been proposed to play
   a role in signaling on CD4+ T cells. Some viruses have been shown to signal the CD27
   pathway, leading to destruction of neutralizing antibody responses (Matter et al. (2006) J
   Exp Med 203:2145-55). As such, the CD27L antigen binding protein compositions and
25 methods of the present disclosure can be used to treat a subject with a viral infection
   including, for example, infections from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis
   (A, B, & C), Herpesvirus, (e.g., VZV, HSV-1, HAV-6, HSV-II and CMV, Epstein Barr
   virus), adenovirus, influenza virus, flaviviruses, echovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackie virus,
   cornovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, mumps virus, rotavirus, measles virus, rubella
30 virus, parvovirus, vaccinia virus, HTLV virus, dengue virus, papillomavirus, molluscum
   virus, poliovirus, rabies virus, JC virus and arboviral encephalitis virus and lymphocytic
   choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or in the treatment of HIV infection/AIDS. Additionally,
   the human antibodies, antibody compositions and methods of the present disclosure can
   be used to inhibit TNF-a production.

   RCC, papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC,and the like, glioblastoma, Head and Neck
10 Cancers (e.g., squamous cell carcinomas(HNSCC), and the like), breast cancer, brain
   tumors, nasopharangeal carcinomas, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), such as low grade
   NHL, diffuse large cell NHL, and the like, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), such as
   pre-B-ALL, and the like, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL or B-CLL), Burkitt's

   Nature Genetics 15:146-156; Green and Jakobovitis, 1998, J. Ex. Med. 188:483-495).
            IgGI, IgG2, and IgG4 XENOMOUSE@ mice were immunized/boosted with
   soluble human CD27L or human CD27L recombinantly expressed on the surface of
   Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Hybridomas were produced from the immunized
10 mice. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for binding to recombinant human CD27L
   expressing 293 cells. Over 260 supernatants were positive for binding.
            The positive supernatants were then screened for binding to native CD27L on the
   surface of Raji and/or 786-0 cells. The native CD27L binding assay revealed 161
   positive supernatants.
15          Those supernatants were tested for cross-reactivity with cynomolgus CD27L.
   Twenty-five supernatants were positive for cross-reactivity with cynomolgus monkey
   CD27L. Those twenty five were then tested for CDC activity and the ability to block
   human CD27 binding to human CD27L. Nineteen supernatants were positive for CDC
   activity and for inhibition of CD27 binding to CD27L. Subcloning and sequencing of the
20 13 IgG 1 and 6 IgG4 lines revealed 7 unique IgG 1 antibodies (Ab 1-Ab7) and 1 unique
   IgG4 antibody (Ab8).
           A summary of the characteristics of the eight antibodies along with those of a
   chimeric version of a commercially available mouse anti-human CD27L antibody are
   provided in FIG. 1.
25         Affinity
           Affinity for recombinant soluble human CD27L was determined using a CM5
   chip on a BIACORE 3000. Goat anti-human IgG antibody was used to capture the test
   antibody. Binding and dissociation of Histidine-tagged human soluble CD27L was
   measured to determine Ka, Kd, and KD. The conditions were as follows:
30          Temperature = 25'C
            Flow Rate = 50 ul/min
            Running Buffer   = HBS-EP

 5          5 Minute Association and 25 Minute Dissociation
            ADCC Activity
            The ADCC assay was performed in a sterile 96 well round bottom tissue culture
   plate (Corning). Antibodies were titrated from 20 [pg/mL to 0.0002 ptg/mL by carrying
10 10 ptL in 100ptL of complete RPMI containing 10% FCS (a 1:10 dilution). Calcein
   labeled targets were added, 50 ptL to contain 10,000 cells. Target cells and various
   concentrations of antibody were incubated for 40 minutes at 4' C, then NK cell effectors
   added, 50 ptL to contain 200,000 cells. Cultures were incubated for 4 hrs at 37 C then
   supernatants pulled and assayed for calcein release by measuring fluorescence at 485-535
15 nm on a Wallac Victor 11 1420 Multilable HTS counter. 100% lysis values were
   determined by lysing six wells of calcein labeled Raji targets with Igepal 630 detergent (3
   ptL per well) and spontaneous lysis values determined by measuring the fluorescence in
   supernatants from targets alone.
            Percent (%) specific lysis was defined as (sample fluorescence) - (spontaneous
20 lysis fluorescence)/(100% lysis - spontaneous lysis fluorescence). Raw data was entered
   in an Excel spreadsheet with the embedded formulae to calculate % specific lysis and
   resultant values transferred to graphic program (GraphPad Prism) where the data was
   transformed in a sigmoidal curve fit graph. Subsequent analyses (linear regression
   calculations) were done in GraphPad to generate EC50 values.

            Monocytes were negative selected from human peripheral blood and stored in 4'C
   cold room over night with medium RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Then monocytes
   were seeded to a 48-well tissue culture plate at 200,000 cells per well with 200 piL of
   growth medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 40 ng/ml Hu M-CSF) and
30 incubated at 37'C, 5% CO 2 for 6 days to let monocytes differentiate to macrophages.

 5 The percentage of tumor cell phagocytosis is represented with percentage of tumor cells
   that were overlapped with macrophages vs. total macrophages in the selected fields and
   obtained from output feature of ArrayScan reader "%ObjectCounts". The % values were
   expressed as the mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) for duplicate measurements
   (n = 2). The EC50 was determined by using nonlinear regression (curve fit) followed by
10 using Sigmoidal dose-response equation. Data were normalized to the maximum and
   minimum signal and fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve.

 5         AbI, Ab2, Ab4, Ab7, and Ab8 were conjugated to MCC-DM1 (see Figure 12).
   The targeted load level was 4.5-5 drugs per antibody. Briefly, the lysines of the antibody
   were conjugated to the NHS-ester of the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker Succinimidyl 4
   [N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane- 1-carboxylate (SMCC) which contains an NHS-ester
   and a maleimide. Next the linker-modified antibody was purified from excess linker and
10 then conjugated to the warhead DM1 via a sulfhydryl present on DM1. Excess DM1 was
   then removed by a second purification step to generate the final conjugate Ab-MCC
   DM1.
           More particularly, CD27L antibody, transiently expressed in mammalian cell
   culture 2936-E cells, was loaded onto a MabSelect SuRe column (GE Healthcare) that
15 had been equilibrated in 25mM Tris, 150mM Sodium Chloride, pH 7.4. The column with
   bound CD27L antibody was then washed with 3 wash steps: first an equilibration buffer
   wash, followed by a 25mM Tris, 500mM L-Arginine, pH 7.5 wash and a final wash with
   equilibration buffer. CD27L antibody was eluted with 1n00mM Sodium Acetate, pH 3.5.
   Fractions containing the antibody were pooled and adjusted to a final pH of 5.0 with IM
20 Tris, pH 8.0. The antibody was subsequently purified on a Fractogel@' EMD S03-(M)
   column (EMD Chemicals Inc) equilibrated in 30mM Sodium Acetate, pH 5.0. Bound
   antibody was eluted with an 8CV gradient between 0 to 0.8M Sodium Chloride in 30mM

   Conjugation Buffer (2mM EDTA, 50mM Sodium Chloride, 50mM Potassium Phosphate,
25 pH 6.5).
           The purified CD27L antibody was modified with the amine reactive linker
   Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) (Thermo

 5 Ellman's reagent (5,5'-dithio-bis-[2-nitrobenzoic acid]) as described below. The antibody
   was found to be modified with an average of 7.5 maleimide groups per antibody.
           Ellman's reagent is cleaved by thiols, yielding a yellow product with an
   absorbance at 412nm. A subtractive Ellman's assay was used to determine the number
   of maleimide groups on the CD27L antibody after reaction with SMCC. CD27L
10 antibody modified with SMCC or a control sample of buffer without antibody was
   incubated with an equivalent concentration of thiols, 0.4mM DTT (dithiothreitol). Any
   maleimides present in the antibody sample would react with the thiols in DTT, making it
   unavailable for further reaction with Ellman's reagent. Ellman's reagent was then added
   to both samples and a colorimetric quantitation at 412nm was made to determine the
15 concentration of reacted Ellman's reagent. The decreased concentration of thiols in the
   antibody sample as compared to the control sample is proportional to the number of
   maleimides present in the antibody sample. This value was used to determine the number
   of linked maleimide groups per modified CD27L antibody.
           The SMCC modified CD27L antibody (7.5 maleimide groups per antibody) at a
20 concentration between 17pM - 27pM was treated with 1.7 molar equivalents of DM1
   (Immunogen) per maleimide group buffered with 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 35mM
   Sodium Citrate, pH 5.0 adjusted to 3% DMA (v/v) in the final reaction mixture. Reaction
   mixtures were incubated at room temperature overnight for up to 20 hours. The reaction
   mixture was loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
25 with 20mM Sodium Phosphate, 150 mM Sodium Chloride, pH 6.5. Fractions were
   collected and and monomeric antibody containing fractions pooled and assayed. The
   molar ratio of DM1 molecules linked per antibody was determined by measuring the
   absorbance at 252 nm and 280 nm, and found to be 4.5 - 5.0 DM1 molecules per
   antibody.

           In vitro pharmacology
           The antibody drug conjugates (ADC) Ab4- and Ab8-MCC-DM1 demonstrated
   comparable native CD27L binding to their un-conjugated counterparts as assessed by
   flow cytometry. The observed binding EC50 for Ab4 and Ab4-MCC-DM1 were the
35 same while it was a modest 4-fold lower for Ab8-MCC-DM1 as compared to Ab8 (Table

 5 6). A more precise measure of binding affinity was determined for Ab4, Ab8 and their
   conjugate counterparts by measuring their ability to bind native human CD27L expressed
   on Raji cells using Gyros technology. The results showed that both conjugates exhibited
   sub-nM affinities for CD27L within two-fold of those observed for the un-conjugated
   Ab4 and Ab8 (Table 6). Both unconjugated and conjugated Ab4 and Ab8 also exhibited
10 binding affinities to soluble human CD27L-his within 2-fold of each other as determined
   by BIACORE.

           The internalization of Ab4-MCC-DM1, Ab8-MCC-DM1, Ab4, and Ab8 was
15 evaluated in the CD27L-expressing human ccRCC line 786-0. CD27L expressing 786-0
   cells were exposed to un-conjugated Ab4 and Ab8 human anti-CD27L antibody, Ab4
   MCC-DM1, Ab8-MCC-DM1, control HuIgG1, or control aSA-MCC-DM1 and allowed
   to bind at 4'C. Internalization of the test articles was evaluated using FluoroNanogold
   goat anti-hu IgG Fab' Alexa 488. Cells were fixed and permeabilized at specific times
20 after incubation with test articles (time = 0, 1, 3, and 5 hour) and imaged using an
   ArrayScan VTI HCS reader. Co-localization of internalized test articles to endosomes
   was determined using anti-EEA-1 antibody, an endosomal marker. The time-dependent
   internalization of the antibodies, including Ab4-MCC-DM1, was observed via
   fluorescence microscopy image analysis by the formation of punctate spots within the
25 cellular cytoplasm at 37 0 C compared with cell membrane localization at time zero at 4'C.
   Ab4-MCC-DM1 co-localized with the endosomal marker EEA-1 after a 5-hour
   incubation at 37 0 C, demonstrating that Ab4-MCC-DM1 is internalized into the
   endosomal subcellular compartment of 786-0 cells. The level and rate of internalization
   was within a similar range for Ab4, Ab8 and their conjugated counter-parts (Figure 2).

 5 CD27L Ab4 or Ab8 were incubated with CD27L expressing 786-0 luciferase or CD27L
   negative H 1650 target cells in the presence/absence of naked Ab4 or Ab8, respectively,
   or control HuIgG1 for 4 days. Both cell lines, 786-0 luciferase and H1650, were seeded
   in 96-well tissue culture plates with growth medium at 100 tL of well with 500 cells per
   well for 786-0 luciferase and 1000 cells per well for H1650. All plates were incubated at
10 37oC, 5% C02 for 4 hours. After a 4 hour incubation, naked Ab and conjugates were
   added to cells at 100 tL per well at various dose titrations. The total volume in each well
   at the start of culture was 200 pL. Cells were continuously incubated at 37oC, 5% C02
   for 4 days prior to measurement of cellular ATP levels. To assess cell growth inhibition,
   ATP levels (as a measure of cell number) were measured via luminescence using the
15 CellTiter-Glo assay kit.
            Both Ab4-MCC-DM1 and Ab8-MCC-DM1 inhibited cell growth of CD27L
   expressing 786-0 cells with a concentration of 50% inhibition (IC50) as set forth in Table
   7. Cell growth inhibition was not observed in CD27L-negative H1650 cells upon
20 exposure to Ab4-MCC-DM1 and Ab8-MCC-DM1. Addition of an excess of
   unconjugated parental anti-CD27L antibody was able to block Ab4-MCC-DM1 mediated
   growth inhibition, confirming CD27L binding by Ab4-MCC-DM1 was required for
   activity. Unconjugated parental anti-CD27L antibody did not inhibit the growth of
   CD27L-expressing 786-0 cells. Control conjugate, anti-streptavidin-MCC-DM1 (USA
25 MCC-DM 1), did not exhibit any inhibition of cell growth in either the CD27L-positive or
   the CD27L-negative cell line. The results indicate that both Ab4-MCC-DM1 and Ab8
   MCC-DM1 were potent inhibitors of 786-0 cell growth compared to control conjugate
   (Figure 3). Ab4-MCC-DM1 tended to show a slight increase in potency over Ab8-MCC
   DM1 (Table 7).

 5         Ab4-MCC-DM1 mediated Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
   against Raji cells with similar potency (EC50     = 0.006 tg/mL) and magnitude to that
   observed for the unconjugated parental Ab4 anti-CD27L antibody (EC50        = 0.01 tg/mL).
   Briefly, Natural Killer (NK) cells isolated from the PBMC obtained from a normal
   human blood donor were incubated with calcein labeled Raji human B cell lymphoma
10 target cells (express CD27L) in the presence of Ab4-MCC-DM1 or control antibodies as
   described above. Percent (%) specific cytotoxicity was determined by measuring calcein
   release from CD27L expressing target cells lysed in the presence of Ab4-MCC-DM1 as
   compared to control wells. The results are shown in Figure 8 which indicate that Ab4
   MCC-DM1 mediated a similar level of ADCC to that of the Ab4 antibody (EC 50 values
15 of 0.006 and 0.01 tg/mL respectively). The huIgG1 control did not mediate any
   measurable lysis of CD27L expressing targets. Both the Ab4-MCC-DM1 and the
   unconjugated Ab4 antibody are capable of inducing NK cell mediated ADCC of CD27L
   specific targets at similar levels. Similar results were observed for Ab8-MCC-DM1 and
   the unconjugated Ab8 antibody.
20          vitro Antibody Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP) activity of Ab4-MCC
   DM1 or unconjugated parental antibody Ab4 was measured against both Raji and 786-0
   tumor cells. Ab4-MCC-DM1 mediated a similar level of complement-mediated lysis to
   that observed for unconjugated parental antibody Ab4. Briefly, macrophages were
   differentiated from monocytes isolated from the human peripheral blood obtained from
25 normal human blood donors. Macrophages were incubated with PHK67 green labeled
   CD27L expressing cell lines, 786-0 and Raji as target cells in the presence of
   unconjugated anti CD27L antibody Ab4, HuIgG1, Ab4-MCC-DM1, or control antibodies
   (aSA-MCC-DM1), as described above. Percent (%) tumor cell phagocytosis was
   determined from the percentage of tumor cells that were engulfed by macrophages vs.
30 total macrophages in the selected fields. The results are shown in Figure 9 and indicate
   that Ab4-MCC-DM1 mediated similar ADCP potency in CD27L expressing cell lines,
   786-0 and Raji. EC50 values of the unconjugated Ab4 were within 10-fold of those
   observed for Ab4-MCC-DM1 (see Table 8).

           Given that the dilution curve was performed at 1:40 dilution intervals, the
   observed EC50 for both Ab4-MCC-DM 1 and the unconjugated Ab4 are of a similar
10 potency (with-in the margin of the dilution factor). Thus, both the conjugated Ab4
   MCC-DM1 and the unconjugated WT Ab4 antibodies are capable of inducing human
   macrophage to mediate ADCP of CD27Lexpressing cells at similar levels. Similar
   results were observed for Ab8-MCC-DM1 and the unconjugated Ab8 antibody.
           In vitro Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) activity of Ab4-MCC-DM1
15 was assessed employing both human and rabbit complement and CD27L-expressing Raji
   tumor cells. At 10 tg/mL, Ab4-MCC-DM1 mediated a similar level of complement
   mediated lysis to that observed for unconjugated parental antibody Ab4 (rabbit
   complement 72% lysis and human 17% lysis). Briefly, activated rabbit or human
   complements were incubated with CD27L expressing Raji target cells in the presence of
20 anti CD27L antibodies or control antibodies, as described above. CDC mediated killing
   was measured from output feature of ArrayScan reader "% selected objects" to detect %
   of PI positive vs. Hoechst for "% Cytotoxicity." The results indicate that Ab4-MCC
   DM1 mediated similar levels of CDC to that of the WT Ab4 antibody when incubating
   tumor Raji cells with 10% baby rabbit complement or 20% human complement. Heat
25 inactivated rabbit or human complements didn't show any CDC mediated killing against
   Raji. Thus, both Ab4-MCC-DM1 and un-conjugated Ab4 induce a similar level of CDC
   activity against CD27L expressing tumor target cells. Similar results were observed for
   Ab8-MCC-DM1 and the unconjugated Ab8 antibody.

            In vivo passaged 786-0 ccRCC cells (786-0 S4) were implanted into female CB
   17/ SCID mice using growth-factor reduced MATRIGEL to generate tumor xenografts
   for efficacy studies. 786-0 S4 cells express an average of approximately 180,000 CD27L
   sites/cell. Treatment with Ab4-MCC-DM1 or Ab8-MCC-DM1 was initiated when the
10 tumor size reached an average of approximately 250 mm 3. Tumor-bearing animals were
   randomized by tumor size into groups of ten animals each and dosed intravenously once.
   A blinded dose response study of Ab4-MCC-DM1 and Ab8-MCC-DM1 employing doses
   ranging from 7-64 ug DM1/kg (0.3-2.5 mg Ab/kg) was performed in this established
   tumor model. Robust tumor regression was observed at the low 7 ug DM1/kg, mid 25 ug
15 DM1/kg and the high 64 ug DM1/kg doses. At the mid and high dose, complete
   regressions were maintained at least 28 days following a single dose (Figure 4). No body
   weight loss was observed in any of the dosing groups over the course of the study.
            In another demonstration of in vivo efficacy, Caki- 1 ccRCC cells that express an
   average of 59,000 CD27L sites per cell (3-fold less that 786-0 cells) were implanted into
20 CB-17/SCID mice as described above. When the Caki-1 xenografts reached an average
   size of 250 mm 3, tumor-bearing animals were randomized by tumor size into groups of
   ten animals each and dosed intravenously once per week for 3 weeks (to more closely
   mimic a weekly clinical dosing regimen). A blinded dose response study of Ab4-MCC
   DM1 and Ab8-MCC-DM1 employing doses ranging from 60-270 ug DM1/kg (2.4-11
25 mg Ab/kg) was performed in this established tumor model. Tumor regression was
   initially observed at the mid 120 ug DM1/kg and the high 270 ug DM1/kg doses while
   tumor growth inhibition was observed at the low 60ug DM1/kg dose compared to the
   control conjugate or vehicle. As time progressed, tumor regression in the two higher
   dose groups began to diminish within 7 days of receiving the last dose (Figure 5).
30          Like ccRCC cells, Raji B-lymphoma cells express CD27L (about 200,000 sites /
   cell) and internalize the anti-CD27L drug conjugate which results in mitotic arrest and
   cell death in vitro. Ab4-MCC-DM1 was evaluated for efficacy in the subcutaneous Raji
   Xenograft model. When the Raji xenografts reached an average size of 250 mm 3, tumor
   bearing animals were randomized by tumor size into groups of ten animals each and
35 dosed intravenously q4 days x 2 and then once per week for one additional week for a

 5 total of 3 doses (to more closely mimic a weekly clinical dosing regimen). A blinded
   dose response study of Ab4-MCC-DM1 using doses ranging from 60-270 ug DM1/kg
   (2.4-11 mg Ab/kg) was performed in this established tumor model. Tumor growth
   inhibition was observed at all dose levels, with >90% tumor growth inhibition being
   observed at the mid 120 ug DM1/kg and the high 270 ug DMl/Kg doses during the active
10 dosing period with an intermediate anti tumor response being observed at the low 60ug
   DM1/kg dose compared to control conjugate (Figure 6). At the end of the tumor
   measurement period a slight majority of animals in the mid and high dose groups
   exhibited tumor regression suggesting that further dose and schedule optimization could
   improve response.
15         The efficacy of different dosing intervals of control conjugate aSA-MCC-DM1,
   or Ab4-MCC-DM1 was evaluated in the 786-0 xenograft model. CB-17/SCID mice were
   implanted with 786-0 tumor cells. On day 13, 50 animals were randomized into cohorts
   of 10 animals each with an average tumor volume of 200 mm3. Each cohort was
   administered an intraperitoneal dose of either control conjugate aSA-MCC-DM1 or Ab4
20 MCC-DM1. Tumor volume is represented as group average  standard error of the mean
   (SEM).     Statistical significance of observed differences between growth curves was
   evaluated from days 13 to 59 by repeated measures analysis of covariance (RMANOVA)
   of the log transformed tumor volume data with Dunnett adjusted multiple comparisons.
   Significance is attained if p < 0.05. Three doselevels of Ab4-MCC-DM1 (1.0, 2.0, or 2.9
25 mg/kg of Ab4-MCC-DM1 based upon antibody or 25, 50, or 75 pg/kg based upon DM1
   equivalents, respectively) were administered. The 1.0 mg/kg dose was administered once
   per week or once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, the 2.0 mg/kg dose was administered once
   every 2 weeks for 6 weeks and the 2.9 mg/kg dose was administered once every 3 weeks
   for 6 weeks. Animals were dosed intraperitoneally starting on day 13 post tumor
30 inoculation. By day 59, the aSA-MCC-DM1 treated group was euthanized due to large
   tumor volumes. On day 59, the average tumor volume of mice treated with each dose
   regimen of Ab4-MCC-DMIadministered was significantly less than that of the USA
   MCC-DM1 control conjugate group (p < 0.0001) (Figure 7). Ab4-MCC-DM1 mediated
   durable tumor regression with each dosing regimen. No body weight loss was observed
35 in any of the Ab4-MCC-DM1 treatment groups.

           Pharmokinetics
           Ab4 and Ab8 antibody drug conjugates were assessed after intravenous
   administration to female CB-17/SCID mice containing CD27L-expressing 786-0
   xenografts in the context of efficacy studies and a follow-on terminal PK study. The
10 cumulative exposures and clearance values were within 1.33 and 1.4-fold between the
   Ab4-MCC-DM1 and Ab8-MCC-DM1 molecules, and the half-life of both ADCs was
   approximately 12 days in mice.
           The stability and PK parameters of the Ab4-MCC-DM1 and Ab8-MCC-DM1
   antibody drug conjugates were characterized in vivo following a single intravenous (IV)
15 dose into CB-17/SCID mice bearing 786-0 xenografts. The exposures of the two
   antibody drug conjugates were highly comparable, but Ab4-MCC-DM1 demonstrated a
   more stable drug-to-antibody conjugation ratio over the 96 hour time-course of the study
   as determined by affinity-MS than did Ab8-MCC-DM1 molecule. Ab4-MCC-DM1
   showed no detectable loss of conjugate integrity at the 30 min or 24 hour time point post
20 injection while Ab8-MCC-DM1 exhibited changes at the 30 minute time point and
   significant decreases in all conjugate species by 24 hours post injection.

           Modifications to Ab4 were tested for binding to CD27L by ELISA. CD27L was
   bound to Maxisorp plates at room temperature for > 2 hours, shaking with lug/mL in 100
25 uL. The plates were then blocked with 250 uL 10% Non-fat dry milk in PBS + 0.05%

   modified Ab and purified parental control titrations ranging from 0.045 to 100 ng/mL
   were applied to the plates and incubated for 1 hour. A horseradish peroxidase conjugated

30 PBST wash, and incubated for 1 hour. A final wash was performed and TMB substrate

   450nm was taken and plotted vs. concentration. These curves were then analyzed with a
   3 parameter non linear curve fit and the EC 50 and Max calculated signal were compared

   binding to CD27L. The 9 that did not bind to CD27L had at least one of the following:
15 "G33S-134L" and "S 103G-G104S" heavy chain modifications or the "N31H-Y58N" light
   chain modification. Of the 97% similar antibodies (2 amino acid modifications) 75% (6
   of 8) retained some level of binding, while 56% (7 of 16) of the 94% similar antibodies (4
   amino acid modifications) retain some level of binding, 2 of which have similar binding
