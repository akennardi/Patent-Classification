ABSTRACT
This invention relates to a process for decontaminating or sterilizing an article contaminated with
spores. The process comprises contacting the spores with a liquid sterilant for a sufficient period
of time to effect a desired reduction (e.g., at least a 4 log reduction) in the number of spores
capable of returning to vegetative growth. The liquid sterilant may comprise water, an anti
microbial agent (e.g. peracetic acid) and a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).

           This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 14/262,840,
   filed April 28, 2014.     This application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S.

   applications are incorporated herein by reference.
                                        Technical Field
           This invention relates to a process for decontaminating or sterilizing an
   article contaminated with spores, using an aqueous composition containing an
10 antimicrobial agent (.e.g., peracetic aid) and a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen
   peroxide).
                                          Background
           Spores are a highly resistant, dormant cell type formed by some types of
   bacteria. Endospores (or simply spores) form within the vegetative mother cell in
15 response to adverse changes in the environment, most commonly nutrient
   depletion.    The mother cell undergoes an asymmetrical cell division, where it
   replicates its genetic material, which is then surrounded by multiple concentric
   and spore specific layers.       The mother cell then disintegrates, releasing the
   mature dormant spore which requires neither nutrients, water nor air for survival
20 and is protected against a variety of trauma, including extremes of temperature,
   radiation, and chemical assault.         Spore forming bacteria cause a number of
   serious diseases in humans, including botulism, gas gangrene, tetanus, and
   acute food poisoning. Anthrax results from infection by the aerobic spore form
   Bacillus anthracis.
25                                         Summary
           Spores are difficult to kill and a problem in the art of decontamination and
   sterilization relates to providing an effective process for killing spores.      This
   invention provides a solution to this problem.          This invention relates to a
   decontamination or sterilization process wherein spores are killed using a liquid
30 sterilant comprising water, an antimicrobial agent (e.g., peracetic acid) and a
   peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).

                                               2
            Medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments and
   devices that are exposed to blood or other body fluids (e.g., endoscopes) require
   sterilizing or disinfecting between each use.       Liquid sterilizing or disinfecting
   systems are used to clean and decontaminate instruments and devices that
   cannot withstand the high temperatures of steam sterilization.
            This invention relates to a process for decontaminating or sterilizing an
   article contaminated with spores, comprising:     contacting the article with a liquid
   sterilant comprising water, an antimicrobial agent and a peroxide for a sufficient
   period of time to effect at least a 4 log reduction, or at least a 5 log reduction, or
 5 at least a 6 log reduction in the number of spores capable of returning to
   vegetative growth, the aqueous composition having a concentration of peroxide
   in the range from about 0.01 to about 14% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about
   12% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight, or from about 0.01 to
   about 8% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about 7% by weight, or from about
10 0.05 to about 7% by weight, or from about 0.1 to about 7% by weight, or from
   about 0.1 to about 6.5% by weight.
            In an embodiment, the concentration of the antimicrobial agent is in the
   range from about 0.001 to about 95% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about
   80%, or from about 0.001 to about 60% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about
15 30% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 10% by weight, or from about 0.001
   to about 7% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 6%, or from about 0.001 to
   about 5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 4% by weight, or from about
   0.001 to about 3% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 2% by weight, or from
   about 0.001 to about 1% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 0.5% by weight,
20 or from about 0.001 to about 0.4% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 0.3%
   by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 0.2% by weight, or from about 0.001 to
   about 0.16% by weight.
            In an embodiment, the concentration of the antimicrobial agent is in the
   range from about 0.005 to about 0.5% by weight, or from about 0.005 to about
25 0.4% by weight, or from about 0.005 to about 0.3% by weight, or from about
   0.005 to about 0.2% by weight, or from about 0.005 to about 0.16% by weight.
            In an embodiment, the weight ratio of the antimicrobial agent to the
   peroxide is in the range from about 0.001 to about 0.5, or from about 0.003 to

                                                 3
   about 0.4, or from about 0.006 to about 0.3, or from about 0.008 to about 0.2, or
   from about 0.01 to about 0.1.
            In an embodiment, the process is conducted in a sterilizing apparatus, the
   sterilizing    apparatus   comprising    a   sterilization chamber    and   a  sterilant
 5 introduction system, the process comprising: placing an article contaminated with
   spores in the sterilization chamber; flowing the liquid sterilant in the sterilization
   chamber in contact with the article; draining the liquid sterilant from the
   sterilization chamber; flowing rinse water in the sterilization chamber in contact
   with the article; and removing the article from the sterilization chamber.
10                            Brief Description of the Drawings
            Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a bacterial spore that can be killed in
   accordance with the invention.
            Fig. 2 is a flow sheet showing a decontamination or sterilization process
   that may be used in accordance with the invention.
            Fig. 3 is a flow sheet showing a filtration system that may be used with the
   sterilization process illustrated in Fig. 2.
                                     Detailed Description
            All ranges and ratio limits disclosed in the specification and claims may be
15 combined in any manner. It is to be understood that unless specifically stated
   otherwise, references to "a," "an," and/or "the" may include one or more than one,
   and that reference to an item in the singular may also include the item in the
   plural.
            The phrase "and/or" should be understood to mean "either or both" of the
20 elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some
   cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Other elements may optionally be
   present other than the elements specifically identified by the "and/or" clause,
   whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified unless
   clearly indicated to the contrary. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to
25 "A and/or B," when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as
   "comprising" can refer, in one embodiment, to A without B (optionally including
   elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B without A (optionally
   including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B
   (optionally including other elements); etc.

                                                 4
           The word "or" should be understood to have the same meaning as "and/or"
   as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, "or" or "and/or"
   shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also
   including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally,
 5 additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as
   "only one of' or "exactly one of," may refer to the inclusion of exactly one element
   of a number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein shall only
   be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. "one or the other but not
   both") when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one
10 of," or "exactly one of."
           The phrase "at least one," in reference to a list of one or more elements,
   should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or
   more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least
   one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and
15 not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition
   also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements
   specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase "at least one"
   refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.
   Thus, as a non-limiting example, "at least one of A and B" (or, equivalently, "at
20 least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in one
   embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B
   present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment,
   to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and
   optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at
25 least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally
   including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
           The transitional words or phrases, such as "comprising," "including,"
   "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," "holding," and the like, are to be
   understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to.
30         The term "killing" (or "kill") spores refers to rendering the spores incapable
   of returning to vegetative growth.        In an embodiment, the term killing spores
   refers to rendering the spores incapable of reproduction, metabolism and/or
   growth.

                                               5
          The term "log reduction" is a mathematical term to show the number of live
   spores killed by contacting the spores with the aqueous composition of the
   invention. A "4 log reduction" means that the number of live spores is 10,000
   times smaller.     A "5 log reduction" means that the number of live spores is
 5  100,000 times smaller. A "6 log reduction" means that the number of live spores
   is 1,000,000 times smaller.
          The    term   "antimicrobial   agent"   refers   to a    substance    that kills
   microorganisms or inhibits their growth.
          The term "disinfectant" refers to a substance that is applied to non-living
10 objects to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that are on the objects.
           The term "antibiotic" refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth
   of microorganisms within the body.
          The term "antiseptic" refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth
   of microorganisms on living tissue.
15        The term "biocide" refers to a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of
   living organisms.     The biocide can be a pesticide.         The biocide can be a
   fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, algaecide, molluscicide, miticide or rodenticide.
          The term "sanitizer" refers to a substance that cleans and disinfects.
          Sterilization with respect to spores is often taken as referring to a process
20 for achieving a total absence of living spores. Processes that are less rigorous
   than sterilization may include decontamination processes, and the like.           The
   liquid sterilant provided for herein may be used to achieve at least a 4 log
   reduction, or at least a 5 log reduction, or at least a 6 log reduction in the number
   of spores capable of returning to vegetative growth, or in an embodiment,
25 capable of reproduction, metabolism and/or growth.           When at least a 6 log
   reduction is achieved, the process may be referred to as a sterilization process.
   When a 4 log reduction or a 5 log reduction is achieved, the process may be
   considered to be less rigorous than a sterilization, but nevertheless useful for
   various decontamination applications.
30        Bacterial spores typically comprise multiple concentric layers surrounding
   a central core. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 wherein a bacterial spore is shown
   which has a central core, inner membrane, germ cell wall, cortex, outer
   membrane, spore coat and occasionally an exosporium.             Oxidizing agents for

                                              6
   years have been thought to attack DNA, RNA, protein and most organic matter
   equally.    However, while not wishing to be bound by theory, with the present
   invention it is believed that the mechanism that is provided involves the peroxide
   (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) first piercing holes in multiple layers surrounding the
 5 central core of the spores, and then the antimicrobial agent advancing through
   the pierced holes and attacking the central core to kill the spores.            This
   mechanism is believed to occur when using liquid sterilant compositions with
   relatively low concentrations of the peroxide (e.g., in the range from about 0.01 to
   about 14% by weight, or from about 0.01 to about 7% by weight).
10         In embodiments wherein the concentrations of the antimicrobial agent and
   peroxide are relatively low, as indicated above, advantages of the inventive
   process include relatively low costs due to the fact that the concentrations of the
   antimicrobial agent and peroxide used in the processes are relatively low in
   comparison to normal concentrations used in other products using these
15 ingredients.    Other advantages of these embodiments include low levels of
   corrosion of surfaces treated due to the low concentrations of the antimicrobial
   agent and peroxide.
           The water may comprise tap water, deionized water, distilled water, water
   purified by osmosis, or a mixture of two or more thereof.
20         The peroxide may comprise any compound containing an oxygen-oxygen
   single bond, or a peroxide group or peroxide ion. Examples include hydrogen
   peroxide; organic peroxides (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, acetyl acetone peroxide,
   acetyl benzoyl peroxide, diacetyl peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, methyl
   isobutyl ketone peroxide, acetone peroxide, or a mixture of two or more thereof);
25 peroxy acids (e.g., peroxy carboxylic acid); organic hydroperoxides (e.g., t-butyl
   hydroperoxide,      ethylhydroperoxide,  or  cumene       hydroperoxide);  inorganic
   peroxides such as peroxide salts (e.g., alkali metal or alkaline earth metal
   peroxides); acid peroxides (e.g., peroxymonosulfuric acid or peroxydisulfuric
   acid); and mixtures of two or more thereof.
30         The hydrogen peroxide may be derived from any source of hydrogen
   peroxide.     Hydrogen peroxide is typically available as a solution in water.
   Hydrogen peroxide concentrations of about 3 to about 8% by weight may be
   used. Commercial grades of about 30% to about 40% by weight, or about 35%

                                                7
   by weight, hydrogen peroxide may be used. Commercial grades of about 70 to
   about 98%      by weight hydrogen         peroxide   may be used.       The   higher
   concentrations would be diluted to provide the desired concentrations of
   hydrogen peroxide that are indicated above.
 5         The antimicrobial agent may comprise a disinfectant, antibiotic, antiseptic,
   biocide and/or sanitizer. The antimicrobial agent may comprise peracetic acid.
   The antimicrobial agent may comprise an alcohol, chlorine, a chlorine compound,
   an aldehyde, an oxidizing agent, iodine, ozone, a phenolic, a quaternary
   ammonium compound, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial
10 agent may comprise formaldehyde, ortho-phthalaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, silver
   dihydrogen citrate, polyaminopropyl biguanide, sodium bicarbonate, lactic acid,
   chlorine bleach, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial agent may
   comprise methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, isopropanol, or
   a mixture of two or more thereof.         The antimicrobial agent may comprise a
15 hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, a dichloroisocyanurate, a monochloroisocyanurate,
   a halogenated hydantoin, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The antimicrobial
   agent may      comprise     sodium   hypochlorite,   calcium  hypochlorite,  sodium
   dichloroisocyanurate, sodium       chlorite,   N-chloro-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
   sodium salt, 2,4-dichorobenzyl alcohol, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The
20 antimicrobial agent may comprise performic acid, potassium permanganate,
   potassium peroxymonosulfate, or a mixture of two or more thereof.               The
   antimicrobial   agent    may comprise      phenol,   o-phenylphenol,  chloroxylenol,
   hexachlorophene, thymol, amylmetacresol, or a mixture of two or more thereof.
   The antimicrobial agent may comprise benzalkonuim chloride, cetyltrimethyl
25 ammonium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride, boric acid,
   Brilliant green, chlorhexidine gluconate, tincture of iodine, providone-iodine,
   mercurochrome, manuka honey, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexamethylene
   biguamide, balsam of Peru, or a mixture of two or more thereof. Many of these
   antimicrobial agents may not be effective in the killing of spores on their own, but
30 when combined with hydrogen peroxide at the concentration levels indicated
   above many of these antimicrobial agents are useful for killing spores.
           The liquid sterilant composition may further comprise acetic acid, sulfuric
   acid, or a mixture thereof. The concentration of acetic acid may range up to

                                                8
   about 60% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 60% by weight, or from about
   0.001 to about 30% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 10% by weight, or
   from about 0.001 to about 5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 2% by
   weight. The concentration of sulfuric acid may range up to 3% by weight, or from
 5 about 0.001 to about 2% by weight. The concentration of each of these may be
   in the range up to about 1% by weight, or from about 0.001 to about 1% by
   weight, or from about 0.001 to about 0.5% by weight, or from about 0.001 to
   about 0.3% by weight.
          The liquid sterilant composition may further comprise one or more
10 surfactants to provide the aqueous composition with surface active properties,
   one or more buffers to provide buffering capability (pH modulation), one or more
   corrosion inhibitors to provide corrosion inhibiting properties, and/or one or more
   chelators to provide chelation capacity (water softening).
          The surfactant may comprise any compound that lowers surface tension or
15 provides greater wettability. The surfactant may comprise one or more detergent,
   wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents and/or dispersants. The surfactant
   may comprise one or more organic compounds that contain both hydrophobic
   groups and hydrophilic groups.         The surfactant may comprise both a water
   insoluble component and a water soluble component.               The surfactant may
20 comprise one or more anionic, cationic, zwitterionic and/or nonionic compounds.
   The surfactant may comprise one or more alkanolamines, alkylarylsulfonates,
   amine oxides, poly(oxyalkylene)s, block copolymers comprising alkylene oxide
   repeat units, carboxylated alcohol ethoxylates, ethoxylated alcohols, alkyl
   phenols, ethoxylated alkyl phenols, ethoxylated amines, ethoxylated amides,
25 oxiranes, ethoxylated fatty acids, ethoxylated fatty esters, ethoxylated oils, fatty
   esters, fatty acid amides, glycerol esters, glycol esters, sorbitan, sorbitan esters,
   imidazolines, lecithin, lignin, glycerides (e.g., mono-, di- and/or triglyceride), olefin

   alcohols, sucrose esters, sulfates and/or alcohols and/or ethoxylated alcohols of
30 fatty esters, sulfonates of dodecyl and/or tridecyl benzenes, sulfosuccinates,

   glycol, or a mixture of two or more thereof.
           The concentration of the surfactant in the liquid sterilant composition may
   be in the range up to about 10% by weight, or from about 0.5 to about 10% by
 5 weight, or from about 0.5 to about 6% by weight, or from about 1 to about 4% by

           The process may be conducted in any suitable decontamination or
   sterilization apparatus. An example of such sterilization apparatus is illustrated in
   Figs. 2 and 3.     Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, sterilization apparatus 10 includes
30 panel 22, which is part of a housing structure (not shown). The panel 22 includes
   a recess or cavity 24 dimensioned to receive the articles to be decontaminated or
   sterilized.   A tray or container 26 is provided to receive the articles to be

                                                 11
   decontaminated or sterilized. Container 26 is dimensioned to be received within
   the recess or cavity 24.
            A manually operable lid 32 is movable between an opened position
   allowing access to cavity 24, and a closed position (shown in Fig. 1) closing or
 5 covering cavity 24. A seal element 34 surrounds cavity 24 and forms a fluid-tight,
   i.e., an air-tight and liquid-tight, seal between lid 32 and panel 22 when lid 32 is in
   a closed position. A latch (not shown) is provided for latching and securing lid 32
   in a closed position during a sterilization cycle. Cavity 24 defines sterilization
   chamber 36 when lid 32 is in the closed position.
10          A fluid circulation system 40 provides for the flow of the liquid sterilant to
   sterilization chamber 36 and for the circulation of the liquid sterilant in sterilization
   chamber 36. Fluid circulation system 40 may include a water inlet line 42 that is
   connected to a source of heated water (not shown). Filter elements 44 and 46
   may be positioned in water inlet line 42 to filter out large contaminants that may
15 be present in the incoming water. Filters 44 and 46 may comprise size exclusion
   filter elements used to remove particles exceeding a predetermined size. Filter
   element 46 may be used to filter out smaller particles than filter element 44. Filter
   element 44 may be used to filter out particles of about 3 micrometers or larger,
   and filter element 46 may be used to filter out particles of about 0.1 micrometer or
20 larger. Pressure sensors (not shown) may be provided to monitor pressure drops
   across filter elements 44 and 46. A change in the pressure drop across either
   filter element may be indicative of clogging, rupturing or the like.
            A viral reduction device 52 for inactivating organisms within the water
   source may be provided in water inlet line 42. Viral reduction device 52 may
25 comprise an ultraviolet (UV) treatment device, for example, a class A device, as
   specified in NSF/ANSI Standards 55, or an equivalent thereof. An example of
   such a device would be a UV light system having a minimum dosage of 40,000
   pW/cm2 which may be available from Wedeco Ideal Horizons of Charlotte, North
   Carolina. The viral reduction device 52 may be positioned downstream from filter
30 elements 44 and 46, as shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, the viral reduction device
   52 may be positioned in water inlet line 42 upstream of the filter elements 44 and

            The first and second filter assemblies 110 and 130 may be pre-sterilized
   prior to installation so that the contents of the filter assemblies 110 and 130 may

                                                 14
   be free of microbial contaminants. The filter assemblies 110 and 130 may be
   sterilized during each subsequent processing phase.
            Valves 152 and 154 are positioned in fluid feeder line 62 to enable
   isolation of the first filter assembly 110.       Valve 152 is positioned within first

   of the first and second filter assemblies 110 and 130. One end of bypass line
    172 is connected to fluid feed line 62 between pump 92 and the location where
15 the water inlet line 42 connects to fluid feed line 62. A directional check valve
    174 is positioned between water inlet line 42 and filter bypass line 172 to prevent
   incoming water from entering filter bypass line 172. The other end of filter bypass
   line 172 is connected to feeder line 62 downstream of the filter assemblies 110
   and 130, and the heater 102.
20          Filter purge manifold system 180, which includes air inlet line 182 and vent
   line 188, may be used to provide clean, filtered, pressurized air to the circulation
   system 40. Control valve 184 is positioned within air inlet line 182 to regulate the
   flow of air therethrough.      The air in air inlet line 182 may be operated at a
   predetermined, regulated pressure.         Air inlet line 182 may include a pressure
25 regulator (not shown) for maintaining a generally constant, desired air pressure
   within air inlet line 182. Air inlet line 182 splits into two branch return lines 192
   and 194. A vent line 188 with control valve 189 is connected to branch lines 192

30           Alternate embodiments of the water filtration system 100 that may be used
   are disclosed in U.S. Patent 7,569,182 B2, at column 12, line 43 to column 13,
   line 46, and Figs. 3 and 4, these passages and drawings being incorporated
   herein by reference.

                                               16
            A sterilization process may be conducted using the apparatus 10 as
   follows.     One or more articles to         be sterilized     (e.g., medical,   dental,
   pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments or devices) are loaded into
   container 26, which in turn is placed into chamber 36.             The articles may be
 5 supported on a tray, or in a basket, or a cartridge, or the like (not shown), within
   the container 26.
            The articles may be decontaminated or sterilized using the liquid sterilant
   where ingredients of the liquid sterilant are placed in the dispensing device 72
   and contacted with incoming water to form the liquid sterilant. At the beginning of
10 a sterilization process, drain valve 96 in circulation system 40 is closed, and
   water valve 54 in inlet line 42 is opened to allow heated water to enter circulation
   system 40. The temperature of the water may be in the range from about 20 to
   about 800C, or from about 40 to about 600C. The incoming water is filtered using
   filter elements 44 and 46 in water inlet line 42 to remove particulates greater than
15 a predetermined size. The water may be treated by using a viral reduction device
   52 wherein ultraviolet (UV) radiation is applied to the water to inactivate
   organisms therein. The water passes through valve 54 and enters circulation
   system 40. The incoming water is filtered using filter assemblies 110 and 130 in
   feeder line 62 and proceeds to fill the circulation system 40, sterilization chamber
20 36 and container 26.
            Check valve 174 between water inlet valve 54 and filter bypass line 172
   causes all of the incoming water to flow through the first and second filter
   assemblies 110 and 130, thereby insuring filtration of the water flowing into
   apparatus 10.
25          The incoming water, which is under pressure from an external source,
   forces air in the fluid circulation system 40, sterilization chamber 36 and container
   26 to an over-flow/air device (not shown) that may be positioned at the highest
   point of apparatus 10.        Air within the system migrates toward the over-flow
   device.
30          The presence of the water flowing through the over-flow block is indicative
   that apparatus 10 is filled with water. The system controller then causes water
   valve 54 to close, thereby stopping the flow of water into apparatus 10, i.e., into

                                                  17
   fluid circulation system 40, sterilization chamber 36 and container 26.           This
   completes the water fill phase of the process.
            Once the apparatus 10 is filled with water, the system controller initiates
   the chemical mixing and exposure phase of the process. Pump 92 is energized
 5 to circulate water through circulation system 40, sterilization chamber 36 and
   container 26.      Valve 74 is opened to initiate the flow of water through the
   dispensing container 72.       The liquid sterilant flows into circulation system 40,
   wherein it is circulated through circulation system 40, sterilization chamber 36
   and container 26 by pump 92.             A portion of the liquid sterilant flows into
10 sterilization chamber 36 around container 26, and a portion of the liquid sterilant
   flows into and through container 26 and contacts the articles contained therein.
           As indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3, a portion of the circulated liquid
   sterilant flows through filter bypass line 172 and a portion of the liquid sterilant
   flows through feed line 62 and the filter assemblies 110 and 130. The amount of
15 fluid flowing through the respective portions of the system may be controlled by
   regulating valve 222. The portion of the liquid sterilant flowing through filter feed
   line 62 and through the first and second filter assemblies 110 and 130 should be
   sufficient to insure sterilization of the filter elements 114 and 134 by exposure to
   the liquid sterilant.   In this respect, the flow of the liquid sterilant through filter
20 assemblies 110 and 130 sterilizes filter elements 114 and 134 and inactivates
   any microbial contamination that may have entered into filter assemblies 110 and
    130 during the water fill phase.      During each operation of apparatus 10, filter
   elements 114 and 134 may be exposed to liquid sterilant and as a result be
   sterilized by the sterilant. Moreover, the liquid sterilant that flows throughout the
25 closed-loop, fluid circulation system 40 during a sterilization phase, effectively
   sterilizes the fluid circulation system 40, and the components and fluid conduits
   forming the same. In other words, fluid circulation system 40 is sterilized during
   each sterilization cycle.
           After a predetermined exposure period, the drain phase may be initiated.
30 The length of the exposure period may range from about 0.5 to about 240
   minutes, or from about 2 to about 60 minutes. To initiate the drain phase, drain
   valve 96 is opened and the liquid sterilant is drained from the circulation system
   40, sterilization chamber 36 and container 26.

                                                18
            After the liquid sterilant has been drained from the apparatus 10, one or
   more rinsing phases is performed to rinse any liquid sterilant and any residual
   matter from the sterilized articles.     In this respect, inlet valve 54 is opened to
   introduce fresh water into apparatus 10, in a manner as heretofore described as
 5 the fill phase. All incoming water passes through the water filtration system 100,
   wherein water entering the circulation system 40 and sterilization chamber 36 is
   sterile. After each rinse fill, the rinse water is drained from apparatus 10 as
   heretofore described.      Pump 92 may be activated to circulate the rinse water
   through apparatus 10. During each fill, circulation and drain phase, the fluid over
10 flow/air make-up assembly operates to prevent microbial contaminants from
   entering the internal environment within the system.         The sterilized article may
   then be removed from the sterilization chamber.
                                           Examples
            The efficacy of the inventive process is assessed using a time kill
15 suspension test method and spores of Bacillus subtilis.
            Peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 0 2) are prepared as
   concentrated stocks (3x concentrate).         Each test contains 100 pl of the PAA
   concentrate and 100 pl of the H2 0 2 concentrate. Controls containing only PAA or
   H2 0 2 are also prepared. These contain 100 pl of either the PAA concentrate or
20 H2 0 2 concentrate and 100 pl of de-ionized water. To each test, 100 pl of spores
   are added while starting the timer concurrently.            The samples are mixed
   thoroughly.      The temperature of the samples is room temperature.              At the
   appropriate contact times, 10 pl of the appropriate test sample are placed into 90
   pl of the appropriate neutralizing solution, mixed thoroughly and incubated for at
25 least 10 minutes. Ten fold serial dilutions are prepared through 10-6 and plated
   using the drop counting method. The plates are then incubated aerobically at 37
   OC  for 1-2 days. Following incubation, colony forming units (CFU) are counted
   using standard plate count techniques and converted to log1 0 values for analysis.
            The results are indicated in the tables below.

                The values shown in Table 1 represent the time taken (minutes) to achieve
      a 4 log reduction in spore count in the presence of either PAA or H2 0 2 alone, or
      in combination with each other. For PAA concentrations 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and

                                                20
   0.04% (in the absence of H2 0 2 ), the values shown are extrapolated based on the
   experimental data obtained for PAA concentrations 0.08, 0.16 and 0.32%.
   Similarly, for H2 0 2 concentrations 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4% (in the absence of PAA), the
   values shown are extrapolated from experimental data.              All other values are
 5 generated from spore kill data.
            Table 2 illustrates the potentiation of spore killing by PAA when in the
   presence of H2 0 2 . At higher PAA concentrations (0.08 and 0.16% PAA) relatively
   little activity is gained by the addition of even very high concentrations of H2 0 2 .
   For example, 0.16% PAA is only 3.41 times more active in the presence of 6.4%
10 H2 0 2 , as compared to the activity of 0.16% PAA alone.
            However, as the concentration of PAA is reduced, the effect of adding
   H2 0 2 becomes more dramatic, with PAA spore killing activity being hundreds,
   thousands and even tens of thousands of times greater when in the presence of
   low concentrations of H2 0 2 . For example, 0.02% PAA is 333.11 times more
15 active in combination with 0.8% H2 0 2 than when used alone.
            Table 3 illustrates the potentiation of spore killing by H2 0 2 when in the
   presence of PAA. The enhancement of the spore killing activity of H2 0 2 when in
   the presence of PAA is far less pronounced, with relative improvement in the
   spore killing activity of H2 0 2 in combination with all but the highest concentrations
20 of PAA being no greater than about 100 times.
