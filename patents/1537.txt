   TITLE OF THE INVENTION
   FOAMING SKINCARE FORMULATIONS
 5 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   This invention is directed to formulations and/or compositions, particularly lotion, cream or
   foam formulations, (in particular emulsion formulations) that are held under pressure. The
   subject invention is also directed to lotion formulations containing a pressure generating vehicle
10 along with at least one recognized skin care active agent in a container or device such that the
   pressure generating vehicle would eject the formulation as foam, whipped cream or a similar
   form, upon application of external pressure on the container or device. The pressure generating
   vehicle is present in the device in sufficient amounts and pressure to mix with the ejecting
   formulation to form a foam, whipped cream or similar form or consistency.

   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   The invention relates to formulations which when dispensed from a device under pressure
   deposit lotion, cream, spray, ointment, gel or foam on the skin that exhibits a unique texture and
20 appearance, spread easier and rubs in faster to provide an improved feel on the wearer's skin and
   thereby enhance the entire application experience of the user compared with conventional
   lotions, foams or mousses. Formulations that relate to the invention include formulations that
   are applied topically to skin that help repair and maintain skin's condition or that prevent damage
   from exposure to environmental insults, such as solar ultraviolet radiation, pollutants,
25 excessively dry, cold or moist climates and the like.
   The invention also relates to formulations which when deposited on skin from the pressurized
   device create an appearance and texture that reinforces attributes of softness and gentleness that
   are especially important to users who require relief from sensitive skin or from skin which is
30 otherwise dry, inflamed, itchy or painful. When skin is compromised, it is frequently
   recommended that topical products be applied multiple times over the course of a day, so
   products that visually reinforce a product's skin benefits by its appearance can also help users
   comply with the need to make multiple applications during the day.

   The invention also relates to formulations applied topically to skin for the purposes of protecting,
   repairing and maintaining skin health and include inter alia sunscreens, moisturizers, skin
   protectants and therapeutic emollient-based products.
 5 There still exists a need for a skincare formulation that is easily applied to the skin of the user,
   and has a good texture and "feel" on the skin of the users. The product(s) of the present
   invention satisfy that need by having a very desirable "dry" and/or less greasy feel as it is being
   applied.
10 Yet another area where the present invention is applicable is sunscreen technology. Thus, the
   invention also relates to formulations that are applied to the skin to reduce the amount of solar
   ultraviolet radiation received by the skin. More particularly, the invention relates to formulations
   that impart several beneficial properties to topical formulations, including inter alia, ease of
   topical application, faster spreading, quick absorbance and a skin feel that is less greasy. A non
15 limiting example would be sunscreens. In the case of sunscreen, for example, it is now generally
   recognized that exposure to solar radiation can have adverse health consequences, sometimes not
   appearing until several years following the exposure. Of course, the immediately appearing
   sunburn from an overexposure can itself be a serious acute health problem.
20 Many products are available to reduce the amount of solar ultraviolet radiation received by the
   skin during exposure to the sun's rays. Typical product formulations are lotions, creams,
   ointments, sprays or gels containing chemical and/or physical barriers to ultraviolet transmission.
   These vary considerably in their abilities to protect the skin against the physical and biochemical
   effects of ultraviolet radiation. Many conventional cosmetic cream and lotion compositions are
25 described, for example, in Sagarin, Cosmetics Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, Volume 1,
   Wiley Interscience (1972), and Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7.
   Earlier sunscreen formulations were designed to protect against sunburn from a limited solar
   exposure period, while transmitting sufficient radiation to permit skin tanning. However, the
30 current focus is on eliminating as much ultraviolet radiation exposure as possible, it being
   recognized that skin tanning, while aesthetically pleasing to some, is a clear indication of tissue
   damage from overexposure to solar radiation. It has been recently discovered that any amount of
   unprotected exposure can potentially cause immune system suppression and lead to future health
   problems, such as skin carcinomas and other dermatological disorders.
                                                    -2-

    WO 2014/052264                                                               PCT/US2013/061299
   The SPF ("Sun Protection Factor") rating system has been developed to provide consumer
   guidance in selecting suitable sunscreens for any given outdoor activity. In general, the SPF
   number approximately corresponds to the multiple of time during which the properly applied
 5 sunscreen will prevent obvious reddening of the skin, over the exposure time that causes
   unprotected skin to exhibit reddening. Thus, if an SPF 8 sunscreen formulation has been properly
   applied, a person should be able to remain in the sun without visible effects for eight times the
   usual unprotected duration. Of course, the duration of unprotected exposure which produces a
   visible effect on the skin varies from one individual to another, due to differences in their skin
10 cells. Currently popular are high-SPF "sunblocker" products, having SPF values of at least 30.
   A sunscreen product that has been available for several years and sold by MSD Consumer Care,
   Inc., Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.A., is COPPERTONE* SPORT* SPF 30 lotion. But there still
   exists a need for a sunscreen formulation that is easily applicable to the skin of the user, has a
15 good texture and "feel" on the skin of the users.  The product of the present invention satisfies
   that need by having a very desirable "dry" and/or "less greasy" feel as it is being applied.
   In sunscreens, currently the FDA recommends reapplication of sunscreens after 2 hours. By
   having a very desirable and appealing feel, the inventive formulation may improve consumer
20 compliance in that regard.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   Names given to chemical substances herein generally are either accepted chemical names, or are
   trade organization or regulatory agency approved names such as CTFA Adopted Names as listed
15 in J. A. Wenninger et al., Eds., CTFA InternationalCosmetic IngredientDictionary,Eighth Ed.
   and Tenth Ed., The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Washington, D.C., 1997 and
   2000, respectively.
   In this application, the term "percent" shall mean percent by weight unless the context clearly
20 indicates otherwise.
   The term "pressure generating vehicle" refers to a chemical component or components which
   generate pressure, e.g., compressed gas, while inside an enclosed device or container (such as a
   can, for example), and get released upon application of external pressure on the device (e.g., by
25 way of a valve, actuator or similar such mechanism), while at the same time accompanying any
   other ingredients or formulation that is dispensed or expelled from inside the device. Non
   limiting examples of such pressure generating vehicles are compressed gases/propellants and
   liquid propellants such as, for example, C0 2 , propane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, nitrous
   oxide and the like, and suitable blends of such propellants. When the valve is opened by
30 applying an external pressure, the formulation or ingredients in the device are dispensed in a
   'whipped' form or a foamy form, infused with bubbles (of CO 2 or other compressed
   gas/propellant as stated above), creating a unique texture of the formulation and "feel" on the
   wearer's skin.
                                                    -5 -

    WO 2014/052264                                                              PCT/US2013/061299
   For the purposes of this invention, the terms "external pressure" and "external force" are
   interchangeable regarding their intended meaning. Similarly, the terms "internal pressure" and
   "internal force" are interchangeable regarding their intended meaning.
 5 The present invention offers a number of unique benefits for a skincare product (as well as thick
   lotion, cream, ointment and the like). Skincare formulations are typically greasy, heavy lotions
   that can be difficult to dispense from a traditional lotion package, cumbersome to spread across
   the skin, and they can leave a greasy residue on hands and skin that makes the experience less
   enjoyable. Many skin care products, especially for dry, chapped skin, have heavy greasy
10 aesthetics, petrolatum-containing formulations being a prime example. Non-limiting examples
   of other skincare products that are likely to be benefit from the present invention include those
   associated with diaper rash, products that help with psoriasis and eczema, and the like. The
   formulations are also applicable to petrolatum-containing formulations, mineral oil-containing
   formulations, dimethicone-containing formulations as well as others that are generally
15 recognized and known in the industry.
   In one embodiment, the formulation dispenses in a continuous stream when an external pressure
   is applied to the device, such as by depressing the valve/actuator , thereby eliminating the need
   to squeeze and shake the formula out of a bottle or tube.
20
   In another embodiment, the present invention operates as a "one-touch" delivery system; in such
   system, the user will hold down the actuator until the desired amount of formulation is
   dispensed.
25 In another embodiment, the present invention offers a continuous delivery system for skincare
   applications. Traditionally, "continuous delivery" is typically offered as a spray product and has
   been very successful due to the ease and speed that it provides for sunscreen application. Many
   consumers, however, prefer lotions/gels over sprays and would benefit from a continuous
   delivery mechanism. The present invention offers such an advantage.
30
   In another embodiment, the inventive formulation dispenses in a light 'whipped' form, infused
   with tiny bubbles that make the texture of the formulation lighter, smoother and easier to spread
   across the skin. This texture also makes the formulation feel less greasy and more aesthetically
   pleasing on hands and skin, leaving a 'sumptuous' feel with a sunscreen during application. This
                                                    -6-

    WO 2014/052264                                                               PCT/US2013/061299
   formulation spreads quickly and disappears rapidly as the user rubs the formulation into the skin.
   Such a formulation may even prevent excess application of the agent and may offer ecological
   advantages.
 5 In another embodiment, the present invention offers an easier, faster, smoother, and less greasy
   skincare formulation than a traditional formulation.
   For purposes of the present invention, a "skincare active agent" shall include all of those
   materials which are regarded as acceptable for use as active skin-protecting ingredients.
10 Approval by a regulatory agency may sometimes be required for inclusion of active agents in
   formulations intended for human contact including but not limited to sunscreen active
   ingredients or petrolatum, white petrolatum, mineral oil, and dimethicone as skin protectants, as
   well as agents used as self-tanners or for diaper rash treatment and the like. Those sunscreen
   active agents which have been or are currently approved for sunscreen use in the United States
15 and elsewhere include, without limitation, paraaminobenzoic acid, avobenzone, cinoxate,
   dioxybenzone, homosalate, menthyl anthranilate, octocrylene, octyl methoxycinnamate, octyl
   salicylate, oxybenzone, padimate 0, phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, octisalate,
   sulisobenzone, trolamine salicylate, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, diethanolamine
   methoxycinnamate, digalloyl trioleate, ethyl dihydroxypropyl PABA, glyceryl aminobenzoate,
20 lawsone with dihydroxy acetone, red petrolatum and the like. Several other sunscreen active
   ingredients are accepted for use in other countries. Some non-limiting examples from outside the
   U.S. include Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T-150, UVA sorb HEB, Uvinul A Plus, Neo
   Heliopan AP, Neo Heliopan MBC, and the like. It is typical to use combinations of two or more
   skincare active agents in a formulation. Preferably, the amount of skincare active agent or agents
25 is present in an amount that is consistent with the FDA guidelines. The use of a combination of
   active agents is especially true for sunscreen formulations in order to achieve higher levels of
   ultraviolet absorption or to provide useful absorption over a wider range of ultraviolet
   wavelengths than can be the case with a single active component. Preferably, the sunscreen
   active agent or agents is present in an amount that is consistent with the FDA sunscreen
30 monograph for sunscreen active agent or agents that are believed to provide the requisite SPF in
   accordance with the FDA monograph for such sunscreens. Other skin care active agents include
   sunless tanning active agents, skin protectant active agent emollients, insect repelling agents, and
   the like.
                                                    -'7-

    WO 2014/052264                                                                PCT/US2013/061299
   The pressure generating vehicle can be formulated inside the device in a variety of ways,
   depending upon the nature of the component or components that form the pressure generating
   vehicle. The vehicle, while acting as pressure-generator, is a gas, even though it may have been
   packaged as, for example, a gas, a liquid or a solid. Non-limiting examples of the gas are carbon
 5 dioxide (C0 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 20) and the like. Thus, for example, if the vehicle is carbon
   dioxide, the carbon dioxide can be 'derived' inside the sealed pressurized container in several
   ways. For example, the gas could be pumped into the container, or it could be added into the
   ingredients as "dry ice", or it could be derived or generated in situ via the chemical reaction of a
   suitable base with a suitable acid. In the case of "pumped in" or "dry ice", the gas is already
10 present as CO 2. In the case of generation in situ via the chemical reaction of a base with an acid,
   the gas is generated when the acid and the base mix. In either case, when the valve or actuator or
   similar equipment on the device is depressed, this gas escapes the container along with and
   propelling the skincare formulation, creating a whipped consistency. The pressure generating
   vehicle is present in sufficient amounts to mix with the ejecting skincare formulation to form a
15 foam, whipped cream or similar form and texture.
   If generating the gas by chemical reaction between a base and an acid, non-limiting examples of
   suitable bases include sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium
   carbonate and the like. Non-limiting examples of suitable acids include acetic acid, citric acid
20 and the like. Sodium bicarbonate with citric acid is a suitable combination. Because the
   components are being combined inside of the sealed container (device), the gas produced during
   the reaction is trapped which pressurizes the container. When the valve or actuator on the device
   is depressed, this gas escapes the container along with the skincare formulation, creating a
   whipped consistency.
25
   There are a number of ways to combine the sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. In an illustrative
   way, the sodium bicarbonate is first combined with the skincare formulation (phase one) and
   then placed inside the device. Citric acid is then made into an aqueous solution (phase two) and
   carefully added on top. The vessel is sealed and then shaken to combine the two phases. The
30 gas produced pressurizes the vessel.
   In an alternative (reverse) way, the citric acid is first combined with the skincare formulation
   (phase one) and then placed inside the device. Sodium bicarbonate is then made into an aqueous
                                                     -8-

    WO 2014/052264                                                               PCT/US2013/061299
   solution (phase two) and carefully added on top. The vessel is sealed and then shaken to
   combine the two phases. The gas produced pressurizes the vessel.
   It would also be possible to create this effect using a two chambered system where the two
 5 phases are combined at the point of use causing the formulation to begin foaming as it leaves the
   valve of the container. Such alternative designs are well known to the people skilled in the art.
   One advantage of the inventive system is that the gas introduced or produced may be non
   flammable.
10
   The pressure generating vehicle is generally present in about 0.1 to about 80 wt % in the
   formulation as the formulation is ejected from the device. The pressure generating vehicle is
   selected from a gas, such as gaseous propellant, a liquid, such as a liquid propellant or a blend of
   gas and liquid. As used herein, a gaseous propellant is also a compressed gas, such as CO 2 and
15 the like. As used herein, a liquid propellant is also a liquefied gas, such as isobutane and the
   like.
   In some embodiments, for example, where gaseous propellant is used, the pressure generating
   vehicle is present from about 0.1 to about 50 wt%. In another embodiment, the gaseous
20 propellant is present from about 0.1 to about 30 wt%. In another embodiment, the gaseous
   propellant is present from about 0.1 to about 15 wt%. In a further embodiment, the gaseous
   propellant is present from about 0.1 to about 10 wt%. In a preferred embodiment, the gaseous
   propellant is present from about 0.1 to about 5 wt%. Typically, when the pressure generating
   vehicle is a gaseous propellant, about 3 to about 5 wt% is present in the formulation.
25
   In some embodiments, where liquid propellant is used, the pressure generating vehicle is present
   from about 0.1 up to about 60 wt%. %. In another embodiment, the liquid propellant is present
   from about 0.1 to about 40 wt%. In another embodiment, the liquid propellant is present from
   about 0.1 to about 30 wt%. In a further embodiment, the liquid propellant is present from about
30 0.1 to about 20 wt%. In a preferred embodiment, the liquid propellant is present from about 10
   to about 30 wt%. Typically, when the pressure generating vehicle is a liquid propellant, about
   15 to about 30 wt% is present in the formulation

   In some other embodiments, where blends of both gaseous and liquid propellants are used, the
   pressure generating vehicle is generally present up to about 15 wt% for the gaseous propellant
   and up to about 40 wt% for the liquid propellant, preferably up to about 10 wt% for the gaseous
   propellant and up to about 30 wt% for the liquid propellant, more preferably up to about 5 wt%
 5 for the gaseous propellant and up to about 20 wt% for the liquid propellant, and typically up to
   about 3 wt% for the gaseous propellant and up to about 20 wt% for the liquid propellant.
   The term "emulsion" shall be used herein to identify oil-in-water (o/w) or water in oil (w/o) type
   dispersion formulations intended for application to the skin, particularly lotions and creams
10 providing cosmetic or therapeutic benefits. The emulsions may contain any of a number of
   desired "active" ingredients, including skin colorants, drug substances (such as anti
   inflammatory agents, antibiotics, topical anesthetics, antimycotics, keratolytics, etc.), skin
   protectants or conditioners, humectants, ultraviolet radiation absorbers and the like, depending
   on the intended uses for the formulations.
15
   Suitable emulsifiers for one aspect of the invention are those known in the art for producing oil
   in-water type emulsions. An aqueous external phase is preferred by many people for skin
   contact, since it is not as likely to produce an oily or greasy sensation when it is being applied, as
   is an emulsion having an oil external phase. The typical oil-in-water emulsifier has a
20 hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (frequently abbreviated as "HLB") value greater than about 9, as
   is well known in the art; however, this "rule" is known to have numerous exceptions. The chosen
   emulsifier, depending upon its chemical nature, will be a component of either the oil or aqueous
   phase or both, and assists with both the formation and the maintenance, or stability, of the
   emulsion.
25
   Although specific suppliers of commercially available ingredients may be listed herein, it is
   understood that these products may be available from additional suppliers and that the instant
   invention is not limited to only that ingredient from the specifically cited supplier. Rather the
   supplier is being provided as an example of what is commercially available.
30
   Non-limiting examples of suitable emulsifiers or surfactants include pharmaceutically
   acceptable, non-toxic, non-ionic, anionic and/or cationic surfactants. Examples of suitable non
   ionic surfactants include glycerol fatty acid esters such as glycerol monostearate, glycol fatty
   acid esters such as propylene glycol monostearate, polyhydric alcohol fatty acid esters such as
                                                    - 10 -

15 Insect repelling components are also a desirable ingredient in certain skincare and sunscreen
   formulations, if the formulations are to be used by persons engaged in outdoor activities. The
   most widely used insect repelling agent for personal care products is N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide,
   frequently called "DEET" and available in the form of a concentrate containing at least about 95
   percent DEET. Other synthetic chemical repellents include dimethyl phthalate, ethyl hexanediol,
20 indalone, di-n-propylisocinchoronate, bicycloheptene, dicarboximide, IR3535 (3-[N-Butyl-N
   acetyl]-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester; available from Merck KGaA)) and
   tetrahydrofuraldehyde. Certain plant-derived materials also have insect repellent activity,
   including citronella oil and other sources of citronella (including lemon grass oil), limonene,
   rosemary oil and eucalyptus oil. Choice of an insect repellent for incorporation into the skincare
25 or sunscreen emulsion will frequently be influenced by the odor of the repellent. The amount of
   repellent agent used will depend upon the choice of agent; DEET is useful at high
   concentrations, such as up to about 15 percent or more, while some of the plant-derived
   substances are typically used in much lower amounts, such as 0.1 percent or less.

   percent); Zinc acetate (0.1 to 2 percent); Zinc carbonate (0.2 to 2 percent); and Zinc oxide (I to
15 25 percent).
   Water is employed in amounts effective to form the emulsion. It is generally preferred to use
   water which has been purified by processes such as deionization or reverse osmosis, to improve
   the batch-to-batch formulation inconsistencies which can be caused by dissolved solids in the
20 water supply. The amount of water in the emulsion or composition can range from about 15
   percent to 95 weight percent.
   A humectant is a moistening agent that promotes retention of water due to its hygroscopic
   properties. Suitable humectants include glycerin, polymeric glycols such as polyethylene glycol
25 and polypropylene glycol, mannitol and sorbitol. Preferably, the humectant is glycerin, Sorbitol
   70% USP or polyethylene glycol 400, NF. More preferably, the humectant is glycerin. One or
   more humectants can optionally be included in the formulation in amounts from about 1 percent
   to about 10 percent by weight, preferably about 5 percent by weight. Other suitable humectants
   include, inter alia, fructose, glucose, glycerin, lactic acid, PCA, potassium lactate and PCA,
30 propylene glycol, sodium lactate and PCA.
   A dry-feel modifier is an agent which when added to an emulsion, imparts a "dry feel" to the
   skin when the emulsion dries. Dry feel modifiers can include talc, kaolin, chalk, starches, zinc
   oxide, silicone fluids, inorganic salts such as barium sulfate, surface treated silica, precipitated

   The present formulation may additionally contain waterproofing agents. A waterproofing or
   water resistance agent is a hydrophobic material that imparts film forming and waterproofing
   characteristics to an emulsion. A waterproofing agent that can be used in conjunction with the
   waterproofing agents of the present invention can be a copolymer of vinyl pyrollidone and
10 eicosene and dodecane monomers such as the Ganex V 220, Ganex P-904 LC, and Ganex V 216
   Polymers, respectively, available from ISP Inc. of Wayne, New Jersey. Still other suitable
   waterproofing agents include poly alfa olefin polymers, such as Performa V 825 available from
   New Phase Technologies and polyanhydride resin No. 18 available under the trade name PA- 18
   from Chevron. Additional examples of waterproofing agents are polyurethane polymers. Some
15 such polymers are described, for example, in United States Patent No. 7,097,828.
   An antimicrobial preservative is a substance or preparation which destroys, prevents or inhibits
   the proliferation of, microorganisms in the sunscreen composition, and which may also offer
   protection from oxidation. Preservatives are frequently used to make self-sterilizing, aqueous
20 based products such as emulsions. This is done to prevent the development of microorganisms
   that may grow in the product during the manufacture and distribution of the product and/or
   during use by consumers, who may further inadvertently contaminate the products during normal
   use. Typical preservatives include the lower alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoates (parabens),
   especially methylparaben, propylparaben, isobutylparaben and mixtures thereof, benzyl alcohol,
25 phenyl ethyl alcohol and benzoic acid. The preferred preservative is available under the trade
   name of Germaben II from Sutton or a combination of chlorophenesin and benzyl alcohol. One
   or more antimicrobial preservatives can optionally be included in an amount ranging from about
   0.001 to about 10 weight percent, preferably about 0.05 to about 1 percent.
30 An antioxidant is a natural or synthetic substance added to the sunscreen to protect from or delay
   its deterioration due to the action of oxygen in the air (oxidation) and to protect the skin from
   sun damage. Anti-oxidants prevent oxidative deterioration which may lead to the generation of
   rancidity and nonenzymatic browning reaction products. Typical suitable antioxidants include
   propyl, octyl and dodecyl esters of gallic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, usually
                                                    - 15 -

   purchased as a mixture of ortho and meta isomers), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT),
   nordihydroguaiaretic acid, Oxynex (Oxynex ST liquid is a mixture of diethylhexyl
   syringylidenemalonate and caprylic/capric triglyceride), Vitamin A, Vitamin E and Vitamin C.
   One or more antioxidants can optionally be included in the composition in an amount ranging
 5 from about 0.001 to about 5 weight percent, preferably about 0.01 to about 0.5 percent.
   Chelating agents are substances used to chelate or bind metallic ions, such as with a heterocyclic
   ring structure so that the ion is held by chemical bonds from each of the participating rings.
   Suitable chelating agents include ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), EDTA disodium,
10 calcium disodium edetate, EDTA trisodium, EDTA tetrasodium and EDTA dipotassium. One or
   more chelating agents can optionally be included in the composition in amounts ranging from
   about 0.001 to about 0.2 weight, percent preferably about 0.01% weight percent.
   The inventive formulation may include foam stabilizers or foam stabilizing agents. There are
15 many examples of such agents and means to achieve foam stability. Non-limiting examples of
   suitable foam stabilizers include the Avicels, Capmul S12L, Capmul Sl8L, Amilite GCK-12,
   Amadol CMA-2, Ampholak 7 CX-C, Ampholak X CO-30, Polyox WSR N-10, Amaranth S,
   Foam-Coll 5, Blanose 12M3 1XP, Genu carrageenan, Avanel S150CG and others. Avicel is an
   example that can be used in the formulation. For example, Avicel RC-591 is a mixture of
20 cellulose gum and microcrystalline cellulose. Some foam stabilizers also help improve long term
   high temperature stability.
   Fragrances are aromatic substances which can impart an aesthetically pleasing aroma to the
   skincare or sunscreen composition. Typical fragrances include aromatic materials extracted from
25 botanical sources (i.e., rose petals, gardenia blossoms, jasmine flowers, etc.) which can be used
   alone or in any combination to create essential oils. Alternatively, alcoholic extracts may be
   prepared for compounding fragrances. However, due to the relatively high costs of obtaining
   fragrances from natural substances, the modern trend is to use synthetically prepared fragrances,
   particularly in high-volume products. Both types are considered to be within the scope of the
30 present invention.
   A pH modifier is a compound that will adjust the pH of a formulation to a lower, e.g., more
   acidic pH value, or to a higher, e.g., more basic pH value. The formulations of the present
   invention may contain such pH modifiers as is necessary.

   The present formulation may be used as an after sun formulation. As used herein, an after sun
   emulsion formulation is defined as a formulation that can be administered after a user has been
   in the sun for any amount of time and is a formulation that provides a soothing or healing effect
   that is pleasant to the user. Such a formulation can contain, for instance, aloe vera, vitamins A
10 and E, cooling agents, moisturizers, redness-reducing agents and the like.
   The present formulation may be used as self-tanning composition or for sunless tanning. As used
   herein, the term "sunless-tanning" or "self-tanning compositions" refer to compositions which,
   when applied to human skin, impart thereto an appearance similar to that achieved by exposing
15 the skin to natural or artificial sunlight. Examples of sunless tanning active agents are described
   in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,482,397, 6,261,541, and 6,231,837. Such sunless tanning compositions
   typically comprise, in addition to an artificial tanning effective amount of a self tanning agent,
   effective amounts of a composition coloring agent and a cosmetically acceptable carrier adapted
   for topical application to human skin. The self tanning agents can also include those
20 compositions generally accepted in the art for application to human skin, and which, when so
   applied, react therein with amino acids so as to form pigmented products. Such reactions give the
   skin a brown appearance, similar to the color obtained upon exposing it to sunlight for periods of
   time sufficient to tan the skin. Suitable self tanning agents include, without limitation, alpha
   hydroxy aldehydes and ketones, glyceraldehyde and related alcohol aldehydes, various indoles,
25 imidazoles and derivatives thereof, and various approved pigmentation agents. Presently
   preferred herein as self tanning agents are the alpha-hydroxy aldehydes and ketones. Most
   preferably, the self tanning agent is dihydroxyacetone ("DHA"). Other suitable self tanning
   agents include, without limitation, methyl glyoxal, glycerol aldehyde, erythrulose, alloxan, 2,3
   dihydroxysuccindialdehyde, 2,3-dimethoxysuccindialdehyde, 2-amino-3-hydroxy
30 succindialdehyde and 2-benzylamino-3-hydroxysuccindialdehyde.
   The present invention is not dependent upon any particular formulation technique, it being
   recognized that the choice of specific formulation components may well make necessary some
                                                     - 17 -

 5 The invention will be further described by means of the following examples, which are further
   illustration purposes only and are not intended to limit the invention, as defined by the appended
   claims, in any manner.
   EXAMPLE 1. Skincare Formulation containing C0 2 :             The following ingredients were
10 taken in Parts A-F:
   Part A contained USP Purified water (409.80 g) and Avicel RC-591 (20.0 g).
   Part B contained Disodium EDTA (0.5 g), Ganex P-904 LC (2.0 g) and Sodium ascorbyl
   phosphate (0.1 g).
   Part C contained Avobenzone (30.0 g), Oxybenzone (60.0 g), Prolipid 141 (50.0 g), Octocrylene
15 (100.0 g), Octisalate (50.0 g) and Homosalate (150.0 g).
   Part D contained Chlorphenesin (2.5 g), Vitamin E (DL- alpha tocopherol, 5.0 g), Benzyl alcohol
   (10.0 g), Oxynex ST (10.0 g), Butylene alcohol (40.0 g) and Vitamin A palmitate (0.1 g).
   Part E contained Citric acid (30.0 g).
   Part F contained 30.0 g. of sodium bicarbonate.
20 In a large container, the dry ingredients of Part A were mixed rapidly with the water of Part A
   until free from lumps. The ingredients of Part B were then added and mixed until dispersed and
   then it was heated to about 70-75'C with mixing.
   In a separate container, the ingredients of Part C were mixed together and heated to about 70
   75'C with mixing until dissolved. The heat was turned off and the ingredients of Part D were
25 added to the dissolved Part C and mixed until the chlorphenesin was in solution. There was now
   an oil phase and an aqueous phase. The oil phase was added to the mixture containing Parts A
   and B and mixed until homogeneous. It was cooled to about 45'C and the citric acid of Part E
   was added and mixed until homogeneous. This was Component A.
   Separately sodium bicarbonate of Part F formed Component B.
30 Both components A and B were placed in suitable containers and sealed tightly. The containers
   were selected such that when pressurized, the components of both containers would mix forming
   CO 2 which pressurizes the formulation as a whipped lotion.
                                                   - 18-

   Alternately, the two components A and B were carefully mixed in a suitable single container
   which was then sealed, trapping the CO 2 generated within the container. When pressed, the CO 2
   helped propel the formulation as a whipped lotion.
 5 EXAMPLE 2. Use of Dry Ice instead of bicarbonate and citric acid:          For the dry ice
   example, the formulation of Example 1 (without the citric acid and bicarbonate) was prepared as
   a single component and placed in a pressurizable container and then dry ice was added at about
   1.2% by weight of the formulation. At this point the vessel was quickly sealed before the dry ice
   had a chance to sublime. Citric acid may be included in the formulation without any bicarbonate.
