   Field of the Invention
 5 The present invention relates to food waste management system, and in particular, a
   telematics control system for a food waste management system.
   Background to the Invention
10 The use of renewable energy and the development and adoption of associated green
   technologies is ever-increasing. One renewable energy source, bio methane, is a
   product of biogas. Biogas is usually produced by anaerobic digestion plants, which
   process organic waste, such as food and livestock waste. In an anaerobic digestion
   plant, microorganisms break down organic material (otherwise known as feedstock) to
15 form bio methane and organic fertilizer. Naturally, the continued production of biogas
   relies on the ongoing supply of organic waste. Furthermore, the production of biogas
   is maximised when the calorific content of the food waste stock is optimised to be as
   high as possible.
20 Many businesses dealing with food generate unavoidable food waste. Such waste
   could be, and sometimes is, directed to anaerobic digestion plants. To encourage
   businesses to manage their organic waste for renewable energy purposes (rather than
   sending it to landfill or incineration), systems exist which allow businesses to manage
   the processing of their organic waste before it is delivered to an anaerobic digestion
25 site. It is an aim of the present invention to improve the efficiencies of current systems
   and processes for producing feedstock for biogas production.
   Summary of the Invention

   apparatus comprising means for receiving and storing organic waste, processing
   means configured to process the organic waste into feedstock, and a processor in
   communication with the processing means, wherein the processor is configured to
                                                 1

   determine values of one or more properties of the feedstock using the processing
   means, determine one or more new operational parameters of the processing means
   based on the determined values of the one or more properties of the feedstock, and
   output instructions to the processing means, wherein the instructions are based on the
 5 determined one or more new operational parameters. Advantageously, monitoring of
   the feedstock and adjusting the operation of the apparatus accordingly results in
   efficient feedstock generation and improved feedstock quality.
   According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for

   Detailed Description
   Organic waste management apparatus is apparatus for receiving organic waste,
   processing the waste to generate 'feedstock', monitoring the feedstock and storing the
 5 feedstock until the feedstock is extracted from the apparatus and delivered to a bio
   digestion facility. The main components of an exemplary organic waste management
   system are shown in figure 1.
   The system of Figure 1 shows an organic waste management unit 100 which includes
10 a number of components, the arrangement of which are shown only schematically in
   Figure 1. Unit 100 is a large container which is typically installed at the premises of a
   business which generates food waste. A hopper 101 is located on the side of the unit
   100 and provides an inlet through which food waste can be received by the unit 100.
   The food waste is pulled into a sealed storage tank 102 located within the unit 100
15 where it is processed over time to convert it to a 'soup' of feedstock which ultimately
   produces biogas. The waste fed through hopper 101 is pulled into storage tank 102 via
   macerator    103.   Once   inside  storage tank    102,   the   waste    content is  and
   hydrolysed/homogenised (using hydrolyser/homogeniser 104 of storage tank 102).
   Later references to 'hyrolyser', hydrolysed' or 'hydrolysing' are also intended to refer
20 to homogeniser, homogenised or homogenising respectively. Macerator 103 breaks
   the food into smaller pieces and hydrolyser 104 chums the contents. A vacuum pump
   105 pulls waste through the hopper 101, through to macerator 103 and into the storage
   tank 102. The vacuum pump 105 comprises a carbon filter fitted on the exhaust side
   to minimise odour escaping from the storage tank 102.
25
   When storage tank 102 is full and the food waste has been sufficiently processed into
   feedstock which is optimal for biogas production (as will be discussed in further detail
   below), storage tank 102 is emptied via collection outlet 106. A control unit 107
   located within the unit 100 is configured to monitor, using data from sensors located
30 in storage tank 102, parameters of the feedstock (e.g. its viscosity, volume, specific
   gravity) and is in communication with a remote management system 109. A user
   interface 108 is configured to output user instructions, warning messages, etc., as
   instructed by control unit 107.
                                              3

   Although not shown in figure 1, unit 100 may also comprise an RFID access control
   module in communication with control module 107. The access control module is
   configured to read an RFID tag of an individual, by means that are known in the art.
   The RFID reader on unit 100 is configurable to allow only particular individuals to
 5 carry out waste input and/or feedstock extraction procedures. This allows the control
   module 107 to monitor which individuals are using the machine and how often they
   are using it. This information is typically used for the purposes of periodic usage
   reporting to an owner of the machine or associated business or for troubleshooting or
   billing/invoicing purposes. Control module 107 may also estimate the average amount
10 of waste being input by a particular user into the unit 100 based on a variation in
   readings taken by weight sensor 317 (as discussed further below).
   An overview of a waste management process 200 is shown in figure 2. At step 201,
   unit 100 receives organic waste and processes it into feedstock. When the tank is full
15 and/or parameters of the feedstock meet certain criteria, a notification is sent to
   remote system 109 from control module 107 and the unit 100 is emptied (typically
   into a large transportable tanker) at step 203. It will be appreciated that the contents of
   multiple units 100, located at different places, may be extracted by a single
   transportation tanker. The feedstock is taken to a biodigestion facility at step 204 and
20 is further processed at the biodigestion facility at step 205.
   The system of figure 1 will now be described in further detail with reference to figure
   3. Figure 3 shows a number of sensors 301-305 and 317 which are located either in
   storage tank 102 (not shown) or otherwise within unit 100 (not shown). The sensors
25 301-305 are in communication with controller area network module 306 which is
   located within control module 107 (not shown). Module 306 is also in communication
   with inverters 307-310 which control operation of components of unit 100, as will be
   described in further detail below. PLC 311 is also located within control module 107
   and is configured to receive data from sensor 317 and module 306. PLC 311 can also
30 send data to module 306, such as operating instructions for inverters 307-310. Via
   remote controller 313, modem 314 and GPRS antenna 315 or wifi adaptor 316, data
   can be exchanged wirelessly between remote system 318 and PLC 311.
                                                4

   Vacuum sensor 301 is typically a PM 2655 programmable electronic pressure sensor
   with a range of -0.99 to 4.00 bar (-14.4 to 58.0 PSI). The pressure inside storage tank
   102 is chosen to be lower than atmospheric pressure and sufficient to pull waste
   through hopper 101 and macerator 103. Vacuum sensor 301 is configured to sense
 5 changes to the pressure that are sufficient to jeopardise effective operation to pull
   waste through hopper 101. The determination is sent to the module 306, and, if
   necessary, the vacuum pump 105 is operated to compensate for a change in pressure
   and thus maintain a desired pressure.
10 Level sensor 302 monitors the level (height) of the feedstock within the tank so that it
   can be determined whether the tank is full. Level sensor 302 may be a RM900
   multiturn solid shaft encoder having a resolution of 24 bits/4096 steps per revolution.
   The temperature of the feedstock is measured by temperature sensor 303 which is
   preferably a TA 3131 temperature transmitter sensor (-50 to 150 deg C) with an
15 analogue output of 4-20 milliamps. The temperature of the feedstock is a useful
   indicator of the extent to which it has been processed and therefore its maturity.
   Pressure sensor 304 is typically a PT5404 electronic sensor with a measuring range of
   0-10 bar. Valves within unit 100 are air valves and therefore need to be maintained at
20 an operational pressure. If pressure sensor 304 detects a deviation from operational
   pressure, a compressor (not shown) can be used maintain the pressure required to
   effective operation of the valves.
   Door sensor 305 senses whether the door of hopper 101           is properly shut and is
25 typically a S118-DC8 PNP NO proximity door sensor having a switching distance of
   8mm. If sensor 305 determines that the door to hopper 101 is not properly shut, a
   routine wash cycle to wash hopper 101 and macerator 103 (using pressurized water)
   will be delayed until sensor 305 determines that door is properly closed. Weight
   sensor 317 is preferably a strain gauge load cell and SEM 1600B amplifier and
30 measures the weight of the feedstock in the storage tank 102. The weight of the
   feedstock is used by the PLC 311 to measure its specific gravity.
   Module 306 generally acts as a node to manage the sending of data from the sensors
   to the PLC 311 and the receipt of instructions from the PLC 311 relating to operation
                                               5

   of inverters 307-310. Typically module 306 is a CAN node CR2016, I/O module
   digital and analogue CAN interface with configurable input/output functions. Level
   and temperature sensors 302, 303 are configured to take readings periodically
   (discussed below) and immediately send the readings to module 306 which in turn
 5 passes them to PLC 311. Readings from weight sensor 317 are sent directly to PLC
   311. The vacuum, pressure and door sensors 301, 304 and 305 are configured to sense
   a change in default operating conditions of their respective components and as such
   take readings far more frequently than other sensors.
   Based on instructions from PLC 311 (which may derive from readings from sensors
10 301-305), module 306 can instruct a change in default operation of jetting inverter
   307, macerator inverter 308, hydrolyser inverter 309 and vacuum pump inverter 310.
   For example, if it is determined that a user is attempting to open the door to hopper
   101 during a wash cycle, jetting inverter 307 (which controls output of pressurized
   water) can be controlled accordingly. Macerator inverter 308 controls the driving
15 power of macerator 103. Detection of a significant change in power usage by
   macerator inverter 308 may indicate that macerator 103 is malfunctioning and needs
   to be switched off to facilitate servicing.
   PLC 311 (also located within telematics unit 107) is typically a CR0020 PLC which
20 can program 40 inputs/outputs with configurable functions. An RS232 PC interface
   312 allows for a laptop, for example, to be connected to the PLC 311. This facilitates
   the copying of historical data relating to operation of unit 100 to the laptop such that
   the data can be analysed by an engineer (for example) for diagnostic purposes,
   performance analysis review and the like.
25
   PLC 311 is the processing hub of control module 107. It is configured to analyse the
   data received from sensors 301-305, 317 and issue output instructions based on the
   analysis. If the data received from door, vacuum or pressure sensors 305, 301, 304
   indicate a fault (for example, that the door of the storage tank was not closed securely
30 after a recent maintenance visit, or that the vacuum pump is faulty such that food is
   not been drawn into storage tank 102 from hopper 101) the PLC will control operation
   of the unit 100 accordingly (for example, by powering off various components,
   outputting instructions or warning messages to user interface 108 and/or issuing alert
                                               6

   messages to remote system 318 to schedule a maintenance visit (for example, if wash
   water is below a predetermined level and requires filling) or remote diagnostics
   connection).
 5 PLC 311 is further configured to analyse readings from weight, level and temperature
   sensors 317, 302, 303 and output instructions to hydrolyser inverter 309 based on the
   analysis. PLC 311 is configured to periodically calculate values of viscosity and
   specific gravity of the feedstock using the received sensor data and data from the
   hydrolyser inverter 309, and compare the calculated viscosity value with those in a
10 stored look up table. The look up table comprises a list of values for viscosity and
   hydrolyser frequency     and speed, and is compiled (at least           initially) using
   computational    fluid dynamics.    Thus, the provision of hydrolyser operational
   parameters for a particular value range of viscosity is calculated using predictive
   modelling for how the viscosity will change with hydrolyser speed as the storage tank
15 102 fills up with feedstock (wherein parameters such as the type of waste that will be
   input and the frequency at which food will be provided to the unit 100 is based on the
   location and predicted usage of a specific unit 100). Accordingly, whilst the values in
   look up table are specific to each unit 100, they are based on a priori estimates.   For
   example, a consultation with a user of unit 100 prior to first use of unit 100 by the
20 user may indicate how often, how much, and what type of food waste will be input to
   the particular unit 100. This information allows remote system 318 to determine, in
   conjunction with known information concerning the optimisation of the quality of
   feedstock generally, desired values for viscosity over the course of a cycle to yield
   optimal feedstock which will produce the most biogas. This information in turn also
25 determines the initial default operation of the hydrolyser inverter. However, over
   time, as the unit is used, the remote system 318 is able to build up a more accurate
   description of how a particular unit 100 is being used, which of course may differ
   from that as originally predicted. Remote system 318 can then adjust values in the
   look up table such that processing of the feedstock over time, by virtue of the
30 operation of the hydrolyser 104, is optimised.
   Based on historic data relating to a particular unit 100, remote system 318 is also able
   to predict when storage tank 102 of unit 100 will require emptying. For example, if
   the previous three empty-to-full cycles each took between 9 and 11 days, the remote
                                               7

   system 318 schedules emptying of unit 100 in 10 days from the date storage tank 102
   was previously emptied. As discussed above, the PLC 311 of unit 100 is configured to
   output an alert message to the remote system 318 should the storage tank 102
   approach full and require emptying outside of the scheduled dates/times.
 5
   As will be discussed in further detail below, the power used by hydrolyser inverter to
   drive hydrolyser 104 at a known frequency /speed is measured to determine a value of
   the viscosity of the feedstock using a viscometer. This viscosity value is looked up in
   the look up value to identify the desired operational characteristics, including
10 frequency of rotation and frequency and duration of operation for the hydrolyser 104.
   Operation of the hydrolyser 104 is then adjusted accordingly.             Once PLC 311
   determines, using the look up table, that the feedstock is of optimal quality (i.e. its
   viscosity has reached the desired value), it can issue an alert to indicate that the
   storage tank 102 should be emptied, regardless of whether or not the storage tank 102
15 is full or near-full.
   To aid the breakdown of organic waste, water may be introduced into macerator 103,
   the amount of water depending upon the quantity and type of organic waste.
   Knowledge of the specific gravity of the feedstock is required in order to determine
20 whether the feedstock can and should be emptied and transported to an aerobic
   digestion facility. If the specific gravity of the feedstock is too high, for example, the
   feedstock is too dense to be effectively extracted from storage tank 102. Accordingly,
   although the viscosity of the feedstock (and its level in the tank) is the primary factor
   for determining when storage tank 102 should be emptied, the specific gravity of the
25 feedstock is a secondary factor.
   In addition to managing the data received from the sensors 301-305, 317 and received
   from remote system 318, algorithms of the PLC 311 also monitor, control and log the
   process by which waste is input to and unloaded from the tank. It outputs instructions
30 to the user interface 108 to guide a user through the waste input process and to guide
   waste collection personnel through the emptying process. Furthermore, the PLC 311
   stores data relating to the number of loading operations, number of times the unit has
   been emptied, the changes in the operation of the machine over time, the particular
                                                8

   users of the machine etc, which data is also sent to the remote system 318 for
   subsequent customer reporting.
   Remote system 318 undertakes a variety of functions including storing and collating
 5 calculations of values of parameters of feedstock of multiple different units 100,
   analysing data received from single and multiple units 100, sending firmware
   upgrades to individual units 100, producing reports for customers/users of unit 100,
   outputting instructions concerning maintenance and feedstock collection to an
   organisation responsible for maintenance and/or collection, facilitating remote
10 connection to individual units 100 for remote diagnostic purposes and outputting
   control instructions to individual units 100 (which may override the instructions of
   PLC 311, as will be described in further detail below). Some or all functions of
   remote system 318 may be performed on cloud-based servers.
15 By collectively analysing the values of viscosity and specific gravity of feedstock
   received from the PLCs of multiple units 100, remote system is able to intelligently
   use this information to adjust the operational parameters of an individual unit 100.
   Referring again to Figure 3, PLC 311 transfers data to a controller area network
20 remote controller 313 and onto 3G radio modem 314 for transfer of SMS messages
   and data packages. Remote controller 313 also includes a GPS receiver for location
   tracking. Remote controller 313 is configurable to send the data to remote system 318
   using either GPS/GPRS antenna 315 (if a usable network is available at the location
   of the unit 100) or a controller area network wifi adaptor (if no appropriate network is
25 available). SMS is preferred since messages can be sent and received with a weak
   signal and can be used by networks which span a very large geographical area.
   Advantageously, SMS messages are queued and resent in the case of failure of an
   initial message. Alert, periodic logging, control and location messages adopt a
   specific format to make effective use of the 160 character limit for SMS messages.
30 The format consists of a series of values, commencing with the sending unit's unique
   5 digit serial number, a unique incrementing 6 digit message identifier, followed by a
   single character denoting message type, followed by a series of parameter values,
   followed by a 5 digit checksum and a single digit to denote the end of the message.
   Each parameter value will have a single character denoting the parameter type then
                                               9

   the parameter value. A delimiter (hash) is used between each element of the message
   so that field length can be modified and automatically detected by the position of the
   delimiter.
 5 An overview of the data collection process will now be described with reference to
   Figure 4. The process described in Figure 4 typically occurs within a predetermined
   time period following a loading operation (i.e. completion of the process of a user
   inputting food waste into the unit 100) and at predetermined time intervals thereafter.
   The predetermined time period and interval is set depending on the estimated usage
10 characteristics of a particular unit 100, amongst other reasons. The predetermined
   time period following loading is timed using a countdown timing. If a subsequent
   loading operation occurs within the predetermined time period, the countdown timer
   is reset, and the process of figures 4a and 4b will not start unit the countdown timer
   has reached zero. This is to ensure that the unit 100 is in a stable state.
15
   Step 401 denotes a number of initial automated checks that are made by the PLC 311
   of unit 100. Such initial checks typically include checking whether or not unit 100 is
   in sleep mode (i.e. not hydrolysing the contents of storage tank 102), checking
   whether organic waste is currently being loaded into hopper 101, checking whether
20 storage tank 102 is currently being emptied, and checking whether a washing cycle is
   currently in progress. If the initial checks are satisfied, the process moves to step 402
   whereby the vacuum sensor 301 determines whether or not there is a deviation from
   the system pressure that may require compensation by vacuum pump 105. Assuming
   the system vacuum has not collapsed, pressure sensor 304 determines the air pressure
25 for system values at step 403.
   At step 404, the weight of the feedstock is measured and at step 405 the height level
   of the feedstock in storage tank 102 is measured. Once the vacuum, pressure, weight
   and level sensor readings have been collected and sent to the PLC 311, the PLC 311
30 instructs the hydrolyser to run at a predetermined frequency for 60 seconds. This is
   done so that the torque exerted by the hydrolyser can be calculated by the hydrolyser
   inverter (steps 406 and 407). At step 408, the temperature of the feedstock is
   determined. At step 409, the PLC 311 uses the determined torque to calculate the
   viscosity of the feedstock. As the feedstock becomes more viscous, the hydrolyser
                                                10

   inverter will be required to supply a greater current to maintain a speed of the
   hydrolyser, thereby resulting in higher torque output from its motor. The specific
   gravity of the feedstock is calculated by the PLC 311 using the level and weight
   readings. Specific gravity is an indicator of the solid content within the feedstock. As
 5 mentioned above, a value of specific gravity above a predetermined amount indicates
   that there may be difficulty in emptying the feedstock. If the calculated values of the
   parameters of the feedstock indicate that the quality of the feedstock is optimal, the
   remote system 318 is alerted.
10 The frequency at which the hydrolyser 104 of a particular unit 100 will be driven will
   depend on the type and quantity of organic waste input into unit 100. For example, if
   waste is input infrequently, hydrolyser 104 may need only rotate at a frequency of 60
   rpm for a period of 1 minute every hour in order to effectively process the feedstock
   such that the viscosity of the feedstock is optimal when storage tank 102 is full or near
15 full. Operating hydrolyser 104 more frequently than this may consume unnecessary
   power. For a different unit 100 having different usage characteristics, the duration and
   frequency for which the hydrolyser runs and the frequency at which it is rotated may
   be different.
20 Accordingly, once the PLC has determined the viscosity of the feedstock as a result of
   the data collection process, the PLC 311 compares the calculated values of viscosity
   with a look up table (as discussed above) to determine new operational parameters of
   hydrolyser 104 to optimise feedstock quality. Alternatively or additionally, remote
   system 318, having received the viscosity and specific gravity values of the feedstock,
25 compares the viscosity values to a large data set relating to multiple waste
   management units and determines new operational parameters for hydrolyser 104
   accordingly (as discussed above). When the remote system 318 does determine new
   operational parameters, and such determination coincides with a determination made
   by PLC 311, the associated instructions sent to the PLC 311 from remote system 318
30 may override those generated by the PLC 311 itself.
