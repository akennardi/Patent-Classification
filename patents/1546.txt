                               FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5 This invention relates to treating breast cancer. In particular, the invention
   relates to treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).The invention also
   relates to a method of identifying a compound that treats breast cancer.
10                                   BACKGROUND
   Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Triple
   negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subgroup of breast cancer that represents
   approximately 10-15% of all breast cancers. TNBC is characterized by the
15 absence of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) and
   lack of overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
   Although TNBC patients initially respond to chemotherapy, disease relapses
   occur frequently leading to poor prognosis and shorter overall survival rates.
20 In view of the demand for effectively treating breast cancer in patients,
   particularly TNBC, improvements in methods and compositions that treat
   breast cancer are desired.

                                      SUMMARY
   One example embodiment is a method of treating breast cancer in a person.
   The method includes obtaining a biological sample from a breast of a person;
 5 determining levels of protein kinase N2 (PKN2) expression in the biological
   sample; comparing the level of PKN2 expression in the biological sample with
   a control sample; identifying the person as having the breast cancer if the
   level of PKN2 expression in the biological sample is higher than that of the
   control sample; and administering a therapeutic agent that treats the breast
10 cancer to the person identified as having the breast cancer.
   Another example embodiment is a method of identifying a compound that
   treats breast cancer. The method includes obtaining breast cancer cells that
   overexpress PKN2; contacting a test compound with the breast cancer cells;
15 comparing a level of PKN2 overexpression in the breast cancer cells
   contacted with the test compound to that in breast cancer cells without a
   treatment; and identifying the test compound as the compound that treats
   breast cancer, if the level of PKN2 overexpression in the breast cancer cells
   contacted with the test compound is lower than that of the breast cancer cells
20 without the treatment.
   Other example embodiments are discussed herein.

                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Example embodiments relate to a method of treating breast cancer.
   The method includes obtaining a biological sample from a breast of a person
 5 and determining the levels of protein kinase N2 (PKN2) expression in the
   biological sample, and comparing the level of PKN2 expression in the
   biological sample with a control sample. The method also includes identifying
   the person as having breast cancer if the level of PKN2 expression in the
   biological sample is higher than that of the control sample, and administering
10 a therapeutic agent that treats the breast cancer to the person who has been
   identified as having breast cancer.
   An example embodiment relates to a method of treating triple-negative breast
   cancer (TNBC). In an example embodiment, the biological sample for
15 determining the levels of PKN2 expression are cells or tissues from the
   breast. In an example embodiment, the control sample is from normal cells or
   tissues from a healthy breast.
   Example embodiments relate to a method of identifying a compound that
20 treats breast cancer. The method includes obtaining breast cancer cells that
   overexpress PKN2 and contacting a test compound with the breast cancer
   cells. The method also includes comparing the level of PKN2 overexpression
   in the breast cancer cells contacted with the test compound to breast cancer
   cells that have not had any treatment. The test compound is identified as a
25 compound that treats breast cancer if the level of PKN2 overexpression in the
   breast cancer cells that have been contacted with the test compound is lower
   than that of the breast cancer cells that have not had any treatment.
   An example embodiment relates to a method of identifying a compound that
30 treats TNBC.
   PKN2 is a member of protein kinase C-related serine/threonine-protein kinase
   and Rho/Rac effector protein that participates in specific signal transduction
   responses in the cell. PKN2 plays important roles in cellular processes,
                                            4

   including cell cycle progression, actin cytoskeleton assembly, cell adhesion,
   tumor cell migration and invasion and apoptosis. PKN2 was highly expressed
   in TNBC cell lines and knocking down PKN2 by lentivirus-mediated short
   hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly reduced colony formation and in vivo
 5 xenograft growth of TNBC cells. This indicates that PKN2 is important to the
   survival of TNBC cells.
   The following experiments and data show that PKN2 can be used in the
   treatment of breast cancer, and in the identification of a compound that treats
10 breast cancer.
   Example 1
   1.1 Procedure
   1.1.1   Cell culture
15 Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HCC1 937, MDA-MB-468,
   MCF7, ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453 (Cell Bank of the Chinese
   Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were cultured in 1640 medium
   (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Pen Strep
   Glutamine (10OX, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10,000 mg/ml streptomycin and
20 29.2 mg/ml L-Glutamine) (Gibco).
   1.1.2 In vitro cell proliferation assay (sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay)
   The anti-proliferative effects of tested chemicals on breast cancer cell lines
   were assessed by sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay. Cells were
25 seeded in 96-well plates at a volume of 100pl/well at densities of
   5,000~40,000 cells per well. After overnight incubation at 37 0C in a humidified
   incubator with 5% C02, 100 pl medium containing chemicals (2 X indicated
   concentrations) were added. After treatment for 72 hours, attached cells were
   fixed with 50pl cold 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 1 hour at 40C and
30 then stained with 100pl 0.4% (w/v) SRB. The absorbency at 515 nm was
   measured using SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) after
   solubilizing the protein-bound dye with    2 00pl 10mM Tris base solution (pH
   10.5). The IC5o value was defined as the concentration required for a 50%
   reduction in cell growth.
                                             5

   1.1.3 Colony Formation Assay
   Cells were selected with puromycin for 3 days after lentivirus transduction.
   The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), plated in
 5 drug-free medium in 6-well plates at densities of 1,000 cells/well and
   incubated for 7-10 days. Colonies were stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet
   in buffered formalin for 10 minutes. The number of colonies was then counted.
   1.1.4 Lentivirus mediated gene knockdown
10 The following double strand oligos (only sense strands indicated) were cloned
   into the pLKO.1 plasmid at Agel and EcoRI sites and sequence verified before
   use. shPKN2:
   5'
   CCGGGTCCACGTCAAAGTATGATATCTCGAGATATCATACTTTGACGTGG
15 ACTTTTTG-3'.
   A MISSION non-target short hairpin RNA (shRNA) control vector served as
   the scrambled control (Sigma-Aldrich, SH002). Lentivirus were produced by
   cotransfection of 293T cells with the above constructs and the MISSION
   packing mix (Sigma-Aldrich) using FuGENE HD transfection reagent
20 (Promega). Cells were incubated with lentivirus for 24 hours before selection
   with puromycin (Gibco). Gene knockdown was confirmed by western blotting
   analysis.
   1.1.5 Retrieval of gene expression data from CCLE database
25 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data on breast cancer cell lines was
   used to compare messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of triple-negative
   breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC cells. The log2 ratio of TNBC cell lines
   (n=26) versus non-TNBC cell lines (n=30) was analyzed using GENE-E and
   Prism software.
30
   1.1.6 Quantitative real-time PCR
   Cellular mRNA was purified by binding to poly(dT) magnetic beads (Dynal)
   and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) in accordance with
   the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
                                           6

   reaction (PCR) was performed in duplicate three times using SYBR Green
   (Molecular Probes) on the ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
   Biosystems). Data were expressed as relative mRNA levels normalized to the
   eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EIF3S5 or TIF) expression level in each
 5 sample.
   1.1.7 Western blotting
   Protein samples were prepared by adding radioimmunoprecipitation assay
   (RIPA) buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) to cells and diluted in
10 sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
   protein sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 minutes at 95 0 C before
   fractionation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred
   to Immobilon P (Millipore) and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at
   4C. The membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated with the
15 appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room
   temperature. Proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Extended
   Duration Substrate or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
   (Thermo Scientific).
20 1.1.8 Xenograft assay
   4-6 week old female nude mice were subcutaneously injected in both hind
   limbs with 2x1 06 cells resuspended in 100pl PBS. Tumors were measured by
   digital caliper and volumes were calculated using the following equation,
   volume = (width2 x length)/2. The protocols for animal studies were approved
25 by the Division of Animal Control and Inspection of the Department of Food
   and Animal Inspection and Control, Macau, and the Animal Care and Use
   Committee (ACUC) of the Macau University of Science and Technology.
   1.1.9 Statistical Analysis
30 Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Data are shown as
   mean ± standard deviation (SD) and the statistical significance was
   determined by two-tailed Student's t-test.
                                             7

   1.2 Results
   The mRNA level of PKN2 in quantitative real-time breast cancer cells
   including four non-triple-negative breast cancer (non-TNBC) cell lines (MCF7,
   ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453) and four triple-negative breast cancer
 5 (TNBC) cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468) was
   measured and is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows a graph 100 illustrating
   the relative PKN2 mRNA values in the non-triple-negative breast cancer cell
   lines (non-TNBC) and in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines.
   Figure 1 shows that PKN2 mRNA level was higher in all four TNBC cell lines
10 than non-TNBC cell lines , with PKN2 mRNA levels being only slightly higher
   MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with non-TNBC cells.
   Figure 2 shows a western blot analysis 200 of PKN2 in the four non-TNBC
   cell lines (MCF7, ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453) and four TNBC cell
15 lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468). Figure 2 further
   confirms a higher PKN2 expression level in TNBC cell lines compared to non
   TNBC cell lines.
   Figure 3 shows a graph 300 illustrating the relative mRNA expression levels
20 (log2) of PKN2 in non-TNBC cell lines and TNBC cell lines. The gene
   expression profile data in figure 3 of PKN2 in 56 human breast cancer cell
   lines, including 26 TNBC cell lines and 30 non-TNBC cell lines was from the
   Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database. Figure 3 showed that PKN2
   expression was significantly increased in the TNBC cell lines compared to
25 non-TNBC cell lines.
   Figure 4 shows a western blot analysis 400 after transduction of MDA-MB-231
   cells with nonspecific short hairpin RNA (shNS) or PKN2-specific lentivirus
   (shPKN2).
30
   Figure 5 shows colony formation assay plates and a graph 500 illustrating the
   effect of PKN2 knockdown on colony formation of non-TNBC and TNBC cell
   lines. In order to test whether PKN2 was required to support the growth of
   TNBC cells, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted against PKN2 was stably
                                           8

   introduced. Colony formation of TNBC cell lines and non-TNBC cell lines were
   examined. Figure 5 showed that knocking down PKN2 in TNBC cell lines
   significantly decreased colony formation. Figure 5 also showed that there
   were no obvious changes in colony formation in all four non-TNBC cell lines
 5 after PKN2 knockdown. Figure 5 shows that PKN2 expression is essential for
   TNBC cell growth in vivo.
   Figure 6 shows xenograft pictures and a graph 600 illustrating the effect of
   PKN2 knockdown on xenograft formation of TNBC MD-MB-231 cells and non
10 TNBC ZR-75-1 cells. In order to test whether increased PKN2 expression in
   TNBC cell lines is also necessary for cell growth, a xenograft assay was
   performed. TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 and non-TNBC cell line ZR-75-1
   were first transduced with either nonspecific shRNA or PKN2-specific
   lentivirus and were then injected into contra-lateral hind limbs of athymic nude
15 mice with equal number of cells. PKN2 deficiency did not change xenograft
   formation of non-TNBC cell line ZR-75-1 but significantly decreased the
   growth of TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Both the in vitro colony formation
   assay and the in vivo xenograft assay after PKN2 knockdown underscored
   PKN2's important role in supporting TNBC cell growth.
20
   The examples above demonstrate that PKN2 is highly expressed in TNBC
   cells, and suppression of PKN2 by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA
   (shRNA) significantly decreased colony formation and xenograft growth of
   TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines.
