   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to the use of 1,2-polyunsaturated fatty acid derivatives as
10 medicaments, preferably for the treatment of diseases whose etiology is based on alterations
   of cell membrane lipids, such as: changes in the levels, in the composition or structure of these
   lipids and proteins that interact with them; as well as in the treatment of diseases where the
   regulation of lipid composition and membrane structure, as well as of proteins that interact
   with them with the result of reversion a of pathological state.
15 Thus, the present invention, because of its wide range of application, is likely to be generally
   included in the field of medicine and pharmacy.
   STATE OF THE ART
   Cell membranes are structures that define the organization of cells and the organelles they
   contain. Most biological processes occur in or around membranes. Lipids not only have a
20 structural role, but also regulate the activity of important processes. Moreover, the regulation
   of the membrane lipid composition also influences the location or function of important
   proteins involved in controlling the cell's physiology, such as G proteins or PKC (Escribi et
   al., 1995, 1997, Yang et al, 2005, Martinez et al., 2005). These and other studies demonstrate
   the importance of lipids in controlling important cellular functions. In fact, many human
25 diseases   such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative         diseases, obesity,
   metabolic disorders, processes and inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases or autoimmune
   diseases, among others, have been associated with alterations in the levels or the composition
   of lipids in biological membranes, further demonstrating the beneficial effects that treatments
   with fatty acids could be used to reverse these diseases, in addition to those of the present
30 invention, which regulate the composition and structure of membrane lipids (Escribi, 2006).
   The lipids consumed in the diet regulate the lipid composition of cell membranes (Alemany et
   al., 2007). In addition, various physiological and pathological situations can change lipids in
   cell membranes (Buda et al., 1994; Escribi, 2006). As an example of a situation that induces
   physiological changes in membrane lipids it may be mentioned the fish living in rivers with
35 variable temperature, whose lipids undergo important changes (changes in the quantity and

                                                  2
   types of membrane lipids) when the temperature goes down from 20"C (summer) to 4"C
   (winter) (Buda et al. 1994). These changes allow the maintenance of their functions in cell
   types of diverse nature. Examples of pathological processes that may influence the lipid
   composition are neurological disorders or drug-induced diseases (Rapoport, 2008). Therefore,
 5 one could say that membrane lipids can determine correct activity of multiple mechanisms of
   cell signalling.
   Changes in membrane lipid composition affect cell signalling and may lead to development of
   disease or to reverse them (Escribi, 2006). Various studies over the past few years indicate
   that membrane lipids play a more relevant role than they had been assigned so far (Escribi et
10 al., 2008). The classical view of the cell membrane assigns to lipids a purely structural role, as
   a support for membrane proteins, which are supposed to be the only functional elements of the
   membrane. The plasma membrane would have an additional role, avoiding water, ions and
   other molecules from entering into the cells. However, membranes have other functions of
   great importance in the maintenance of health, disease occurrence and healing. Since the body
15 is sick because their cells are sick, alterations in membrane lipids produce alterations in cells
   and these can lead to the occurrence of diseases. Similarly, therapeutic, nutraceutical or
   cosmetic interventions, aimed at the regulation of the levels of membrane lipids can prevent
   and reverse (cure) pathological processes. In addition, numerous studies indicate that
   consumption of saturated and trans-monounsaturated fats is related to the deterioration of
20 health. In addition to the neurological diseases described above, vascular diseases, cancer and
   others have also been directly associated with membrane lipids (Stender and Dyerberg, 2004).
   The deterioration of an organism is manifested in the appearance of this and other types of
   diseases, which may include metabolic diseases, inflammation, neurodegeneration, etc.
   Cell membranes are the selective barrier through which a cell receives metabolites and
25 information from other cells and the extracellular environment that surrounds it. However,
   membranes develop other very import functions in cells. On the one hand, they serve as a
   support for proteins involved in receiving or initiating messages that control important organic
   functions. These messages, which are mediated by many hormones, neurotransmitters,
   cytokines, growth factors, etc., do activate membrane proteins (receptors), which propagate
30 the received signal into the cell through other proteins (peripheral membrane proteins), some
   of which are also located at the membrane. Since (1) these systems work as amplification
   cascades, and (2) membrane lipids can regulate the localization and activity of these
   peripheral proteins, the lipid composition of membranes can have a major impact on cell's

                                                 3
   physiology. In particular, the interaction of certain peripheral proteins, such as G proteins,
   protein kinase C, Ras protein, etc., with the cell membrane depends on its lipid composition
   (Vogler et al., 2004, Vogler et al., 2008). Furthermore, the lipid composition of cell
   membranes is influenced by the type and amount of lipids in the diet (Escribi et al., 20 03). In
 5 fact, nutraceutical or pharmaceutical lipid interventions can regulate the lipid composition of
   membranes, which in turn can control the interaction (and hence the activities) of important
   cell signalling proteins (Yang et al., 2005).
   The fact that membrane lipids are able to control cell signalling, may also suppose that they
   are able to regulate the physiological status of cells and therefore the general state of health. In
10 fact, both negative and positive effects of lipids on health have been described (Escribi et al.,
   2006; Escribi et al., 2008). Preliminary studies have shown that 2-hydroxyoleic acid, a
   monounsaturated fatty acid, is able to reverse certain pathological processes such as
   overweight, hypertension or cancer (Alemany et al., 2004, Martinez et al., 2005; Vogler et al,
   2008).
15 Cardiovascular diseases are often associated with excessive proliferation of cells that
   constitute the heart and vascular tissues. This hyperproliferation results in cardiovascular
   deposits in the inner lumen of vessels and cavities of the cardiovascular system resulting in a
   wide range of diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia, aneurysms, ictus,
   infarction, angina, stroke (cerebrovascular accidents) etc. (Schwartz et al., 1986). In fact, it
20 has been suggested that the development of drugs that prevent cell proliferation would be a
   good alternative for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (Jackson and
   Schwartz, 1992).
   Obesity is caused by an altered balance between intake and energy expenditure, in part due to
   alterations in the mechanisms regulating these processes. On the other hand, this condition is
25 characterized by hyperplasia (increase in cell number) or hypertrophy (increased size) of fat
   cells, adipocytes. Numerous studies show that fatty acids either free or as part of other
   molecules, may influence a number of parameters related to energy homeostasis, such as body
   fat mass, lipid metabolism, thermogenesis and food intake, among others (Vogler et al., 2008).
   In this sense, the modification of fatty acids could be a strategy to regulate energy
30 homeostasis, i.e., the balance between intake and energy expenditure, and therefore related
   processes such as appetite or body weight.

                                                  4
   Neurodegenerative processes lead to a number of diseases with different manifestations, but
   with the common characteristic of being caused by degeneration or dysfunction of the central
   and/or peripheral nervous system cells. Some of these neurodegenerative processes involve a
   significant reduction in the cognitive ability of patients or alterations of their motor ability.
 5 Neurodegenerative, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders have a common basis of
   neuronal degeneration or alteration of its components, such as lipids (e.g., myelin) or
   membrane proteins (e.g., adrenergic, serotonergic receptors, etc.). Such central nervous
   system diseases include, among others, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple
   sclerosis, ALS, sclerosis of the hippocampus and other types of epilepsy, focal sclerosis,
10 adrenoleukodystrophy      and other leukodystrophy, vascular         dementia,   senile dementia,
   headaches including migraine, central nervous system trauma, sleep disorders, dizziness, pain,
   stroke (cerebrovascular accidents), depression, anxiety, or addictions. Furthermore, certain
   neurological and neurodegenerative diseases may lead to processes that end up in blindness,
   hearing problems, disorientation, altered mood, etc.
15 An example of well-characterized          neurodegenerative disorder is Alzheimer's disease,
   characterized by the formation of senile plaques, composed of membrane protein fragments
   (eg p-amiloyd peptide) originated from a wrong peptide processing, followed by an
   accumulation on the outside of the cells, and neurofibrillary tangles of Tau protein. This
   process has been associated with alterations in the metabolism of cholesterol and the
20 consequent alteration of the levels of certain membrane lipids such as cholesterol and
   docosahexaenoic acid (Sagin and Sozmen, 2008, Rapoport, 2008). In addition, several
   neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia
   (or Lewy bodies) have been associated with pathological accumulation of fibrillar aggregates
   of the c-synuclein protein, which lead to a significant alteration of the cellular metabolism of
25 triglycerides   (Coles   et  al.,  2001).   In   fact, the development      of these    and  other
   neurodegenerative diseases is associated with alterations in serum or cell lipids, such as
   cholesterol, triglycerides, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, etc. This again suggests
   that lipids play a crucial role in the correct activity of neurons, nerves, brain, cerebellum and
   spinal cord, which is logical given the abundance of lipids in the central nervous system. The
30 molecules of this invention have a high or very high potential to reverse many of the processes
   associated with neurological, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Moreover, different types of sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases related to the
   "demyelination", whose net result is the loss of lipids on the cover of the neuronal axons, with

                                                 5
   consequent changes in the process of propagation of electrical signals that this involves.
   Myelin is a fatty layer that surrounds the axons of many neurons and that is formed by a series
   of spiral folds of the plasma membrane of glial cells (Schwann cells). Therefore, it's clear that
   lipids play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, it
 5 was found that unmodified natural PUFAs have a moderate preventive effect on the
   development of neurodegenerative processes (Lane and Farlow, 2005). In fact, the most
   important lipid in the central nervous system is docosahexaenoic acid, a natural PUFA and
   whose abundance is altered in many neurodegenerative processes.
   Metabolic diseases form a group of diseases characterized by the accumulation or deficit of
10 certain molecules. A typical example is accumulation of glucose, cholesterol and/or
   triglycerides above normal levels. The increased levels of glucose, cholesterol and/or
   triglycerides, both systemic (e.g., increased plasma levels) and at cellular level (e.g., in cell
   membranes) is associated with alterations in cell signalling leading to dysfunction at various
   levels, and are usually due to errors in the activity of certain enzymes or to the inadequate
15 control     of   such    proteins. Among      the  most    important    metabolic    disease    are
   hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides). These
   diseases have higher rates of incidence, morbidity and mortality, so their treatment is a
   necessity of first order. Other important metabolic diseases include diabetes and insulin
   resistance, characterized by problems in the control of glucose levels. These metabolic
20 diseases are involved in the occurrence of other diseases, like cancer, hypertension, obesity,
   atherosclerosis, etc. Recently, it has been defined another disease process closely related to
   metabolic disorders described above and which could constitute a new type of metabolopathy
   per se, it is the metabolic syndrome.
   The protective role of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on certain diseases has
25 been described by different researchers. For example, PUFAs slow the development of cancer
   and    have     positive   effects against    the  development      of   cardiovascular   disease,
   neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, obesity, inflammation, etc. (Trombetta et al.,
   2007, Jung et al., 2008, Florent et al., 2006). These stimuli indicate the important role of lipids
   (PUFA) in both the etiology of various diseases and in its treatment. However, the
30 pharmacological activity of these compounds (PUFA) is very limited due to rapid metabolism
   and short half-life in blood. Therefore it seems necessary to develop PUFAs with a slower
   metabolism, which results in an increased presence in the cell membrane compared to the
   PUFAs used up to now, facilitating the interaction of cell signalling peripheral proteins. The

                                                 6
   molecules of this invention are synthetic derivatives of PUFAs, have a slower metabolism and
   a marked and significantly superior therapeutic effect compared to the natural PUFAs.
   Because of the relationship between structural and functional alterations of lipids located in
   the cell membrane with the development of various diseases of different typology, but with an
 5 etiology unitarily related to structural and/or functional alteration of lipids in membrane cells,
   such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammation, neurodegenerative and
   metabolic diseases, the present invention focuses on the use of new synthetic polyunsaturated
   fatty acids able to solve the technical problems associated with known fatty acids mentioned
   above and therefore, they are useful for treating these diseases effectively.
10
   DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   Brief description of the invention
   This invention is focused on 1,2-derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids (hereinafter: D
15 PUFAs) for use in the treatment of common diseases whose etiology is related to structural
   and/or functional alterations of cell membrane lipids, or of the proteins that interact with them,
   particularly selected from: cancer, vascular diseases, neurodegenerative and neurological
   disorders, metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, obesity and overweight. D-PUFAs have
   a lower metabolic rate than natural polyunsaturated fatty acids (hereinafter: PUFA), because
20 the presence of different atoms other than hydrogen (H) at carbons 1 and/or 2 blocks its
   degradation through p-oxidation. This causes significant changes in the composition of
   membranes, regulating the interaction of cell signalling peripheral proteins. This may lead to,
   for example, differences in the packaging of the surface of the membrane, modulating the
   anchoring of peripheral proteins that participate in the propagation of cellular messages. Thus,
25 the D-PUFA molecules that are the subject of this invention have an activity much greater
   than the PUFAs, showing significantly higher effect for the pharmacological treatment of the
   identified diseases.
   As mentioned above, the diseases treated with the D-PUFA molecules of the invention share

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
Figure 1. Effect of compounds in Table 1 on tumour cell growth. On the y axis it is
represented the number of viable cells (% control) depending on the compound used (x-axis).
Human lung cancer (A549) cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% serum for 48 hours
in the absence (control) or presence of 250   M of the compounds of the invention. The graph
represents the number of viable cells (mean and standard error of the mean of three
experiments). The dotted line represents the total elimination of cells (0% viability).
Figure 2. Effect of certain PUFAs and D-PUFA molecules of the present invention on the
proliferation of A10 vascular cells. On the y axis it is represented the number of cells (%

complete medium (control, C), incomplete medium without supplement (CSS) or complete

   medium in the presence of PUFAs (182, 183A, 183G, 204, 205 and 226) or D-PUFAs
   (182A1, 183A1, 183A2, 204A1, 205A1 and 226A1). The reduction of proliferation, but still
   above the values of CSS, indicates that these molecules have the capacity to regulate abnormal
   proliferation of cardiovascular cells without being toxic.

   axis the compounds used in the treatment of experimental animals. In the X axis, from left to
   right, it is represented first the treatment with vehicle (C) and then, the treatment with several
   of the compounds of the invention. SHR rats were treated for one month with 200 mg/kg of
   each one or of the 24 compounds shown in the Figure. Each experimental group consisted of
15 six animals and for each series a group of animals treated with vehicle (water) was used, and
   results were compared with the weight of the animals that had not received any treatment. The
   letters A, B, N and P indicate the combination of radicals R1 and R 2 according to Table 3.
   Figure 4
   A. Death of P19 cells cultured in the absence of external factors (control, C: 0% neuronal
20 death) and in the presence of NMDA (100% neuronal death). On the vertical axis it is
   represented the neuronal death (% of control) depending on the fatty acid used (x-axis). The
   presence of PUFAs induced modest increases in the survival of P19 cells in the presence of
   NMDA. D-PUFAs induced significant increases in cell survival values, exceeding in more
   than 200% in the case of 226A1. Since the number of cells in cultures treated cells is higher
25 than in control cells, it may be affirmed that these compounds not only prevent neuronal death
   induced by NMDA (anti-neurodegenerative) but also are neuroregenerative agents.
   B. Effect of D-226B1 PUFA in improving exercise performance in the radial maze in an
   animal model of Alzheimer's disease. In the Y axis of the left figure it is shown the time taken
   to complete the exercise and in the vertical Y axis of the right figure the total number of errors
30 made in the implementation of programmed exercise (mean ± standard error of the mean)
   (runtime). In both figures, from left to right, it is represented in the X axis the results in
   healthy mice (control) (first column), in mice with induced Alzheimer and treated with water

   as vehicle (second column) or in mice treated with the compound 226B1 (third column).
   Animals with Alzheimer's disease took longer and made more errors than healthy mice, being
   the differences statistically significant (*, P <0.05). By contrast, mice with Alzheimer that
   were treated with the compound 226 BI showed no significant differences with healthy
 5 animals.

30 determinated (average effect of each lipid in all disease models studied and the number of
   double bonds) and it is plotted against the transition temperature. The reduction in HU
   transition temperature indicates a greater induction of membrane discontinuities, which results

   in the presence of anchoring sites in the membrane for peripheral proteins and leads to better
   regulation of cell signalling and, therefore, more effective for the control of certain diseases.

 5 change with respect to control %) depending on the number of double bonds presented by
   each molecule (horizontal axis). In both cases the correlations were significant (P <0.05). It
   was observed that the therapeutic effect depends on the number of double bonds that the
   molecule has, which in turn is related to the ability to regulate the membrane structure. In this
   sense, the presence of a radical in carbons 1 and 2, present in D-PUFAs, but not in PUFAs, is
10 essential to enhance the therapeutic effect of these molecules.
   These results indicate that the effects of lipids contained in this invention have a common
   basis. These correlations (with r2 values of 0.77 and 0.9 for D-PUFAs and P <0.05 in both
   cases) clearly indicate that the structure of the lipids used is the basis of its effect and that it
   occurs through the regulation of membrane structure, caused by the structure-function
15 relationship of each lipid. In fact, there is a number of research works in which human
   diseases are associated with alterations described above in the levels of PUFAs, demonstrating
   the important role of lipids in cellular physiology.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
20 The broad spectrum of therapeutic applications offered by D-PUFA molecules of the present
   invention leads to widely assume that these D-PUFA molecules confer the membranes with
   specific structural properties that allow the proper processing of the activity carried out in and
   through these membranes. In other words, many of the abnormalities that give rise to different
   kinds of diseases are caused by significant variations in the levels of certain important lipids
25 for cell function and/or of proteins that interact with membranes and/or are related to
   production of lipids. These pathological changes that may lead to different kinds of diseases
   can be prevented or reversed by synthetic fatty acids described in this invention, which can be
   effectively used to treat or prevent any disease whose etiology is related either to alterations in
   levels, composition, structure, or any other alteration of the biological membrane lipids or
30 with a deregulation of cell signalling as a result of these changes in these lipids in biological
   membranes. Additionally, the lipids contained in this invention can also be used as medicines

   when a disease occurs as a result of another change, as long as the result of modulation of the
   properties and/or membrane functions is able to reverse the pathological process.
   For this study of the therapeutic effects of the fatty acids of this invention, cultured cell lines
   and animal models of various diseases were used and the activity of D-PUFAs and PUFAs to
 5 treat different diseases was investigated.
   The structure of the molecules of the invention is shown in the Tables 1, 2 and 3. Given the
   Formula I, compounds of the present invention preferably present combinations of the values
   of a, b and c shown in Table 1.
   In addition, in the invention the compounds are named with a three digit number followed by
10 the symbol X1 or X2. The number 1 denotes all D-PUFAs used, except the series based on
   C18:3 o-6 (y-linolenic acid), which appear under number 2. The first two digits of this
   number represent the number of carbons of the molecule. The third digit of that number
   represents the number of double bonds. The letter X is replaced by any of the letters from A to
   W (Table 3), these letters A to W to represent the specific combination of R, and R2 of
15 Formula I.
   Thus, particularly preferred compound of this invention are identified under abbreviations:
   182X1, 183X1, 183X2, 204X1, 205X1, 226X1 and should be interpreted according to the
   above directions.

   EXAMPLES
 5 Example 1. Percentage of total PUFAs in membranes of cells treated with D-PUFAs and
   PUFAs
   Synthetic D-PUFA molecules are hydrophobic, and therefore cells exposed to these D-PUFAs
   have high levels of these fatty acids on their surfaces.
   Table 4 shows the total percentage of PUFAs in membranes of 3T3 cells treated with 100 tM
10 of these fatty acids for 48 hours. To perform these experiments, membranes were extracted
   and total fatty acids were obtained by hydrolysis in basic medium. Methanolic bases of these
   fatty acids were quantified by gas chromatography. The data shown are averages of four
   independent measures of PUFA's mass divided by the total fatty acids and expressed as a
   percentage. It is also shown is standard error of the mean. In cell cultures, 3T3 cells incubated
15 in the presence of these fatty acids showed higher levels of PUFAs (including D-PUFAs) and
   lower levels of saturated fatty acids.
   The control corresponds to a culture without the presence of added natural or synthetic fatty
   acids. Cells in their natural form present PUFAs in their membranes, but the presence in the
   medium of the D-PUFA molecules of the invention increases these levels of PUFAs in the cell

   membrane. Therefore these results suggest that nutraceutical or pharmaceutical interventions
   of these compounds of the present invention can effectively regulate the composition of the
   cell membranes.

   Example      2.   L    (lamellar)-to-HI,    (hexagonal)     transition  in  DEPE      (dielaidoil
   phosphatidylethanolamine) cell membranes
   Tables 5 and 6 show the lamellar-to-hexagonal (H11) transition temperature in DEPE model
   membranes. The transition temperature was determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry.
10 The proportion DEPE:D-PUFA was 10:1 (mol:mol) in all cases. Lamellar-to-hexagonal
   transition is an important parameter that reflects relevant signalling properties of cell
   membranes. The propensity to form Hu1 phases, which is higher as the temperature of this
   transition lowers indicates that the membrane surface pressure is lower, meaning that the polar
   heads of phospholipids form a less dense or compact network that those formed by lamellar
15 structures (Escribi et al., 2008). When this occurs, certain peripheral membrane proteins (such
   as G proteins, protein kinase C or Ras protein) can more easily bind to the membrane, while
   others have a poor interaction (e.g., the Ga-protein), so changes in the HI, transition
   temperature are important in regulating cellular functions related to health and human therapy
   (Escriba et al., 1995, Vogler et al., 2004; Escriba, 2006).
20 Control values correspond to model membranes in the absence of fatty acids. The reduction in
   HI, transition temperature obtained by using the D-PUFA of the invention indicates an
   increased induction of membrane discontinuities, generating anchoring sites in the membrane
   for peripheral proteins and leads to better regulation of cell signalling and, therefore, greater
   effectiveness in the control of certain diseases.

   Thus Table 5 shows the transition temperature TH (hexagonal lamellar to H11) in membranes
   of DEPE (4 mM) in the presence or absence of 200 iM of various compounds of the present
   invention of the series A.

10 Example 3. Binding of Gii protein (trimer)to a model cell membrane
   The regulation of the membrane lipid composition resulted in changes in membrane structure,
   as measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, which causes variations in the localization
   of G proteins in model cell membranes as shown in Table 7. The net result is a regulation of
   cell signalling leading to the reversal of various pathological processes, as shown later. Table
15 7    shows    the  binding    of   heterotrimeric    Gii    protein  to   model  membranes    of
   phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine         (6:4,   mol:mol)   measured  by  centrifuge
   analyses, followed by immunoblotting, visualization by chemiluminescence and quantified by

   image analysis. For these experiments it was used 2 mM phospholipid and 0.1 pM of the
   different D-PUFAs indicated in Table 7. The Control is a sample of model membranes in the
   absence of fatty acids.
   These results indicate that the modification induced in the structural and functional properties
 5 of the membrane increases as the number of unsaturations increases. Both the presence of
   unsaturations and the changes in carbons 1 and 2 reduce the rate of metabolism of PUFAs.
   This fact, in relation with the particular effect of these lipids on the membrane structure,
   indicates that the action on the abnormal cells share a common origin.
   In fact, there was a good correlation between the pharmacological effect and the effect they
10 have on the lipid membrane structure.

   Example 4. Use of 1,2-PUFA derivatives for the treatment of cancer
   Cancer is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of transformed cells. As
15 indicated above, in addition to certain genetic alterations, cancer is characterized by the
   presence of altered levels of membrane lipids that may influence cell signalling. In this sense,
   the natural PUFAs showed some efficacy against the development of human cancer cells
   (A549) at the concentrations used in this study, although its metabolic use probably prevented
   a greater efficacy (Figure 1). However, D-PUFAs showed a marked and significantly higher
20 efficacy than the unmodified molecules at carbons 1 and 2 (Figure 1 and Table 8) at the same
   concentrations. These results indicate that the changes on natural polyunsaturated fatty acids
   results in molecules with strong anti-tumour potency and significantly greater than that of
   natural PUFAs and therefore have great utility in the treatment and prevention of tumour
   diseases through pharmaceutical and nutraceutical approaches in humans and animals.

   For the experiments shown in Figure 1, cultured human Non Small Cell Lung Cancer cells
   (A549) in RPMI 1640 were used, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and antibiotics,
   at 37'C and 5% CO 2. Cells were maintained in culture for 48 hours in the presence or absence
   of D-PUFAs and PUFAs indicated in Table 2 at a concentration of 250 PM. After treatment,
 5 cell count was performed and the study of the mechanisms involved in the antitumor activity
   of compounds was evaluated by flow cytometry. Figure 1 shows the percentage of cell
   survival (being assigned 100% to the untreated tumour cells). These values correspond to
   averages of three independent experiments.
   In a separate series, compounds listed in Table 3 were used against different tumour types
10 shown in Tables 8A, 8B and 8C. These charts show the antitumor efficacy of the compounds
   of this invention against the growth of breast cancer cells, brain (glioma), and lung cancer.
   Efficacy data are expressed as IC 5 0 values (values of pM concentration which produce death
   in 50% of tumour cells) after 72 hours of incubation. The other experimental conditions are
   identical to those described in the preceding paragraph.
15 The results clearly indicate that all D-PUFAs are highly effective against tumour
   development. Overall, it may be seen that the series of compounds A and B are the best, so the
   effectiveness of these series against the development of leukaemia and liver cancer (Tables 9
   and 10) was tested. Also, it can be argued that the compounds of the series 204 and 226, i.e.,
   numbered D-PUFAs with the pair number of instaurations higher in size, are most effective.
20 These results indicate the existence of a structure-function relationship in the pharmacological
   activity of the present invention, which also goes in favour of the thesis of a common
   mechanism of action related to the structure of each compound and, therefore, of the unity of
   invention in this section.

25 breast cancer cells MDA-MB-23 1, expressed in micromolar IC50 values.

   All these results indicate that the D-PUFAs are useful for the prevention and treatment of
   cancer included in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical compositions in humans and animals. It
10 was also found that the potency of action of D-PUFA is correlated with the increased number
   of double bonds and that the presence of changes in carbon 1 and 2 is essential for the
   antitumor potency of the lipids to be relevant at therapeutic level. Because these compounds
   have anti-tumour effect against a wide range of tumour cells, it may be affirmed that they are
   molecules with broad anti-tumour spectrum and may be of general application against the
15 development of any cancer.
   Example 5. Use of 1,2-PUFA derivatives for the treatment of cardiovascular disease
   To investigate the usefulness of the D-PUFA for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases,
   several experimental approaches were used. First, the efficacy of the compounds of the
20 invention in aorta cells in culture (cell line A-10) was investigated. These cells were
   maintained in culture with complete medium (C, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum
   and PDGF) and incomplete medium (CSS, supplemented with 1% foetal bovine serum
   without PDGF). Cultures were performed for a period of 72 hours in a similar fashion as

   described in the preceding paragraph. After this period of incubation, cell counts were carried
   out by flow cytometry.
   In the incomplete medium (CSS, no extra control PDGF), cells have a proliferative behaviour,
   similar to that produced in a healthy body. The proliferative behaviour that occurs in complete
 5 medium would be a similar situation to what occurs in a pathological organism. The presence
   of D-PUFA produced a significant reduction in the proliferation of normal aorta (A-10) cells
   in complete culture medium with proliferative agents present in the foetal serum included in
   the culture medium. In the presence of proliferative agents (cytokines, growth factors, etc.),
   A1O cell counts were similar to those obtained in incomplete medium (CSS) with the presence
10 of the D-PUFA of the present invention (Figure 2). In contrast, PUFA showed little or no
   antiproliferative efficacy, demonstrating that the changes made on these fatty acids increase
   substantially their pharmacological potential for treating cardiovascular diseases such as
   hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia, cardiomyopathies, aneurysms, ictus, angiogenesis,
   cardiac hyperplasia, infarction, angina, stroke (cerebrovascular accidents), etc.
15 The effects on this cell line can not be considered toxic for two reasons: (1) in complete
   medium, D-PUFAs never induced reductions in cell proliferation below the levels of cells
   incubated in incomplete medium, and (2) aorta (A1O) cells treated with D-PUFAs showed no
   signs of molecular or cellular necrosis, apoptosis or any other type of cell death. Since the
   proliferation of vascular cells is involved in the development of numerous cardiovascular
20 diseases, D-PUFAs are useful for the prevention and treatment of these diseases through
   nutraceutical and pharmaceutical approaches in humans and animals.
   In a separate series, rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro for 24 hours, after
   which a number of parameters were measured. First, it was measured the number, length and
   width of cells in culture. It was observed that all compounds of series A and B (182-226) were
25 able to increase the number of cells that survived in culture (between 12% and 33%) and their
   length and width (between 18% and 42%). In addition, these compounds induce decreases in
   the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) induced by anoxia (reductions of between 9% and
   68% for all compounds of series A and B). These results indicate that the D-PUFA molecules
   of the present invention have a protective effect on cardiovascular cells and increase their
30 elasticity, which can be used to prevent and treat heart and vascular diseases of various kinds,
   such    as   hypertension,    atherosclerosis, ischemia,   cardiomyopathy,     aneurysm,   ictus,

   angiogenesis, cardiac hyperplasia, infarction, angina, stroke (cerebrovascular accident), faulty
   blood circulation, etc.
   In a separate experimental series, it was studied the effect of D-PUFA molecules of the
   present invention on blood pressure of SHR rats. In these animals both, blood pressure and
 5 levels of apolipoprotein Al (apoA-I) were measured. For these experiments Spontaneously
   Hypertensive Rats (SHR) were treated for 30 days with vehicle (water control) or compounds
   of the invention (200 mg/kg day, p.o.). At the end of this period, the animals' blood pressure
   and serum levels of apoA-I were measured. The results show the capacity of the compounds
   of the present invention to lower blood pressure and induce the expression of apoA-I,
10 indicating that these molecules are useful in the treatment of hypertension and atherosclerosis
   (Table 11). For these experiments, non-invasive methods for determining blood pressure
   (cuff-tail method) and gene expression for apoA-I (RT-PCR) described in the literature (Ter6s
   et al., 2008) were used. The usefulness of the molecules of the present invention for the
   treatment of cardiovascular diseases is reinforced by its capacity for reducing the levels of
15 serum cholesterol and triglycerides (see below).
   Table 11 shows the blood pressure (mm Hg) and levels of apoA-I (%) in SHR rats. The
   average values of SHR before treatment were 214 mmHg and 100% respectively.

   Example 6. Use of 1,2-PUFA derivatives for the treatment of obesity
   Figure 3A shows how PUFAs (both natural and synthetic ones) are capable of inhibiting the
   hyperplasia and hypertrophy of fat cells. For this study, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used. This
 5 effect was already known and had been described previously for unmodified natural PUFAs
   (Hill et al., 1993). However, D-PUFAs have an increased potency to inhibit the proliferation
   of fat cells (Figure 3A). This effect is not toxic in any case, since inhibition of growth of fat
   cells did not produce reductions in cell proliferation below levels of cells cultured in
   incomplete medium (with 1% serum). The cell culture media and conditions used were similar
10 to those described above.
   These results demonstrate that D-PUFAs have a high potential to inhibit the growth of fat cells
   and, therefore, for the prevention and treatment of obesity and other processes related to the
   accumulation of body adipocytes (e.g., cellulite) or appetite alterations through nutraceutical
   or pharmaceutical approaches in animals and humans. The observed effect, again, showed a
15 clear correlation with the number of double bonds of the molecules used and the presence of
   modifications at carbons 1 and 2 in the lipid molecule.
   Additionally, several compounds related to the present invention were used to study their
   effect on body weight of rats (Figure 3B). In this regard, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats
   (SHR) treated with compounds 182-226 (series A, B, N and P) showed reductions in body
20 weight after 1 month treatment with 200 mg/kg (reductions of 3.2% to 6.9%) caused in part by
   a decrease in food intake and partly by inhibition of the proliferation of fat cells (in untreated
   animals fed with the same amount of food the weight drop was not as marked as in animals
   treated). These results demonstrate that these compounds can be used in the control of body
   weight (obesity and overweight), appetite control and body fat (cellulite) regulation.
25
   Example 7. Use of 1,2-PUFA derivatives for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
   In these studies, different models of neurodegeneration were used. First, P19 cells were
   studied, where neuronal differentiation was induced with trans-retinoic acid. To do this,
   P19cells were incubated in minimum essential medium (u-MEM) supplemented with 10%
30 foetal bovine serum and 2 dM of trans retinoic acid at 37'C in the presence of 5% CO 2. Cells
   were incubated in the presence or absence of several D-PUFAs or PUFAs at different

   concentrations for 24 hours. Neurotoxicity was induced with 1 pM NMDA. Subsequently, the
   number of cells was counted by optical microscopy in the presence of trypan blue. These
   experiments showed that PUFAs have a protective effect on neuronal degeneration, although
   the effect mediated by D-PUFAs is much higher (Figure 4A and Table 12). In this figure and
 5 table it is clear that the D-PUFA molecules of the present invention protect against neuronal
   death, as they inhibit NMDA-induced neuronal death, so that these substances may be useful
   for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,
   sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, leukodystrophy, etc. It has also been shown that the number of
   cells in cultures treated is higher than in cultures were there are not neurodegenerative agents
10 added. In particular, cell death negative values indicate that the number of P19 cells is higher
   than in a control situation. Therefore, the D-PUFA compounds of the present invention can be
   used to promote neuroregenerative processes, such as those produced by traumatic processes
   (accident) or toxic agents.
   Table 12 shows the protective effect against neuronal death in P19 cells: inhibition of
15 neuronal death (P19 cells) with D-PUFA of the present invention after treatment with NMDA
   (100% death). Control cells without NMDA, showed a level of 0% cell death. All percentages
   below 100% indicate protection against neuronal death. Negative values indicate that in
   addition to protection of neuronal death there is also a level of neuronal proliferation.
   Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention decrease the levels of a-synuclein
20 (Table 13), a protein that is associated with neurodegenerative processes, such as Parkinson's,
   Alzheimer's, dementia of Lewy, multiple systemic atrophy, prion diseases, etc. Therefore, the
   molecules of the present invention can be applied to the prevention and treatment of
   neurodegenerative, neuroregenerative, neurological and neuropsychiatric processes.

 5 To test the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention to induce neuroregeneration or
   inhibit neurodegeneration, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease was used. In this model
   mice develop neurodegeneration because they express a series of mutant proteins that lead to
   brain damage (Alzh mice). B6 mice were used as healthy animal controls. Both groups of
   animals were treated for a period of 3 months with vehicle (water) or with various D-PUFA
10 (20 mg/kg, daily po) since they were an age of 3 months. To determine whether cognitive
   improvement occurred after treatment, animal behaviour was monitored in the radial maze.
   The animals are kept on restricted diet to have appetite. In a symmetrical 8-arm radial maze,
   visual marks were placed to facilitate the orientation of the animal and food (15 mg tablet)
   was put in four of the arms. The time each animal took to complete the exercise, and the
15 number of errors, were measured using a camera attached to a computer system. In this sense,
   Alzheimer animals have values about 50% higher than healthy animals, both by the time it
   takes to perform the exercise and by the number of errors made (Figure 4B). By contrast,
   mice with Alzheimer treated with 226B1 (Alzh+LP226) presented behavioural parameters
   similar to those of control animals and significantly (P <0.05) lower than animals treated with
20 vehicle (Alzh). In this regard, the effectiveness of the compound 183B1, 205A1, 205B1,
   226A1, 226 VI was also tested, showing improvements in animals with Alzheimer's disease
   (times of 98, 92, 93, 86 and 89 seconds, respectively). On the other hand, it is also interesting
   that these same compounds (183B1, 205A1, 205B1, 226A1, 226B1 and 226V1) also produced
   reductions in the times taken to complete the experiment in control animals (B6 healthy mice)
25 of 8s, 1 Is, 12s, 18s, 16s and 14s, respectively. Therefore, it may be concluded that these
   compounds have significant activity against neurodegeneration and in neuroregeneration.
   Among the neurodegenerative processes that could be prevented and treated with D-PUFA

   molecules of the present invention are Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, Zellweger
   syndrome, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the sclerosis of the hippocampus
   and other types of epilepsy, focal sclerosis, adrenoleukodystrophy and other types of
   leukodystrophy, vascular dementia, senile dementia, dementia of Lewy, multiple systemic
 5 atrophy, prion diseases, etc. In addition, neuroregenerative activity, evidenced by the effect in
   both mice with Alzheimer and healthy B6 mice, treatment can be applied to processes in
   which neuronal loss has occurred as a result of an accident, surgery, trauma of different nature
   or due to certain toxins. D-PUFA molecules of the present invention can also be used for the
   prevention or treatment of different neurological and / or neuropsychiatric problems, such as
10 headaches including migraine, central nervous system injury, sleep disorders, dizziness, pain,
   stroke (cerebrovascular accidents), depression, anxiety, addictions, memory, learning or
   cognitive problems, and for enhancing the memory and cognitive ability of human beings.
   Example 8. Use of 1,2-PUFA derivatives for the treatment of inflammatory diseases
15 Cyclooxygenase (COX) is an enzyme that can bind to membranes, taking certain lipids from
   there and catalyze its conversion into molecules that can have inflammatory activity. The
   binding of this enzyme to membrane lipids is due in part to the membrane lipid structure. The
   increased activity of COX 1 and 2 isoforms has been associated with the etiopathology of a
   number of inflammatory diseases by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism to produce pro
20 inflammatory lipid mediators. The D-PUFA compounds of the present invention produced a
   series of cellular signals that alter the metabolism of arachidonic acid and, as a result, they
   inhibit the activity and expression of COX in monocytes in culture (Table 14 and Figure 5).
   Also, the D-PUFA of the present invention inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines (TNF-ax) in vivo (Table 15 and Figure 5). For this purpose, C57BL6/J mice were
25 treated with the various derivatives (200 mg/kg, p.o.,) after inducing an inflammatory reaction
   in them by intraperitoneal injection of 20 ptg of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These
   results clearly indicate the effectiveness of the D-PUFA of the present invention to prevent or
   reverse inflammatory processes and pathologies.
   Table 14 shows the expression of COX-2 in monocytes in culture. Inhibition of COX-2
30 expression in monocytes. Percentages of inhibition (compared to the positive control in the

   Example 9. Use of 1,2-PUFA derivatives for the treatment of metabolic diseases
15 Lipids are critical molecules in maintaining metabolic functions. PUFA treatments produced
   some modest reductions in cholesterol and triglycerides levels in 3T3-L1 cells. However, D
   PUFA treatments resulted in marked and significant reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride
   levels in these cells. For these experiments, the above mentioned cells were incubated in
   RPMI 1640 medium in presence of 10% foetal bovine serum at 37'C with 5% C0 2 , and in the

   presence or absence of 150 iM of different PUFA or D-PUFA. The cells were incubated for
   24h and then subjected to lipid extraction and cholesterol and triglyceride levels were
   measured following the procedures described previously (Folch et al., 1951).
   In a separate experimental series, SHR rats were treated with various compounds of the
 5 present invention (200 mg/kg daily, 28 days, p.o.) and the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides
   and glucose in serum were measured by colorimetric methods. It was observed that these
   compounds induce significant (and in many cases marked) reductions in the levels of these
   metabolites (Table 16).
   The results shown in Figure 6 and Table 16 clearly indicate that the D-PUFAs can be used as
10 drugs for the treatment or prevention of metabolic diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia,
   hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes and insulin resistance in humans and animals, through
   pharmaceutical and nutraceutical approaches. The combination high levels of cholesterol and
   triglycerides, high glucose, together with cardiovascular and / or body weight alterations leads
   to "metabolic syndrome", which is beginning to increase in Western societies. The compounds

   Example 10. Structural basis of the therapeutic effects of 1,2-derivatives of PUFAs
 5 Numerous studies have shown that the intake or treatment with lipid results in changes in the
   lipid composition of cell membranes. Furthermore, such composition has a direct effect on the
   membrane lipid structure, which in turn regulates cell signalling and is related to the
   occurrence of many diseases. Figure 7 shows the correlation between changes in the structure
   of the membrane produced by different D-PUFAs (as measured by the HI, transition
10 temperature) and the cellular effects observed in this study. For this purpose, we determined
   the mean effect of each of the D-PUFAs (average of each lipid for all diseases studied with
   respect to the number of double bonds) and the results have been plotted against the transition
   temperature. The reduction in HI, transition temperature indicates a greater induction of
   discontinuities in membranes, creating docking sites for the peripheral membrane proteins that
15 leads to a better regulation of cell signalling, and therefore a more effective control of certain
   diseases. To some extent, the fact that complex organisms can metabolize drugs and that some

   additional mechanisms may be operating in some types (subtypes) of diseases, suggests that
   some of the molecules with fewer double bonds can have greater pharmacological activity.
   However, in general, it appears that the therapeutic effect depends on the number of double
   bonds of the molecule, which itself is related to the capacity of regulating the structure of the
 5 membranes. In that sense, the presence of radicals in carbons 1 and/or 2, found in the D-PUFA
   compounds of the present invention, but not in natural PUFAs, is essential to enhance the
   therapeutic effect of these molecules.
   These results indicate that the effects of lipids contained in this invention have a common
   basis. These correlations (with r2 values of 0.77 and 0.9 for D-PUFAs and P <0.05 in both
10 cases) clearly indicate that the structure of the lipids used is the basis of its effect and that it
   occurs through the regulation of membrane structure, caused by the structure-function
   relationship of each lipid.
   Thus, the present invention relates in a first aspect to compounds of formula (I) or
   pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives where a, b and c independently can have values from
15 0 to 7 and R, and R 2 may be an ion, atom or group of atoms with a molecular weight not
   exceeding 200 Da independently, for use in the treatment of diseases based on structural
   alterations and/or functional characteristics of cell membrane lipids selected from: cancer,
   vascular disease, inflammation, metabolic diseases, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases and
   neurological disorders.
20 A second aspect of the present invention relates to the use of at least one compound of
   formula (I), or its pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, where a, b and c independently
   may have values from 0 to 7, and R, and R 2 can be an ion, atom or group of atoms with a
   molecular    weight   not exceeding     200   Da independently,      for the preparation      of a
   pharmaceutical and/or nutraceutical composition for the treatment of diseases based on
25 structural and/or functional alterations of lipids in cell membranes selected from: cancer,
   vascular diseases, inflammation, metabolic diseases, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases and
   neurological disorders.
   The last aspect of the present invention relates to a method for therapeutic treatment of
   diseases in humans and animals whose common etiology is related to structural and/or
30 functional alterations of the lipids located in cell membranes selected from: cancer, vascular
   disease, inflammation, metabolic diseases, obesity, neurodegenerative            and neurological
   diseases, which comprises administration to the patient of a therapeutically effective amount

   of at least one compound of formula (I) and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or
