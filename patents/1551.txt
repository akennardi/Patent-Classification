Background
        There have been important advances in recent years regarding understanding of the
immune system and discovery of drug compounds for modifying immune response to treat or
prevent disease. Such immune response modifier ("IRM") compounds have been discovered in a
variety of compound classes, including imidazoquinoline amines, imidazopyridine amines, 6,7
fused cycloalkylimidazopyridine amines, 1,2-bridged imidazoquinoline amines, thiazoloquinoline
amines, oxazoloquinoline amines, thiazolopyridine amines, oxazolopyridine amines,
imidazonaphthyridine amines, imidazotetrahydronaphthyridine amines, and thiazolonaphthyridine
amines. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,338; 4,929,624; 5,266,575; 5,268,376;

2012/040461 and 2013/0230578. Many of these compounds have demonstrated potent
immunostimulating, antiviral and antitumor (including anticancer) activity, and have also been
shown to be useful as vaccine adjuvants and treatment of TH2-mediated diseases.
        However, the ability to provide desired therapeutic benefits of such compounds depends
on a variety of factors, including the extent to which they can be formulated and delivered in a
way that is suitable for particular treatments. Accordingly, there is a need for new methods and
formulations to provide the potential therapeutic benefits from these important immunomodifying
drug compounds.

Summary
While many diseases may be treated by systemic delivery of immune response modifying
compounds, systemic delivery can have increased negative side effects, such as systemic TNF
induction, as compared to localized delivery, and can also limit the amount of IRM compound
therapeutically available to treat the disease by spreading it throughout the body. While some
advancements have been made in localized delivery of IRMs (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
7,799,800; and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004/026535 1; 2009/0035323; and 2013/0230578),
there remains a need for stable formulations that provide increased localization of IRM delivery.
        It has been found that formulations comprising an IRM compound, ethanol, and sesame
oil provide locally active IRM compounds for an extended period of time.
        The present invention provides injectable formulations comprising ethanol, sesame oil, and
an Immune Response Modifier (IRM) compound. The IRM compound generally has the formula
(I):

        wherein R, R2, X, Y, and R1 are as defined below.
        In another aspect, the invention provides a method of delivering the pharmaceutical
formulations described herein, comprising injecting the formulation into a subject.
        In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a disease, comprising
injecting into a subject in need of treatment of the disease any one of the formulations described
herein.
        In another aspect, the present invention further provides a method of making
pharmaceutical formulations comprising ethanol, sesame oil, and an IRM compound of Formula I.

30          It has surprisingly been found that formulations comprising an IRM compound, ethanol,
   and refined sesame oil, as described above such that one or more polar compounds have been
   substantially removed from the sesame oil, have increased stability, not only of the formulation

            IRM compounds of Formula I have been shown to induce production of cytokines such
   as TNF-a (see, e.g, U.S. Patent No. 7,799;800; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 201 3/023057$).
15 The ability to induce cytokine production indicates that the IRM compounds used in
   formulaions of the invention can modulate the immune response in a number of different ways,
   rendering the IRM compounds useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders. Other cytokines
   whose production may be induced by the administration of the formulations disclosed herein
   generally include Type I interferons (e.g, INF-a),l IL-1, IL-6. IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, MIP-1, MCP-1,
20 and a variety of other cytokines. Among other effects, these and other cytokines inhibit virus
   production and tumor cell growth, making the formulations of the present invention useful in the
   treatment of viral diseases and neoplastic diseases. For example, tumor necrosis factor
   interferons, or interleukins have been shown to stimulate a rapid release of certain
   monocyte/macrophage-derved cviokines and are also capable of stimulating B cells to secrete
25 antibodies which play an important role in antiviral and antitumor activities.

10         The animal to which the formulation is administered for treatment may have a disease
   (e.g, a viral or neoplastic disease), and administration of the compound may provide therapeutic
   treatment, Exemplary conditions that may be treated by administering a formulation of the
   present invention include:
           (a) neoplastic diseases such as melanoma, leukeimias (e.g.. nyelogenous letikemia,
15 chronic lymphocytic leukemia., multiple myeloma, non-l-lodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell
   lymphoma. B-cell lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia), breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate
   cancer, colon cancer, head or neck cancers, bladder cancer, and other cancers;
           (b) viral diseases such as diseases resulting from infection by a poxvirus (e.g, an
   orthopoxvirus such as variola or vaccinia, or molluscum contagiosum), or a papovavirus (e.g.
20 papillonaviruses, such as those that cause genital warts, common warts, or plantar warts):
           (c) diseases associated with wound repair such as inhibition of keloid formation and other
   types of scarr      e.g enhancing wound healing, including chronic wounds).
           In some embodiments, the disease treated is a neoplastic disease. In some embodiments,
   the formulation is injected into a tumor mass, In some embodiments, the disease treated is
25 selected from a head or neck cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and bladder cancer,
           In some embodiments, the disease treated is a viral disease that causes warts. In some
   embodiments, the formulation is injected into a wart,

   will vary according to factors known in the art including the nature of the carrier, the size and
   stare of the subject's immune system (eg., suppressed, compromised, stimulated), the species to
   which the formulation is being administered, the dosing regimen selected, the application site,
   the particular formulation, and the condition being treated, Accordingly, it is not practical to set
 5 forth generally the composition of a formulation that includes ethanol, sesame oil, and an IRM
   compound of Formula I or an amount of the IRM compound that constitutes an effective amount,
   or a dosing regimen that is effective for all possible applications. Those of ordinary skill in the
   art, however, can readily determine appropriate formulations, therapeutically effective amounts
   of the IR M compound, and dosing regimen based on the guidance provided herein, information
10 available in the art pertaining to IRM compounds, and routine testing. The tenn "a
   therapeutically effective amount" thus means an amount of the IRiM compound sufficient to
   induce a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, such as cytokine induction, inhibition of TH2
   immune response, antiviral or antitumor activity, reduction of scarring, or enhanced wound
   healing.
15         An amount of a formulation or IRM compound in the formulation effective to induce
   cytosine biosynthesis is an amount sufficient to cause one or more cell types, such as monocytes,
   macrophages, dendritic cells and B-cells to produce an amount of one or more cytokines such as,
   for example., lFN-a, TNF-a, R-A, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 that is increased over a background level
   of such cytokines. The precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is
20 expected to be a dose of about 100 nanograms per kilograms (ng'kg) to about 50 milligrams per
   kilogram (mg/kg). in some embodinents about 10 nicrogrms per kilogram (gg/kg) to about 5
   mg/kg, about 100 pg/kg to about I mg/kg, or about 0.01 mg m to about 10 mg/nm2
   Alternatively, the dose may be calculated using actual body weight obtained      just prior to the
   beginning of a treatment course, For the dosages calculated in this way, body surface area (n1)
25 is calculated prior to the beginning of the treatment course using the Dubois method: n          (wt
   kg"" x height conP    2)  x 0.007184. An amount effective to treat or inhibit a viral infection, for
   example, is an amount that will cause a reduction in one or more of the manifestations of viral
   infection, such as viral lesions, viral load, rate of virus production, and mortality as compared to
   untreated control animals and may include any of the aforementioned doses. An amount of a
30 compound or pharmaceutical composition effective to treat a neoplastic condition is an amount
   that will cause a reduction in tumor size or in the number of tumor foci and may include any of
   the aforementioned doses.

            Formulations of the invention may induce the production of certain cytokines and are
   useful as imnune response modifiers that can modulate the immune response in a number of
   different ways, rendering them useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders. Among other
   effects, these and. other cytokines can inhibit virus production and tnuor cell growth, making the
 5 formulations useful for, e.g., treatment of viral and neoplastic diseases. It should also be noted
   that the formulations may be administered prior to acquiring a disease so that administration of
   the formulation may provide a prophylactic treatment.
            In addition to the ability to give rise to cytokine induction, formulations of the invention
   may bring about an effect on other aspects of the innate immune response. For example, natural
10 killer cell activity may be stimulated, an effect that may be due to cytokine induction. The
   formulations may also bring about activation of macrophages, which in turn stimulate secretion
   of nitric oxide and the production of additional cytokines. Further, the formulations may bring
   about proliferation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes.
            Formulations of the invention may also bring about an effect on the acquired immune
15 response. For example, the production of the T helper type 1 (T-,l) cytokine IFN-y may be
   induced indirectly and the production of the T helper type 2 tT 1i2) cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL
     3 may be inhibited upon administration of the formulations.
            Formulations of the present invention may be particularly helpful in individuals having
   compromised immune function. For example, compounds or salts may be used for treating the
20 opportunistic infections and tumors that occur after suppression of cell mediated immunity in,
   for example, transplant patients, cancer patients and HIV patients.
            The invention thus also provides, or example, a method of treating a viral infection in an
   animal and a method of treating a neoplastic disease in an animal comprising administering via
   injection an effective amount of a formulation of the invention to the animal. An amount
25 effective to treat or inhibit a viral infection is an amount that will cause a reduction in one or
   more of the manifestations of viral infection, such as viral lesions, viral load, rate of virus
   production, and mortality as compared to untreated control animals. The precise amount that is
   effective for such treatment will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be
   an amount so as to deliver an 1RM compound dose of about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg.
30 preferably about I pg/kg to about 5 mg/kg. An amount of fornmlation effective to treat a
   neoplastic condition is an amount that will cause a reduction in tumor size or in the number of
   tumor foci, Again, the precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is
   expected to be an amount at a given drug concentration to deliver via injection an IRM

           The injectable formulations described herein can include a range of IRM compound
   concentrations, with lower limits based on minimum therapeutic potency of the IRM compound
   and upper hmis based primarily on solubility of the drug. In general, the concentration of the
   IRM compound will be from about 0.1 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml (approximately 0,01% to about
    1% by weight). In some embodiments, the 1RM compound is present in an amount of from about
10 0.1 mg/ ml to about 6 mg/ml In some embodiments, the IRM compound is present in an amount
   of from about 0.5 mg/ml to about 3 m/  nni.
           In some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein, the formulation may be
   administered, for example, from a single dose to multipIe doses per week, although in some
   embodiments the methods of the present invention may be performed by administering the
15 formulation at a frequency outside this range, some embodiments, the fomulation may be
   administered from about once per month to about five times per week. In some embodiments,
   the formulation is administered once per week.
           The present invention further provides a method of making pharmaceutical formulatiions
   comprising ethanol, sesame oil, and an IRM compound of Formula . In some embodiments, the
20 method of making comprises dissolving the IRM compound in the ethanol to create an ethanol
   IRM compound soition. In some enbodiments, the IRM compound is fully dissolved in the
   ethanol, while in some embodiments, small amount of IRM compoumd will remain undissolved
   but the majority of IRM compound will be dissolved. The ethanolTIRM compound solution is

   Example 10. Intratumoral (IT) Injection
            All procedures were conducted in accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care
   and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols. The animals were housed in a facility that was
   accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
 5 (AAALAC, Frederick, MD) C57BL/6l-Tyr Albino mice, female, 15-20 grams were obtained
   from Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, Maine. The syngeneic B16.OVA melanoma cell line was
   obtained from Dr. Wvnette Dietz, University of Minnesota. The cell line was characterized at
   3M and determined to express OVA.
            Prior to establishing tumor-bearing mice, the animals were anesthetized with 1%
10 isoflurane in an airtight box and then maintained under anesthesia by administration of 1%
   isoflurane via a face mask, Each mouse was given unique descriptor (unique tattooed number
   on the tail). The right flank was shaved and 5x105 B 16,OVA melanoma cells in 0.1 mL DPBS
   were implanted subcutaneously.
            Seven days after turimor implantation the mice were randomized into 3 groups (Groups A
15 C) of 20 mice per group, At this point the average tumor size in the muce was approximately 20
   mmi     Animals that were outliers based on tumor size were identified and excluded from the
   study based on the ROT statistical method developed by GraphPad Software (La Jolla, CA).
   The Group A animals received a 0.05 mL intratumoral injection of the formulation of Example
   3, The Group B animals received a 0,05 mL injection of the Formulation of Example 3
20 administered subcutaneously (SC) into the flank region opposite from the implanted tumor (ie.
   left flank). The Group C aimrals received a 0.05 mL intratumoral injection of a Vehicle Control
   Formulation, The Vehicle Control Fornulation was the same as the Formulation of Example 3
   with the exception that N-(4-{4-amino-2-butl- IH-imi dazoj 4,5-cjquinolin-l
             i
   ylloxy butyl)octadecanaide       was not included in the formuulation, All of the formulations for
25 Groups A-C were administered using a 0.5 mL syringe with a 26 gauge needle. All three groups
   were injected with the corresponding formulation at 7 days and 14 days after the tumor
   implantation, For Groups A and C the intratumoral injection was administered in the center of
   the tumor. Prior to injection, the animals were anesthetized with 1%isofmune via a lace mask.
   For each animal, the tumor size was measured with a calibrated digital caliper, All tumors were
30 palpable and visible. If the tumor size was measured to be 200 mn or greater, the animal was
   euthanized. The animals were monitored for 90 days post tumor implantation. For each animal,
   the tumor size data is reported in Tables 2A-C, and the percent survival data is reported in Table
   3. The median survival in days was 34 days for Group A, 22 days for group B, and 21.5 days for
                                                    -24-

   Group C, The animal survival data was analyzed using Prism 5,04 software (GraphPad
   Software). KaphumMeier survival curves were compared by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test
   followed by pairwise comparison using the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test, The survival
   advantage of the Group A animals versus group B and C animals was determined to be
   statistically significani (p value < 0,0001).
   Example 11
             A variety of formulations with fixed levels of ethanol concentration (at 7.5 wt-% of
   ethanol in the formulation), differing levels of N-(4-{4 -amino-2-butyl1H-imidazo[4,5
10 c*quinolin-1 -ylloxy}buty)octadecanmiude concentrations ranging fi-om 0.1 mg/mL to 2.5
   mg/iL, and BHA concentrations (300 ppm) are prepared using the general procedures of
   Examples 1- . For Fornilations I -A thru I 1-E deoxygenated ethanol and sesame oil are used.
   The fonuilations are reported in Table 4.
             Formulations are prepared in which the ethanol content of the fbrmulation is reduced by
15 including an ethanol evaporation step munediately prior to the final filtuation step. The
   evaporation of the ethanol in the formulation is accomplished by passing a streani of dry nitrogen
   gas over the stirred formulation.
