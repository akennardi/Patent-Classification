locking post (not shown in the figures), the hinge post passes through the hinge hole 603, and
the rotation of the table 500 around the hinge points relative to the frame can be realized by
using the arrangement of the hinge post passing through the hinge hole 603. When the table
500 is opened relative to the frame 100, the locking post is engaged with the neck 604, in this
condition, a work table of the table 500 is in parallel to the work table of the platform 101.
When the table 500 is closed relative to the frame 100, the locking post is disengaged from the
neck 604, in this condition, only the hinge post passes through the hinge hole 603. Preferably,
in this embodiment, the hinge hole 603 is an elongated circular hole, that is, the hinge post is
up-down movable inside the elongated circular hole relative to the hinge plate 602. That is,
when the table 500 is closed relative to the frame 100, it is required to pull the whole table 500
upward to disengage the locking post from the neck 604, and then the table 500 is rotated
around the hinge points and to approach the frame 100. Similarly, when the table 500 is
opened relative to the frame 100, the table 500 is firstly rotated around the hinge points to
leave away from the frame 100 until the work table of the table 500 is almost in parallel to the
work table of the platform 101, then it is required to pull the table 500 upward to reserve an
activity space for engaging the locking post at the neck 604.
