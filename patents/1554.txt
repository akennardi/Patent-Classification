              HYALURONIC ACID FORMULATION CONTAINING PYRUVATE
                                        BACKGROUND
 [001]       Skin aging is a progressive phenomenon, occurs over time and can be
 affected by lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use and sun
 exposure.     Aging of the facial skin can be characterized by atrophy, slackening, and
 fattening. Atrophy corresponds to a massive reduction of the thickness of skin tissue.
 Slackening of the subcutaneous tissues may lead to an excess of skin and ptosis can
 and lead to the appearance of drooping cheeks and eye lids. Fattening refers to an
 increase in excess weight by swelling of the bottom of the face and neck.              These
 changes are typically associated with dryness, loss of elasticity, and rough texture.
 [002]       Hyaluronan, also known as hyaluronic acid (HA) is distributed widely
throughout the human body in connective and epithelial tissues and abundant in the
 different layers of the skin, where it has multiple functions such as, e.g., to ensure good
 hydration, to assist in the organization of the extracellular matrix, to act as a filler
 material, and to participate in tissue repair mechanisms.         However, with age, the
quantity of HA, collagen, elastin, and other matrix polymers present in the skin
decreases.        For example, repeated exposed to ultra violet light, e.g., from the sun,
causes dermal cells to both decrease their production of HA as well as increase the rate
of their degradation. This HA loss can result in various skin conditions such as, e.g.,
imperfects, defects, diseases and/or disorders, and the like. For instance, there is a
strong correlation between the water content in the skin and levels of HA in the dermal
tissue.    As skin ages, the amount and quality of HA in the skin is reduced.           These
changes lead to drying and wrinkling of the skin.
[003]        Dermal fillers are useful in treating soft tissue conditions and in other skin
therapies because the fillers can replace lost endogenous matrix polymers, or
enhance/facilitate the function of existing matrix polymers, in order to treat these skin
conditions. In the past, such compositions have been used in cosmetic applications to
fill wrinkles, lines, folds, scars, and to enhance dermal tissue, such as, e.g., to plump
thin lips, or fill-in sunken eyes or shallow cheeks. One common matrix polymer used in
dermal filler compositions is HA.       Because HA is natural to the human body, it is a
generally well tolerated and a fairly low risk treatment for a wide variety of skin

 conditions. Unfortunately, some HA compositions are less stable to sterilization, such
 as heat sterilization, than may be desired.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[017]        A pyruvate, such as, sodium pyruvate may be added to a hyaluronic acid
composition to help stabilize the composition. For example, the addition of sodium
pyruvate or another pyruvate, may have a significant impact on the stability of a
hyaluronic acid gel (e.g. sterilization and thermal stability) and the other ingredients
present in the formulation (such as sodium ascorbyl phosphate or vitagen).
[018]        Hyaluronic acid is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan that enhances water
retention and resists hydrostatic stresses. It is non-immunogenic and can be chemically
modified in numerous fashions. Hyaluronic acid may be anionic at pH ranges around or
above the pKa of its carboxylic acid groups.           Unless clearly indicated otherwise,
reference to hyaluronic acid, hyaluronan, or HA herein may include its fully protonated,
or nonionic form as depicted below, as well as any anionic forms and salts of hyaluronic
acid, such as sodium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, magnesium salts, calcium
salts, etc.

 [019]     Any suitable amount of HA may be used in a composition, such as about
 0.1% w/w to about 5% w/w; about 0.5% w/w to about 3% w/w; about 1% w/w to about
 2.5% w/w; about 1% w/w to about 2% w/w; about 2% w/w to about 3% w/w; about 0.5%

 w/w; about 2.5% w/w; or any concentration in a range bounded by, or between, any of
these values.
 [020]     An HA may have any suitable molecular weight, such as an average
 molecular weight of about 5,000 Da to about 20,000,000 Da; about 300,000 Da to about
 800,000 Da; or about 2,000,000 Da to about 5,000,000 Da.
 [021]     In some embodiments, an HA comprises both high molecular weight HA and
 low molecular weight HA, wherein the high molecular weight HA has a molecular weight
greater than about 2,000,000 Da and wherein the low molecular weight HA has a
 molecular weight of less than about 1,000,000 Da.
 [022]     In some compositions, an HA may have a low molecular weight, e.g., about
 100,000 Da, about 200,000 Da, about 300,000 Da, about 400,000 Da, about 500,000

700,000 Da, about 300,000 Da to about 800,000 Da, or about 400,000 Da to about
700,000 Da.
[023]      In some embodiments, an HA may have a high molecular weight, such as
about 1,000,000 Da, about 1,500,000 Da, about 2,000,000 Da, about 2,500,000 Da,

 Da to about 3,500,000 Da, or about 2,000,000 Da to about 4,000,000 Da.
 [024]     An HA may be a combination of a low molecular weight HA fraction and a
 high molecular weight HA fraction. A high molecular weight HA fraction includes HA
 having a mean molecular weight of about 1,000,000 Da or greater, such as about
 1,500,000 Da, about 2,000,000 Da, about 2,500,000 Da, about 3,000,000 Da, about
3,500,000 Da, about 4,000,000 Da, about 4,500,000 Da, or about 5,000,000 Da. A low
molecular weight HA fraction includes HA having a mean molecular weight of less than
about 1,000,000 Da, such as about 200,000 Da, about 300,000 Da, about 400,000 Da,
about 500,000 Da, about 600,000 Da, about 700,000 Da, of about 800,000 Da, or about
900,000 Da.
[025]      In an HA composition comprising a low molecular weight HA fraction and a
high molecular weight HA fraction, any suitable ratio of high molecular weight HA to low
molecular weight HA may be used.        In some embodiments the weight ratio of high
molecular weight HA to low molecular weight HA may be about 20, about 15, about 10,
about 5, about 1, about 0.07, about 0.05, about 0.2, or about 0.1. A weight ratio is the
quotient (weight high molecular weight HA)/(low molecular weight HA). For example a
composition having 20 g of high molecular weight HA and 1 g low molecular weight HA
has a weight ratio of high molecular weight HA to low molecular weight HA of 20.
[026]      An uncrosslinked HA fraction may also improve the rheological properties of
an HA composition so as to improve treatment of a skin condition. In aspects of this
embodiment, a composition comprises an uncrosslinked HA where the uncrosslinked
HA is present at a concentration of, e.g., about 2 mg/g, about 3 mg/g, about 4 mg/g,
about 5 mg/g, about 6 mg/g, about 7 mg/g, about 8 mg/g, about 9 mg/g, about 10 mg/g,

 mg/g to about 17 mg/g, about 11 mg/g to about 16 mg/g, or about 12 mg/g to about 15
 mg/g. In some embodiments, the ratio of crosslinked HA to uncrosslinked HA is about
 0.001 to about 100, about 0.005 to about 20, or about 0.01 to about 0.05.
 [027]     An    HA      may   be   crosslinked,    partially crosslinked,   or   substantially
 uncrosslinked.     In some embodiments, a low molecular weight HA fraction may be
crosslinked, a low molecular weight HA fraction may be partially crosslinked, or a low
 molecular weight HA fraction may be uncrosslinked; and a high molecular weight HA
fraction may be crosslinked, a high molecular weight fraction may be partially
crosslinked, or a high molecular weight HA fraction may be uncrosslinked.
[028]      A crosslinked HA may result from linking two or more individual HA
molecules, either directly or by a linking moiety. Crosslinking HA may increase the
viscosity of an aqueous HA composition, which may result in the formation of a
hydrogel.    HA may be crosslinked using dialdehyde or disulfide crosslinking agents
including, without limitation, multifunctional PEG-based crosslinking agents, divinyl
sulfones, diglycidyl ethers, bis-epoxides, and biscarbodiimides. Non-limiting examples
of crosslinking agents include multifunctional PEG-based crosslinking agents like
pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether (PETGE),         divinyl sulfone (DVS),     1,4-butanediol
diglycidyl   ether     (BDDE),    1,2-bis(2,3-epoxypropoxy)ethylene      (EGDGE),      1,2,7,8

anesthetic agent may be a local anesthetic agent, including an anesthetic agent that
causes a reversible local anesthesia or a loss of nociception, such as, e.g., aminoamide
local anesthetics and aminoester local anesthetics. Non-limiting examples of anesthetic

to adjust osmolality.   Examples include, but are not limited to, salts such as, e.g.,
sodium chloride and potassium chloride; and glycerin.
[037]      Some HA compositions may be suitable for use as a dermal filler.              For
example, such an HA composition may be in the proper form, e.g. as a gel having an
appropriate elastic modulus and viscous modulus, so as to be suitable as a dermal filler.
By contrast, an HA composition that is too hard or stiff, or too liquid, may not be suitable
for use as a dermal filler. Additionally, a dermal filler may have a composition that is
compatible with the part of the body into which it is injected.

[040]       Non-limiting examples of buffers include acetate buffers, borate buffers,
citrate buffers, neutral buffered salines, phosphate buffers, and phosphate buffered
salines. Any concentration of a buffer can be used, such as about 0.1 mM to about 900

 [043]      The elastic modulus of an object includes the slope of its stress-strain curve
 in the elastic deformation region: A = stress/strain, where A is the elastic modulus in
 Pascal's (Pa); stress is the force causing the deformation divided by the area to which
 the force is applied; and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the
 original state of the object. Although depending on the speed at which the force is
 applied, a stiffer composition will have a higher elastic modulus and it will take a greater
 force to deform the material a given distance, such as, e.g., an injection. Specifying how
 stresses are to be measured, including directions, may allow many types of elastic
 moduli to be defined.
 [044]      Viscous modulus is also known as the loss modulus because it describes the
 energy that is lost as viscous dissipation. Tan 6 is the ratio of the viscous modulus and
 the elastic modulus, Tan 6 = G"/G'.         For Tan 5 values disclosed in the present
 specification, a Tan 6 is obtained from the dynamic modulus at a frequency of 1 Hz. A
 lower tan 6 corresponds to a stiffer, harder, or more elastic composition.
 [045]      In some embodiments, an HA composition can be injected through a 27
gauge needle at a speed of about 13 mm/min with an extrusion force of about 9 N to
about 13 N, about 10 N to about 12 N, or about 11 N, measured on gel syringes
thermostated between 24 and 250C.
[046]       Some HA composition comprising pyruvate may have improved stability to
heat, such as heat sterilization, or during storage.
[047]       In some embodiments, an HA composition may be heat sterilized at least
about 100 C, and remain substantially stable at room temperature for at least about 12
months after heat sterilization.
[048]       Some embodiments include method of preparing a hydrogel composition
comprising heat treating a mixture of hyaluronic acid and pyruvate. A hydrogel thus
treated may maintain the desired hydrogel properties disclosed herein.

 (049]      In some embodiments, an HA gel has improved thermal stability as compared
to a substantially identical gel lacking pyruvate. One method for assessing heat stability
 is by obtaining a A Tan 6 1Hz, which is the difference between the Tan 6 1Hz with
 additives and without additives as shown in the formula below, measured at 25OC:
        A Tan 6 1 Hz =(Tan 6 1 Hz gel with additives) - (Tan 6 1 Hz NaHA control)
 [050]      A gel is considered as stable if A Tan 6 1 Hz 5 0.1 in conjunction with other
 physical parameters such as stable extrusion force. A negative A Tan 6 1 Hz value can
be indicative of a stability improvement due to the addition of pyruvate.
[051]       In some embodiments, the gel has a A Tan 6 1 Hz of about 0.004 or less,
about 0.001 or less, about 0 or less, about -0.002 or less, about -0.004 or less, or about
-0.006 or less, after heat sterilization. In some embodiments, the gel has a A Tan 6 1
 Hz of about -0.01 or less, about -0.03 or less, or about 0.04 or less, after storage for
about 60 days at about 450C as compared to a similar gel lacking pyruvate
[052]       In some embodiments, an HA composition can be injected through a 27
gauge needle at a speed of about 13 mm/min with an extrusion force of about 9 N to
about 13 N, about 10 N to about 12 N, or about 11 N, after heat stabilization and
measured on gel syringes thermostated between 24 and 250C.
[053]       An HA composition may be used to treat a soft tissue condition of an
individual.   As used herein, the term "treating," includes to reducing any detectable
amount or eliminating in an individual a cosmetic or clinical symptom of a soft tissue
condition characterized by a soft tissue imperfection, defect, disease, and/or disorder; or
delaying or preventing in an individual the onset of a cosmetic or clinical symptom of a
condition characterized by a soft tissue imperfection, defect, disease, and/or disorder.
For example, the term treating          includes reducing a symptom of a condition
characterized by a soft tissue defect, disease, and/or disorder by any detectable
amount.     In some embodiments, a symptom may be reduced at least about 20%, at
least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least
about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90% or at least about 100%.             The
effectiveness of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein in treating a condition
characterized by a soft tissue defect, disease, and/or disorder can be determined by
observing one or more cosmetic, clinical symptoms, and/or physiological indicators

 associated with the condition. An improvement in a soft tissue defect, disease, and/or
 disorder also can be indicated by a reduced need for a concurrent therapy. Those of
 skill in the art will know the appropriate symptoms or indicators associated with specific
 soft tissue defect, disease, and/or disorder and will know how to determine if an
 individual is a candidate for treatment with a compound or composition disclosed herein.
 [054]       A soft tissue condition may include, without           limitation, a soft tissue
 imperfection, defect, disease, and/or disorder, such as a breast imperfection, defect,
 disease and/or disorder, such as, e.g., a breast augmentation, a breast reconstruction,
 mastopexy, micromastia, thoracic hypoplasia, Poland's syndrome, defects due to
 implant complications like capsular contraction and/or rupture; a facial imperfection,
 defect, disease or disorder, such as, e.g., a facial augmentation, a facial reconstruction,
 a mesotherapy, Parry-Romberg syndrome, lupus erythematosus profundus, dermal
 divots, scars, sunken cheeks, thin lips, nasal imperfections or defects, retro-orbital
 imperfections or defects, a facial fold, line and/or wrinkle like a glabellar line, a
 nasolabial line, a perioral line, and/or a marionette line, and/or other contour deformities
or imperfections of the face; a neck imperfection, defect, disease or disorder; a skin
 imperfection, defect, disease and/or disorder; other soft tissue imperfections, defects,
diseases and/or disorders, such as, e.g., an augmentation or a reconstruction of the
 upper arm, lower arm, hand, shoulder, back, torso including abdomen, buttocks, upper
 leg, lower leg including calves, foot including plantar fat pad, eye, genitals, or other body
part, region or area, or a disease or disorder affecting these body parts, regions or
areas. As used herein, the term "mesotherapy" includes a non-surgical cosmetic
treatment     technique    of the   skin involving   intra-epidermal,    intra-dermal,  and/or
subcutaneous injection of an agent administered as small multiple droplets into the
epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, and/or the dermis.
[055]        The amount of an HA composition used may be determined based on the
alteration and/or improvement desired, the reduction and/or elimination of a soft tissue
condition symptom desired, the clinical and/or cosmetic effect desired by the individual
and/or physician, and the body part or region being treated.             The effectiveness of
composition administration may be manifested by one or more of the following clinical
and/or cosmetic measures: altered and/or improved soft tissue shape, altered and/or
improved soft tissue size, altered and/or improved soft tissue contour, altered and/or
improved tissue function, tissue ingrowth support and/or new collagen deposition,

 sustained engraftment of composition, improved patient satisfaction and/or quality of
 life, and decreased use of implantable foreign material.
 [056]       For example, effectiveness of the compositions and methods in treating a
facial soft tissue may be manifested by one or more of the following clinical and/or
cosmetic measures: increased size, shape, and/or contour of facial feature like
 increased size, shape, and/or contour of lip, cheek or eye region; altered size, shape,
and/or contour of facial feature like altered size, shape, and/or contour of lip, cheek or
eye region shape; reduction or elimination of a wrinkle, fold or line in the skin; resistance
to a wrinkle, fold or line in the skin; rehydration of the skin; increased elasticity to the
skin; reduction or elimination of skin roughness; increased and/or improved skin
tautness; reduction or elimination of stretch lines or marks; increased and/or improved
skin tone, shine, brightness and/or radiance; increased and/or improved skin color,
reduction or elimination of skin paleness; sustained engraftment of composition;
decreased side effects; improved patient satisfaction and/or quality of life.

about 10 mL, about 10 mL to about 100 mL, or about 50 mL to about 200 mL.
[058]       Duration of treatment may be determined based on the cosmetic and/or
clinical effect desired by the individual and/or physician and the body part or region
being treated.      For some treatments, administration of an HA composition can

[059]      An HA composition may be administered to a skin region of an individual by
injection into a dermal region or a hypodermal region, such as an epidermal-dermal
junction region, a papillary region, a reticular region, or any combination thereof.
[060]      As used herein, the term "dermal region" refers to the region of skin
comprising the epidermal-dermal junction and the dermis including the superficial
dermis (papillary region) and the deep dermis (reticular region). The skin is composed
of three primary layers: the epidermis, which provides waterproofing and serves as a
barrier to infection; the dermis, which serves as a location for the appendages of skin;
and the hypodermis (subcutaneous adipose layer).           The epidermis contains no blood
vessels, and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis. The main type of cells which
make up the epidermis are keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkels
cells.
[061]      The dermis includes the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that includes
connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly
connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane.                  It also harbors many
mechanoreceptor/nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains
the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels
and blood vessels. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste
removal from its own cells as well as from the Stratum basale of the epidermis. The
dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis,
called the papillary region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region.

    WO 2014/013286                                                     PCT/IB2012/001525
 [062]      The papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. It is
 named for its fingerlike projections called papillae that extend toward the epidermis. The
 papillae provide the dermis with a "bumpy" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis,
 strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin. The reticular region lies
 deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense
 irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of
 collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers
 give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Also located within
the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors,
 nails, and blood vessels. Tattoo ink is held in the dermis. Stretch marks from pregnancy
 are also located in the dermis.
 [063]      The hypodermis lies below the dermis. Its purpose is to attach the dermal
 region of the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood
vessels and nerves. It includes loose connective tissue and elastin. The main cell types
 are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes (the hypodermis contains 50% of body
fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.
 [064]      Some methods of treating a soft tissue condition of an individual comprise
administering an HA composition to a site of a soft tissue condition of the individual to
 improve or treat the soft tissue condition. In some embodiments a soft tissue condition
 includes a breast tissue condition, a facial tissue condition, a neck condition, a skin
condition, an upper arm condition, a lower arm condition, a hand condition, a shoulder
condition, a back condition, a torso including abdominal condition, a buttock condition,
an upper leg condition, a lower leg condition including calf condition, a foot condition
 including plantar fat pad condition, an eye condition, a genital condition, or a condition
effecting another body part, region or area.
[065]       Some methods of treating a skin condition comprise administering an HA

[068]      In the experiments reported herein, the impact on the stability of an HA gel
and the ingredients were shown by incorporating sodium pyruvate (i) alone in a gel
containing lidocaine, or (ii) with other additives such as acorbic acid, sodium ascorbyl
phosphate, vitagen. Throughout the examples, all rheology measurements were done at
250C. Measurements of the extrusion force, unless stated otherwise, were carried out
on gel syringes thermostated between 24 and 25 0C.

autoclaving stability

 [069]      Sodium pyruvate was incorporated into a matrix NaHA gel with lidocaine (with
 0.3% w/w lidocaine) with a content of 0.01 % w/w to 1% w/w. The gels were autoclaved.
 Extrusion force (F) was measured with 27G needle and a speed of 13 mm/min.              A Gel

 [070]      Rheological properties of the gels are followed as a function of frequency
 using a controlled stress rheometer according the following method: frequency sweep
 from 0.05Hz to 10Hz with 0.8% controlled strain. G' is elastic modulus. G" is viscous
 modulus. Tan A shows the ratio of viscous modulus to elastic modulus (it shows the
 degradation of the gel).    Table 1 shows the compositions tested and the A Tan 5 1 Hz
 obtained after autoclaving between 1200C and 1300C for 5 to 15 minutes. The results
 in Table 1 show that, at least about for these compositions, addition of pyruvate in the
 gel preserves the stability of the gel and can improve their stability above 0.25%.

[071]      The shelf-life at 450C during 60 days was tested of the formulations prepared

that, for these compositions, the addition of pyruvate in a gel helps to stabilize the gel.
The effect on tan D increase during storage at 450C is correlated to the pyruvate
content, with a stability improvement plateau reached at about 0.25 %.

Example 3:          Incorporation of sodium pyruvate to a formulation containing
Vitagen, lidocaine and autoclaving stability
[072]       Sodium pyruvate was incorporated into a matrix of NaHA gel with Lidocaine
(with 0.3% w/w lidocaine) and vitagen with a content of 0.6% w/w.            The gels were
autoclaved between 1200C and 1300C for 5 to 15 minutes. As shown in Table 3, an
increase of the stability (pH, extrusion force, tan delta) after autoclaving is observed in
compositions containing pyruvate while the composition containing Vitagen without
pyruvate is not stable during autoclaving.

 Example 4: Thermal stability of gel properties example 3
 [073]       The shelf-life at 450C over 60 days was tested of the formulations prepared in
 example 1 and the NaHA matrix with Lidocaine. The pH and rheological properties
 were followed. The addition of pyruvate to the formulation has a significant impact of the
 stability of a gel with no additive and a gel containing only Vitagen.
 [074]       As shown in FIG. 4, the addition of the Vitagen (alone) in the formulation
 leads to a pH decrease of the gel over time. Addition of pyruvate allows pH to be better
 maintained. As a result of the improved pH stability, rheological properties are better
 maintained. (FIGS. 5-8)
 Example 5: Thermal stability of the additive Vitagen present in gel of Example 3
[075]        The amount of Vitagen remaining on the autoclaved samples of Example 3
was quantified by HPLC.          Table 4 shows that addition of pyruvate to a formulation
containing Vitagen contributes to stabilize the additive during thermal stability.
