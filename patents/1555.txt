               In         general,          the      Applicant            noticed          that       the      capability           of    an
  observer               to      evaluate        the     distance          of    objects,           and therefore             the      depth
  of      field           of the        views       that      constitute          a    three-dimensional                   scenery,       is
5 based on multiple physiological                                     and psychological mechanisms connected
  to         focusing,                binocular           convergence,               binocular             parallax,            movement
  parallax,                  luminance,           size,        contrast,           aerial            perspective,            etc.       Some
  mechanisms                  may     gain      significance              compared          to     the    others         according        to
  both the                observing conditions                    (e.g.,        whether the             observer is moving or
0 still,              watching             with        one      or       two      eyes,           etc.)        as     well        as     the
  characteristics                       of   the      scenery,          these       latter          depending,           for     example,
  on whether objects with known                                   size,       distance or luminance are present,
  serving as a reference to evaluate                                        how distant the observed element of
  the scenery is.
5              In       particular,              the     Applicant            noticed          that      an     observer,          who    is
  watching                a    light      projector           through         a  window,            loses      the     capability         of
  estimating                  how     far    the projector               is    when      such       distance        is     higher       than
  five         meters              (preferably,          seven       meters),           provided          that      the     background
  surrounding                       the      projector             is        black           and       uniform.            When         such
0 circumstances are met, the                                distance          from the projector is undetermined
  by       the          observer.            The       capability             of     estimating             distances            is     lost
  because              i)      precise        focusing         of     a    blinding          light       source        is   difficult,
  which           prevents              the      observer          from        using        the       focusing          mechanism         to
  evaluate                  the      object's          distance,            and      ii)       binocular           convergence            is
  9720238_1 (GHMatte ) P99976.AU.1

                                                                    5
  scarcely              efficient           as   an    instrument      for distance         evaluation         when      the
  object             is      more      than      five     meters      away     (preferably,        seven        meters);
  moreover, the capability to estimate is lost because the other psycho
  physic            mechanisms             that    are     commonly     valid     and     efficient      in      case     of
5 high distances                    fail,      being inhibited by the absence of further points
  of reference.
               The       Applicant           further       noticed     that,     when     a   Rayleigh       diffusion
  panel is interposed between the observer and the light projector, this
  latter            being         surrounded        by a     black,    uniform background,            the       observer
0 is       induced              to   perceive         the     light    projector        virtually      at       infinite
  distance               from       him.     More      particularly,        the     effect     of   perception            at
  infinite distance is obtained whenever the observer looks at the light
  projector                through         the    Rayleigh        diffusion     panel,      and   this      latter        is
  thoroughly and uniformly lit by the projector, and the real projector
5 to-observer                    distance        is     five     meters     at    least       (preferably,           seven
  meters).              Such       effect       may be      interpreted       as   a   consequence        of     the     so
  called            "aerial          perspective",            a   perception      mechanism       induced         by     the
  Rayleigh diffusion panel. As a matter of fact, the color and intensity
  of       light           scattered          by     the    Rayleigh      diffusion        panel    are      virtually
0 identical               to the corresponding                  color and     intensity of skylight,                 where
  intensity                is     evaluated         as   relative      to   the    intensity       of   transmitted
  light.             In       particular,           the     so-called       aerial       perspective         mechanism
  relates to the presence of an air layer interposed between any objects
  and the observer;                       the color and luminance of such air layer affect the
5 estimation                   of    the       object-to-observer            distance,        the    object          being
  perceived               by the         observer       as   lying behind the           air   layer   itself;          such
  mechanism               is      dominant       at    high distances        or,     generally     speaking,           when
  the          other            psycho-physic            mechanisms        for    distance        evaluation             are
  suppressed or scarcely efficient.
0              The        Applicant            further       noticed     that     the      observer      is       led     to
  perceive              light emitted by the Rayleigh                      diffusion panel as           coming from
  a virtually                   infinite        distance,       provided that         the   spotlight        is     inside
  the         observer's              visual         field.      Such    effect       may    be   interpreted             by
  considering                   that      the    Rayleigh        diffusion      panel     acts    as   a      secondary
  9720238_1 (GHMattem)P99976.AU.1

                                                                     6
  source            of luminous              radiation,         and that the observer                can hardly         assess
  his         distance               from      the     emitting       plane     of      such      luminous         radiation
  because              of the          high     spatial       uniformity       of   luminous         radiation        itself,
  which          does          not     provide        any    visual     point     of     reference        to    look      upon.
5 Thus,          the         presence         of   the     light projector           in     the    visual      field       at    a
   (physical)                 distance of           five meters         (preferably,          seven meters)           affects
  the evaluation of the whole scenery's depth of field by "dragging" the
  estimated                   position          of     the      Rayleigh       diffusion           panel      beyond          the
  threshold of distance perception by binocular convergence. Such effect
0 is      connected to the                     luminance        of the light projector,                 and to the fact
  that, besides the Rayleigh diffusion panel, the light projector itself
  is      the         only         spatially         localized       element      perceived          by   the      observer.
  Basically,                  when looking            at the      Rayleigh      diffusion         panel,      the     eyes of
  the observer                     are    forced by the           light     projector         to   arrange       themselves
5 as       if      they          were     watching         a   very    distant       object.        The    mind      is     then
  pushed by such arrangement of the eyes to infer that the object in the
  middle            of        the     visual       field,       that   is    light      emitted        by   the     Rayleigh
  diffusion                 panel,        is    very      far    compared      to    the      real     position        of     the
  panel          itself.            Also,      the     effect     of perceiving           a   diffused-light            source
0 at great               distance from the observer                      is   favored by the fact that light
  scattered                 by      the     Rayleigh         diffusion      panel       has     the     same      color       and
  luminance                  (compared         to    transmitted         light)     typical         of   skylight.          Such
  effect,              due to the aforementioned mechanism                            of aerial         perspective,           is
  particularly                     efficient,          thereby      causing       the      light      projector          to    be
5 perceived                at virtually              infinite      distance.       The Applicant            also      noticed
  that          the          described          effect,        that     is    the     visual        perception          of     an
  infinite               depth         of    field      (from now       on   called       "breakthrough            effect"),
  takes place                    irrespective           of the     direction       of observation             through         the
  Rayleigh diffusion panel.
0              In       addition,            the Applicant          noticed      that       the    aerial      perspective
  alone          cannot            perfectly         assure      the   breakthrough            effect,     if     the     light
  projector                 is      outside       the     visual      field,     because         other     psycho-physic
  mechanisms                  prevail,         such     as    the   focusing      of     scratches        or    borders        of
  the Rayleigh diffusion panel.

                                                                             7
               Moreover,                the         Applicant               noticed           that           the        aforementioned
  breakthrough                      effect         is      reduced            whenever           the        light        projector            is
  positioned                  next      to      the      Rayleigh            diffusion            panel,          e.g.     without          any
  mirrors             or lenses             to move          afar its           virtual         image.         In    fact,      the light
5 projector's                   distance          would        be     in      this      case       easily         estimated           by    the

  despite              the        contribution              of      the      aerial        perspective.                Similarly,           the
  Applicant                 noticed            that       the        aforementioned                 breakthrough              effect          is
  reduced             whenever           the       light         projector          is     not       surrounded            by     a    black,
0 uniform background.                           In     fact,        an     observer          can      determine           the      distance
  from         a background                 other than              a   black and uniform background,                                thereby
  limiting               the        depth      of     field         of    the     whole         scenery,           in    spite        of    the
  contribution of the aerial perspective.
               BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
5              That having being                       stated,         Figure        1   shows        an artificial                lighting
  system 1,               which will be from now on referred to concisely as lighting
  system 1.
               In      detail,          lighting           system         1    comprises           a    first        light     source         2,
  preferably                  directional,              i.e.        designed          to     emit        light        in   an      emission
0 solid          angle           smaller         than       47c    sr.      Moreover,           the       first       light       source        2
  emits           light           in   the      visible           region        of     the       spectrum,            that     is      having
  wavelengths                   between          400      nm      and       700    nm.       Moreover,             the     first         light
  source            2 emits light                 (visible electromagnetic                         radiation)            with spectral
  width          AX      preferably             higher          than      100     nm,      more       preferably            higher        than
5 170nm.            Spectral width AX may be defined as                                         the      standard deviation                   of
  the first light source's wavelength spectrum.
               The       lighting            system         1    also       includes          a    first        diffuser          panel       4,
  which          is      for        example        shaped          as    a    parallelepiped.                  In    particular,            the
  first          diffuser             panel        4   is     delimited           by     a    first         surface        Si    and by         a
0 second             surface           S2 ,     parallel             to     each       other;         preferably,             the        first
  diffuser               panel        4     is     thin,         i.e.       its     thickness              w,     measured          along       a
  direction               perpendicular                to     the      first       and      the      second         surfaces          Si,    S2,
  has square value not higher than 5%, preferably 1%, of the area of the

                                                                          8
  first         and the second surfaces S1,                             S2.
               More particularly,                       in    the embodiment             shown in           Figure 1 the              first
  diffuser panel                     4 operates            as     a so-called Rayleigh diffuser,                              i.e.      as a
  panel          which          substantially               does     not     absorb       light in           the visible              range
5 and which diffuses more efficiently the short-wavelength in respect to
  the        long-wavelength                   components            of     the    impinging            light,         e.g.       a   panel
  which           substantially                does        not      absorb       light      in     the       visible          range       and
  which          diffuses             light        rays      of wavelength              X=450nm          (blue)        at     least       1.2
  times,            preferably             at      least        1.4    times,       more       preferably              at     least       1.6
0 times          more         efficiently              than       light      rays     of    wavelength                =650nm         (red),
  wherein              diffusion              efficiency             is     given        by     the       ratio          between          the
  diffused               light         radiant           power        respect         the     impinging              light         radiant
  power.            Optical           properties            and microscopic               characteristic                  of     Rayleigh
  like diffusers                     are also described in                       detail      in    the patent              application
5 EP2304478 of the                       same Applicant.                A further          insight on the microscopic
  features is also provided in what follows.
               In      the embodiment                 shown in         figure      1,    the first            light source 2 is
  vertically                 aligned to the                 first      diffuser         panel       4,     i.e.       it    lies along
  an axis H,                 which is          perpendicular              to the first            and second surfaces                      Si,
0 S2    and passes through the barycenter of these latter                                                      (in Figure 1, the
  barycenter                 of the         first        surface        Si    is   designated by                 0).      In     general,
  except            where          otherwise            stated,        in    the     present          description               the     term
  "barycenter"                    is    meant         in    its      geometric          acceptation,              instead           of    its
  physical              acceptation              (center         of mass),         hence it          is     applicable            also to
5 plane             surfaces,              and         anyway         to      objects         having            a      substantially
  infinitesimal                     thickness.             Therefore,          the     term      "barycenter"                has     to     be
  meant as "geometrical center" or "centroid" and it coincides, given an
  object            (or surface) having an infinitesimal thickness, with the center
  of       mass         of       this      latter,           calculated           under       the       assumption             that       the
0 object             has          a    uniform            density          and,       precisely,              an       infinitesimal
  thickness.                Moreover,           the first           light source 2 illuminates                           entirely the
  first          diffuser            panel        4.     Embodiments           wherein the             first       light        source        2
  is      arranged               off-axis          in     respect        to    the     barycenter             of     the      first       and
  second            surfaces            Si,     S2     are,      however,         possible,          as      described            in    what

                                                                           9
  follows.
               The        lighting           system        1    is      optically         coupled     to   an     environment,
  e.g. a room 6 shaped as a parallelepiped and delimited by a lower wall
  P1 , an upper wall P2 and four lateral walls P1 . In particular, without
5 losing generality,                        it    is   assumed that the upper wall P 2 has a cavity 8,
  which has,                 seen from above, the same shape of the first diffuser panel
  4     and        is      filled         entirely          by     this      latter.        In   any    case,      the   present
  invention                is      not     restricted            to      the     shape     and/or     arrangement         of     the
  cavity 8; as an example, according to further embodiments                                                        (not shown),
0 the         cavity           may       be     formed        within         a    lateral       wall.     Furthermore,           the
  present              invention             is     not      restricted             to   be    used    in   indoor       spaces;
  therefore,                 embodiments             are possible             in     which the lighting device                 1   is
  used as a                system for outdoor day-like                              illumination during night time.
  Therefore,                  the        lighting          system          1     can     be    coupled      to      an   outdoor
5 environment,                    i.e.     an     environment              equivalent         to  a  room,       the   walls       of
  which are either black or arranged at an infinitely large distance.
               The         lighting             system        1     comprises           a   support       element       10     that
  delimits,                together            with     the       first       surface       Si   of  the     first      diffuser
  panel          4,      an       external         volume        V which          is    external     to the        room   6;     the
0 first          light source 2 is                     placed inside the external                      volume V.        Although
  not shown, embodiments are possible in which the support element 10 is
  mechanically                    coupled to the room 6 in                         a manner such that the external
  volume V is                   delimited at least                    in    part also by a wall              of the room 6,
  as an example the upper wall P2 .
5              The support                element        10 is        internally coated by an                 internal layer
  12,         made           of       a    material           capable          of      absorbing        incident        luminous
  radiation;                 such material              is,      for      example,        a material with black color
  and coefficient                       of    absorption           higher than 70%,              preferably         higher than
   90%,       most preferably higher than 95%,                                    even most preferably higher than
0  97% in           the visible range.                     The internal              layer 12     is   aimed ad absorbing
  incident               radiation            that      comes,          for    example,        directly     from      the    first
  light          source 2,              or from reflection                   and/or scattering processes                  by the
  first         diffuser panel 4,                     or from the room 6 through the                          first     diffuser

  the first               diffuser panel 4.                     In other words, the support element                                      10 and
  the        internal             layer      12     define         a    sort       of     dark box            (or chamber) ,            wherein
  the        term        "dark"         relates         to      a    condition             of     little          illumination           and/or
5 to the            capability of absorbing the light, so as to make the box barely
  visible,                as         described            hereinbelow;                   therefore,                in      what       follows,
  reference will also be made to a dark box 10.                                                         The light          can enter/exit
  the dark box only through the first diffuser panel 4.

  Furthermore,                    as      the      size      of     nanoparticles          gets   larger,       the     ratio

  the aperture                    of    the      forward         scattering        cone   gets   smaller.       Therefore,
  the         choice           of     r     is    biased        by    the    search     for   a   compromise        between

  the observer;                    and
               -    a light ray                  IR2 generated by the first                                 light           source 2 hits the
  reflective                 system           30      a   first         time,       is      conveyed            a     first        time      onto       the
0 first            diffuser               panel            4,       is      partially               reflected                 due       to      Fresnel
  reflection                 by      the        first        surface           S1,     hits         the      reflective                system         30     a
  second            time,         is      conveyed             a    second        time        onto        the       first         diffuser          panel
  4,      crosses            the       first          diffuser           panel       4    and reaches                 the       observer          from       a
  different direction with respect to the light ray IR1.
5              In      this         case,          the       observer            would         experience                the      vision          of    two

  different               directions.                   The      first       image        is      the      image          formed by             IR1     and
  by      all        the       light           rays        close         to     IR1,       i.e.         the       light          rays      that        have
  crossed             only one             time the              first       diffuser            panel        4.      The       second        image        is
0 the image               formed by the light                            ray     IR2 and by all                     the       light rays            close
  to      IR2,         i.e.        the        rays        which,          having         been        partially               reflected            by    the
  first          surface S1 , are redirected                                by the          reflective               system         30 toward the
  observer.                 Since          Fresnel             reflection               redirects              only          a     portion            (e.g.
  about 4% per each surface of the first diffuser panel                                                                       4,    for incidence
5 nearly            perpendicular                     and     for       PMMA      material),               the        second         image        of    the
  first          light          source           2     is    weaker         than       the       first         one.         Nevertheless,               its
  luminance                is      still           very       high;        therefore,               an     observer              would        perceive
  the difference with natural                                        lighting, which is evidently characterized
  by the presence of only one image of the Sun.
0              In      a     similar            way,       should          the     aforementioned                      geometric            condition

  reflected               by      the        reflective                system        30      and       re-enter             the      room       6   after
  crossing              again          the       first         diffuser           panel         4.      In    such         case,        an    observer

  would             perceive            the     presence           of       luminous        objects         having        colors
  different                from      the     color      of the        first     diffuser         panel      4,    as   if    they
  were         arranged beyond the                     first      diffuser panel             4.    Furthermore,           due to
  the so-called backscattering,                                the     first    diffuser panel              4 itself        would
5 be        seen         by       the     observer         not     only       directly,         but     also      trough      the
  reflective                 system        30;   in     practice,          the   first      diffuser         panel     4    would
  generate a luminous spot, spatially limited by the mirror frame, which
  would spoil the uniformity of the background. In addition, an observer
  could notice the presence of the reflective system 30 because of swift
0 change            in     luminance          that could take place                    at mirror edges.             All     these
  effects would cause the lighting to appear unnatural, the image of the
  first           diffuser            panel      4    being       different          from     that      of     natural       sky.
  Moreover,               the       perception         of     objects        or  mirrors        in    the    background        of
  the          first            diffuser         panel         4    would       prevent           from      obtaining         the
5 breakthrough effect.
               That          having       being       stated,         embodiments          are     possible         where,     as
  shown in               Figure        2,    the    first      mirror        22  is     plane      and parallel           to the
  first           diffuser             panel      4     (namely parallel                to    the     first       and     second
  surfaces S1 ,                 S2),    so that the occupied volume is                       minimized.
o              Moreover,             irrespective            of the shape and the angle of inclination
  of the first mirror 22, the first light source 2 and the first mirror
  22 are arranged in such a way that, if the surface of the first mirror
  22 is         referred to as the reflecting surface Sr,                                   the barycenter 0 of the
  first         surface Si and the barycenter                            0' of the reflecting surface Sr can
5 be      connected by a                   line,     having an angle              of incidence AO with respect
  to the axis H which is between 40                                     and 65', preferably between 42' and
  50',         more          preferably          in     a    neighborhood           of     45   .   In     such     a   way,     a
  compromise is reached between minimizing the space occupied vertically
  by the lighting system 1, which decreases as the angle of incidence AO
0 gets          larger,            and     minimizing           the      light      losses        due     to     the    partial
  reflection                 which occurs at the                 first       diffuser panel 4,              which grows        as
  the         angle          of     incidence        AO     gets      larger,       in    the     hypothesis          that    the
  first diffuser panel 4 has refractive index basically equal to 1.5 and
  that         the       angle        of    incidence AO           is     higher      than     45   .   It    is   worthwhile

  plane,             the        vertical          space       occupied             by      the     lighting          system       1     is

  axis         H,       the        proportionality                 coefficient             being         close       to    1    when     the
  angle of incidence AO is close to 45'.
               The Applicant                   also       noticed that            the natural                quality of lighting
  is      further             improved           if     the     first      light        source          2    features        a   circular

  first          light           source        2    is      directional,            it      is     characterized             by    a   main
  direction,                  which        is      the       direction          of      the      absolute            maximum      of     the
  luminous              intensity,              and by         a    main plane,              here       defined        as    the plane,
  perpendicular                     to the main direction,                       in    which the             absolute maximum of

  is      the portion                  of the         main plane           where         the      luminance           along     the main
  direction is                    higher than             10% of this absolute maximum of the luminous
  intensity.                 The emitting                surface        Sf   is     called         circular           or elliptic          if
  there          exists             a   circumference               or    ellipse           enclosing            it    and     having      an

  preferably 20%, more preferably 10%.
               All       that being              said,        the     light     rays hit            the first           surface       Si   in
  corresponding                      points         of     incidence         and        form       corresponding               angles      of

  where L is                 at least equal                   to three meters             and,     preferably,            X<<L,      e.g.

  condition                 is      satisfied             also       by     the     embodiment         shown        in     Figure        1,

  panel 4 from the first light source 2 is equal to L.
                In     such         a    way,      the       light       rays     impinge       on    the     first        surface        Si
  with         almost parallel                     directions,             in    a way     similar to what                happens        in
  nature.              Furthermore,                this        condition          can   be    met      even      when       the    first

0               The Applicant                  has       further         noticed that,           in    certain         applications
   (e.g.,           in    the case where the                       first       diffuser panel 4 is                set apart          of a

                                                                       22
  the first                surface Si of a suitable distance.                           As an example,           embodiments
  are         possible,               wherein        the       illuminance        produced       by     the    first        light
  source 2 on the first                          surface Si is           substantially uniform,               owing to the
  fact that the following relationship holds true:
5  Itan(O 1 -0,)              0,5-cos(01 )
  wherein             0e is        the angle at which a further                       light ray,        which originates
  from the                barycenter           0" of the           emitting      surface      Sf of the         first       light
  source 2,                impinges         on a point of the boundary of the                          first     surface Si,
  this         point           being      the      point        among    the   points       of   the      boundary        having
0 maximum              distance          from the            barycenter      0 of       the   first       surface       SI.    The
  Applicant has further noticed that, also in this case, if the observer
  is      set       apart          from the         first       diffuser     panel      4 by a      small     distance,          it
  is      sufficient                 that    L    is     at     least   equal      to   50%,    preferably          70%,      even
  more         preferably               to      100%,         of   the   maximum        distance       between         any     two
5 points of the first surface Si.
               The          Applicant            further          noticed      that      the     natural        quality         of
  lighting                improves         whenever           the    maximum      luminance        of    the   first        light
                                                                          2                                            2
  source             2     is      greater        than        106   cd/M ,     preferably         0.1*106       cd/m ,       more
  preferably                   1*106     cd/M 2 ,      still      more    preferably         10*106      cd/M 2 . For         such
0 values, as a matter of fact, the first light source 2 generates enough
  glare           for         the      source        itself        to   be    difficult        to     look    at,       thereby
  preventing the observer from evaluating the source's distance by means
  of         the         mechanism           of        eye       focusing.       These       luminance        values         thus
  contribute to obtain the infinite breakthrough effect. Moreover, glare
5 makes             it        difficult            to        detect     possible         non-uniformities               in     the
  luminance                  profile         of      the        first    light       source      2,     thus      making         it
  difficult                to detect           differences           between      the    image      of   the    first       light
  source 2 and the image of the Sun.
               The Applicant                 also verified that the natural                        quality      of lighting
0 improves               if      the    size and shape               of the     first      light     source 2         are     such
  that,           given            a   light        ray       that    connects        the    perimeter        of      emitting

  As a matter of fact, the natural quality of lighting improves when the
  lower          values           of     such     angle       are     associated             to  the     higher        values       of
  luminance,                    this       condition            allowing           to        obtain       a    more       natural

               As shown in               Figures       5a and 5b,           independently            from the details of
  the        first          diffuser        panel       4, the        first       mirror        22   may     be    a    concavely
  curved mirror,                      such     as   a    concavely          curved mirror             having       a parabolic

0 mirror 22 may be shaped as                              a portion of a circular paraboloid,                              i.e.      a
  surface             obtained by             rotating a           generator          parabola        around       its    axis A,
  such that the intersection with any plane including the axis A defines
  the        same        generator           parabola.          In   particular,              the   portion        of    circular
  paraboloid                   is      obtained        by       splitting           a     portion        of     the      circular
5 paraboloid surface with a secant plane that crosses the axis A forming
  an      angle          different           from     9 0 0.     For    the      sake       of  brevity,        from now          on,
  reference                 is     made      to     the      circular           paraboloid,          without          mentioning
  explicitly                  that      the    mirror        is    formed        by     a     portion       of   the     circular
  paraboloid.
o              According               to    this       embodiment,             the      first      light       source        2     is
  arranged              in     the     focus of the circular                    paraboloid;          more precisely,              the
  barycenter 0" of the emitting surface Sf of the first                                                   light source 2 is
  arranged              in      the     focus     of    the      circular         paraboloid,           so    that     the    light
  rays           coming           from      that      barycenter             and       reflected          by    the      circular
5 paraboloid hit the                       first      surface Si with directions                       of propagation all
  parallel              to the axis A.              In    this way,           the observer           perceives the            first
  light            source           2    as     if    it     were       arranged            at   a   virtually           infinite
  distance,                similarly          to   what       happens         with      the     Sun,     thereby        enhancing
  the natural                  quality of lighting.                  In     other words,           the virtual           image      of
0 the first light source 2 is at infinite distance from the observer.
                Furthermore,              the     size     of the         first       light      source       2 perceived           by
  the        observer             is    given      by    the      size      of the          image    of     the    first     light
  source            2 on the retina,                and depends only on the physical                             dimension          of
  the         first          light       source       2    and     on     the      magnification             of    the    optical

                                                                       24
  telescope               system          formed by          the eye      lens       (the crystalline)            and by the
  circular paraboloid;                             such optical telescope                 system has       an    image plane
  and an object                      plane which are arranged,                     respectively,         in   the focus           of
  the         eye        lens         and        in     the    focus      of    the        circular      paraboloid.             The
5 abovementioned                      magnification             is    given     by      the   ratio     of   the      eye       lens
  focal          length to               the      circular       paraboloid          focal     length;     therefore,            the
  size of the first light source 2 as perceived by the observer does not
  depend on the                      distance          of the      observer       from lighting          system        1.      Thus,
  this         additional               condition           contributes        in      creating       a natural        lighting
0 effect,              because             the       Sun's      perceived         size       do     not   depend          on     the
  observer's position.
               The Applicant                    also      noticed      that,     if      the   emitting      surface           Sf is
  shaped as a circle, the image of the first light source 2 perceived by
  the observer                    is    still        circle     shaped,     because         the optical       system shown
5 in Figure 5a does not twist the image.
               The       embodiment               shown     in    Figure     5a     is    characterized        in     that       the
  vertical              space         occupied by             the    lighting        system      1   is  almost        equal      to
  the size of the                        first       diffuser panel           4 along the x-axis,               in     case the
  light rays reflected by the circular paraboloid hit the first diffuser
0 panel 4 at 450,                      and the abovementioned geometric condition is met.
               According to a variant,                          shown in       Figure 5a,          the first       and second
  surfaces Si and                     S2  of the first           diffuser panel 4 have an elliptic                           shape,
  such           a       shape          being          encompassed         by      the      projection        of       circular
  paraboloid 22 on the xy plane along the direction given by the axis A.
5 Therefore,                 the first            and second surfaces Si and                   S2  can be circumscribed
  by      the       luminous             spot       SP    formed by       the     circular        paraboloid        in      the xy
  plane, thereby reducing light losses. Moreover, the first mirror 22 is
  cut        so as to accept                      a   light beam having circular                     divergence,          i.e.    is
  cut in            a way          that       its    projection         on the plane orthogonal                to the           line
0 connecting the barycenter                                0" of the emitting surface Sf and the vertex
  of         the        circular              paraboloid           has    a    circular           shape,     or      at        least
  circumscribes                     a   circle with            good approximation.               However,     other shapes
  of      the        first           mirror         22    are   also     possible,          e.g.     an  elongated             shape
  along the y direction.

               The        use          of      the        circular            paraboloid              implies             that         the        light

  lighting              system           1    shown       in     Figure         5a    creates         an effect               of     large        depth

  planes            that intersect                the first          diffuser panel 4 along lines parallel
  to       the        y-axis.            In    the      following,            the     average        divergence         in      these
  latter            planes           is    referred         for     simplicity           as    divergence        along      the    y
  axis direction.
5              The embodiment                  shown       in    figure        6 allows to use a              first      diffuser
  panel          4 which             is    considerably            longer        along the y-axis            than      along the
  x-axis, thereby maximizing the area                                         of the first           diffuser panel 4 and
  so       the        angles            under     which        the     observer          perceives        the     breakthrough
  effect. More precisely,                             such a large              elongation          of the    first      diffuser
0 panel 4 is                 possible because the embodiment                              relies       upon the usage of a
  mirror            which           features         a   large        elongation            in    the    y-axis       direction,
  while           preserving               a   limited          (output)          divergence          in   the     same      y-axis
  direction.                  More        specifically,              the       Applicant          has    noticed        that      the
  perceived size of the first light source 2 along the y-axis direction,
5 i.e.        the diameter of the perceived emitting surface Sf along the y-axis
  direction,                 does        not    depend        on    the     distance         between      the     observer        and
  the         first          light         source       2,      or    it      depends         from     this    distance          very
  weakly.             Regarding             the     size      of    the     first       light      source    2    perceived        by
  the observer along the x-axis direction, it depends on the position of
0 the observer                     and decreases             with     distance.           Therefore,        with the         aim of
  assuring               that          a    circular          shape        of      the     first       light     source         2  is
  perceived,                 a light         source with an elliptic                       emitting surface             Sf can be
  adopted, wherein the eccentricity of the ellipse is fixed according to
  the expected point of observation inside the room 6.

               A     further            advantage             given        by     using           a    parabolic              cylinder              is     the
  fact         that         such        a     kind      of     mirrors          are        easy        to    be      manufactured,                     since

  perceive               the       first         light         source         2    at      far        distance,             due        to      the       fact
  that         his       eye-convergence                     operates           only        in      planes         containing                both        eyes

  happens no matter the ray divergence in the orthogonal direction is.
               In      a     different             embodiment              (not shown),                  the      lighting              system          1    is
  mounted in such a way that the first                                                diffuser panel 4 is parallel to a
  vertical wall,                      instead of a ceiling,                           in such a way that the light beam
5 from         the        first           light        source         2    enters            the        room       6    being          parallel              to

  In      this         embodiment,                the     parabolic             cylinder              is    obtained by                 translation

  different               shape.           In   particular,           as    shown     in   Figure 8,          embodiments       are
  possible              wherein            both the        first       and second mirrors                22,    24 are      shaped
  as        portions                of      two      corresponding              parabolic          cylinders,          that     are
  generated               by       generator          parabolae          that     lie     in    orthogonal         planes,      and
0 that are translated along orthogonal directions and thus perform light
  collimation                    in       orthogonal           panes.         In   the      present         embodiment,         for
  example,               the        first       mirror        22    is     similar       to    the      parabolic        cylinder
  shown          in     Figure           6,    whereas       the second parabolic                 cylinder,        which      forms
  the         second             mirror          24,     is     obtained         by     taking        a    second      generator
5 parabola               in       the       xH     plane      and      by     translating          it     along     the     y-axis
  direction, thus obtaining a beam-divergence reduction in the xH plane.
  Moreover,               the        Applicant          has     verified         that    a    good      collimation        in   all
  the        directions                for the         light     rays       reflected        by    the     second mirror         24
  towards              the        first        mirror      22     is     obtained        when      the     second      generator
0 parabola              has        its      axis     oriented         in    a   direction        substantially           parallel
  to the axis of the generator parabola of the first mirror 22, provided
  that         the       two        parabolic          cylinders          are     arranged        so that        they     share   a
  common            focus            (or,      more      precisely,           so   that      the      generator        parabolae
  share a common focus, where the position of the focus of the generator
5 parabola              of the first                mirror 22 accounts                for the reflection              by mirror
  24)        and the             first        light     source 2         is    arranged       substantially           in   such a
  common focus.
               The embodiment shown in Figure 8 enables to use a diffuser panel
  having a length along the y-axis which is considerably larger than the
0 length along the x-axis, and therefore enables to maximize the area of
  the         first           diffuser            panel      4,     the       vertical       space        occupied       by    this
  embodiment                 being          equal     to    the     one     occupied       in    case      of   square panel.
  Moreover,                 this          embodiment           enable         to    generate          a    light     beam      that
  impinges              on the           first      surface       Si with a reduced               divergence         along both

                                                                      29
  the        x-axis           and       the     y-axis       (i.e.     along       planes      that     intersect           the      xy
  plane           along           lines       that    are      parallel        to    the     x-axis       and      the     y-axis,
  respectively).                     Therefore, the transmitted light rays have a divergence
  similar             to       sunrays.          This     condition         contributes          in     creating          a    large
5 depth of field perception even when the first light source 2 is not in
  the observer's                      visual       field.      Moreover,        since the        first        light      source 2
  is      arranged               close       to    the    common      focus,        the    size     of    the      first       light
  source 2 as perceived by the observer does not depend on the distance.
  Finally,              the        illumination          of a       diffuser panel            elongated          along       the y
0 axis         direction               is     here made         possible        by    starting       from        a   light       beam
  which           impinges              on     the    second        mirror       24    with     substantially               a    same
  divergence both in the plane of incidence and in the orthogonal plane,
  i.e.         by      efficiently              using     a light        source that          generates          a    light beam
  having            a    square-like              cross-section.           This      result,      that       is    achieved by
5 performing                  the         reduction        of      the    initial          beam     divergence             in      two
  separate                steps           in     the    two        orthogonal          directions,            represents             an
  advantage                respect           to    the    case      of    a    single       parabolic           cylinder,          for
  which asymmetric beams are required, as described below.
               Irrespective of the details of the first diffuser panel 4 and the
0 reflective                 system 20,           the    first      light      source 2 may have,                 as explained
  before,             an emitting               surface       Sf with       a   circular       or    elliptic          shape.        In
  particular,                 the emitting surface Sf may have an elliptic                                    shape whenever
  the         reflective                  system      20      includes         at     least     one       paraboloid             with
  cylindrical                  symmetry,           so that       the    different          magnifications             introduced
5 along          the        x-axis          and    y-axis       are    compensated,           thus      allowing          for      the
  creation of a circle-shaped light spot on the observer's retina.
               As      shown         in     Figures      9a and 9b,           the    first     light      source         2 may be
  formed            by      a     set      of   emitting        devices        50.    Each     emitting          device       50     is
  formed            by       a      LED      source     52      and    a    corresponding           compound            parabolic

  aperture              IN and an output aperture OUT;                             the input aperture                IN and the
  output aperture OUT may be respectively shaped as a first and a second

  having an area                      smaller than the               second rectangle.             Moreover,           the     first

  symmetry than                      the     second       rectangle.          For   example,        the     first         rectangle
  has a greater                      ratio,      i.e.       it     is   more   elongated,        than the            second one.
  The         LED        source         52    may     be       formed      by   an   array      of     LED     emitters           (not

  in      such a way that                     radiation emitted by the LED                        source 52            is    coupled
  to the             CPC        concentrator            54      through      the   input      aperture         IN,       and   exits
  the output                   aperture         OUT.      Other types          of reflective            concentrators              are
  however              possible;             similarly,             light    emitting       devices        other        than     LEDs

  light beam formed by the                           summation           of all       the unit         light        beams,      this
  summation               occurring          because         of the      propagation           of    the      composite beam

  desired distance                      from the        first       light     source      2,      which      is     a   rectangle
  of      desired              area     and    shape.         Furthermore,          this       embodiment            enables      to
  create a light source having an emitting surface Sf which can have any
  shape,            e.g.        a   circular      or an elliptical                shape.        In    what       follows,       this
0 light source is referred to as "rectangular-beam source". It should be
  stressed that                     the    result    is      not    obtained by relying                  upon       a knife-cut
  aperture and imaging optics as performed, e.g.,                                              for standard, theater
  like,             stage-light              projectors,             where        the     beam         cut        causes        high
  transmission                    losses.      Therefore,          the    rectangular-beam               source        allows to
5 minimize the overall energy consumption.
               Although not                shown,    a different            embodiment           is   possible,          in    which
  the first light source comprises a plurality of emitting devices, each
  of       which           is       formed     by    a       LED     source       having        square          shape,       and    a
  corresponding                    compound      parabolic           concentrator         of a        square        type,     which
0 features a square input aperture and a square output aperture. In such
  a     way,         each         emitting      device         generates        a   square         beam,       which      has    the
  same         divergence              in    the    two       orthogonal          directions           (i.e.        in    the    two
  planes            containing             the    concentrator             axis     and,       respectively,              the    two
  axes         of      the        output      aperture         that     are     parallel          to   the       sides      of   the

                                                                       33
  output            aperture) .             In     particular,           the      present        embodiment          allows      to
  generate               a    square        beam      with      a   desired         divergence,         for     an     arbitrary
  shape          of the            emitting         surface        Sf.    In    what      follows,      this      first     light
  source will be referred to as the "square-beam source".
5              In      a     further        different          embodiment            (not shown),         the     first     light
  source            comprises            a    plurality           of    emitting         devices,        each     of    which      s
  formed by a LED source having a circular, and a corresponding compound
  parabolic                concentrator            of a circular              type     (not shown),           which features
  a     circular               input       aperture         and     a    circular         output      aperture.         In   this
0 case,            the        first        light        source        generates           a    beam     with       a    circular
  symmetry.                Therefore,             this     first       light       source        allows      to     generate       a
  circular beam with a desired divergence, for an arbitrary shape of the
  emitting surface                      Sf.     In   what     follows,         this     first      light source will be
  referred to as the "circular-beam source".
5              In      case        the    reflective           system        20   is    made     of   one     or more plane
  mirrors, or in                     case the reflective                  system 20 includes                a single mirror
  having the shape                      of     a parabolic           cylinder,         the     rectangular-beam            source
  allows            to obtain            a   luminous         spot      SP    which      is    elongated        along     the y
  axis,         i.e.         a luminous           spot SP which circumscribes                       the   first      surface Si
0 of the first                    diffuser panel 4,              the first         surface Si having the shape of
  a       rectangle                 elongated           along         the       y-axis.         In    both        cases,       the
  rectangular-beam                       source        is     oriented          so     that      its     axis      of    greater
  divergence 58 is "mapped" by the reflective system 20 onto the y-axis,
  so       as       to       reduce        the      complexity           of    the      lay-out       of     the     reflective
5 system.             In     the context of               the present           invention,         the reflector           system
  is      said         to      map     the      axis      of    greater        divergence          onto     the     y-axis     if,
  given            a     narrow         bundle        of      light        rays       including        the      carrier       ray,
  originating                  at barycenter              0" of the          emitting         surface      Sf and lying in
  the plane                of greater            divergence,           the     reflective         system      20    causes     the
0 ray bundle to cross the first diffuser panel 4 along a line tangent to
  the y-axis.                  For example,            if   the      reflective         system 20        is    such that the
  carrier             ray       is   folded        in    a   single plane,             the     rectangular-beam            source
  is      oriented with the axis of greater                                   divergence 58 parallel                  to the y
  axis.

                                                                    34
               In case the reflective system 20 comprises two mirrors having the
  shapes of parabolic cylinders having orthogonal cylinder axes, the use
  of the            square-beam              source     is   advantageous.          In    this     case,        in     fact,   it
  is      possible               to    rely     upon    the    fact    that     the     initial         divergence          of    a
5 square beam is reduced at two different distances from the first light
  source            2,      for      the    purpose      of    obtaining      a   luminous          spot       SP    elongated
  along            the        y-axis.          This     embodiment         allows       to      achieve          an     optimal
  coupling                between            commercially          available         LED       emitters,            that      are
  typically square-shaped, and the concentrators.
o              Furthermore,                in    case the reflective system                  20 comprises a mirror
  having            the       shape       of a      circular     paraboloid,          the     use    of the          circular
  beam source is advantageous. In this case, however, the light source 2
  may be made of a single                             circular      CPC,    which is         coupled to a circular
  LED         assembly,              this      solution      allowing       to   obtain         a   circular           emitting
5 surface Sf.
               Figure            10    shows      an   additional       embodiment          where       the     first      light
  source            2     is       again      formed      by   identical        CPC     concentrators               54,    their
  input          apertures             IN and output apertures                OUT being           again,       exemplarily,
  rectangular-shaped. In this case, however, a mask 60 is applied on the
0 overall              aperture           formed      by    the    output      apertures          OUT;       the      mask    60,
  which           lies         in     the     output     plane     POUT,        defines        a   mask        aperture       62,
  having a               shape which is              a rounded       rectangle        with an area               larger than
  the area               of a        single output          aperture       OUT.   In     particular,            the mask       60
  may be formed by a layer of optically absorbing material,                                                      so that the
5 radiation                 can       cross      the    output      plane     POUT        only      through           the   mask
  aperture              62.       In   this way,        the first       light    source 2 is             still       perceived
  as       having            basically           a   circular       emitting       surface         Sf.      The      Applicant
  further             noticed           that     the mask       60   does    not     substantially              distort       the
  shape of the luminous spot SP formed in the plane of first surface S1.
0              Independently from the number and the shape of the mirrors which
  form the                reflective            system     20,    the    lighting        system        1   may      include       a
  second light                    source,       which     comprises       a diffused-light               emitting         layer,

  source            2 beyond this               emitting        layer.      In   the present          description,          the
5 term "transparent"                        is   used for        indicating the            so-called       "see     through"

                                                                     36
   64 and an illuminator 66, the second diffuser panel 64 being shaped as
  a light guide side-lit by the illuminator 66, the illuminator 66 being
  formed,             as      an     example,       by    a    linear      stripe     of   LEDs     or     a    fluorescent
  tube         lamp,          so    that     light     emitted by the            illuminator         66 propagates           in
5 guided-mode                   inside       the    second       diffuser       panel     64,     which        diffuses      it
  homogeneously.                     The     second     diffuser         panel     64    may   be,       for     example,       a
  commercial                  diffuser          suitable       for    side-lighting          as,     e.g.,        "Acrylite@
  LED"         or "Plexiglas@ LED EndLighten".                             Moreover,      as   shown in          figure     11,
  the        thickness               along      the   axis      H of      the   second      diffuser          panel      64  is
0 negligible                 compared         to thickness          along a direction            K perpendicular             to
  the axis H.
               In      a     particular           configuration,           the   second     diffuser          panel      64  is
  formed            by      a     third     material         (e.g.,     a   material       chosen        from      among    the
  materials                previously            listed      with     reference        to   the      first        material),
5 wherein             microparticles               of   a   fourth      material        (e.g.,     ZnO,        TiO2 ,    ZrO 2 ,
  SiO2 ,          A1 2 0 3 )       are     dispersed;         such     third     and     fourth      material          do   not
  absorb light with wavelengths in the visible range. In particular, the
  diameters of microparticles may range from 2                                         m to 20        m.
               When in use, part of the radiation guided by the second diffuser
0 panel          64      exits        the      second     diffuser        panel    64    while     propagating           along
  the        second           diffuser          panel    64,     due    to   diffusion       by    microparticles            of
  the fourth material. Since the second diffuser panel                                              64 has negligible
  thickness                along       the      axis   H compared           to  the     direction          K,    the    second
  diffuser              panel         64    is    basically        transparent         to   radiation          propagating
5 along the                 axis      H,    but    works      as   a   diffuser       for   radiation          propagating
  along the direction K.
               Moreover, assuming that the second diffuser panel 64 is delimited
  on the upper and the lower side by a third and a fourth surface S3 , S 4,
  at least one out of such third and fourth surface S 3 ,                                           S 4 may be surface
0 finished               to       introduce        roughness.         Such     roughness       contributes             to   the
  diffusion               by       the   second       diffuser       panel     64   of the       light        generated      by
  the illuminator                      66,     the diffusion process               being virtually             homogeneous
  along          any        direction           parallel       to   the     direction      K.    In     a   per     se   known
  manner,              roughness           may     be   designed         so   that     great     part       of    the     light

                                                                      37
  generated                 by      the       illuminator          66     is      scattered             mainly        through       one
  between             the        third        and    the      fourth     surface           S 3,    S4 ,   and      in   particular
  towards the                   first        diffuser       panel     4.     In     case      at least         one between          the
  third             and          the        fourth         surface        S 3,       S4       features           roughness,           no
5 microparticles                      need to be dispersed                   in     the     second       diffuser panel             64.
  In any case, roughness may be present on both the third and the fourth
  surface            S3,      S 4 of the         second diffuser panel 64.
               In a different configuration, the second light source 68 includes
  a substantially transparent                                emitting surface,                which is         made of an OLED
0 film.          The OLED              film      is   also      capable        to     generate          diffused        light      with
  controlled                 color and intensity,                  being at the same time transparent                                 to
  the         light           that       crosses        it     along     a      direction           perpendicular              to   its
  surface.
               The         second          light       source       68    allows           to     change         the     color      and
5 intensity of the diffused-light component generated by lighting system
  1,         basically                without         changing         the        color         and      intensity            of    the
  transmitted                   component.           For     this     aim,       it     is      possible         to    act     on   the
  color          and        intensity           of    the     light emitted             by      the     second       light      source
   68.
o              For        example,            aiming       at   reproducing            the      characteristics              of    late
  afternoon light,                       a    lamp with low CCT,                e.g.      2500      K, may be used as the
  first           light           source        2;     in    this     way,        the       color       of    the      transmitted
  component                is     similar         to the       color     of     sunlight          before        sunset.       Without
  the        second           light        source       68,    the    color        of the         component          scattered        by
5  just the              first         diffuser panel 4 would be                        different          from the         color of
  the corresponding natural component. As a matter of fact, what happens
  in nature is that the sky above the observer is lit by white sunlight,
  i.e. by sunlight that has not crossed the atmosphere yet, having a CCT
  which          is      equal         approximately            to   6000      K,    a much higher               value than         the
0 lamp's            CCT.        As     a    consequence,          the    CCT of the              light       scattered by           the
  sky        above          the       observer        in    the    late      afternoon            hours      is     significantly
  higher than the CCT of the light scattered by the first diffuser panel
  4,      in      case the             first       light     source 2 that              illuminates            this     latter      has
  low         CCT.          However,            if     the      second        light         source        68      is    used,       and

                                                                        38
  particularly if the second diffuser panel                                         64 is used together with the
  illuminator                  66,    and this       latter         is    made of an ensemble of                   red,     green,
  blue         ("RGB")            LED emitters,          it     is     possible to adjust the luminous                         flux
  for        each        of such three            elements;             this    allows    for the second                 diffuser
5 panel          64 to generate a                scattered component having color                              and intensity
  which            are        such     that      the      overall            component      that       exits         the     first
  diffuser panel 4 and is scattered by the first and the second diffuser
  panel 4,               64,      has the desired color.                    In  other words,          the second source
   68     allows           for      decoupling        the       color       of the transmitted              component          from
0 the         color           of     the   scattered             component.          Moreover,         if       a     lamp     with
  adjustable                 CCT is      used as the             first       light    source     2,     the variation              of
  natural lighting at different times of the day can be reproduced.
               Other embodiments are also possible where the second light source
  68 is         placed under the first                       diffuser panel 4,              in   such a way that the
5 light generated by                      the     first        light       source     2 passes       through           the   first
  diffuser panel                     4 before passing through the second diffuser panel                                          64.
  Moreover,                 additional         embodiments               are    possible       where       the        first      and
  second diffuser panels 4, 64 are physically separated.
               Embodiments are also possible where the second light source 68 is
0 used in             the absence of the first                       diffuser panel 4,            i.e.       in    the absence
  of the Rayleigh panel. In this case the axis H is a line perpendicular
  to the diffuse-light emitting layer and crossing the barycenter of the
  diffuse-light emitting layer.
               In      view        of the    above,         all      the disclosed          embodiments             refer     to     a
5 system including                     a first       light         source,      a   diffused-light            generator          and
  a     dark         chamber,          wherein       the      diffused-light            generator         is      shaped      as     a
  layered              component          delimited           by       an    inner     surface        (facing           the    dark
  chamber)               and      an outer      surface           (facing the         room),     and the           first     light
  source             is       configured        to      emit        a    visible-light          beam,         and       the    dark
0 chamber               is       optically       coupled           to      the    room    via      the       diffused-light
  generator.                  Moreover,        the      diffused-light              generator         is      configured           to
  receive                the       visible-light             beam,          and    to    be     at       least         partially
  transparent                  to the visible-light                    beam,    and to transmit               at least         part
  of the visible-light beam, and to emit visible diffused light from the
  9720238_1 (GHMattem)P99976.AU.1

                                                                         39
  outer          surface,            and to          generate         a   transmitted            light      having      CCT  lower
  than          the         CCT       of     the       visible          diffused           light.        The     diffused-light
  generator                 may      be      substantially               free       from       chromatic         absorption      or
  reflection, i.e. from preferentially absorbing or reflecting a limited
5 portion of the visible-light spectrum with respect to another portion.
               More in particular, the CCT of the diffused light is higher than
  the CCT of the transmitted light;                                      still more in particular, the CCT of
  the        transmitted               light        is   not      greater        than the         CCT      of  the    light   beam
  generated by the                       first        light source.             Furthermore,            as   already     said,   in
0 the        context             of the        present        invention,            the     light      "transmitted"        by   an
  optical             element          is     meant      as     the portion             of the        light     rays    impinging
  onto          the        optical          element         which         cross        the     optical        element     without
  suffering                significant              angular         deviation,            e.g.     being       deviated     by   an
  angle          smaller            than       0.1'.      Therefore,           an      optical      component        is   said to
5 "transmit               at least           a portion"            of    an    impinging         light       beam whenever       it
  produces a transmitted light component.
               As explained above, the diffused-light generator may be formed by
  a     Rayleigh              diffusing            layer,       i.e.      a   layer        which      selectively        diffuses

                The      advantages                 brought          by     the       present         lighting           system        are    made
5 evident by the previous description.
                In     detail,            the present               lighting            system       allows         for an         observer       to
  perceive the existence of an unlimited space beyond the diffused-light
  generator,                 similarly               to    what        happens           in     nature       when        the      sky    and    the
  Sun         illuminate                a     room      through            a     window.           Such     result          is     due    to    the
0 presence of the dark chamber, which is coupled to the room by means of
  the        diffused-light                      generator.             The       dark       chamber         allows         for     perceiving
  an      homogeneous                  black          background              for       every       direction            along       which      the
  first            and/or            second           diffuser             panels           are      observed.             Moreover,          such
  effect            is     improved              by    adopting           a     suitable           observer-to-source                   distance
5  (and thus,                a     first         and/or         second panel-to-source                         distance),             and/or      by
  using a reflective system which reflects light rays                                                               in such a way that
  they feature a limited range of slopes.
               Furthermore,                    some     embodiments                 of the        present         invention           give    rise
  to       the         aforementioned                   breakthrough                  effect         while        limiting           the    space
0 occupied              by      the       lighting            system.            In    particular,             the      embodiment          shown
  in      Figure            2     is     an      off-axis           lighting             system,        namely         a    system       wherein
  the        light         source           and the           first        diffuser            panel       are      not      aligned,       which
  allows            to      reducing              the     space        occupied             by     the     system         itself,        without
  spoiling the quality of the illumination.
5              Eventually,                  it     is     evident           that       modifications                and     variations          can
  be      made          to      the        present           lighting             system         without          departing            from     the
  scope the present invention, as defined by the appended claims.
                For example, the position of the light source with respect to the
  focus/focuses                      of the         optical           elements            of the       reflective              system      can be
0 different                  than          those          described.                Furthermore,                instead            of,     or      in
  addition              to     a     converging             mirror,           the       reflective           system may             comprise        a
  diverging                mirror.              In    addition,              in      order        to    achieve           full      divergence
  removal,              at      least          along       the       y-axis          direction,           more       complex          shapes      of
  the mirrors                  (e.g. free-form shapes) can be considered.

  coupling the first diffuser panel 4 to a first anechoic chamber in the

5 230; and afterwards

               - measuring the luminance L2 of the first point 220, still in the
  first observation direction 230; and
0              - computing                the      difference            between       the    luminance          L2    and   the

               As shown            in     Figure        12,    the sheaf         axis 210       may coincide          with the

               As      previously             mentioned,           the     first      structure         condition       may   be
  fulfilled also by the other embodiments. Therefore, it is possible, as
0 an example,                    that     the     support        element         10  and the        inner      layer     12  are
  different               from what has been                    shown,      but anyway such as to fulfill                    the
  first          structure            condition.            As an example,            the inner        layer     12 may coat
  only a portion of the support element                                         10,   which in        turn may be formed
  in      more         than        one     piece.        To this         regard,       at  least       part     of    the   dark

  structure               may be          formed by a housing of the                      first      light source              2,   or
  by one or more screens;                                similarly,      the support           element       10 may feature
  one or more optical                            apertures,         as   an example          closed by         corresponding
  elements                which         are       matt        in    the     visible        range,       or        overlain          by
5 brickworks elements.
                The      dark         structure           300    may   further      be     configured          to     fulfill         a
  second structure condition, and namely to prevent that, when the first
  light source 2 is on, the abovementioned first background luminance is
  greater             than         a   luminance            threshold       value     equal       to   30% of         the      total
0 luminance               of       the     first        point     220   in   the    first        observation           direction
  230,           this        total         luminance           being     measured        under       the      assumption            of
  absence             of      light       rays       coming      from the      room 6,          and hence by means                  of
  the         abovementioned                   first        anechoic       chamber.       Furthermore,              embodiments
  are possible, wherein the second structure condition is fulfilled, but
5 the         first         structure            condition         no.    Furthermore,           the    second         structure
  condition may be                        fulfilled           also   by    the   other       embodiments.            Therefore,
  as an example it is possible that the support element 10 and the inner
  layer            12     are        different            from    what     has   been        shown,      but       such       as    to
  fulfill, in any way, the second structure condition.

  example,               only        a   portion           of   the    support      element         10    is      coated        by    a
  corresponding portion of the                                  inner layer,        which is         referred to as the
  absorbing                  patch         310.        The      absorbing      patch         310      has      an      absorbing

  preferably                  90%;       furthermore,             the   absorbing         patch       310     is     preferably
  edge-free               and        has     an    area      at   least     equal    to 50%,         preferably           80%,      of

  simplicity,                  reference is              made to the case in             which the second diffuser
  panel           64 and the              illuminator 66 are absent;                     furthermore,            in   Figure        14
  the        dark        structure             and      the    reflective      system        are    not     shown.        In      this
  embodiment,                    a    visual         reference        element      is      arranged         downstream             the

  first          diffuser panel 4,                    such,      as an example,            a reflecting surface 320,
  which           is     delimited            by    an     edge      and    is     arranged     so   that     at  least    one
  portion             of      it     is    lit,       together          with     a    corresponding        portion     of  the
  edge,            by       the       light        generated            by     the      first    light      source     2   and
5 transmitted                    by     the      first        diffuser          panel      4.   This    portion       of   the
  reflecting                 surface         320 has         an area        at least        equal   to    50%,   preferably
  70%,          even more preferably                        100%,      of the area          of  the entire       reflecting
  surface             320.        Furthermore,             this      portion        of the     reflecting       surface    320
  is      such that the                   shortest path among the optical paths                             connecting the
0 first          light source 2 to the reflecting                                  surface 320      has a length equal
  to      at       least          50%,     preferably            70%,      even     more     preferably       100%,    of  the
  maximum              distance            between           any     two      points       of   this    portion       of   the
  reflecting surface 320.
                As shown in Figure 15, the visual reference element may be formed
5 by      a     diaphragm 350                 between         two     rooms,       which    delimits      a   corresponding
  aperture,                which         puts      the      two     rooms       in    optical    communications.          This
  aperture              thus        forms       an immaterial              surface       (with the     exception       of the
  edge)            and       has       a   respective             portion,          delimited      by    a    corresponding
  portion              of       the      edge,        which       fulfills         the     requirements        mentioned      a

  reflecting surface 320.
                In practice, referring to the embodiments shown in Figures 14 and
  15,        it      occurs         that,        the      closer       to   one     is   the   ratio    of the      speed at
  which the observer moves to the speed at which he sees the first light
5 source            2 moving with respect                       to the visual reference                 (the edge      of the
  abovementioned portions of the reflecting surface 320 and the aperture
  of the diaphragm 350),                             i.e.      the     closer to the visual             reference      is  the
  observer,                the      greater         is     the     depth       effect      induced     by    the   so-called
  motion             parallax.             Furthermore,               the      abovementioned          portions      of    the
0 reflecting                 surface         320      and of        the     aperture       of the     diaphragm      350   may
  have narrow areas,                        as an example equal                    to 1/10,     preferably       3/10,    even
