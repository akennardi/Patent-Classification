FIELD
[0002]          The present technology generally relates to a decorative lighting apparatus.
Specifically, embodiments of the present technology relate to a decorative laser light
apparatus.
BACKGROUND
[0003]          Lighting is often used in a decorative manner. For example, many people
decorate homes, offices, stores, outdoor spaces, etc. with various lighting to achieve certain
effects, designs, atmospheres, festive moods, etc. Although decorative lighting may be used
at any time of the year, many people utilize decorative lighting during certain holidays.
[0004]          There are many types of decorative lighting. For example, string lights,
character lights, and laser lights are just a few of the various forms of decorative lighting.
However, existing laser lights having numerous shortcomings in their design and
functionality. For example, switch mechanisms used to control the operation of many laser
lights are typically limited in their functionality and are often disposed in inconvenient
locations. This can make accessing the switch and operating the decorative light difficult,
especially when the light is positioned for use. Additionally, although the lasers used in the
decorative lights can be dangerous, many decorative laser lights use unreliable adhesives
and tapes that a prone to failure to affix lenses that scatter the light emitted by lasers.
[0005]          The inventor has invented a new decorative lighting apparatus.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0037]           Embodiments of the present technology generally relate to a decorative
lighting apparatus. Specifically, certain exemplary embodiments of the present technology
provide various new and novel features for a decorative lighting apparatus, such as a
decorative laser lighting apparatus. Although the embodiments of the present technology are
primarily described with respect to a decorative laser lighting apparatus, it is not limited
thereto, and it should be noted that the exemplary apparatus and systems described herein
may be used in connection with any decorative lighting apparatus.
[0038]           In accordance with embodiments of the present technology there is provided a
decorative lighting apparatus (shown in at least Figures 1 and 2 at 100 and described herein)
which comprises: at least one light source 106 generating a light; an attenuation assembly
620 (shown in at least Figure 6A and described in detail herein) including: at least one
attenuator 606; and a first member 602 coupled to a second member 610, the first member
                                                  7

602 and the second member 610 forming at least one recess designed and dimensioned to
receive and hold the at least one attenuator 606 in at least one of a first path of a first light
being generated by a first laser light source and a second path of a second light being
generated by a second laser light source, such that the at least one attenuator 606 scatters
the at least one of the first light and the second light passing through the at least one
attenuator 606 when projected onto a surface.
[0039]           In some embodiments the first member 602 is a first housing member and the
second member 610 is a second housing member which are configured to hold the
attenuator 606 in a substantially fixed position; and there is further provided a base member
604 configured to be coupled to a second base member 608, the arrangement being such
that when the first base member 604 is coupled to the second base member 608, the first
and second base members form a further recess designed and dimensioned to receive and
hold the coupled first housing member and second housing member in a substantially fixed
position.
[0040]           In some embodiments there is provided a motion assembly 500 shown in at
least Figure 5B and described herein, which includes: an articulating element (which may be
an articulating optical element 510) coupled to the attenuator 606; and a motor 502 coupled
to the articulating (optical) element 510 via a linkage (which may be in the form of connecting
shaft 504) such that a movement generated by the motor 502 is imparted to the articulating
(optical) element 510 so that the light passing through the attenuator is articulated when
projected onto a surface.
[0041]           In some embodiments the at least one light source 106 is a laser light source;
and a first laser light source is configured to generate a first light having a first color; a second
laser light source is configured to generate a second light having a second color, and there is
a switch 108 provided including a first setting (shown in Figure 3C and described herein)
corresponding to the first light source being in an on condition and the second light source
being in an off condition, and a second setting (shown in Figure 3B and described herein)
corresponding to the first light source and the second light source being in an on condition;
wherein the attenuation assembly 620 positions the attenuator 606 in a path of the light
generated by the at least one light source.
[0042]           In some embodiments there is provided a visual indicator 114 shown in at
least Figure 4 and described herein, wherein the visual indicator corresponds to an operation

                                                  8

[0043]           In accordance with embodiments of the present technology, Figure 1 shows a
perspective view of an exemplary decorative lighting apparatus 100. As shown in Figure 1,
decorative lighting apparatus 100 may include body 102, mounting element 104, one or more
light sources 106, switch 108, and light sensor 116. According to one embodiment, in
operation, decorative lighting apparatus 100 is positioned via mounting element 104 and is
coupled to a power source. A user can then actuate switch 108 to control the operation of
decorative lighting apparatus 100. When decorative lighting apparatus 100 is turned on via
switch 108, light sources 106 are activated to produce light, and decorative lighting apparatus
100 thereby emits and projects the light generated by light sources 106 onto a target, such as
a wall of a house or other structure. According to certain embodiments of the present
technology, the light generated by light sources 106 passes through a light attenuator to
attenuate the light being emitted and projected by decorative lighting apparatus 100.
[0044]           According to embodiments of the present technology, decorative lighting
apparatus 100 can generate any combination of colored light depending on the light
source(s) 106 employed by decorative lighting apparatus 100. For example, light source(s)
106 may include one or more light sources all producing the same color light (e.g., green) so
that decorative lighting apparatus 100 only emits and projects one color light. Alternatively,
light source(s) 106 may include multiple light sources capable of producing lights of various
colors so that decorative lighting apparatus 100 can generate multiple different colored lights
(e.g., red light and green light). Although the embodiments of the present technology are
primarily described with respect to a decorative laser lighting apparatus generating two
different colored lights (i.e., red light and green light), it is not limited thereto, and it should be
noted that the exemplary apparatus and systems described herein may generate any
combination of any number of different colored lights.
[0045]           As shown in Figure 1, body 102 may be cylindrical in shape and preferably
houses the mechanical and electrical components of decorative lighting apparatus 100. For
example, body 102 may include housing 112, light source(s) 106, light cover 110, switch 108,
switch visual indicator 114, and light sensor 116. Inside housing 112, body 102 may house
electronic circuitry (not shown) that enables the electrical operation of decorative lighting
apparatus 100, as well as various mechanical components (not shown) that facilitate the
design and operation of decorative lighting apparatus 100. According to certain
embodiments of the present technology, as shown in Figure 5A, decorative lighting apparatus
                                                   9

100 may also include a motion switch 118 to control a motion, modulation, or articulation of
light source(s) 106.
[0046]          As shown in Figures 1 and 2, body 102 may be coupled to pivoting arm 105
via a coupling element 116. According to certain embodiments of the present technology,
coupling element 116 may include a nut and a hand screw, as shown in Figure 2. For
example, projection 103 of body 102 may include a nut disposed within a recess which may
prevent the nut from rotating, and pivoting arm 105 may include an opening through which
the hand screw may pass. To secure pivoting arm 105 to body 102, the hand screw can
pass through the opening in pivoting arm 105 and engage the nut disposed in projection 103
of body 102. Further, coupling element 116 may also allow body 102 to be rotatably adjusted
relative to pivoting arm 105. For example, the surfaces of projection 103 and pivoting arm
105 which contact each other may be toothed or geared so that body 102 can be rotatably
adjusted relative to pivoting arm 105 in discrete positions. Alternatively, the contacting
surfaces can be smooth such that body 102 can be rotatably adjusted relative to pivoting arm
105 through a full range of motion. In operation, when the hand screw and the nut of
coupling element 116 are not fully tightened, body 102 can be rotatably adjusted relative to
pivoting arm 105 so that the angle at which the light is projected can be adjusted. After body
102 is positioned in a desired angle relative to pivoting arm 105, the hand screw of coupling
element 116 can be tightened so that body 102 is substantially fixed relative to pivoting arm
105. Although coupling element 116 is shown as a screw and a nut, coupling element 116
can include any mechanism by which the angle of body 102 can be adjusted and fixed
relative to pivoting arm 105, such as a hinge, or the like. According to certain embodiments
of the present technology, body 102 is rotatably adjustable relative to pivoting arm 105 via a
single pivoting point.
[0047]          As shown in Figures 1 and 2, to facilitate positioning of decorative lighting
apparatus 100 in a desired location and position, mounting element 104 is coupled to pivoting
arm 105. According to certain embodiments, mounting element 104 and pivoting arm 105
can include complementary threads configured to engage each other to couple mounting
element 104 and pivoting arm 105, allowing mounting element 104 and pivoting arm 105 to
be screwed together. Alternatively, mounting element 104 and pivoting arm 105 can be
coupled via any coupling engagement, such as a locking nut, an engaging projection and
recess, etc. As shown in Figure 1, according to certain embodiments of the present
technology, mounting element 104 may include a ground stake. This can enable decorative
                                                10

lighting apparatus 100 to be positioned outside by positioning and securing decorative
lighting apparatus 100 in a material such as soil, grass, dirt, etc. by inserting the mounting
element 104 into such material. Although mounting element 104 is shown as a ground stake
in Figure 1, alternatively, mounting element 104 can be any mechanism that facilitates
positioning decorative lighting apparatus 100. For example, mounting element 104 may
include a bracket, a clip, a platform, or any other mechanism by which decorative lighting
apparatus 100 may be located and/or positioned in a desired location.
[0048]          As noted above, the operation of decorative lighting apparatus 100 can be
controlled using switch 108. Although switch 108 is shown as a button, switch 108 can be
any type of switch that can control the operation of decorative lighting apparatus 100, such
as, e.g., a rocker switch, a toggle switch, a dimmer switch, a rotating switch, and the like.
Preferably, switch 108 is disposed on a top portion of body 102 to facilitate easy access to
the switch by a user. For example, if decorative lighting apparatus 100 is placed outdoors in
a discreet location, such as behind bushes or some other structure, locating switch 108 on a
top portion of body 102 enables a user to easily access switch 108 and operate decorative
lighting apparatus 100. According to one embodiment, switch 108 may include weather
proofing elements to protect switch 108, as well as other internal components of decorative
lighting apparatus 100, from the exterior environment, including weather. For example,
weather-proofing elements for switch 108 may include rubber, plastic, and/or other sealing
elements to make it substantially waterproof, water-repellant, dirt-proof, and the like. As
shown in Figure 7, according to one embodiment, waterproofing switch 108 may include a
rubber or plastic cover 109 that can be disposed over switch 108. For example, switch 108
can be received within cover 109 to protect switch 108 from water and other environmental
elements. Cover 109 may include a main body 109a, within which switch 108 may be
received, and an extension 109b. Extension 109b may be sealed on an interior surface of
housing 112 to prevent water and other environmental elements from penetrating within the
interior of housing 112, thereby protecting switch 108 and the interior of housing 112 from
water and other environmental elements.
[0049]          As shown in Figure 3A, according to certain embodiments of the present
technology, switch 108 may include a rocker switch having switch portions 108a and 108b.
As shown in Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C, switch 108 may include three positions and may be
articulated between the various positions by pressing on switch portion 108a or 108b to
articulate the switch in the directions depicted by arrows A and B.
                                                 11

[0050]          According to certain embodiments of the present technology, Figure 3A shows
switch 108 in an OFF position. In this OFF position, neither switch portion 108a nor 108b is
depressed, and light sources 106 are in an off condition (i.e., not generating light) and
decorative lighting apparatus 100 is therefore not emitting or projecting any light. In the OFF
position, either switch portion 108a or 108b can be pressed in the directions depicted by
arrows A and B, respectively, to articulate switch 108 into one of two ON positions.
[0051]          Figure 3B shows switch 108 in a first ON position. In the position shown in
Figure 3B, switch 108 may have been articulated from the OFF position shown in Figure 3A
in the direction shown by the arrows. Specifically, the movement of switch portion 108b is
shown by arrow A and the movement of switch portion 108a is shown by arrow B. For
example, from the OFF position shown in Figure 3A, switch portion 108b may have been
pressed to articulate switch 108 from the OFF position to this first ON position as shown in
Figure 3B. According to certain embodiments of the present disclosure, in this first ON
position, decorative lighting apparatus 100 may be operating in a first operating mode. For
example, in an embodiment where light sources 106 produce red light and green light, this
first ON position of switch 108 may correspond to an operation of decorative lighting
apparatus 100 where light sources 106 producing both red light and green light are turned on
so that decorative lighting apparatus 100 emits and projects both red light and green light.
[0052]          Figure 3C shows switch 108 in a second ON position. In the position shown in
Figure 3C, switch 108 may have been articulated from the OFF position in the direction
shown by the arrows. Specifically, the movement of switch portion 108b is shown by arrow A
and the movement of switch portion 108a is shown by arrow B. For example, from the OFF
position shown in Figure 3A, switch portion 108a may have been pressed to articulate switch
108 from the OFF position to this second ON position as shown in Figure 3C. According to
certain embodiments of the present disclosure, in this second ON position, decorative lighting
apparatus 100 may be operating in a second operating mode. For example, in an
embodiment where light sources 106 produce red light and green light, this second ON
position of switch 108 may correspond to an operation of decorative lighting apparatus 100
where only the light sources 106 which only produce green light are turned on so that
decorative lighting apparatus 100 emits and projects only green light.
[0053]          Figure 4 shows a top view of decorative lighting apparatus 100, including a
view of body 102, switch 108, and switch visual indicator 114. As shown in Figure 4,
according to certain embodiments of the present technology, switch visual indicator 114 may
                                               12

include portions 114a, 114b, and 114c. Portions 114a, 114b, and 114c can include visual
indicators that correlate the position of switch 108 to the operating modes of decorative
lighting apparatus 100. For example, portion 114b may include a green color and portion
114c may include a red color. These colors may correspond to the first operating mode
described with respect to Figure 3B, where decorative lighting apparatus 100 emits and
projects both green light and red light. Accordingly, articulating switch 108 toward the side of
visual indicator 114 which includes green portion 114b and red portion 114c can activate the
light sources 106 which produce green light and red light. Thus, articulating switch 108 in this
direction would turn decorative lighting apparatus 100 on to emit and project both red light
and green light. Further, portion 114a may include only a green portion and may correspond
to the second operating mode of decorative lighting apparatus 100 described above with
respect to Figure 3C. Similarly, articulating switch 108 towards the side of visual indicator
114 which only includes green portion 114a can activate only the light sources 106 which
produce green light, thereby activating decorative lighting apparatus 100 to emit and project
only green light.
[0054]          Light sensor 116 can also control the operation of decorative lighting
apparatus 100 in conjunction with switch 108. According to certain embodiments of the
present technology, light sensor 116 measures the ambient light present and can control
whether light sources 106 are on or off. For example, assuming that switch 108 is in one of
the two operating modes described above, light sensor may turn the appropriate light sources
106 on or off depending on the level of ambient light measured by light sensor 116. During
the day, when light sensor 116 measures a level ambient light above a certain predetermined
threshold, light sensor 116 may turn light sources 106 off, regardless of the position of switch
108. When the level of ambient light measured by light sensor 116 drops below the
predetermined threshold (e.g., as it becomes night), light sensors 116 may allow light sources
106 to operate as dictated by switch 108. Accordingly, the operation of light sensor 116 can
extend the lifetime of decorative lighting apparatus 100, prevent overheating of decorative
lighting apparatus 100, and provide energy savings by ensuring that decorative lighting
apparatus 100 is not operating continuously during high levels of ambient light when the light
emitted and projected by decorative lighting apparatus 100 may be difficult to see in any
event.
[0055]          As shown in Figure 5A, according to certain embodiments of the present
technology, decorative lighting apparatus 100 may also include a motion switch 118. Similar
                                                 13

to switch 108, motion switch 118 may also be disposed on a top portion of body 102 to
enable a user to easily access switch 118, especially while decorative lighting apparatus 100
is positioned in use where access to other portions of decorative lighting apparatus 100 may
be hindered or difficult. Motion switch 118 may also optionally include weather-proofing
elements to protect motion switch 118, as well as other internal components of decorative
lighting apparatus 100, from the exterior environment, including weather. For example,
weather-proofing elements for motion switch 118 may include rubber, plastic, and/or other
sealing elements to make it substantially waterproof, dirt-proof, and the like.
[0056]           As noted above, motion switch 118 may control any visual and/or optical effect
that can be produced by decorative lighting apparatus 100, such as a motion, modulation, or
articulation of the light produced by light source(s) 106. For example, motion switch 118 may
turn on and off the various visual and/or optical effects produced by decorative lighting
apparatus 100, such as pulsing light sources 106, activating the colored lights being
produced by light sources 106 in a pattern (e.g., first red, then green, then red, the together,
etc.), moving the light being emitted and projected by decorative lighting apparatus 100.
Moving the light being emitted and projected by decorative lighting apparatus 100 may be
achieved by moving a reflective element within decorative lighting apparatus 100 so that the
light projected by decorative lighting apparatus 100 on a target surface moves.
[0057]           Figure 5B shows an exploded view of motion assembly 500 according to an
embodiment of the present technology. According to an embodiment, motion assembly 500
may enable the movement, modulation, and/or articulation of the light which is controlled by
motion switch 118. As shown in Figure 5B, according to an embodiment of the present
technology, motion assembly 500 may include a motor 502, a connecting shaft 504, gears
506 and 508, articulating optical elements 510, articulating covers 512, a fixed optical
elements seat 514, fixed optical elements 516, and fixed covers 518. Articulating optical
elements 510 and/or fixed optical elements 516 may include attenuators as described herein
and may be disposed in gears 508 or fixed optical elements seat 514 and secured via
articulating covers 512 or fixed covers 512. Articulating optical elements 510 and fixed
optical elements 516 may include any type of optical component, such as a lens, a diffracting
element, an attenuator, etc., and may be disposed within a recess of gears 508 and fixed
optical elements seat 514 and secured via articulating covers 512 and fixed covers 518,
respectively. Motion switch 118 may control activation of motor 502. Once activated, motor
502 may provide a rotating or oscillating motion which may be transferred via a linkage, such
                                                 14

as connecting shaft 504, to gear 506. The rotating or oscillating motion provided by motor
502 may rotate or oscillate gear 506, which may in turn rotate or oscillate gears 508. As
shown in Figure 5B, articulating optical elements 510 may be secured within recesses of
gears 508. Alternatively, articulating optical elements 510 may be secured on a separate
component which may be coupled to gears 506 and/or 508 and thereby articulated via the
coupling mechanism to gears 506 and/or 508. Accordingly, optical elements 510 may then
be rotated or oscillated in accordance with the rotating and/or oscillating motion of gears 508.
[0058]           In operation, when light sources 106 can be turned on via switch 108, and the
motion, movement, modulation, and/or articulation or the light is activated via motion switch
118. Once light sources 106 are turned on, the light generated by light sources 106 passes
through articulating optical elements 510, which are articulated by motor 502. Accordingly,
as the light passes through articulating optical elements 510, the light is articulated, in
accordance with the motion provided by motor 502, on the surface onto which decorative
lighting apparatus 100 is projecting the light. For example, if the light is being projected on a
wall, the articulation of the articulating optical elements 510 may cause the light to move
across the surface of the wall. For example, the light may rotate in a circular manner, the
light may oscillate linearly or rotationally about an axis, etc. on the surface on which the light
is being projected. Further, articulating optical elements 510 and/or fixed optical elements
516 may include optical features to scatter, or create patterns in the light being projected.
[0059]           Figure 6A shows an exploded view of attenuator assembly 620 of decorative
lighting apparatus 100 according to certain embodiments of the present technology. As
shown in Figure 6A, attenuator assembly 620 includes attenuator lower housing 602,
attenuator lower base 604, attenuators 606, attenuator upper base 608, attenuator upper
housing 610, and fastening elements 612 and 614. Attenuator assembly 620 positions and
secures attenuator 606 in the path of the light generated by light source 106 within body 102
of decorative lighting apparatus 100. According to some embodiments of the present
technology, optical elements 510 and/or fixed optical elements 516 shown in Figure 5B may
include attenuator 606, and attenuator assembly 620 may be used in conjunction with motion
assembly 500, as shown and described with respect to Figure 5B. Although Figure 6A shows
decorative lighting apparatus 100 only having two attenuators 606, decorative lighting
apparatus 100 preferably includes an attenuator 606 for each light source 106 included in
decorative lighting apparatus 100. Thus, if decorative lighting apparatus 100 were to include
five light sources 106, decorative lighting apparatus 100 would preferably include five
                                                   15

attenuators 606. Accordingly, embodiments of the present technology contemplate
modifications to attenuator assembly 620 shown in Figure 6A to accommodate any number of
attenuators 606 that may be required in view of the number of light sources 106 employed by
decorative lighting apparatus 100.
[0060]           According to certain embodiments of the present technology, attenuators 606
can include any type of attenuating device to be placed in the path of the light generated by
light sources 106. For example, attenuator 606 can include an opening/slit or a lens to
diffract and/or scatter the light produced by light source 106. Alternatively, attenuators can
include an optical attenuator (e.g., fixed, variable, etc.) to reduce the power of the light
produced by light sources 106. Attenuators may be necessary where light sources 106
include lasers since lasers can be dangerous and can cause damage to eyesight. Although
attenuator 606 is shown to be substantially square, attenuator 606 may be any shape, such
as a circle, rectangle, triangle, hexagon, octagon, or any other shape. Figure 6B shows an
exemplary scatter pattern 690 that may be employed by attenuator 606. Attenuator 606 is
not limited to the scatter pattern 690 shown in Figure 6B. Attenuator 606 may include any
scattering or attenuating elements therein.
[0061]           As shown in Figure 6A, attenuator assembly 620 includes attenuator 606
disposed between upper and lower attenuator bases 604 and 608, which is disposed
between upper and lower attenuator housings 602 and 610. Upper and lower attenuator
bases 604 and 608 can include complementary designs and, when coupled together,
preferably form a recess shaped and configured to receive attenuator 606 such that
attenuator 606 is held in a substantially fixed position. Similarly, upper and lower attenuator
housings 602 and 610 can include complementary designs and preferably include a recess,
when coupled together, shaped and configured to receive the assembled upper and lower
attenuator bases 604 and 608 such that the assembled upper and lower attenuator bases
604 and 608 are held in a substantially fixed position. The assembled attenuator assembly
620 can be held together and mounted within housing 112 by fastening devices 612 and 614.
Although fastening devices 612 and 614 are shown as screws, fastening devices 612 and
614 may include any type of mechanism that can hold attenuator assembly 620 together
and/or mount attenuator assembly 620 within housing 112 of body 102, such as snap-fits,
adhesives, glue, screws, bolts, Velcro, hinges or any other fastening mechanisms.
Accordingly, fastening devices 612 and 614 can secure attenuator assembly 620 together
and position attenuator 606 in the path of the light generated by light sources 106.
                                                 16

[0062]           According to certain embodiments of the present technology, decorative
lighting apparatus 100 may include an anti-theft device. For example, decorative lighting
apparatus 100 may include an anti-theft device that includes a proximity sensor disposed
within decorative lighting apparatus 100 and a base unit that may be disposed in a secure
location, such as inside a home. The anti-theft device may be configured that the proximity
sensor disposed within decorative lighting apparatus 100 and the base unit must remain
within a certain distance to each other for decorative lighting apparatus 100 to be operable. If
the distance between the proximity sensor with decorative lighting apparatus 100 and the
base unit exceeds a certain threshold distance (e.g., if decorative lighting apparatus 100 had
been placed outside and is stolen and removed from the premises), anti-theft device
preferably renders decorative lighting apparatus 100 inoperable. Alternatively or additionally,
once the anti-theft device is activated, decorative lighting apparatus 100 may also include an
audio and/or visual alerting mechanism, such as flashing lights, emitting a sound, etc. The
anti-theft device may include other features, such as a key-pad to enable utilizing a security
code, a biometric sensor, a motion sensor, etc.
[0063]           According to yet another embodiment of the present technology, decorative
lighting apparatus 100 may include a solar power module configured to power decorative
lighting apparatus 100. For example, decorative lighting apparatus 100 may include solar
panels, such as photovoltaic panels, which can convert solar energy into electricity and store
the electricity in a storage medium, such as batteries or capacitors, which can then be used
to power decorative lighting apparatus 100. This can remove the need for decorative lighting
apparatus 100 to be connected to an external power supply by, for example, having to run
extension cords to the location of decorative lighting apparatus 100. Accordingly, this can
enable decorative lighting apparatus 100 to be more easily placed and positioned in virtually
any location.
[0064]           The embodiments and examples shown above are illustrative, and many
variations can be introduced to them without departing from the spirit of the disclosure or from
the scope of the appended claims. For example, elements and/or features of different
illustrative and exemplary embodiments herein may be combined with each other and/or
substituted with each other within the scope of the disclosure. For a better understanding of
the disclosure, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive
matter in which there is illustrated exemplary embodiments of the present technology.
