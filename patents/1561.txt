                                       BACKGROUND
[0005] Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation of
abnormal, cancer, cells derived from normal tissue. The uncontrolled growth and
proliferation can lead to the cancer cells invading adjacent tissues. In some instances, the
cancer cells can enter the lymphatic or circulatory system of an animal, spreading, i.e.
metastasizing, to regional lymph nodes and to distant sites.
[0006] Many types of cancers are associated with angiogenesis, i.e. the process of new
blood vessel formation from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis is a normal process, for
example, during growth, development, wound healing, and in granulation tissue.
However, it is also a fundamental step in tumorigenesis. In addition to its role in cancers,
angiogenesis is implicated in the pathologies of numerous other diseases. For example,
angiogenesis has been linked to proliferative retinopathies, age-related macular
degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriasis.
10007] There are two types of angiogenesis: intussusceptive angiogenesis and sprouting
angiogenesis. Intussusceptive angiogenesis, also known as splitting angiogenesis, involves
the repeated addition of transcapillary pillars in existing tumor vessels. In Intussusceptive
angiogenesis, the capillary walls extend into the lumen and split a single vessel into two
vessels. Sprouting angiogenesis the process by which new blood vessels grow from
existing ones. Sprouting angiogenesis is a ubiquitous phenomenon in health and disease.
It plays a pivotal role in diverse processes from embryo development to wound healing to
tumor growth.
10008] Regarding tumor angiogenesis, it has been shown that solid tumor growth depends
on successful neovascularization and several factors. The most notable class of factors are
the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). VEGFs were first described as a potent
vascular permeability factor (VPF) secreted by tumor cells that stimulate a rapid and
reversible increase in microvascular permeability without mast cell degranulation or
endothelial cell damage. VEGF is a potent mitogen for vascular endothelial cells which
has been reported as a pivotal regulator of both normal and abnormal angiogenesis. Ferrara
and Davis-Smyth (1997) Endocrine Rev. 18:4-25; Ferrara (1999) J. Mol. Med. 77:527
543. Compared to other growth factors that contribute to the processes of vascular

formation, VEGF is unique in its high specificity for endothelial cells within the vascular
system. VEGF has also been suggested to be essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis. Carmeliet et al. (1996) Nature 380:435-439;Ferrara et al. (1996) Nature
380:439-442. Furthermore, VEGF is required for the cyclical blood vessel proliferation in
the female reproductive tract and for bone growth and cartilage formation. Ferrara et al.
(1998) Nature Med. 4:336-340; Gerber et al. (1999) Nature Med. 5:623-628.
[0009] In addition to being an angiogenic factor in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis,
VEGF is a pleiotropic growth factor that exhibits multiple biological effects in
physiological processes. For example, VEGF effects endothelial cell survival, vessel
permeability and vasodilation, monocyte chemotaxis and calcium influx. Ferrara and
Davis-Smyth (1997), supra. Recent studies also report mitogenic effects of VEGF on non
endothelial cell types, such as retinal pigment epithelial cells, pancreatic duct cells, and
Schwann cells. Guerrin et al. (1995) J. Cell Physiol. 164:385-394; Oberg-Welsh et al.
(1997) Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 126:125-132; Sondell et al. (1999) J. Neurosci. 19:5731
5740.
[0010] VEGF has also been implicated in the disease development that involves
pathological angiogenesis. For example, VEGF mRNA has been shown to be
overexpressed in human tumors. Berkman et al. J Clin Invest 91:153-159 (1993); Brown
et al. Human Pathol. 26:86-91 (1995); Brown et al. Cancer Res. 53:4727-4735 (1993);
Mattern et al. Brit. J. Cancer. 73:931-934 (1996); and Dvorak et al. Am J. Pathol.
 146:1029-1039 (1995). Also, VEGF concentration in eye fluids is highly correlated to the
presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetes and other
ischemia-related retinopathies. Aiello et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 331:1480-1487 (1994).
Furthermore, studies suggest choroidal neovascular membrane localization of VEGF in
patients affected by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Lopez et al. Invest.
Ophtalmo. Vis. Sci. 37:855-868 (1996).
[0011] Because VEGF is a primary regulator of angiogenesis in pathological conditions
has led to numerous attempts to block VEGF activities. Inhibitory anti-VEGF receptor
antibodies, soluble receptor constructs, antisense strategies, RNA aptamers against VEGF
and low molecular weight VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors have been
developed to interfere with VEGF signaling. Siemeister et al. Cancer Metastasis Rev.
17:241-248 (1998). Specifically. anti-VEGF antibodies have been shown to block the
                                               I

VEGF cascade and suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines. Kim et al.
Nature 362:841-844 (1993); Warren et al. J. Clin. Invest. 95:1789-1797 (1995); Borgstrom
et al. Cancer Res. 56:4032-4039 (1996); and Melnyk et al. Cancer Res. 56:921-924 (1996).
Furthermore, anti-VEGF antibodies have also been shown to inhibit intraocular
angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders. Adamis et al. Arch. Opthalmol.
114:66-71 (1996). Accordingly, anti-VEGF antibodies such as bevacizumab (Avastin@;
Genentech), a humanized anti-VEGF antibody, have been widely studied and used in the
treatment of tumors and VEGF-associated disorders. VEGF polypeptides belong to the
PDGF family of growth factors and are perhaps the most important players that regulate
vessel formation. VEGFs are encoded by a family of genes that includes VEGF-A, -B, -C,
-D and Placental growth factor (PIGF). They are dimeric cysteine-linked secreted
glycoproteins with a molecular weight of ~40 kDa. Produced in response to hypoxia,
specific growth and differentiation factors, and by oncogenes, VEGFs are produced by
many cell types including tumor cells. In tumors, VEGF-A appears to be the most potent
angiogenic factor of the vascular growth factors, and its secretion has been shown to be
critical for tumor growth. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that control angiogenesis,
and in particular that control VEGF-A expression, are of paramount importance in tumor
biology.
[0012] It has been suggested that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signal transduction is
implicated in VEGF production. FAK is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase localized
to cell substratum-extracellular matrix (ECM). In adherent cells, FAK is often associated
with integrins at focal adhesions. Schaller et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
89:5192-5196. Numerous other signaling proteins, including other protein tyrosine
kinases are associated with FAK at these regions. Phosphorylation of FAK results in
activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, FAK regulates
activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase which may serve to prevent apoptosis.
10013] Overexpression of FAK is involved in cancer progression. For example, high levels
of FAK correlate with invasiveness and metastatic potential in colon tumors, breast
tumors, and oral cancers. Weiner et al. (1993) Lancet 342:1024-1025; Owens et al. (1995)
Cancer Res., 55:2752-2755); Kornberg (1998) Head Neck 20:634-639. Furthermore, the
role FAK plays in cell migration has led to the speculation that FAK plays a relevant role
                                               4

in the development and pathology of other diseases such as embryonic development and
angiogenic disorders. Kornberg (1998) Head Neck 20:634-639.
[0014] It has been shown that epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2), a member of the
tetraspan protein of the GAS-3/PMP22 family, regulates FAK and Src activation. EMP2 is
expressed at high levels in epithelial cells of the lung, eye, and genitourinary tracts. Like
several tetraspan proteins (CD9, CD81, PMP22), EMP2 in murine fibroblasts is localized
to lipid raft domains. EMP2 controls cell surface trafficking and function of certain
integrins, GPI-linked proteins, and class I MHC molecules, and reciprocally regulates
caveolin expression. Claas et al. (2001) J Biol Chem 276:7974-84; Hasse et al. (2002) J
Neurosci Res 69:227-32; Wadehra et al. (2003) Exp Mol Pathol 74:106-12; Wadehra et al.
(2004) Mol Biol Cell 15:2073-2083; Wadehra et al. (2002) J Biol Chem 277:41094-41100;

[0015] Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy. In the
United States, the death rate from EC has doubled in the last twenty years, and currently a
woman has approximately a 3% chance of developing EC during her lifetime. Silverberg
et al. (2003) World Health Organization Classification of Tumors: Tumors of the Breast
and Female Genital Tract, Lyon: IARC Press. p.221-57; Sorosky (2008) Obstet Gynecol
111:436-47. EC is classified into two major sub-groups based on histology, clinical
behavior, and epidemiology. The more common Type I is associated with estrogen
predominance and pre-malignant endometrial hyperplasia. Hecht et al. (2006) J Clin
Oncol 24:4783-91; Sherman (2000) Mod Pathol 13:295-308. Type II is mediated by non
hormonal risk factors, and often has a high grade or high-risk histology with an aggressive
clinical. Hecht et al. (2006) J Clin Oncol 24:4783-91. Incidence of ECs generally
increases with age, with 75-80% of new cases occurring in postmenopausal women.
Creasman (1997) Semin Oncol 24:S1-140-Si-50.
[0016] Primary treatment for ECs is the surgical removal of the tumor, but recurrence is
common, and other therapeutic interventions (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine
therapy) benefit only a subset of patients. Markman (2006), Semin Oncol 33: S33-8;
Engleman et al. (2003) Semin Oncol 30:80-94. Presently, there are few biomarkers that
distinguish ECs at the pre-malignant stage, although emerging efforts are targeting
molecules that underlie the process of tumorigenesis. Kelloff et al. (2006) Clin Cancer
Res 12:3661-97; Gossett et al. (2004) Int J Gynecol Cancer 14:145-5 1. Similarly, there are

currently no biomarkers that can be targeted for tumor suppression and elimination. Thus,
new modalities for early detection and treatment of ECs at premalignant and frankly
malignant stages of disease are needed to improve management and prognosis.
[0017] One promising biomarker appears to be EMP2. EMP2 expression is associated
with EMP2 neoplasia. Wadehra et al. (2006) Cancer 107:90-8. In endometrial cancer,
EMP2 is an independent prognostic indicator for tumors with poor clinical outcome.
EMP2 positive tumors, compared to EMP2 negative tumors, had a significantly greater
myometrial invasiveness, higher clinical state, recurrent or persistent disease following
surgical excision, and earlier mortality. As EMP2 expression was independent of other
known biomarkers such as the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, EMP2
represents a unique biomarker for patients who are not responsive to current hormone or
chemotherapy. Wadehra et al. (2006) Cancer 107:90-8. Moreover, EMP2 expression
level positively correlates with the increasing pre-malignant potential of proliferative
endometrium. In other words, there is a gradation of endometrial EMP2 expression, with
minimal expression in normal proliferative or quiescent premenopausal endometrium, and
increasing expression in patients with disordered proliferative endometrium, endometrial
hyperplasia, and endometrium carcinomas.
[0018] In the endometrium, EMP2 expression is regulated by progesterone and required
for successful blastocyst implantation. Wadehra et al. (2006) Dev Biol 292:430-41;
Wadehra et al. (2008) Reprod Biol Endocrinol 6:15. EMP2 appears to regulate trafficking
of various proteins and glycolipids by facilitating transfer of molecules from post-Golgi
endosomal compartments to appropriate plasma membrane locations. Specifically, EMP2
is thought to facilitate the appropriate trafficking of select molecules into glycolipids
enriched lipid raft microdomains (GEMs). Wadehra et al. (2004) Mol Biol Cell 15:2073
83. GEMs are cholesterol rich microdomains which are often associated with chaperones,
receptosomes, and protein complexes that are important for efficient signal transduction.
Leitinger et al. (2002) J Cell Sci 115:963-72; Moffett et al. (2000) J Biol Chem 275:2191
8. Moreover, GEMs are involved in correct sorting of proteins from the Golgi apparatus to
plasma membrane. Abrami et al. (2001) J Biol Chem 276:30729-36; Galbiati et al. (2001)
Cell 106:403-11; Gruenberg et al. (1995) Curr Opin Cell Biol 7: 552-63. In this respect,
modulation of EMP2 expression levels or its location on the plasma membrane alters the
surface repertoire of several classes of molecules including integrins, focal adhesion
                                                 6

kinase, class I major histocompatibility molecules and other immunoglobulin super-family
members such as CD54 and GPI-linked proteins. Wadehra et al. (2005) Dev Biol
287:336-45; Wadehra et al. (2003) Clinical Immunology 107:129-36; Morales et al. (2008)
Invest Opthalmol Vis Sci 50(l):462-9. Furthermore, concordant with the role of
tetraspans. EMP2 is thought to curate molecules on the plasma membrane to regulate the
activity of specific signaling complexes.
[0019] Accordingly, there is a need for new compositions and methods to treat and prevent
cancers, to treat and prevent angiogenesis-related diseases and disorders, and to reduce
neovascularization (i.e., the proliferation of blood vessels in tissue not normally containing
them). Disclosed herein are methods and composition for reducing neovascularization by
targeting EMP2. Disclosed herein are also methods and compositions for treating and
preventing uterine cancer. Specifically disclosed herein are methods and compositions for

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Introduction
[0062] Uterine cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer found in women. The
most common type of uterine cancer is endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer originates
in cells lining the uterus. In 2012, it was estimated that there were about 47,130 new cases
of endometrial cancer diagnosed each year in the United States, resulting in 8,010 deaths
annually. See National Cancer Institute website on Endometrial Cancer. The disease most
typically occurs in postmenopausal women, with the average age at the time of diagnosis
being about 60 years. Often, the development of endometrial cancer is preceded by
premalignant neoplastic growth of endometrial glandular cells, a condition that is usually
apparent upon histological examination as atypical hyperplasia, or Endometrial
Intraepithelial Neoplasia (EIN). Hecht et al. (2005) Mod. Pathol 18:324-330; Mutter et al.
(2000) J. Pathol 190:462-469. However, by the time that EIN is detected, cancer is already
present in approximately 39% of women. Baak, et al. (2005) J. Clin. Pathol. 58:1-6.
10063] EMP2 (SEQ ID NO: I)is a novel oncogene upregulated in a number of cancers in
women. In endometrial cancer, for example, EMP2 expression promotes endometrial
cancer growth in vivo, and to date, it is the only biomarker identified to predict
endometrial cancer prognosis and survival. Given its expression profile and importance in
disease pathogenesis, a recombinant antibody fragment (diabody) to EMP2 has been
generated and shown it induce necrosis in vivo.

[0065] Using endometrial cancer cells, anti-EMP2 IgG 1 treatment significantly reduced
tumor load with a net improvement in survival. Within tumors, significant necrosis was
observed. Also, expression of ribozymes or specific shRNA constructs that reduced EMP2
revealed a similar histology. In particular, severe necrosis was observed in tumors with
reduced EMP2. Although we had previously observed increased cell death in vitro after
exposure to antibodies that recognize EMP2, the necrotic response and the studies reported
in the instant disclosure link EMP2 with control of VEGF expression through HIF-la.
                                                I

Notably, HEC-1A cells that were genetically modified for EMP2 expression showed a
positive correlation between EMP2 levels and tumor vascularity. Cell supernatants from
cells that were genetically modified for EMP2 expression showed a positive correlation
between EMP2 levels, and endothelial cell migration and tube formation of two
independent endothelial types. Levels of VEGF and Hif-la were concordant also with
expression levels of EMP2, and blockade of EMP2 using an anti-EMP2 antibody showed a
dose dependent decrease in vascularization. Additional investigations will help identify
how EMP2 controls the hypoxic response. All of the studies presented here point to a
significant effect on HIF-la and VEGF through control of EMP2 expression and suggest
the mechanism for the clinical association of high EMP2 expression with aggressive, more
advanced tumors.
[0066] Several oncogenes stimulate angiogenesis. Without being bound by theory it is
postulated that EMP2 activates HIF-la through a Src dependent mechanism. This
stimulation appears to be independent of AKT activation suggesting that EMP2 and AKT
function independently of one another. Moreover, although AKT inhibitors did not
suppress EMP2 mediated HIF-la activation, erlotinib and Ly294002, the P13 kinase
inhibitor, are sufficient to inhibit its expression.
Antibodies
[0067] The present invention provides anti-EMP2 antibodies, generally therapeutic and/or
diagnostic antibodies as described herein. Antibodies that find use in the present invention
can take on a number of formats as described herein, including traditional antibodies as
well as antibody derivatives, fragments and mimetics, described below. Essentially, the
invention provides antibody structures that contain a set of 6 CDRs as defined herein
(including small numbers of amino acid changes as described below). The anti-EMP2
CDRs are provided in U.S. Patent No. 8,318,906, incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0068] The heavy and light chain variable regions sequences of anti-EMP2 antibodies are
provided in Figure 7.
10069] Traditional antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is
typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one
"light" (typically having a molecular weight of about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain
(typically having a molecular weight of about 50-70 kDa). Human light chains are
                                                 16t

classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta,
gamma, alpha., or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and
IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited to IgGI, IgG2,
IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses, including, but not limited to, IgMI and IgM2. Thus,
"isotype" as used herein is meant any of the subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the
chemical and antigenic characteristics of their constant regions. The known human
immunoglobulin isotypes are IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, IgM I g0M2, IgD, and
IgE. It should be understood that therapeutic antibodies can also comprise hybrids of
isotypes and/or subclasses.
10070] The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100
to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. In the variable
region, three loops are gathered for each of the V domains of the heavy chain and light
chain to form an antigen-binding site. Each of the loops is referred to as a
complementarity-determining region (hereinafter referred to as a "CDR"), in which the
variation in the amino acid sequence is most significant. "Variable" refers to the fact that
certain segments of the variable region differ extensively in sequence among antibodies.
Variability within the variable region is not evenly distributed. Instead, the V regions
consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino
acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called "hypervariable regions"
that are each 9-15 amino acids long or longer.
[0071] Each VH and VL is composed of three hypervariable regions ("complementary
determining regions," "CDRs") and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy
terminus in the following order: FRI-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4.
[0072] The hypervariable region generally encompasses amino acid residues from about
amino acid residues 24-34 (LCDR1; "L" denotes light chain), 50-56 (LCDR2) and 89-97
(LCDR3) in the light chain variable region and around about 31-3 5B (HCDRI; "H"
denotes heavy chain), 50-65 (HCDR2), and 95-102 (HCDR3) in the heavy chain variable
region; Kabat et al., SEQUENCES OF PROTEINS OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST,
5 th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991) and/or
those residues forming a hypervariable loop (e.g. residues 26-32 (LCDR1), 50-52
(LCDR2) and 91-96 (LCDR3) in the light chain variable region and 26-32 (HCDRl), 53
                                                17

55 (HCDR2) and 96-101 (HCDR3) in the heavy chain variable region; Chothia and Lesk
(1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917. Specific CDRs of the invention are described below.
[0073] Throughout the present specification, the Kabat numbering system is generally
used when referring to a residue in the variable domain (approximately, residues 1-107 of
the light chain variable region and residues 1-113 of the heavy chain variable region) (e.g,
Kabat et al., supra (1991)).
10074] The CDRs contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding, or more specifically,
epitope binding site of antibodies. "Epitope" refers to a determinant that interacts with a
specific antigen binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a
paratope. Epitopes are groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains
and usually have specific structural characteristics, as well as specific charge
characteristics. A single antigen may have more than one epitope. For example, as
described herein the antibodies bind to an epitope in the presumptive second extracellular
domain of EMP2.
[0075] The epitope may comprise amino acid residues directly involved in the binding
(also called immunodominant component of the epitope) and other amino acid residues,
which are not directly involved in the binding, such as amino acid residues which are
effectively blocked by the specifically antigen binding peptide; in other words, the amino
acid residue is within the footprint of the specifically antigen binding peptide.
[0076] In some embodiments, the epitope is derived from SEQ ID NO:2, wherein SEQ ID
NO:2 is EDIHDKNAKFYPVTREGSYG and represents a 20-mer polypeptide sequence
from the second extracellular loop of human EMP2
10077] Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is
produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear
polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a
polypeptide chain. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes may be distinguished
in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing
solvents.
[0078] An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino
acids in a unique spatial conformation. Antibodies that recognize the same epitope can be
                                               1R

verified in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding
of another antibody to a target antigen, for example "binning."
[0079] The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily
responsible for effector function. Kabat et al. collected numerous primary sequences of the
variable regions of heavy chains and light chains. Based on the degree of conservation of
the sequences, they classified individual primary sequences into the CDR and the
framework and made a list thereof (see SEQUENCES OF IMMUNOLOGICAL
INTEREST, 5 " edition, NIH publication, No. 91-3242, E.A. Kabat et al., entirely
incorporated by reference).
[0080] In the IgG subclass of immunoglobulins, there are several immunoglobulin
domains in the heavy chain. By "immunoglobulin (Ig) domain" herein is meant a region of
an immunoglobulin having a distinct tertiary structure. Of interest in the present invention
are the heavy chain domains, including, the constant heavy (CH) domains and the hinge
domains. In the context of IgG antibodies, the IgG isotypes each have three CH regions.
Accordingly, "CH" domains in the context of IgG are as follows: "CHI" refers to positions
118-220 according to the EU index as in Kabat. "CH2" refers to positions 237-340
according to the EU index as in Kabat, and "CH3" refers to positions 341-447 according to
the EU index as in Kabat.
[0081] Another type of Ig domain of the heavy chain is the hinge region. By "hinge" or
"hinge region" or "antibody hinge region" or "immunoglobulin hinge region" herein is
meant the flexible polypeptide comprising the amino acids between the first and second
constant domains of an antibody. Structurally, the IgG CHI domain ends at EU position
220, and the IgG CH2 domain begins at residue EU position 237. Thus for IgG the
antibody hinge is herein defined to include positions 221 (D221 in IgG1) to 236 (G236 in
IgG 1), wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some
embodiments, for example in the context of an Fc region, the lower hinge is included, with
the "lower hinge" generally referring to positions 226 or 230.
[0082] Of interest in the present invention are the Fc regions. By "Fc" or "Fc region" or
"Fec domain" as used herein is meant the polypeptide comprising the constant region of an
antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain and in some cases,
part of the hinge. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains
of IgA, IgD., and IgG, the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and
                                                19

IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM, Fc may
include the J chain. For IgG, the Fc domain comprises immunoglobulin domains CY2 and
Cy3 (Cy2 and Cy3) and the lower hinge region between Cyl (Cy 1) and Cy2 (Cy2).
Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region
is usually defined to include residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the
numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments, as is more
fully described below, amino acid modifications are made to the Fc region, for example to
alter binding to one or more FeyR receptors or to the FcRn receptor.
10083] In some embodiments, the antibodies are full length. By "full length antibody"
herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody,
including variable and constant regions, including one or more modifications as outlined
herein.
[0084] Alternatively, the antibodies can be a variety of structures,. including, but not
limited to, antibody fragments, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, minibodies,
domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as "antibody
mimetics"), chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes
referred to as "antibody conjugates"), and fragments of each, respectively. Structures that
still rely
[0085] In one embodiment, the antibody is an antibody fragment. Specific antibody
fragments include, but are not limited to, (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL
and CHI domains, (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains, (iii) the Fv
fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment
(Ward et al., 1989, Nature 341:544-546, entirely incorporated by reference) which consists
of a single variable, (v) isolated CDR regions, (vi) F(ab')2 fragments, a bivalent fragment
comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a
VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains
to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426,
Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5879-5883, entirely incorporated by
reference), (viii) bispecific single chain Fv (WO 03/11161, hereby incorporated by
reference) and (ix) "diabodies" or "triabodies", multivalent or multispecific fragments
constructed by gene fusion (Tomlinson et. al., 2000, Methods Enzymol. 326:461-479;

                                               ?0

entirely incorporated by reference). In some embodiments, the antibody can be a mixture
from different species, e.g. a chimeric antibody and/or a humanized antibody. That is, in
the present invention, the CDR sets can be used with framework and constant regions other
than those specifically described by sequence herein.
[0086] In general, both "chimeric antibodies" and "humanized antibodies" refer to
antibodies that combine regions from more than one species. For example, "chimeric
antibodies" traditionally comprise variable region(s) from a mouse (or rat, in some cases)
and the constant region(s) from a human. "Humanized antibodies" generally refer to non
human antibodies that have had the variable-domain framework regions swapped for
sequences found in human antibodies. Generally, in a humanized antibody, the entire
antibody, except the CDRs, is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical
to such an antibody except within its CDRs. The CDRs, some or all of which are encoded
by nucleic acids originating in a non-human organism, are grafted into the beta-sheet
framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody, the specificity of
which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described
in, e.g., WO 92/11018, Jones,. 1986, Nature 321:522-525, Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science
239:1534-1536, all entirely incorporated by reference. "Backinutation" of selected
acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to
regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct (US 5530101; US 5585089; US

6407213, all entirely incorporated by reference). The humanized antibody optimally also
will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, typically that of a
human immunoglobulin, and thus will typically comprise a human Fc region. Humanized
antibodies can also be generated using mice with a genetically engineered immune system.

"Isolated," when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means a
polypeptide that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a cell or cell
 culture from which it was expressed. Ordinarily, an isolated polypeptide will be prepared
by at least one purification step. An "isolated antibody," refers to an antibody which is
 substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities. For instance,

an isolated antibody that specifically binds to EMP2 is substantially free of antibodies that
specifically bind antigens other than EMP2.
[0091] An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of
human EMP2 or murine EMP2 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related
antigens. for instance from other species, such as EMP2 species homologs. Moreover, an
isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.
10092] Isolated monoclonal antibodies, having different specificities, can be combined in a
well defined composition. Thus, for example all possible combinations of the disclosed
antibodies can be combined in a single formulation, if desired.
10093] For example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 8,318,906, the following human
origin antibody sequences encode for high-avidity antibodies specific for human (KS49,
KS83) and mouse (KS83) EMP2 and have antibody variable region heavy and light chains
suitable for use in either aspect of the invention:

[0096] Anti-EMP-2 variable region sequences, used to encode proteins on backbones
including for native antibody, fragment antibody, or synthetic backbones, can avidly bind
EMP-2. Via this binding, these proteins can be used for EMP-2 detection, and to block
EMP-2 function. Expression of these variable region sequences on native antibody
backbones, or as an scFv, triabody, diabody or minibody, labeled with radionuclide, are
particularly useful in the in vivo detection of EMP-2 bearing cells. Expression on these
backbones or native antibody backbone are favorable for blocking the function of EMP-2
and/or killing EMP-2 bearing cells (e.g. gynecologic tumors) in vivo.
10097] In some embodiments, the present invention provides anti-EMP-2 sequences
comprising CDR regions of an antibody selected from KS49, KS83, KS41, and KS89.
The CDR regions provided by the invention may be used to construct an anti-EMP-2
binding protein, including without limitation, an antibody, a scFv, a triabody, a diabody, a
minibody, and the like. In a certain embodiment, an anti-EMP-2 binding protein of the
invention will comprise at least one CDR region from an antibody selected from KS49,
KS83, KS41, and KS89. Anti-EMP-2 binding proteins may comprise, for example, a
CDR-H1, a CDR-H2, a CDR-H3, a CDR-Ll, a CDR-L2, a CDR-L3, or combinations
thereof, from an antibody provided herein. In particular embodiments of the invention, an
anti-EMP-2 binding protein may comprise all three CDR-H sequences of an antibody
provided herein, all three CDR-L sequences of an antibody provided herein, or both. Anti
EMP2 CDR sequences may be used on an antibody backbone, or fragment thereof, and
likewise may include humanized antibodies, or antibodies containing humanized
sequences. These antibodies may be used, for example, to detect EMP-2, to detect cells
expressing EMP-2 in vivo, or to block EMP-2 function. In some embodiments, the CDR

regions may be defined using the Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, the AbM
definition, the contact definition, or any other suitable CDR numbering system.

[001031          In some embodiments, the invention provides antibodies (e.g., diabodies,
minibodies, triabodies) or fragments thereof having the CDRs of a diabody selected from
KS49, KS83, KS41, and KS89. In some embodiments these antibodies lack the
polyhistine tag. In other embodiments, the diabodies possess the light and heavy chain of
a KS49, KS83, KS41, or KS89 diabody. In still other embodiments, the antibodies are
substantially identical in sequence to a diabody selected from the group consisting of
KS49, KS83, KS41, and KS89 with or without the polyhistidine tag. In still other
embodiments, the antibodies are substantially identical in sequence to the light and heavy
chain sequences of a diabody selected from the group consisting of KS49, KS83, KS41,
and KS89. These identities can be 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and preferably 91%,
92%, 93%, 94%. 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% or greater amino acid sequence identity.
In some further embodiments of any of the above, the antibodies comprise CDRs
sequences identical to those of the KS49, KS83, KS41, or KS89 diabody.
[001041          The anti-EMP2 antibodies of the present invention specifically bind EMP2
ligands (e.g. the human and murine EMP2 proteins of SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2.
[001051          Specific binding for a particular antigen or an epitope can be exhibited, for
example, by an antibody having a KD for an antigen or epitope of at least about 10-4 M, at
least about 10-5 M, at least about 10-6 M, at least about 10-7 M, at least about 10-8 M, at
least about 10-9 M, alternatively at least about 100 lM, at least about 10-1 M, at least about
10-1 M, or greater, where KD refers to a dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen
interaction. Typically, an antibody that specifically binds an antigen will have a KD that is
20-, 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5,000-, 10,000- or more times greater for a control molecule
relative to the antigen or epitope.
Also, specific binding for a particular antigen or an epitope can be exhibited, for example,
by an antibody having a KA or Ka for an antigen or epitope of at least 20-, 50-, 100-, 500-,

1000-, 5,000-, 10,000- or more times greater for the epitope relative to a control, where
KA or Ka refers to an association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
[001061          The anti-EMP2 antibodies of the present invention specifically bind EMP2
ligands (e.g. the human and murine EMP2 proteins of SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2. "Specific
binding" or "specifically binds to" or is "specific for" a particular antigen or an epitope
means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific
binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to
binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does
not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition
with a control molecule that is similar to the target.
100107]          Specific binding for a particular antigen or an epitope can be exhibited, for
example, by an antibody having a KD for an antigen or epitope of at least about 10-4 M, at
least about 10-5 M, at least about  10-6 M, at least about 10-7 M, at least about 10 M, at
least about 10-9 M, alternatively at least about 10-1 M, at least about 101 M, at least about
10-1 M, or greater, where KD refers to a dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen
interaction. Typically, an antibody that specifically binds an antigen will have a KD that is
20-, 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5,000-, 10,000- or more times greater for a control molecule
relative to the antigen or epitope.
[001081          Also, specific binding for a particular antigen or an epitope can be
exhibited, for example, by an antibody having a KA or Ka for an antigen or epitope of at
least 20-, 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5,000-, 10,000- or more times greater for the epitope
relative to a control, where KA or Ka refers to an association rate of a particular antibody
antigen interaction.
        Antibody Modifications
[00109]          The present invention further provides variant antibodies. That is, there are
a number of modifications that can be made to the antibodies of the invention, including,
but not limited to, amino acid modifications in the CDRs (affinity maturation), amino acid
modifications in the Fc region, glycosylation variants, covalent modifications of other
types, etc.
[001101          By "variant" herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that
of a parent polypeptide by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Amino acid

modifications can include substitutions, insertions and deletions, with the former being
preferred in many cases.
[001111         In general, variants can include any number of modifications. as long as the
function of the protein is still present, as described herein.
[001121         However, in general, from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 amino acid
substitutions are generally utilized as often the goal is to alter function with a minimal
number of modifications. In some cases, there are from 1 to 5 modifications, with from I
2, 1-3 and 1-4 also finding use in many embodiments.
[00113]         It should be noted that the number of amino acid modifications may be
within functional domains: for example, it may be desirable to have from 1-5
modifications in the Fc region of wild-type or engineered proteins, as well as from 1 to 5
modifications in the Fv region, for example. A variant polypeptide sequence will
preferably possess at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or up to 98 or 99% identity to the
parent sequences (e.g. the variable regions, the constant regions, and/or the heavy and light
chain sequences.) It should be noted that depending on the size of the sequence, the
percent identity will depend on the number of amino acids.
[001141         By "amino acid substitution" or "substitution" herein is meant the
replacement of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence with
another amino acid. For example, the substitution SI OA refers to a variant polypeptide in
which the serine at position 100 is replaced with alanine. By "amino acid insertion" or
"insertion" as used herein is meant the addition of an amino acid at a particular position in
a parent polypeptide sequence. By "amino acid deletion" or "deletion" as used herein is
meant the removal of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide
sequence.
[00115]         By "parent polypeptide", "parent protein", "precursor polypeptide", or
"precursor protein" as used herein is meant an unmodified polypeptide that is subsequently
modified to generate a variant. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself,
compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that
encodes it. Accordingly, by "parent Fc polypeptide" as used herein is meant an Fc
polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant, and by "parent antibody" as used herein
is meant an antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.

[001161          By "wild type" or "WT" or "native" herein is meant an amino acid sequence
or a nucleotide sequence that is found in nature, including allelic variations. A WT protein,
polypeptide, antibody, immunoglobulin, IgG, etc. has an amino acid sequence or a
nucleotide sequence that has not been intentionally modified.
[001171          By "variant Fc region" herein is meant an Fc sequence that differs from that
of a wild-type Fc sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Fe variant
may refer to the Fe polypeptide itself, compositions comprising the Fe variant polypeptide,
or the amino acid sequence.
[001181          In some embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications are made in
one or more of the CDRs of the antibody. In general, only 1 or 2 or 3 amino acids are
substituted in any single CDR, and generally no more than from 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 9 or 10
changes are made within a set of CDRs. However, it should be appreciated that any
combination of no substitutions, 1, 2 or 3 substitutions in any CDR can be independently
and optionally combined with any other substitution.
[001191          In some cases, amino acid modifications in the CDRs are referred to as
"affinity maturation". An "affinity matured" antibody is one having one or more
alteration(s) in one or more CDRs which results in an improvement in the affinity of the
antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those
alteration(s). In some cases, although rare, it may be desirable to decrease the affinity of
an antibody to its antigen, but this is generally not preferred.
1001201          Affinity maturation can be done to increase the binding affinity of the
antibody for the antigen by at least about 10% to 50-100-150% or more, or from I to 5 fold
as compared to the "parent" antibody. Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have
nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies
are produced by known procedures. See, for example, Marks et al., 1992, Biotechnology
10:779-783 that describes affinity maturation by variable heavy chain (VH) and variable
light chain (VL) domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework
residues is described in: Barbas, et al. 1994, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813;
Shier et al., 1995, Gene 169:147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004;
Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9; and Hawkins et al, 1992, J. Mol. Biol.
226:889-896, for example.

[001211          Alternatively, amino acid modifications can be made in one or more of the
CDRs of the antibodies of the invention that are "silent", e.g. that do not significantly alter
the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. These can be made for a number of reasons,
including optimizing expression (as can be done for the nucleic acids encoding the
antibodies of the invention).
1001221          Thus, included within the definition of the CDRs and antibodies of the
invention are variant CDRs and antibodies; that is, the antibodies of the invention can
include amino acid modifications in one or more of the CDRs of KS49, KS41, KS83, or
KS89. In addition, as outlined below, amino acid modifications can also independently
and optionally be made in any region outside the CDRs, including framework and constant
regions.
[00123]          In some embodiments, the anti-EMP2 antibodies of the invention are
composed of a variant Fc domain. As is known in the art, the Fc region of an antibody
interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands, imparting an array of important
functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. These Fc receptors include, but are
not limited to, (in humans) FcyRI (CD64) including isoforms FcyRIa, FcyRIb, and FcyRIc;
FcyRII (CD32), including isoforms FcyRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R13 1), FcyRIIb
(including FcyRIIb-1 and FcyRIIb-2), and FcyRIIc; and FcyRIII (CD 16), including
isoforms FcyRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158, correlated to antibody-dependent
cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)) and FcyRIIIb (including allotypes FcyRIIIb-NA I and FcyRIIIb
NA2), FcRn (the neonatal receptor), C q (complement protein involved in complement
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)) and FcRn (the neonatal receptor involved in serum half
life). Suitable modifications can be made at one or more positions as is generally outlined,
for example in US Patent Application 11/841,654 and references cited therein, US
2004/013210, US 2005/0054832, US 2006/0024298, US 2006/0121032, US
2006/0235208, US 2007/0148170, USSN 12/341,769, US Patent No. 6,737,056, US Patent
No. 7,670,600, US Patent No. 6,086,875 all of which are expressly incorporated by
reference in their entirety, and in particular for specific amino acid substitutions that
increase binding to Fc receptors.
[00124]          In addition to the modifications outlined above, other modifications can be
made. For example, the molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of disulphide
bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al., 1996, Nature Biotech. 14:1239-

1245, entirely incorporated by reference). In addition, there are a variety of covalent
modifications of antibodies that can be made as outlined below.
[001251          Covalent modifications of antibodies are included within the scope of this
invention, and are generally, but not always, done post-translationally. For example,
several types of covalent modifications of the antibody are introduced into the molecule by
reacting specific amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent
that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues.
[001261          Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with a-haloacetates (and
corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give
carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues may also be
derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, u-bromo-p-(5-imidozoyl)propionic
acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2
pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7
nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and the like.
[001271          In addition, modifications at cysteines are particularly useful in antibody
drug conjugate (ADC) applications, further described below. In some embodiments, the
constant region of the antibodies can be engineered to contain one or more cysteines that
are particularly "thiol reactive", so as to allow more specific and controlled placement of
the drug moiety. See for example US Patent No. 7,521,541, incorporated by reference in
its entirety herein.
1001281          Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at
pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para
bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M
sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.
[00129]          Lysinyl and amino terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other
carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the
charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino
containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate; pyridoxal
phosphate; pyridoxal; chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylisourea;
2,4-pentanedione; and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.

[001301          Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional
reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and
ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in
alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group.
Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine
epsilon-amino group.
[001311          The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular
interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic
diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and
tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives,
respectively. Tyrosyl residues are iodinated using 1251 or 1311 to prepare labeled proteins
for use in radioimmunoassay, the chloramine T method described above being suitable.
[001321          Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by
reaction with carbodiimides (R'-N=C=N--R'), where R and R' are optionally different
alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3
(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues
are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.
100133]          Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for crosslinking antibodies
to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in a variety of methods, in addition
to methods described below. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1
bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for
example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including
disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'-dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate), and bifunctional
maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8-octane. Derivatizing agents such as methyl-3
[(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate yield photoactivatable intermediates that are capable
of forming crosslinks in the presence of light. Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble
matrices such as cynomolgusogen bromide-activated carbohydrates and the reactive
substrates described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,969,287; 3,691,016; 4,195,128; 4,247,642;
4,229,537; and 4,330,440, all entirely incorporated by reference, are employed for protein
immobilization.
1001341          Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the
corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively. Alternatively, these residues

are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues falls within
the scope of this invention.
[001351         Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine,
phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the a,
amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins:
Structure and Molecular Properties, W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86
[1983], entirely incorporated by reference), acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and
amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.
[001361         In addition, as will be appreciated by those in the art, labels (including
fluorescent, enzymatic, magnetic, radioactive, etc. can all be added to the antibodies (as
well as the other compositions of the invention). Another type of covalent modification is
alterations in glycosylation. In another embodiment, the antibodies disclosed herein can be
modified to include one or more engineered glycoforms. By "engineered glycoform" as
used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to the
antibody, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent
antibody. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but
not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. A preferred form of engineered
glycoform is afucosylation, which has been shown to be correlated to an increase in ADCC
function, presumably through tighter binding to the FcyRIIIa receptor. In this context,
"afucosylation" means that the majority of the antibody produced in the host cells is
substantially devoid of fucose, e.g. 90-95-98% of the generated antibodies do not have
appreciable fucose as a component of the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody (generally
attached at N297 in the Fe region). Defined functionally, afucosylated antibodies
generally exhibit at least a 50% or higher affinity to the Fc7RIIIa receptor.
1001371         Engineered glycoforms may be generated by a variety of methods known in
the art (Umafia et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001, Biotechnol
Bioeng 74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al.,
2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473; US 6,602,684; USSN 10/277,370; USSN 10/113,929;

02/30954A1, all entirely incorporated by reference; (Potelligent@ technology [Biowa, Inc.,
Princeton, NJ]; GlycoMAb® glycosylation engineering technology [Glycart
Biotechnology AG, ZUrich, Switzerland]). Many of these techniques are based on
                                               '7

controlling the level of fucosylated and/or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently
attached to the Fc region, for example by expressing an IgG in various organisms or cell
lines, engineered or otherwise (for example Lee-13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2/0
cells, by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway (for example FUT8
[al,6-fucosyltranserase] and/or    P31-4- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III [GnTIII]), or by
modifying carbohydrate(s) after the IgG has been expressed. For example, the "sugar
engineered antibody" or "SEA technology" of Seattle Genetics functions by adding
modified saccharides that inhibit fucosylation during production; see for example
20090317869, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Engineered glycoform
typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an antibody can
include an engineered glycoform.
[00138]         Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the IgG variant that
comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. As is known in the art,
glycosylation patterns can depend on both the sequence of the protein (e.g., the presence or
absence of particular glycosylation amino acid residues, discussed below), or the host cell
or organism in which the protein is produced. Particular expression systems are discussed
below.
[001391         Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N
linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an
asparagine residue. The tri-peptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X
threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for
enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the
presence of either of these tri-peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential
glycosylation site. 0-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N
acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose, to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine
or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.
[001401         Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently
accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the
above-described tri-peptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration
may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine
residues to the starting sequence (for O-linked glycosylation sites). For ease, the antibody
amino acid sequence is preferably altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly

by mutating the DNA encoding the target polypeptide at preselected bases such that
codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.
[001411         Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the
antibody is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the protein. These
procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the protein in a host
cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N- and O-linked glycosylation. Depending on
the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free
carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl
groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as
those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These
methods are described in WO 87/05330 and in Aplin and Wriston, 1981, CRC Crit. Rev.
Biochem., pp. 259-306, both entirely incorporated by reference.
[001421         Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the starting antibody (e.g.
post-translationally) may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically. Chemical
deglycosylation requires exposure of the protein to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all
sugars except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while
leaving the polypeptide intact. Chemical deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et
al., 1987, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al., 1981, Anal. Biochem.
 118:131, both entirely incorporated by reference. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate
moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo
glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., 1987, Meth. Enzymol. 138:350, entirely
incorporated by reference. Glycosylation at potential glycosylation sites may be prevented
by the use of the compound tunicamycin as described by Duskin et al., 1982, J. Biol.
Chem. 257:3105, entirely incorporated by reference. Tunicamycin blocks the formation of
protein-N-glycoside linkages.
[001431         Another type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the
antibody to various nonproteinaceous polymers, including, but not limited to, various
polyols such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylenes, in the
manner set forth in, for example, 2005-2006 PEG Catalog from Nektar Therapeutics
(available at the Nektar website) US Patents 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417;
4,791,192 or 4,179,337, all entirely incorporated by reference. In addition. as is known in

the art, amino acid substitutions may be made in various positions within the antibody to
facilitate the addition of polymers such as PEG. See for example, U.S. Publication No.
2005/0114037A1, entirely incorporated by reference. The present invention provides a
number of antibodies each with a specific set of CDRs (including, as outlined above, some
amino acid substitutions). As outlined above, the antibodies can be defined by sets of 6
CDRs, by variable regions, or by full-length heavy and light chains, including the constant
regions. In addition, as outlined above, amino acid substitutions may also be made. In
general, in the context of changes within CDRs, due to the relatively short length of the
CDRs, the amino acid modifications are generally described in terms of the number of
amino acid modifications that may be made. While this is also applicable to the discussion
of the number of amino acid modifications that can be introduced in variable, constant or
full length sequences, in addition to number of changes, it is also appropriate to define
these changes in terms of the "% identity". Thus. as described herein, antibodies included
within the invention are 80, 81, 82, 83. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97,
98, 98 or 99% identical to KS49, KS41, KS83, or KS89 described herein.
[001441          In some embodiments, antibodies that compete with the antibodies of the
invention (for example, with KS49, KS41, KS83, or KS89) for binding to human EMP2
and/or murine EMP2 are provided. Competition for binding to EMP2 or a portion of
EMP2 by two or more anti-EMP2 antibodies may be determined by any suitable
technique, as is known in the art.
[001451          Competition in the context of the present invention refers to any detectably
significant reduction in the propensity of an antibody of the invention (e.g. KS49, KS41,
KS83, or KS89) to bind its particular binding partner, e.g. EMP2, in the presence of the
test compound. Typically, competition means an at least about 10-100% reduction in the
binding of an antibody of the invention to EMP2 in the presence of the competitor, as
measured by standard techniques such as ELISA or Biacore@ assays. In certain
embodiments, there is at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%,
at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least
65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at
least 98% inhibition. In certain embodiments, there is 100% inhibition. Thus, for
example, it is possible to set criteria for competitiveness wherein at least about 10%
relative inhibition is detected; at least about 15% relative inhibition is detected; or at least
                                                .40

about 20% relative inhibition is detected before an antibody is considered sufficiently
competitive. In cases where epitopes belonging to competing antibodies are closely located
in an antigen, competition may be marked by greater than about 40% relative inhibition of
EMP2 binding (e.g., at least about 45% inhibition, such as at least about 50% inhibition,
for instance at least about 55% inhibition, such as at least about 60% inhibition, for
instance at least about 65% inhibition, such as at least about 70% inhibition, for instance at
least about 75% inhibition, such as at least about 80% inhibition, for instance at least about
85% inhibition, such as at least about 90% inhibition, for instance at least about 95%
inhibition, or higher level of relative inhibition).
1001461          In some cases, one or more of the components of the competitive binding
assays are labeled.
[00147]          It may also be the case that competition may exist between anti-EMP2
antibodies with respect to more than one of EMP2 epitope, and/or a portion of EMP2, e.g.
in a context where the antibody-binding properties of a particular region of EMP2 are
retained in fragments thereof, such as in the case of a well-presented linear epitope located
in various tested fragments or a conformational epitope that is presented in sufficiently
large EMP2 fragments as well as in EMP2.
100148]          Assessing competition typically involves an evaluation of relative
inhibitory binding using an antibody of the invention, EMP2 (either human or murine or
both), and the test molecule. Test molecules can include any molecule, including other
antibodies, small molecules, peptides, etc. The compounds are mixed in amounts that are
sufficient to make a comparison that imparts information about the selectivity and/or
specificity of the molecules at issue with respect to the other present molecules.
[001491          The amounts of test compound, EMP2 and antibodies of the invention may
be varied. For instance, for ELISA assessments about 5-50 pig (e.g., about 10-50 pg, about
20-50 pg, about 5-20 pg, about 10-20 pg, etc.) of the anti-EMP2 antibody and/or EMP2
targets are required to assess whether competition exists. Conditions also should be
suitable for binding. Typically, physiological or near-physiological conditions (e.g.,
temperatures of about 20-40'C., pH of about 7-8, etc.) are suitable for anti-EMP2:EMP2
binding.
                                                .41

[001501         Often competition is marked by a significantly greater relative inhibition
than about 5% as determined by ELISA and/or FACS analysis. It may be desirable to set a
higher threshold of relative inhibition as a criteria/determinant of what is a suitable level of
competition in a particular context (e.g., where the competition analysis is used to select or
screen for new antibodies designed with the intended function of blocking the binding of
another peptide or molecule binding to EMP2 (e.g., the natural binding partners of EMP2
or naturally occurring anti-EMP2 antibody).
[00151]         In some embodiments, the anti-EMP2 antibody of the present invention
specifically binds to one or more residues or regions in EMP2 but also does not cross-react
with other proteins with homology to EMP2.
100152]         Typically, a lack of cross-reactivity means less than about 5% relative
competitive inhibition between the molecules when assessed by ELISA and/or FACS
analysis using sufficient amounts of the molecules under suitable assay conditions.
1001531         The disclosed antibodies may find use in blocking a ligand-receptor
interaction or inhibiting receptor component interaction. The anti-EMP2 antibodies of the
invention may be "blocking" or "neutralizing." A "neutralizing antibody" is intended to
refer to an antibody whose binding to EMP2 results in inhibition of the biological activity
of EMP2, for example its capacity to interact with ligands, enzymatic activity, and/or
signaling capacity. Inhibition of the biological activity of EMP2 can be assessed by one or
more of several standard in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art.
1001541         Inhibits binding" or "blocks binding" (for instance when referring to
inhibition/blocking of binding of a EMP2 binding partner to EMP 2 ) encompass both
partial and complete inhibition/blocking. The inhibition/blocking of binding of a EMP2
binding partner to EMP2 may reduce or alter the normal level or type of cell signaling that
occurs when a EMP2 binding partner binds to EMP2 without inhibition or blocking.
Inhibition and blocking are also intended to include any measurable decrease in the
binding affinity of a EMP2 binding partner to EMP2 when in contact with an anti-EMP2
antibody, as compared to the ligand not in contact with an anti-EMP2 antibody, for
instance a blocking of binding of a EMP2 binding partner to EMP2 by at least about 10%,
20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%, or 100%.
                                               .4?

[001551           The present invention further provides methods for producing the disclosed
anti-EMP2 antibodies. These methods encompass culturing a host cell containing isolated
nucleic acid(s) encoding the antibodies of the invention. As will be appreciated by those
in the art, this can be done in a variety of ways, depending on the nature of the antibody.
In some embodiments, in the case where the antibodies of the invention are full length
traditional antibodies, for example, a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable
region under conditions such that an antibody is produced and can be isolated.
[00156]           In general, nucleic acids are provided that encode the antibodies of the
invention. Such polynucleotides encode for both the variable and constant regions of each
of the heavy and light chains, although other combinations are also contemplated by the
present invention in accordance with the compositions described herein. The present
invention also contemplates oligonucleotide fragments derived from the disclosed
polynucleotides and nucleic acid sequences complementary to these polynucleotides.
[00157]           The polynucleotides can be in the form of RNA or DNA. Polynucleotides
in the form of DNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, nucleic acid analogs, and synthetic DNA are
within the scope of the present invention. The DNA may be double-stranded or single
stranded, and if single stranded, may be the coding (sense) strand or non-coding (anti
sense) strand. The coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide may be identical to the
coding sequence provided herein or may be a different coding sequence, which sequence,
as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code, encodes the same
polypeptides as the DNA provided herein.
[001581           In some embodiments, nucleic acid(s) encoding the antibodies of the
invention are incorporated into expression vectors, which can be extrachromosomal or
designed to integrate into the genome of the host cell into which it is introduced.
Expression vectors can contain any number of appropriate regulatory sequences
(including, but not limited to, transcriptional and translational control sequences,
promoters, ribosomal binding sites, enhancers, origins of replication, etc.) or other
components (selection genes, etc.), all of which are operably linked as is well known in the
art. In some cases two nucleic acids are used and each put into a different expression
vector (e.g. heavy chain in a first expression vector, light chain in a second expression
vector), or alternatively they can be put in the same expression vector. It will be
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector(s), including

the selection of regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host
cell, the level of expression of protein desired, etc.
[001591          In general, the nucleic acids and/or expression can be introduced into a
suitable host cell to create a recombinant host cell using any method appropriate to the host
cell selected (e.g., transformation, transfection, electroporation, infection), such that the
nucleic acid molecule(s) are operably linked to one or more expression control elements
(e.g., in a vector, in a construct created by processes in the cell, integrated into the host cell
genome). The resulting recombinant host cell can be maintained under conditions suitable
for expression (e.g. in the presence of an inducer, in a suitable non-human animal, in
suitable culture media supplemented with appropriate salts, growth factors, antibiotics,
nutritional supplements, etc.), whereby the encoded polypeptide(s) are produced. In some
cases, the heavy chains are produced in one cell and the light chain in another.
[001601          Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are known in the art
and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells, HEK 293 cells, NSO cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells,
monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), and a
number of other cell lines. Non-mammalian cells including but not limited to bacterial,
yeast, insect, and plants can also be used to express recombinant antibodies. In some
embodiments, the antibodies can be produced in transgenic animals such as cows or
chickens.
Methods of Treatment
         Antibody Compositions for In Vivo Administration
100161]          Formulations of the antibodies used in accordance with the present
invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of
purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers
(Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. [1980]), in the form of
lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or
stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and
include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including
ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium
                                                44

chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride:
phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol;
resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about
10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins;
hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine,
glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and
other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as
EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions
such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic
surfactants such as TWEENTM, PLURONICSTM or polyethylene glycol (PEG).
[001621          The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as
necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary
activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to
provide antibodies with other specificities. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition
may comprise a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent and/or small molecule
antagonist. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are
effective for the purpose intended.
[001631          The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for
example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example,
hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate)
microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes,
albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in
macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences
16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).
1001641          The formulations to be used for in vivo administration should be sterile, or
nearly so. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
[001651          Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of
sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic
polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g.
films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,
hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)),
polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and .gamma. ethyl-

L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid
copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOTTM (injectable microspheres composed of lactic
acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable
release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time
periods.
[001661         When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may
denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37"C, resulting in a loss of
biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be
devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the
aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S--S bond formation through
thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues,
lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content., using appropriate
additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.
        Administrative modalities
[001671         The antibodies and chemotherapeutic agents of the invention are
administered to a subject, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous
administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular,
intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. Intravenous or subcutaneous
administration of the antibody is preferred.
[001681         In certain aspects, the antibodies and chemotherapeutic agents of this
invention are administered to a subject with cancer. In certain aspects, the antibodies and
chemotherapeutic agents of the invention are administered to a subject with endometrial
cancer.
[001691         In certain aspects, the antibodies and chemotherapeutic agents of this
invention are administered to a subject with an angiogenic disorder. In certain aspects, the
antibodies and chemotherapeutic agents of this invention are administered to a subject with
a disease characterized by angiogenesis. In certain aspects, the antibodies and
chemotherapeutic agents of this invention are administered to a subject with a disease
characterized by neovascularization.

         Treatment modalities
[001701          In the methods of the invention, therapy is used to provide a positive
therapeutic response with respect to a disease or condition. By "positive therapeutic
response" is intended an improvement in the disease or condition, and/or an improvement
in the symptoms associated with the disease or condition. For example, a positive
therapeutic response would refer to one or more of the following improvements in the
disease: (1) a reduction in the number of neoplastic cells; (2) an increase in neoplastic cell
death; (3) inhibition of neoplastic cell survival; (5) inhibition (i.e., slowing to some extent,
preferably halting) of tumor growth; (6) an increased patient survival rate; and (7) some
relief from one or more symptoms associated with the disease or condition.
100171]          Positive therapeutic responses in any given disease or condition can be
determined by standardized response criteria specific to that disease or condition. Tumor
response can be assessed for changes in tumor morphology (i.e., overall tumor burden,
tumor size, and the like) using screening techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MR1) scan, x-radiographic imaging, computed tomographic (CT) scan, bone scan
imaging, endoscopy, and tumor biopsy sampling.
[00172]          In addition to these positive therapeutic responses, the subject undergoing
therapy may experience the beneficial effect of an improvement in the symptoms
associated with the disease.
[001731          Such a response may persist for at least 4 to 8 weeks, or sometimes 6 to 8
weeks, following treatment according to the methods of the invention. Alternatively, an
improvement in the disease may be categorized as being a partial response. By "partial
response" is intended at least about a 50% decrease in all measurable tumor burden (i.e.,
the number of malignant cells present in the subject, or the measured bulk of tumor masses
or the quantity of abnormal monoclonal protein) in the absence of new lesions, which may
persist for 4 to 8 weeks, or 6 to 8 weeks.
[001741          Treatment according to the present invention includes a "therapeutically
effective amount" of the medicaments used. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to
an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired
therapeutic result.
                                                47

[001751          A therapeutically effective amount may vary according to factors such as
the disease state, age., sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the medicaments
to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one
in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody portion are
outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.
1001761          A "therapeutically effective amount" for tumor therapy may also be
measured by its ability to stabilize the progression of disease. The ability of a compound to
inhibit cancer may be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human
tumors.
[001771          Alternatively, this property of a composition may be evaluated by
examining the ability of the compound to inhibit cell growth or to induce apoptosis by in
vitro assays known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount of a
therapeutic compound may decrease tumor size, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a
subject. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on
such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular
composition or route of administration selected.
[00178]          Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response
(e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several
divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or
increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Parenteral
compositions may be formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and
uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units
suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined
quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in
association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.
[001791          The specification for the dosage unit forms of the present invention are
dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound
and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the
art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in
individuals.
                                                .49

[001801          The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the anti-EMP2
antibodies used in the present invention depend on the disease or condition to be treated
and may be determined by the persons skilled in the art.
[001811          An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of
an anti-EMP2 antibody used in the present invention is about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as about
0.1-50 mg/kg, for example about 0. 1-20 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-10 mg/kg, for instance
about 0.5, about such as 0.3, about 1, or about 3 mg/kg. In another embodiment, he
antibody is administered in a dose of 1 mg/kg or more, such as a dose of from I to 20
mg/kg, e.g. a dose of from 5 to 20 mg/kg, e.g. a dose of 8 mg/kg.
[001821          A medical professional having ordinary skill in the art may readily
determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required.
For example, a physician or a veterinarian could start doses of the medicament employed
in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the
desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is
achieved.
[001831          In certain embodiments, the anti-EMP2 antibody is co-administered with a
VEGF inhibitor. In certain embodiments, the VEGF inhibitor is bevacizumab, pazopanib,
sorafenib, sunitinib, vandeteanib, cabozantinib, ponatinib, axitinib, aflibercept, or a
combination or deriative thereof.
[001841          The term "co-administration" refers to the administration of an anti-EMP2
antibody and a VEGF inhibitor as one single formulation or as two separate formulations
(one for the anti-EMP2 antibody and one for the VEGF inhibitor). The co-administration
can be simultaneous or sequential in either order, wherein there is a time period while both
(or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. As such, the "co
administration" of an anti-EMP2 and antibody and a VEGF inhibitor refers to a
combination therapy of two or more chemical or biological substances involving an anti
EMP2 and antibody and a VEGF inhibitor. In sequential administration of an anti-EMP2
and antibody and a VEGF inhibitor, both agents can exert their biological activities at the
same time. Alternatively, in sequential administration of an anti-EMP2 and antibody and a
VEGF inhibitor, the agents can exert their biological activities at the same time.
                                              49

[001851         In certain embodiments, the time between sequential administrations of an
anti-EMP2 and antibody and a VEGF inhibitor can be less than 10 minutes, approximately
30 minutes, between 30 minutes and 1 hour, between 1 hour and 2 hours, between 2 hours
and 5 hours, between 5 hours and 10 hours, between 6 hours and 12 hours, between 12
hours and 24 hours, approximately 1 day, approximately 2 days, approximately 3 days,
approximately 4 days, approximately 5 days, approximately 6 days, approximately 7 days,
approximately 8 days, approximately 9 days, approximately 10 days, approximately 11
days, approximately 12 days, approximately 13 days, approximately 14 days,
approximately 15 days, approximately 16 days, approximately 17 days, approximately 18
days, approximately 19 days, approximately 20 days, approximately 21 days,
approximately 22 days, approximately 23 days, approximately 24 days, approximately 25
days, approximately 26 days, approximately 27 days, approximately 28 days,
approximately 29 days, approximately 30 days, approximately 35 days, approximately 40
days, or approximately 45 days.
[001861         In certain embodiments, the anti-EMP2 antibody and a VEGF inhibitor are
co-administered approximately once a day, once every 7 days, once every 14 days, once
every 28 days, once every 30 days, once every 45 days, once every 60 days, once every 90
days.
[001871         In one embodiment, the anti-EMP2 antibody is administered by infusion in
a weekly dosage of from 10 to 500 mg/kg such as from 200 to 400 mg/kg. Such
administration may be repeated, e.g., 1 to 8 times, such as 3 to 5 times. The administration
may be performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as
from 2 to 12 hours.
[00188]         In one embodiment, the anti-EMP2 antibody is administered by slow
continuous infusion over a long period, such as more than 24 hours, if required to reduce
side effects including toxicity.
[001891         In one embodiment the anti-EMP2 antibody is administered in a weekly
dosage of from 250 mg to 2000 mg, such as for example 300 mg, 500 mg, 700 mg, 1000
mg, 1500 mg or 2000 mg, for up to 8 times, such as from 4 to 6 times. The administration
may be performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as
from 2 to 12 hours. Such regimen may be repeated one or more times as necessary, for
example, after 6 months or 12 months. The dosage may be determined or adjusted by

measuring the amount of compound of the present invention in the blood upon
administration by for instance taking out a biological sample and using anti-idiotypic
antibodies which target the antigen binding region of the anti-EMP2 antibody.
[001901          In a further embodiment, the anti-EMP2 antibody is administered once
weekly for 2 to 12 weeks, such as for 3 to 10 weeks, such as for 4 to 8 weeks.
[001911          In one embodiment, the anti-EMP2 antibody is administered by
maintenance therapy, such as, e.g., once a week for a period of 6 months or more.
[001921          In one embodiment, the anti-EMP2 antibody is administered by a regimen
including one infusion of an anti-EMP 2 antibody followed by an infusion of an anti-EMP2
antibody conjugated to a radioisotope. The regimen may be repeated, e.g., 7 to 9 days later.
1001931          As non-limiting examples, treatment according to the present invention may
be provided as a daily dosage of an antibody in an amount of about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as
0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 mg/kg, per day, on at least
one of day 1,2,3,4,5, 6,7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40, or alternatively, at least one
of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 after initiation of
treatment, or any combination thereof, using single or divided doses of every 24, 12, 8, 6,
4, or 2 hours, or any combination thereof.
[001941          In some embodiments the anti-EMP2 antibody is used in combination with
one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent or an anti
angiogenic agent. Non-limiting examples of DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents
include topoisomerase I inhibitors (e.g., irinotecan, topotecan, camptothecin and analogs or
metabolites thereof, and doxorubicin); topoisomerase 11 inhibitors (e.g., etoposide,
teniposide, and daunorubicin); alkylating agents (e.g., melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan,
thiotepa, ifosfamide, carmustine, lomustine, semustine, streptozocin, decarbazine,
methotrexate, mitomycin C, and cyclophosphamide); DNA intercalators (e.g., cisplatin,
oxaliplatin, and carboplatin); DNA intercalators and free radical generators such as
bleomycin; and nucleoside mimetics (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, capecitibine, gemcitabine,
fludarabine, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, pentostatin, and hydroxyurea).
                                                   S1

[001951          Chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt cell replication include: paclitaxel,
docetaxel, and related analogs; vincristine, vinblastin, and related analogs; thalidomide,
lenalidomide, and related analogs (e.g., CC-5013 and CC-4047); protein tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (e.g., imatinib mesylate and gefitinib); proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib);
NF-B inhibitors, including inhibitors of IKB kinase; antibodies which bind to proteins
overexpressed in cancers and other inhibitors of proteins or enzymes known to be
upregulated, over-expressed or activated in cancers, the inhibition of which downregulates
cell replication.
100196]          In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be used prior to,
concurrent with, or after treatment with any of the chemotherapeutic agents described
herein or known to the skilled artisan at this time or subsequently.
[00197]          In certain embodiments the anti-angiogenic agent is, for example,
bevacizumab, itraconazole, carboxyamidotriazole, TNP-470, CM101, IFN-u, IL-12,
platelet factor-4, suramin, SU5416, thrombospondin, VEGFR antagonists, angiostatic
steroids + heparin, Cartilage-Derived Angiogenesis Inhibitory Factor, matrix
metalloproteinase inhibitors, angiostatin, endostatin, 2-methoxyestradiol, tecogalan,
tetrathiomolybdate, thalidomide, thrombospondin, prolactin, VEGF aVP3 inhibitors,
linomide, and tasquinimod.
Efficacy of Methods Described Herein
[00198]          In certain aspects of this invention, efficacy of anti-EMP2 therapy is
measured by decreased serum concentrations of tumor specific markers, increased overall
survival time, decreased tumor size, cancer remission, decreased metastasis marker
response, and decreased chemotherapy adverse affects.
[001991          In certain aspects of this invention, efficacy is measured with companion
diagnostic methods and products. Companion diagnostic measurements can be made
before, during, or after anti-EMP2 treatment.
[002001          In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be used to treat
or diagnose a non-neoplastic condition. As used herein, a "non-neoplastic condition"
refers to diseases not being or not caused by neoplasms.

Companion Diagnostics
[002011          In other embodiments, this disclosure relates to companion diagnostic
methods and products. In one embodiment, the companion diagnostic method and
products can be used to monitor the treatment of uterine cancer, specifically endometrial
cancer, as described herein. In some embodiments, the companion diagnostic methods and
products include molecular assays to measure levels of proteins, genes or specific genetic
mutations. Such measurements can be used, for example, to predict whether anti-EMP2
therapy will benefit a specific individual, to predict the effective dosage of anti-EMP2
therapy, to monitor anti-EMP2 therapy, adjust anti-EMP2 therapy,. tailor the anti-EMP2
therapy to an individual, and track cancer progression and remission. Such measurements
can also be used, for example, to predict whether anti-EMP2 and VEGF inhibitor co
administration therapy will benefit a specific individual, to predict the effective dosage of
an anti-EMP2 and VEGF inhibitor co-administration therapy, to monitor an anti-EMP2
and VEGF inhibitor co-administration therapy, adjust an anti-EMP2 and VEGF inhibitor
co-administration therapy, tailor the anti-EMP2 and VEGF inhibitor co-administration
therapy to an individual, and track cancer progression and remission.
[002021          In some embodiments, the companion diagnostic can be used to monitor a
combination therapy.
[002031          In some embodiments, the companion diagnostic can include an anti-EMP2
antibody described herein.
1002041          In some embodiments, the companion diagnostic can be used before,
during, or after anti-EMP2 therapy.
Articles of Manufacture
[002051          In other embodiments, an article of manufacture containing materials useful
for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture
comprises a container and a label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials,
syringes, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as
glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the
condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an
intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection

needle). The active agent in the composition is the antibody. The label on, or associated
with, the container indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of
choice. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a
pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution
and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial
and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and
package inserts with instructions for use.
[00206]        In certain embodiments, an anti-EMP2 antibody and VEGF inhibitor are
combined in a single container. In certain embodiments, an anti-EMP2 antibody and
VEGF inhibitor are in separate containers and are administered separately. In certain
embodiments, the anti-EMP2 antibody and VEGF inhibitor are stored in separate
containers and are combined before administration.

                                         EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 1: EMP2 IgGI improves endometrial cancer survival
[00243]          To detennine the efficacy of EMP2 IgGl for endometrial cancer,
subcutaneous xenografts using the HEC I a/EMP2 cell line were created.
1002441          The human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC-1A (HTBl12,
ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in McCoys media supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum at 37'C in a humidified 5% C02 incubator. Cell lines were used within 2 months
after resuscitation of frozen aliquots and were authenticated based on viability, recovery,
growth, morphology, and isoenzymology by the supplier. Stably transfected HEC-IA cells
containing a human EMP2-GFP fusion protein or control GFP.
100245]          Systemic weekly injections of EMP2 IgGl reduced tumor load compared to
control IgG (Figure IA). This reduction in tumor load translated into a significant increase
in survival for mice treated with EMP2 IgG 1 (Figure IB; p=0.02). Even after 84 days,
surviving mice showed no measurable change in tumor size. Upon histologic examination,
central necrosis was prominent after anti-EMP2 antibody treatment compared with the
control (Figure 1 C).
EXAMPLE 2: Tumor Associated Vasculature
[002461          Tumors were created from endometrial cancer cells that overexpressed
EMP2 (HECla/EMP2), expressed a vector control (HECla/V), or expressed a ribozyme to
reduce its levels (HECla/RIBO).
[002471          Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) from passage 2 were
purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA) and used between passages 3 and 7 for
all experiments. Primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HAECs) (gift from Dr.

J. Berliner, UCLA) were also utilized. All endothelial cells were grown in complete
MCDB-131 complete media (VEC Technologies, Renesselaer, NY). Stably infected HEC
IA cells containing a non-targeting shRNA control or EMP2 specific shRNA (385;
TRCN0000072385, 911; TRCN000032291 1) in pLKO.1-puro were generated as per
manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
1002481         Four to six-week-old nude BALB/c female mice were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and maintained at the University of California, Los
Angeles. Animals were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1 x 106 HEC-IA/OE, HEC
IA IV, or HEC-IA/RIBO cells into the right and left shoulder flanks, respectively. Tumors
were measured using calipers, and the volume calculated with the formula: length x
width2/2. Six mice were used per group. At day 30, tumors were excised, fixed in fornalin,
and then processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining by the Tissue Procurement
Laboratory at UCLA or by Masson's trichrome stain (Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
[00249]         In some experiments, lx10 6 HECla/EMP2 cells were suspended in 5%
matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected s.c. into the shoulder of female athymic mice.
When tumors approached 4mm 2, systemic treatments with 10 mg/kg dose of anti-EMP2
IgGI or control IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) were administered weekly via an intraperitoneal (i.p.)
route. Tumor size was monitored, and mice euthanized once tumors approached 1.5 cm in
diameter or became ulcerated. Tumors were isolated, fixed and processed for hematoxylin
and eosin staining.
[002501         Samples were analyzed to quanitavely and identity tumor vasculature.
Masson's trichrome staining was performed according the manufacturer's instructions
(DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Samples were deparaffinized and dehydrated in alcohol. In
some experiments, after blocking in 1 % normal goat serum, samples were incubated with
1 :50 dilution of FITC-labeled L. esculentum lectin (1 mg/ml in 0.9% NaCl; Vector
Laboratories). Samples were then counterstained with DAPI and mounted. To quantitate
CD34 expression, samples were deparaffinized and then incubated at 95'C for 20 minutes
in 0.1 M citrate, pH 6.0. Rat anti-CD34 (Abcam. Cambridge, MA) was used at a dilution
of 1:25 as previously described followed by visualization using the Vector ABC kit
(Vector Labs,. Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The numbers
of CD34-positive blood vessels in 6 high power fields (x200) were counted and averaged.

[002511         Masson's trichrome staining of xenografts suggested that EMP2 expression
altered tumor vasculature (Figure 2A). HECIalEMP2 tumors were highly vascularized,
while tumors with reduced EMP2 (HECIa/RIBO) levels formed small tumors with poor
vasculature and large areas of necrosis.
[002521         Capillary like tube formation was performed. Briefly, coverslips were
coated with reduced growth factor basement membrane (Geltrex; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) andincubated at 37'C for 30 min to promote jelling. 5xI05HUVECs were resuspended
in cultured media from HECIa/EMP2, HECla/V, or HECIa/RIBO cells. Conditioned media
was typically prepared as follows: confluent cells were grown in 10% FBS-McCoys for 72
h or placed in a hypoxic chamber for up to 24 hours. Migration assays. HUVEC and
HAEC migration assays were conducted in Boyden chambers as previously reported.
Conditioned media was prepared as described above. In some experiments, cultured
supernatants from tumor cells were treated with Bevacizumab (Genentech BioOncology,
South San Francisco, CA, USA). Bevacizumab was obtained from the pharmacy at
University of California, Davis. Each condition was assayed in triplicate wells. "Scratch"
wound closure assays were performed by creating a confluent monolayer of HUVEC cells.
Using the tip of a Pasteur pipet, a scratch was created. Conditioned media from HEC 1
alEMP2, HECla/V, or IEC 1 a/RIB 0 cells were added to the wells. Three random
measurements for each of three wounds were measured for each test condition. The
experiment was repeated three times.
[002531         The cultured media was then collected and centrifuged to remove cell
debris. In some experiments, HECIa cells were treated with 100 /lg/ml of the full-length
EMP2 IgGI for 24 hours 13, or recombinant human VEGF (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an
inducer from 0-50 ng/mL. After 18 h, cells were stained with calcein AM and analyzed.
1002541         To confirm that EMP2 levels correlated with increased numbers of blood
vessels, tumors were stained with Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, which binds uniformly
to the luminal surface of the endothelium, and DAPI. HECla/EMP2 tumors showed
increased tumor associated vasculature compared with the HECIa/V tumors. Similar
staining of HECla/RIBO tumors showed poor tumor vasculature with some background
staining in areas of necrosis (Figure 2B). Xenographs were also stained with CD34
antibodies with concordant results (Figure 2C).
EXAMPLE 3: EMP2 expression promotes endothelial cell tube formation

[002551          Several approaches were used to investigate whether and how EMP2 could
regulate the behavior of endothelial cells. Initially, the chemotactic response of HUVECs
to supernatants from EMP2 modified cell lines was tested using Boyden chambers. After
4-6 hrs, EMP2 tumor expression significantly enhanced directional migration compared to
control cells (p= 0.04; Figure 3A). Reduction in EMP2 expression further reduced cell
migration by two-fold over control cells (p=0.03). To confirm that EMP2 expression
altered endothelial cell migration, a "scratch" test was performed on a confluent monolayer
of HUVEC cells. Concordant with the previous results, an EMP2 dose-dependent response
was also observed (Figure 3B).
1002561          To determine whether EMP2 altered the functional behavior of endothelial
cells, HUVEC cells were placed on a basement membrane matrix to induce capillaiy-like
tube formation. Cells were incubated in cultured supernatants from HECla/EMP2,
HECla/V, and HECla/RIBO (Figure 3C). An EMP2-dependent response was observed in
capillary like tube formation as HECIa/EMP2 induced more tube formation and tubes with
a greater diameter than HECla/V (Figure 3D, E). Reduction in EMP2 expression in HECla
cells further reduced the number of tubes formed compared with HECla/V, suggesting that
EMP2 expression is necessary for endometrial tumor angiogenesis. This effect was also
observed when EMP2 levels were reduced using shRNA (data not shown). No significant
difference in HUVEC cell proliferation was observed within the experimental window
(data not shown).
[002571          To determine if the effects of EMP2 on endothelial cells are cell type
specific, similar experiments were performed on primary human aortic endothelial cells
(HAEC). Using supernatant from HECla/EMP2, HECla/V, or HECla/RIBO as a
chemoattractant, Boyden chamber assays were performed on HAEC. Similar to results
using HUVEC cultures, tumor expression ofEMP2 promoted HAEC invasion (Figure 4A).
These combined results suggest that EMP2 upregulation leads to an increase in
proangiogenic events. Several cellular and molecular changes have been shown to promote
tumor angiogenesis, with the most potent inducer being vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF). In order to determine if VEGF contributed to HAEC invasion, tumor cell
supernatants were incubated with Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF.
Treatment with Bevacizumab reduced HAEC migration to control levels, suggesting that
EMP2 may regulate VEGF expression.

[002581         EXAMPLE 4: EMP2 regulates VEGF expression
[002591         To determine if EMP2 expression altered VEGF expression and secretion,
cells were placed in a hypoxic chamber for 24 hours. EMP2 expression directly correlated
with VEGF protein levels (Figure 4B) as well as with secreted protein (Figure 4C). In
contrast, reduction of EMP2 resulted in undetectable levels of VEGF by western and low
levels of secreted protein. Western blot analysis was carried out by Cells were lysed in
Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) to determine transfer efficiency. Membranes were blocked with 10% low fat
milk in PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20 and probed with EMP2 antisera (1: 1000), anti
VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotech), antiHIF-la (1:800; BD Biosciences), anti-PPAR-y (Santa
Cruz Biotech), anti-p-Src (Cell Signaling, Danvers). Protein bands were visualized using a
horseradish peroxidase (HIRP)-laebeled secondary antibody (BD Biosciences) followed by
chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified using
the NIH program Image J as above. To account for loading variability P-actin was used to
normalize each sample. At least three independent experiments were performed and, where
indicated, the results were evaluated for statistical significance using a Student's t-test
(unpaired, one-tail). A level ofP<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
[002601         MA), anti-p-AKT (Cell Signaling), anti)76/S77p FAK (1:500; BD
Biosciences), or ~-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
[002611         To confirm these results, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on
HECla/EMP2, HECla/V, and HECla/RIBO cells. For RT-PCR analysis, total cellular
RNAs were isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In all conditions, 1 pg
of total RNA was reversed transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine
leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For VEGF amplification including all
four splice variants, the PCR conditions and primers were utilized as previously described.
Amplification of a GAPDH cDNA fragment was performed in a separate PCR reaction as
described. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and were visualized by ethidium
bromide staining.
[00262]         VEGF-A exists as multiple isoforms, which are generically referred to as
VEGFxxx and result from the pre-mRNA alternative splicing of eight exons. Alternative
splicing of VEGF-A was initially shown to generate four different isoforms with 121, 165,
                                               6?

189 and 206 amino acids (VEGF 121, VEGF165, VEGF189, VEGF206., respective well).
EMP2 levels directly increased the mRNA expression of several VEGF isoforms
(VEGF165 and VEGF121) while a reduction in EMP2 produced concordant results (Figure
4D). Low levels ofVEGF189 mRNA were observed in HECla/EMP2 cells, and no
expression of VEGF206 was detected in any of the cell lines.
1002631         Several oncogenic as well as growth factor-driven pathways have been
shown to regulate VEGF expression. As hypoxic conditions have been shown to trigger
with many oncogenic signaling pathways, we initially investigated if the levels of EMP2
were sufficient to alter the hypoxic-induced transcription factor (HIF-la) expression.
Highest levels of HIF-la express were directly correlated with the highest concentration of
EMP2 expression under hypoxic conditions (Figure 4E). HECla/EMP2 cells significantly
induced HIF-la expression compared to HECla/V cells (P=0.0008). Reciprocally,
HECla/RIBO cells produced below detection levels of HIF-la under the same conditions.
To confirm that lower levels of EMP2 reduce HIF-la expression, shRNA constructs were
generated to reduce EMP2 expression (Figure 4F).
In some experiments, inhibitors were added to determine the contribution of specific
pathways to HIF-la expression. HEC1a/EMP2 cells were treated with 10 [M of the kinase
inhibitor Ly294002 (Cell Signaling), the EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib e; 10pM, Genentech),
or theSrc family tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib e; 10 pAM, Bristol-Myers Squibb).
Efficacy of the inhibitors was tested at the manufacturer's recommended dosage, and
potential toxicity was measured using trypan-blue exclusion. Samples were harvested and
probed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis as above FAK-Src small molecule inhibitor
PP2 or the small molecule control PP3 16, 5f-lM of Akt inhibitor VIII (17; Calbiochem,
San Diego, CA), 50 f-lM of the P13
[002641         Similar to experiments with the ribozymes, EMP2 shRNA reduced HIF-la
levels compared to shRNA controls.
[002651         It was demonstrated that downregulation of EMP2 in the tumor cell reduced
capillary formation and the motility of endothelial cells using coculture assays. This may
be the result of reduced VEGF secretion by these cells or due to the expression of anti
angiogenic agents. To address this question, varying amounts of VEGF were added to
supernatants from vehicle control or cells with reduced EMP2 levels (HECla/RIBO or
HECla/shRNA 911). Exogenous VEGF was sufficient to induce HUVEC cell tube

formation (Figure 5A), suggesting that the absence of VEGF contributed to lack of tube
formation.
EXAMPLE 5: EMP2 promotes HIF-la expression through a Src mediated pathway
1002661          EMP2 has been shown to promote integrin mediated F AK and Src
activation, therefore we next examined whether the EMP2-stimulated FAK I Src activation
was directly correlated with increased HIF- I a expression. Using common inhibitors of
AKT, P13-kinase, EGFR, and Src tyrosine kinases, HECla/EMP2 cells were treated with
these agents while in a hypoxic chamber. As shown in Figure 5B, EMP 2 -induced
overexpression ofHIF-la was reversed using Src inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib, respectively.
Both erlotinib and Ly294002, a P13-kinase inhibitor, also produced a similar effect,
suggesting an overlap in signaling with EMP2. In contrast, AKTi did not alter HIF-la
expression in these cells (Figure 5B).
EXAMPLE 6: Anti-EMP2 antibody therapy suppresses neovascularization
[002671          To further examine whether the reductions in tumor vascularity from EMP2
treatment were due to vessel regression or reduced angiogenesis, tumors were stained
Masson's trichrome to detect the presence of collagen sleeves in necrotic areas (Figure
6C). All treatment groups had scattered fragments of basement membrane (Figure 6C,
arrowheads), but empty basement membrane sleeves were more abundant in areas of
necrosis after the anti-EMP2 antibody than control treatments. This suggests that blockade
of EMP2 is a novel mechanism to reduce tumor neovascul arization.
