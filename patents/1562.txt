FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to a drawer chest.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Assembly flat pack furniture can be difficult and require a significant
physical effort for some customers and time-consuming. Sometimes assembly
requires the use of tools such as an Allen key or Phillips head screwdriver. For
complex furniture items, at least two people may be required to perform assembly
of such furniture items.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      The inventive concept arises from a recognition that reducing the time
to assemble large flat pack furniture items, for example, a drawer chest, is
beneficial for users. The packaging of flat pack furniture items should remain as
compact as possible to facilitate easy and convenient transport of items from a
retail store to the user's premises. Avoiding the use of tools for fastening
fasteners to connect components of the furniture item together also saves time
and prevents frustration if users do not possess such tools or when such tools are
not provided with the packaging of the flat pack furniture item.
[0004]      The present invention, in one aspect, comprises a drawer chest
comprising a pair of side panels. The drawer chest also comprises a foldable
back panel pivotally connected to the side panels. The pair of side panels are
movable from a first position to a second position relative to each other. The back
panel is in a folded position when the pair of side panels are in the first position.
The back panel is an unfolded position when the pair of side panels are in the
second position.

                                          2
[0005]      The foldable back panel may comprise a first panel member pivotally
connected to a second panel member.
[0006]      The first panel member may be pivotally connected to the second
panel member by spaced apart hinges.
[0007]      The first panel member may be pivotally connected to a first side panel
of the pair of side panels by spaced apart hinges, and the second panel member
is pivotally connected to a second side panel of the pair of side panels by spaced
apart hinges.
[0008]      The drawer chest may further comprise a front lower span including a
corner bracket and dowels to secure the front lower span to the side panels,
wherein holes of the corner bracket engage with exposed portions of fasteners
inserted into the side panels.
[0009]      The drawer chest may further comprise a locking piece configured to
slide over the exposed portions of fasteners to secure the corner bracket to the
side panels.
[0010]      The drawer chest may further comprise at least one rear span having a
longitudinal recess for receiving an edge of the back panel.
[0011]      The drawer chest may further comprise push pin fasteners to secure
the at least one rear span to the back panel.
[0012]      Other advantages and features according to the invention will be
apparent to those of ordinary skill upon reading this application.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0032]      A preferred drawer chest according to the present invention is
illustrated in Fig. 17 and shown generally at reference numeral 10.
[0033]       Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the drawer chest 10 is depicted in a form
prior to partial assembly by a manufacturer and before provision to a user. The
drawer chest 10 comprises a pair of side panels 20. The drawer chest 10 also
comprises a foldable back panel 40 pivotally connected to the side panels 20.
The pair of side panels 20 are movable from a first position to a second position
relative to each other. The back panel 40 is in a folded position when the pair of
side panels 20 are in the first position. The back panel 40 is an unfolded position
when the pair of side panels 20 are in the second position.
[0034]      The first position for the pair of side panels 20 is a compact position
where the side panels 20 are brought together. The second position for the pair of
side panels 20 is an extended position where the side panels 20 are spaced as
far apart from each other in the final position when the drawer chest 10 is
assembled.
[0035]      The foldable back panel 40 comprises a first panel member 40A
pivotally connected to a second panel member 40B. The first panel member 40A
may be pivotally connected to the second panel member 40B by vertically spaced
apart hinges 42. In one embodiment, there are two hinges 42 pivotally connecting
the two panel members 40A, 40B together.

                                            6
[0036]       The first panel member 40A is pivotally connected to a first side panel
20 of the pair of side panels 20 by spaced apart hinges 44 and the second panel
member 40B is pivotally connected to a second side panel 20 of the pair of side
panels 20 by spaced apart hinges 44.
[0037]       Each side panel 20 comprises a frame and a planar board 25. The
frame includes a front leg 21, rear leg 22, upper span 23 and lower span 24. The
planar board 25 engages with the top surface of the lower span 24 and bottom
surface of the upper span 23 via matching tongue and groove. Recesses are
provided on the inner surface of the front and rear legs 21, 22 at the upper and
lower ends to enable end protrusions of the upper and lower spans 23, 24 to
engage. A dowel 26 is partially inserted into a hole provided at the upper surface
of the front leg 21. The two dowels 26 are inserted into holes on the bottom
surface of the top panel 80 to secure and fix the position of the top panel 80
relative to the side panels 20. A pair of holes 29 are provided at an inner side
surface of the front leg 21. Three pairs of drawer slides 30 or drawer runners are
fastened to the inner surface of the planar board 25 to engage with three drawers.
90. The drawer slides 30 are fastened to the planar board 25 by push pins 31 that
frictionally engage with pre-drilled holes in the planar board 25. A pair of fasteners
28 are inserted into a pair of holes 27 at a front portion of the lower span 24.
[0038]       Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, a partially assembled drawer chest 10 that
is partially assembled by the manufacturer is provided to the user in the
packaging. The partially assembled drawer chest 10 comprises the first panel
member 40A pivotally connected to a second panel member 40B by hinges 42,
the panel members 40A, 40B pivotally connected to the side panels 20 by hinges
44, partially inserted dowels 26 into hole provided at the upper surface of the front
legs 21, and drawer slides 30 mounted to the inner surface of the side panels 20.
The user expands the partially assembled drawer chest 10 by moving the side
panels 20 apart causing the back panel 40 to unfold.
[0039]       Referring to Fig. 5, an upper front span 50 and a lower front span 52
connects the side panels 20 together.

                                             7
[0040]      Referring to Fig. 6, on each end of the upper front span 50 has a pair
of holes to receive the partial insertion of a pair of dowels 51. The exposed part of
the dowels 51 are then positioned and inserted into corresponding holes 29
located at an upper region of the front legs 21 of the side panels 20.
[0041]      Referring to Fig. 7, the lower front span 52 has a pair of pre-drilled
holes on an inner surface. Two right angle brackets 53 are mounted to the inner
surface of the lower front span 52 near its ends. The right angle brackets 53 have
a pair of holes that are required to be aligned with the pre-drilled holes on the
lower front span 52. A pair of fasteners pass through the holes of the right angle
brackets 53 and into the holes of the lower front span 52 to secure the right angle
brackets 53 to the lower front span 52. In a preferred embodiment, the right angle
brackets are pre-assembled on the lower front span 52 (i.e. not assembled on by
the user). Another pair of pre-drilled holes are provided at the ends of the lower
front span 52 for partial insertion of dowels 54.
[0042]      Referring to Fig. 8, the user aligns and clips on the right angle brackets
53 to the exposed portion of the fasteners 28 that are already inserted into a pair
of holes 27 at the front portion of the lower span 24. The pair fasteners 28 pass
through corresponding holes in the right angle bracket 53. The exposed portion of
the dowels 54 also are inserted into the pair of holes 29 are provided at an inner
side surface of the front leg 21 of the side panel 20 No tools are required to
secure the lower front span 52 to the side panel 20.
[0043]      Referring to Figs. 9 and 10, a locking piece 60 with a centrally located
slot that partially extends to the centre of the locking piece 60 is slid over the
remaining exposed portion of the fasteners 28 to prevent the right angle bracket
53 detaching from the fastener 28. The locking piece 60 is a type of collar. The
blind end of the slot is slightly larger than the width of the slot. The locking piece
60 has a rectangular shape and is sized such that one edge abuts against the
surface of the right angle bracket 53 to prevent rotation of the locking piece 60.

                                             8
[0044]      With the upper front span 50 and lower front span 52 assembled the
structural rigidity of the drawer chest 10 is enhanced and also prevents any
further movement of the side panels 20 relative to one another.
[0045]      Referring to Figs. 11 to 13, an upper rear span 70 with a longitudinal
groove 72 and two holes 71 is positioned over a top edge of the back panel 40.
The top edge of the back panel 40 is seated within the longitudinal groove 72.
The holes 71 of the upper rear span 70 align with holes 41 in the back panel 40.
Push pin fasteners 73 are inserted through the holes 41, 71 to secure the upper
rear span 70 to the back panel 40. A lower rear span 72 similarly is positioned
over a bottom edge of the back panel 40 and secured. The rear spans 70, 72
prevent the panel members 40A, 40B of the back panel 40 from pivoting. No tools
are required to secure the rear spans 70, 72 to the back panel 40.
[0046]      Referring to Figs. 14 to 16, the top panel 80 has two pre-drilled holes
83 located near its front edge. The holes 83 must be aligned with the exposed
portions of the dowels 26 inserted in the front leg 21 when the top panel 80 is
lowered onto the side panels 20. Four corner pieces 81 are secured to the bottom
surface of the top panel 80. The corner pieces 81 have a pair of vertical through
holes to enable a pair of push pins 82 to secure the corner pieces 81 to the top
panel 80. The corner pieces 81 have a horizontal through hole to enable a push
pin fastener 84 to secure the top panel 80 with the upper span 23 of the side
panel 20. No tools are required to secure the top panel 80 to the side panels 20.
[0047]      Referring to Fig. 18, in the illustrated embodiment, the drawer chest 10
has three drawers 90. The three drawers 90 engage with the three pairs of
drawer slides 30 or drawer runners which enables them to easily slide in and out.
[0048]      In a preferred embodiment, the drawer chest 10 is packaged and
provided to a user in a pre-assembled form as depicted in Fig. 4. The user
performs the subsequent assembly steps generally depicted in Figs. 3, 5, 8 to 14
and 16. The user moves the side panels 40 apart (Fig. 3) and until the back panel

                                            9
40 is a completely unfolded position so that the upper front span 50 and lower
front span 52 can be connected to the side panels 20 (Figs. 5 and 8). The locking
pieces 60 are slid over by the user to secure the lower front span 52 to the side
panels 20 (Figs. 9 and 10). The rear spans 70, 72 are connected to the back
panel 40 (Figs. 11 to 13) and secured using push pin fasteners 73. The top panel
80 is aligned and lowered onto the side panels (Fig. 14) and the top panel 80 is
secured to the side panels 20 using push pin fasteners 81 (Fig. 16).
[0049]       The drawer chest 10 can be assembled by 1 person and is likely to
take 20 to 30 minutes. In contrast, a traditional flat pack 3-drawer drawer chest is
likely to take 2 hours and require at least 2 people. Also, the drawer chest 10
does not require the use of tools and therefore requires less physical effort
compared to assembly of a traditional flat pack 3-drawer drawer chest.
