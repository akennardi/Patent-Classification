ABSTRACT
The present invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical composition, particularly an
aqueous ophthalmic composition, suitable as an injection, particularly an intravitreal
injection. The composition includes a biologic therapeutic agent (e.g., an isolated monoclonal
antibody that specifically binds to a C5 protein) that tends to raise the viscosity of the
composition and a guanidine and/or guanidine derivative (e.g., L-arginine) that tends to lower
the viscosity of the composition.

   Technical Field of the Invention
15
        The present invention is related to an aqueous pharmaceutical composition,
   particularly an aqueous ophthalmic composition, suitable as an injection,
   particularly an intravitreal injection, the composition including a biologic
   therapeutic agent (e.g., an isolated monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a
20 C5 protein), and guanidine and/or a guanidine derivative (e.g., L-arginine).
   Background of the Invention
           The pharmaceutical industry has been developing compositions that include
25 biologic therapeutic agents (e.g., biologics such as monoclonal antibodies) for
   many years for the treatment of a variety of maladies. Such biologics tend to be
   relatively large molecules which are quite amenable to oral delivery and some
   forms of parenteral delivery. However, biologics can present drawbacks for
   delivery by injection, particularly intravitreal injection. Due to their size, biologics,
30 when included in aqueous compositions, often impart substantial viscosity to those
   compositions. In turn, such compositions can be difficult to administer through an
   injection device (e.g., a syringe). However, injection of a biologic at a site of a
   disease or malady is quite desirable.
                                             - 1-

       WO 2013/174936                                                     PCT/EP2013/060649
             As a consequence, the pharmaceutical industry has committed substantial
     resources to developing techniques to lower the viscosity of aqueous compositions
     that include a biologic such as a monoclonal antibody. While the industry has been
     successful in its efforts to lower the viscosity of many aqueous composition
  5  containing biologics, forming a composition suitable for injection, particularly
     intravitreal injection, can be particularly daunting. For an intravitreal injection in
     particular, it is typically desirable to use a very small gauge needle (i.e., typically at
     least 28 gauge and more typically at least 30 gauge) to avoid harm to the eye.
     However, pushing a viscous composition through such a small needle is particularly
10   undesirable since it can be difficult for doctors to determine a proper amount of
     force to use to deliver the composition at a desired rate.
             Intravitreal injections are particularly desirable for treating retinal diseases
     such as age related macular degeneration (AMD) since an injection device (e.g., a
is   syringe with a needle) is typically used to located the injections in the vitreous closer
     to the retina, which is located at the back of the eye. Recently, it has been
     discovered that an IgGl/lambda isotype monoclonal antibody is able to slow the
      advance of age related macular degeneration (AMD), see U.S. Patent Application
     No. 20100034809, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
20    Unfortunately, the IgG1/lambda isotype monoclonal antibody, like many such
      antibodies, tends to significantly raise the viscosity of an aqueous compositions
      making it difficult to deliver as an intravitreal injection.
              One mechanism for lowering the viscosity of an aqueous composition
 25   containing monoclonal antibodies is to include some amount of one or more selected
      chemical compounds capable of causing a viscosity reduction.                   Arginine,
      particularly L-arginine, has been found to be particularly effective in lowering the
      viscosity of aqueous compositions. However, it has been suggested that arginine,
      particularly L-arginine, can be toxic to the eye and other human tissue. See: Retinal

    particularly the ophthalmic community, has avoided use of compounds such as
    arginine, particularly L-arginine, in ophthalmic compositions for lowering viscosity.
            Unexpectedly, however, the inventors of the composition of the present
  5 invention have discovered that a group of compounds and particularly arginine can
    be used at relatively low concentrations to lower the viscosity of aqueous
    compositions containing particular biologics such as monoclonal antibodies,
    particularly IgGl/lambda isotype monoclonal antibodies. Further, it has been found
    that viscosity can be lowered enough to be suitable for injection and even suitable
10  for intravitreal injection without harming the retina or other ocular tissue.
    Summary of the Invention
            Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an aqueous composition
15  suitable for injection. The composition includes a biologic therapeutic agent,
    guanidine and/or guanidine derivative (e.g., guanidine only, guanidine derivative
    only or a combination thereof) and water. The biologic therapeutic agent, when
    used to form a solution having a concentration of 100 mM of the biologic
    therapeutic agent in water, results in the solution having a viscosity that is at least 10
20  cp. The guanidine derivative has the following formula:

             R1 is nothing, CH 3, CnH 2 n 11, CH 2n, or CnH 2n1 (n=1-10); and/or
 25          R2 is nothing or any chemical group that does not significantly reduce the
     ability of the guanidinium group to lower the viscosity of the composition; and
             R1 and R2 are never nothing at the same time.
     The guanidine and/or guanidine derivative is present in the composition at a
     concentration of at least 25 mM but no greater than 100 mM. Further, the

    Detailed Description of the Invention
            The present invention is predicated upon the formation of a pharmaceutical
    composition, preferably an ophthalmic composition, that is suitable for injection into
is  a mammal, particularly a human body and preferably suitable for intravitreal
    injection into the vitreous of a mannalian eye, particularly the human eye. In a
    narrow sense, the invention involves the discovery that low concentrations of
    arginine, particularly L-arginine, do not exhibit any significant toxicity to the eye
    while still maintaining the ability to sufficiently lower the viscosity of an aqueous
20  composition containing an IgGl/lambda isotype monoclonal antibody thereby
    making that aqueous composition suitable for intravitreal injection. In a broader
    sense, it is contemplated that the invention of the present application could be
    applied to other monoclonal antibodies or other antibodies or biologic therapeutic
     agents (i.e., biologics) in general. It is further contemplated that guanidine and
25   guanidine derivatives other than arginine may also be used at low concentrations to
     lower viscosity of aqueous composition containing IgGl/lambda isotype monoclonal
     antibody or other such antibodies or biologics. While the composition of the present
     invention has been found particularly desirable for intravitreal injection, it is further
     contemplated that compositions can be formed hereunder for application to other
 30  biological targets (e.g., intramuscular injections or the like) of the body if the
     toxicity of the guanidine and/or guanidine derivative, particularly arginine, proves
     sufficiently low relative to that biological target. Advantageously, the discoveries
     discussed herein open pathways of delivery of not only the antibodies discussed
     herein, but potentially other biologics as well.

             The biologic of the composition of the present application is preferably a
    binding antibody or antigen binding fragment. The biologic is typically present in
    the composition at a concentration that is at least 10 milligrams per milliliter
    (mg/ml), more typically at least 50 mg/ml, even more typically at least 75 mg/ml
 5  and still more typically at least 90 mg/ml. The biologic is also typically present in
    the composition at a concentration that is no greater than 200 milligrams per
    milliliter (mg/ml), more typically no greater than 150 mg/ml, even more typically no
    greater than 125 mg/ml and still more typically no greater than 110 mg/ml.
    Compositions of the present invention containing the biologic, at these
10  concentrations, and particularly at a concentration of 100 mg/ml, will typically
    exhibit a viscosity that is at least 3 centipoise (cp), more typically at least 5 ep, even
    more typically at least 7 cp greater than a viscosity of a substantially identical
     composition that does not contain the biologic. As used herein, a substantially
     identical composition that does not contain the biologic is a composition having
is   exactly the same concentrations of each of the excipients of the composition of the
    present invention with the exception that the biologic is not present. For this
     definition of substantially identical composition, water is not considered an
     excipient, but is present in the substantially identical composition in an amount
     sufficient that the excipients are at proper concentrations. Example 2 of the
20   examples presented below illustrates such a substantially identical composition.
     Furthermore, compositions containing only the biologic at these concentrations in
     water, and particularly at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, will typically having a
     viscosity that is at least 10 cp, more typically at least 15 cp and even possibly at least
     20 or even 22 ep.

              Unless otherwise specifically stated, viscosity of any composition discussed
     herein is determined at a temperature of 20 'C and a shear rate of 1029 s- with a
     cone spindle of geometry 0.50/40 mm.

      at least 25,000 daltons, more typically at least 50,000 daltons and even possibly at
      least 75,000 daltons. The biologic of the present invention also typically has a
      molecular weight that is no greater than 500,000 daltons, more typically no greater
      than 280,000 daltons and even possibly no greater than 175,000 daltons.

      binding molecule (e.g., C5-binding antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof).

    pM to about 200 pM.
             In a preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is an isolated
    monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a C5 protein. The antibody can be an
10  isolated human or humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a C5
    protein.     The antibody can additionally or alternatively be an isolated chimeric
     antibody that specifically binds to a C5 protein. As a further additional or
     alternative characteristic, the antibody can comprise a human heavy chain constant
    region and a human light chain constant region.

     protein. The antibody can be a Fab fragment.          The antibody can additionally or
     alternatively be scFv. Preferably, the antibody is an IgG isotype.
             It is also contemplated that the isolated antibody or antigen binding fragment
     thereof can comprise a framework in which amino acids have been substituted into
20   the antibody framework from respective human VH or VL germline sequences.

            The composition of the present invention also includes guanidine, or a
    guanidine derivative (i.e., any molecule that includes a guanidinium group) or a
    combination thereof. This means that the composition can include guanidine only,
    guanidine derivative only or a combination of guanidine and guanidine derivative.
10  The guanidine derivative is preferably according to the following formula:

             wherein:
15           RI is nothing, CH 3 , CH 2n 1 , CH 2 n, or CH 2 n1 (n=1-10); and/or
             R2 is nothing or any chemical group that does not significantly reduce the
     ability of the guanidinium group to lower the viscosity of the composition; and
             R1 and R2 are never nothing at the same time.
             As used herein, the phrase "does not significantly reduce the ability of the
20   guanidinium group to lower the viscosity of the composition" means that, compared
     to a preselected amount of guanidine, an equivalent molar amount of the guanidine
     derivative lowers the viscosity of the composition at least 70% as much as the
     guanidine. In other words, if 2 moles of guanidine were provided in a composition
     and lowered the viscosity of the composition 10 cps relative to the composition
 25  without guanidine, then replacing the 2 moles of guanidine with 2 moles of
     guanidine derivative would lower the viscosity of the same composition at least 7
     cps relative to the composition without guanidine or a guanidine derivative.

            In a still further preferred embodiment:
10          RI is a C -C9 alkyl group, more preferably a CI-C 5 alkyl group and even more
    preferably a C 2 -C 4 alkyl group; and
            R2 is NH 2 COOH, NH 2CH 2CH 2 SO3H or a combination thereof.
            In a still further preferred embodiment:
15          RI is a CI-C 9 alkyl group, more preferably a CI-C 5 alkyl group and even more
     preferably a C2 -C4 alkyl group; and
            R2 is NH 2 COOH.
            It is also preferable that RI is a straight chain alkyl group. Arginine,
20   particularly L-arginine, is a highly preferred guanidine derivative for the
     composition and is also a guanidine derivative and an amino acid.
            It has been suggested that arginine and compounds similar to arginine can be
     toxic. However, it has been advantageously found that lower levels of arginine
25   exhibit substantially lower toxicity and even substantial non-toxicity. It has been
     specifically found that lower concentrations of arginine do not cause damage to
     photoreceptor cells of the eye of a rabbit while higher concentrations (e.g., about
      150 inM) have shown damage to photoreceptor cells. As such, the guanidine and/or
     guanidine derivative, particularly arginine and more particularly L-arginine, is
 30  typically present in the composition at a concentration that is at least 25 mM, more
     typically at least 35 mM and even more typically at least 45 mM. The guanidine
     and/or guanidine derivative, particularly arginine and more particularly L-arginine,
     is also typically present in the composition at a concentration that no greater than
      100 mM, more typically no greater than 65 mM and even more typically at least 55
 35  mM.

            Advantageously, the guanidine and/or guanidine derivative (e.g., L-arginine),
    even at the low concentrations recited above, can substantially reduce the viscosity
    of the composition produced by the inclusion of the biologic within the composition.
    Compositions of the present invention containing the guanidine and/or guanidine
 5  derivative, at the above concentrations, and particularly at a concentration of 50
    mM, will typically exhibit a viscosity that is at least 3 centipoise (cp), more typically
    at least 5 cp, even more typically at least 7 cp lower than a viscosity of a
    substantially identical composition that does not contain the guanidine and/or
    guanidine derivative. As used herein, a substantially identical composition that does
10  not contain the guanidine and/or guanidine derivative is a composition having
    exactly the same concentrations of each of the excipients and the biologic of the
    composition of the present invention with the exception that the guanidine and/or
    guanidine derivative is not present. For this definition of substantially identical
    composition, water is not considered an excipient, but is present in the substantially
is  identical composition in an amount sufficient that the excipients and biologic are at
    proper concentrations. Example 3 of the examples presented below illustrates such a
    substantially identical composition.
            The composition of the present invention will also typically include a protein
    stabilizing agent, although not necessarily required unless specifically stated.
20  Examples of potential protein stabilizing agents include without limitation,
    mannitol, sodium chloride, glycine and trehalose. In a preferred embodiment, the
    protein stabilizing agent is or consists essentially of trehalose. When included, the
    protein stabilizing agent is typically present in the composition at a concentration
    that is at least 50 mM, more typically at least 80 mM and even more typically at
25   least 110 mM. When included, the protein stabilizing agent is also typically present
     in the composition at a concentration that is no greater than 250 mM, more typically
     no greater than 175 mM and even more typically no greater than 130 mM.
             The composition of the present invention will also typically include a
     surfactant, although not necessarily required unless specifically stated.             The
 30  surfactant can include non-ionic, an anionic, a cationic, or an amphoteric or
     zwitterionic surfactant or a     combination of such surfactants.          Examples of
     potentially suitable surfactant include, without limitation, ethers of fatty alcohols
     and/or polyoxyethylene alkyl    ethers, e.g., macrogol ethers such as cetomacrogol
      1000, polyoxyethylene castor   oil derivatives, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid
 35  esters, e.g., the commercially available Tweens@, polyoxyethylene               stearates,

    polysorbates, polaxamers, cyclodextrins, combinations thereof or the like.
    Polysorbate 20 is a particularly preferred surfactant. When included, the surfactant
    is typically present in the composition at a concentration that is at least 0.001 w/v%,
    more typically at least 0.005 w/v% and even more typically at least 0.009 w/v%,
 5  When included, the protein stabilizing agent is also typically present in the
    composition at a concentration that is no greater than 0.1 w/v%, more typically no
    greater than 0.05 w/v% and even more typically no greater than 0.015 w/v%.
             The composition of the present invention will also typically include a
    buffering agent, although not necessarily required unless specifically stated.
10  Examples of potentially suitable buffering agents include, without limitation, sodium
    phosphate, citrate and histidine. Histidine is a particularly preferred buffering agent.
    When included, the buffering agent is typically present in the composition at a
     concentration that is at least 2 mM, more typically at least 7 mM and even more
     typically at least 9 mM. When included, the buffering agent is also typically present
is   in the composition at a concentration that is no greater than 30 mM, more typically
     no greater than 15 mM and even more typically no greater than 11 ImM.
              Additional Ingredients
              Various additional ingredients can be included in the composition of the
20   present invention. The composition of the present invention are typically aqueous
     and typically include a substantial amount (e.g., at least 60 or 90 w/v%) of water.
              As one particular advantage of the present invention, it has been found that
      guanidine and/or guanidine derivative, particularly arginine, can reduce aggregation
25    of the biologic, particularly aggregation of an isolated monoclonal antibody that
      specifically binds to a C5 protein. It has also advantageously been found that the
      guanidine and/or guanidine derivative (e.g., L-arginine) and the biologic (e.g., an
      isolated monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a C5 protein) can be
      combined in composition of the present invention to substantially lower the viscosity
 30   of the composition, particularly at lower pH. The viscosity of the composition is
      typically at least 2 cp, more typically at least 3 cp and even more typically at least 4
      cp. The viscosity of the composition is also typically no greater than 10 cp, more
      typically no greater than 7.5 cp and even more typically no greater than 6 cp or even
       5.5 cp. The pH of the composition is typically at least 3, more typically at least 4
 35   and even more typically at least 5.2. The viscosity of the composition is also
                                                - 12-

       WO 2013/174936                                                     PCT/EP2013/060649
    typically no greater than 8, more typically no greater than 6.5 and even more
    typically no greater than 5.9 or even 5.7.
             By providing such lowered viscosity, the composition can be administered
 5  much easier through an injection device and particularly through a relatively small
    gauge needle. As used herein, the term "small gauge needle" refers to any elongated
    tubular member designed to penetrate and be inserted through biologic tissue such as
    skin or ocular tissue (e.g., corneal, seleral and/or conjunctival tissue). Further, the
    tern "gauge", as used herein, is meant to provide referrals to inner and outer
10   diameters of the common numerical gauge system used for syringe needles.
    Advantageously, compositions of the present invention can be injected through
     small gauge needles having a gauge that is at least 27, more typically at least 28, still
     more typically at least 29 or 30 and even possibly at least 31. As a further
     advantage, the ability to use such small gauge needles allows for more desirable
15   intravitreal injection of composition of the present invention for treatment of retinal
     diseases such as age related macular degeneration.
             Thus, the present invention is further directed to methods of treating diseases.
     Accordingly, an injection device (e.g., a syringe) having a chamber defining a
20   containment space that is in fluid communication with a tunnel of a small gage
     needle is typically provided. The containment space is loaded or otherwise filled
     with the composition of the present invention. The injection device can then be used
     to deliver the composition to a biological target. Preferably, the small gauge needle
     is used to pierce the tissue of the biologic target followed by injection of the
25    composition to the target. As suggested, the composition allows for particularly
      suitable injection to the eye. Thus, in a preferred embodiment the biologic target is
      the eye, the tissue pierced by the needle is the cornea, the conjunctiva, the sclera or a
      combination thereof and the composition is injection into the vitreous of the eye.
 30           The volume of the injection is typically is typically at least 10 microliters
      ( 1), more typically at least 35 pl and even more typically at least 45 pl. The
      volume of the injection is also typically no greater than 100 [l, more typically no
      greater than 75 pl and even more typically no greater than 60 tl.

           It is understood that the concentrations in table I can be varied by ±10%,
    20%, ±30%, ±90% of those concentrations or more and that those variances can be
    specifically used to create ranges for the ingredients of the composition of the
 s  present invention. For example, an ingredient at a concentration of 10 mM with a
    variance of ±20% means that the ingredient can have a concentration range of 8 to
    12 mM.

    As can be seen, even relatively low concentrations of arginine can significantly
    lower the viscosity of the compositions containing the biologic. As suggested,
    guanidine and/or guanidine derivative and particularly arginine can lower the
 5  aggregation of the biologic. With reference to Fig. 1, it can be seen that the
    formulations with arginine (i.e., formulations 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13) exhibit
    significantly reduced aggregation. For Fig. 1, t=0 is time equal to zero, shaking is
    measurement after shaking, F/T is measurement after freeze/thaw cycle and 40 C 6
    w is measurement after six weeks of storage at 40 C.

    Toxicity Data
            A study was performed to determine the toxicity of an Arginine-containing
    formulation buffer following intravitreal administration to the New Zealand White
10  rabbit for 4 weeks. Three buffers in 50 Ll volumes and varying in concentrations of
    Arginine were injected intravitreally on a weekly basis for 3 weeks (i.e., three doses)
     and evaluated for toxicity. The three buffers were as follows: (1) 10 mM Histidine,
     170 mM, Trehalose, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5; (2) 50 mM Arginine, 10 mM,
     Histidine, 120 mM Trehalose, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5; and (3) 150 mM
is   Arginine, 10 mM Histidine, 0.01% polysorbate). The buffer containing 150mM
     Arginine showed degeneration/atrophy of the retina either bilaterally or unilaterally
     in 4 out of 6 animals. Minimal changes were characterized by a focal to multifocal
     loss of the photoreceptors layer whereas in more severe cases, other layers were
     affected, resulting in atrophy of the retina. Intravitreal administration of the buffer
20   containing 50 mM arginine was very well tolerated and gave no indication of ocular
     toxicity.
             A study was performed in which the following formulation: an antibody, 50
     mM Arginine; 10 mM Histidine; 120 mM Trehalose, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5,
 25  was administered intravitreally to cynomolgus monkeys for at least 26 weeks. The
      formulation was administered in both eyes (50 [L/eye) once every two weeks for 26
     weeks (14 doses). Based on the results of this study, intravitreal administration of
      the formulation at repeated dosing up to 5 mg/eye to the cynomolgus monkey was
      very well tolerated and gave no indication of test item toxicity.
