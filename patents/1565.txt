   The present invention relates to the field of diagnostic methods. Specifically, the present
   invention contemplates a method for diagnosing pancreatic cancer in a subject, a method for
   identifying whether a subject is in need for a therapy of pancreatic cancer or a method for
   determining whether a pancreatic cancer therapy is successful. The invention also relates to
10 tools for carrying out the aforementioned methods, such as diagnostic devices.
   Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of all solid tumors with 5-year survival rates of
   less than 5% but an increasing incidence (Everhart 2009, Gastroenterology 136:1134
   11449). There is a widely acknowledged demand for the establishment of innovative tools
15 and technologies for point-of-care utilization of specific biomarkers and novel molecular
   imaging tools for early diagnosis, prognostic stratification and differential diagnosis of
   pancreatic cancer. Advances in these areas are pivotal to improve the prognosis of this
   malignancy, since timely surgical resection of early stage tumors is currently the only
   effective means of treatment of this dismal disease.
20
   The mortality of this cancer type is the highest of any cancer type in Europe and the western
   world. People die soon after diagnosis due to the lack of means for early detection. Early
   symptoms are rare and uncharacteristic. Thus, PDACs are commonly diagnosed in an
   advanced stage of the disease. To date, the best imaging technologies to detect PDAC are
25 endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), spiral computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
   cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
   (ERCP) (Dewitt 2006, Gastroenterol Hepatol. (4):717-25). Unfortunately, the resolution of
   these technologies for detecting neoplastic lesions within the pancreas is in the range of 3
    10 mm. Thus, they are not able to detect pancreatic neoplasia at a curable stage. The serum
30 concentration of conventional tumor markers such as CA1 9-9 is increased in a subset of
   pancreatic cancer patients (Fry 2008, Langenbecks Arch Surg. (393): 883-90). However, so
   far all available markers lack sensitivity and tumor specificity. Thus, new approaches are
   urgently needed to increase the diagnostic sensitivity towards the detection of very small,
   early stage PDAC and its precursor lesions (PanINs and IPMNs) as well as prognostic
35 subgroups of advanced tumors.

   The association between chronic inflammation and the development of malignancies has
   been recognized for many years. For pancreatic cancer this association was only recently
   confirmed and a consensus conference agreed upon a new classification for pancreatic
 5 intraepithelial neoplasia as noninvasive precursor lesions (Hruban 2004, Am J Surg Path
   (28): 977-987). Chronic pancreatitis is defined as recurrent bouts of a sterile inflammatory
   disease characterized by often progressive and irreversible morphological changes, typically
   causing pain and permanent impairment of pancreatic function. With an incidence of 8.2, a
   prevalence of 27.4 per 100 000 population and a 0.04% to 5% frequency in unselected
10 autopsy specimens chronic pancreatitis represents a frequent disorder of the gastrointestinal
   tract. Various etiologies are responsible for the development of chronic pancreatitis. An
   increased risk of patients suffering from of chronic pancreatitis to die from pancreatic cancer
   was shown in an international cooperative investigation conducted by AB Lowenfels and
   coworkers as a multicenter historical cohort study of 2015 patients with chronic pancreatitis
15 recruited from clinical centers in 6 countries in 1993. This study found a cumulative risk of
   pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis of 1.8% after 10 years and of 4% after
   20 years with a standardized incidence ratio of 14.4. For patients with a minimum of two
   years follow up the risk of pancreatic cancer was 16.5 fold higher than that of the general
   population (Lowenfels 1993, N Engl J Med (328): 1433-1437). The search for an association
20 between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer intensified when in 1996 a single point
   mutation in the third exon of the cationic trypsinogen gene on chromosome 7 (7q35) was
   found to be associated with hereditary pancreatitis and multiple kindreds were subsequently
   identified and reported. Only very recently the EUROPAC study group presented their work
   on clinical and genetic characteristics in hereditary pancreatitis. In a multilevel proportional
25 hazard model employing data obtained from the European Registry of Hereditary
   Pancreatitis this group presented 112 families in 14 countries (418 affected individuals)
   (Howes 2004, Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2): 252-261). The cumulative risk
   (95% CI) of pancreatic cancer was 44.0% (8.0% - 80.0%) at 70 years from symptom onset
   with a standardized incidence ratio of 67% (50% - 82%). A previous study had also shown
30 an estimated lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of 40% (Lowenfels 2001, JAMA 286: 169-170,
   Lowenfels 1997, J Natl Cancer Inst 89: 442-44656).
   In pancreatic cancer imaging studies fail to detect early pancreatic malignancies in a curable
   stage, however in the background of chronic pancreatitis imaging studies such as EUS, CT
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                             3
   or MRI drop sensitivity and specificity to a degree where tossing a coin is equally reliable.
   Thus, the detection of pancreatic malignancy in a high risk cohort would be higly desired.
   There are a few reports of metabolic changes in patients suffering pancreas-associated
 5 diseases. Schrader et al (Schrader 2009, Panceas 38: 416-421) suggests that patients with
   pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis show significant changes in serum aminoacid
   levels. It has been suggested that among the ceramides sphingomyelin on the cell surface of
   cancer cells takes actively part in cell signalling. Ceramides are known to induce apoptosis
   in cancer cells. Low levels of sphingomyelin suggest less responsiveness to gemcitabine
10 treatment (Modrak 2009, Mol Cancer Res 7:890-896).
   In conclusion with a 5-year survival rate of 0.5-5%, pancreatic cancer carries the most
   dismal prognosis of all human tumors and represents the 4th leading cause in cancer
   related deaths worldwide. It is thus a disease with a major socioeconomic impact. Accurate
15 diagnosis and timely surgical resection of early tumors currently offer the only realistic
   prospect for the improvement of patient prognosis.
   It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such reference
   does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general
20 knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.
   The technical problem underlying the present invention can be seen as the provision of
   means and methods for complying with the aforementioned needs. The technical problem is
   solved by the embodiments characterized in the claims and herein below.
25
   Thus, the present invention relates to a method for diagnosing pancreas cancer in a subject
                comprising the steps of:
                (a)           determining in a sample of a subject suspected to suffer from pancreas
                              cancer the amount of at least one biomarker from Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a,
30                            or4b; and
                (b)           comparing the said amount of the at least one biomarker with a reference,
                              whereby pancreas cancer is to be diagnosed.
   The method as referred to in accordance with the present invention includes a method which
35 essentially consists of the aforementioned steps or a method which includes further steps.
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                    4
   However, it is to be understood that the method, in a preferred embodiment, is a method
   carried out ex vivo, i.e. not practised on the human or animal body. The method, preferably,
   can be assisted by automation.
 5 The term "diagnosing" as used herein refers to assessing whether a subject suffers from the
   pancreatic cancer, or not. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, such an
   assessment, although preferred to be, may usually not be correct for 100% of the
   investigated subjects. The term, however, requires that a statistically significant portion of
   subjects can be correctly assessed and, thus, diagnosed. Whether a portion is statistically
10 significant can be determined without further ado by the person skilled in the art using
   various well known statistic evaluation tools, e.g., determination of confidence intervals, p
   value determination, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test, etc.. Details are found in Dowdy
   and Wearden, Statistics for Research, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1983. Preferred
   confidence intervals are at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%
15 or at least 95%. The p-values are, preferably, 0.2, 0.1, or 0.05.
   The term includes individual diagnosis of pancreatic cancer or its symptoms as well as
   continuous monitoring of a patient. Monitoring, i.e. diagnosing the presence or absence of
   pancreatic cancer or the symptoms accompanying it at various time points, includes
20 monitoring of patients known to suffer from pancreatic cancer as well as monitoring of
   subjects known to be at risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, monitoring can
   also be used to determine whether a patient is treated successfully or whether at least
   symptoms of pancreatic cancer can be ameliorated over time by a certain therapy.
25 The term "pancreatic cancer" or "pancreas cancer" as used herein relates to cancer which is
   derived from pancreatic cells. Preferably, pancreatic cancer as used herein is pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma. The symptoms accompanying pancreatic cancer are well known from
   standard text books of medicine such as Stedmen or Pschyrembl. Moreover, the terms
   "cancer" and "carcinoma" may, in general, also be used herein interchangeably.
30
   The term "biomarker" as used herein refers to a molecular species which serves as an
   indicator for a disease or effect as referred to in this specification. Said molecular species
   can be a metabolite itself which is found in a sample of a subject. Moreover, the biomarker
   may also be a molecular species which is derived from said metabolite. In such a case, the
35 actual metabolite will be chemically modified in the sample or during the determination
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                     5
   process and, as a result of said modification, a chemically different molecular species, i.e.
   the analyte, will be the determined molecular species. It is to be understood that in such a
   case, the analyte represents the actual metabolite and has the same potential as an
   indicator for the respective medical condition.
 5
   Moreover, a biomarker according to the present invention is not necessarily corresponding
   to one molecular species. Rather, the biomarker may comprise stereoisomers or
   enantiomeres of a compound. Further, a biomarker can also represent the sum of isomers of
   a biological class of isomeric molecules. Said isomers shall exhibit identical analytical
10 characteristics in some cases and are, therefore, not distinguishable by various analytical
   methods including those applied in the accompanying Examples described below. However,
   the isomers will share at least identical sum formula parameters and, thus, in the case of,
   e.g., lipids an identical chain length and identical numbers of double bonds in the fatty acid
   and/or sphingo base moieties
15
   Polar biomarkers can be, preferably, obtained by techniques referred to in this specification
   elsewhere and as described in Example 1, below. Lipid biomarkers can be obtained in
   accordance with the present invention, preferably, as described in this specification
   elsewhere and, in particular, either as lipid fraction by separation of a sample after protein
20 precipitation into an aqueous polar and an organic lipid phase by, e.g., a mixture of ethanol
   and dichloromethane as described in Example 1, below. Those biomarkers may be marked
   by "lipid fraction" herein. Alternatively or in addition, complex lipids can be obtained by
   liquid/liquid extraction using chloroform/methanol followed by fractionation using normal
   phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) as described in Example 1, below. Those biomarkers
25 may be marked or marked in addition by the specific sub-fraction, e.g., "ceramide fraction" or
   "CER" or "sphingomyelins" or "SM" etc.. Further details are found below in the Tables.
   In the method according to the present invention, at least one metabolite of the biomarkers
   shown in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, or 4b is to be determined. However, more preferably, a
30 group of biomarkers will be determined in order to strengthen specificity and/or sensitivity of
   the assessment. Such a group, preferably, comprises at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least
   5, at least 10 or up to all of the said biomarkers shown in the Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, or
   4b.

   plasma, serum, saliva or urine, or samples derived, e.g., by biopsy, from cells, tissues or
   organs, in particular from the heart. More preferably, the sample is a blood, plasma or serum
   sample, most preferably, a plasma sample. Biological samples can be derived from a
15 subject as specified elsewhere herein. Techniques for obtaining the aforementioned different
   types of biological samples are well known in the art. For example, blood samples may be
   obtained by blood taking while tissue or organ samples are to be obtained, e.g., by biopsy.
   The aforementioned samples are, preferably, pre-treated before they are used for the
20 method of the present invention. As described in more detail below, said pre-treatment may
   include treatments required to release or separate the compounds or to remove excessive
   material or waste. Suitable techniques comprise centrifugation, extraction, fractioning,
   ultrafiltration, protein precipitation followed by filtration and purification and/or enrichment of
   compounds. Moreover, other pre-treatments are carried out in order to provide the
25 compounds in a form or concentration suitable for compound analysis. For example, if gas
   chromatography coupled mass spectrometry is used in the method of the present invention,
   it will be required to derivatize the compounds prior to the said gas chromatography.
   Suitable and necessary pre-treatments depend on the means used for carrying out the
   method of the invention and are well known to the person skilled in the art. Pre-treated
30 samples as described before are also comprised by the term "sample" as used in
   accordance with the present invention.
   The term "subject" as used herein relates to animals and, preferably, to mammals. More
   preferably, the subject is a primate and, most preferably, a human. The subject, preferably,
35 is suspected to suffer from pancreatic cancer, i.e. it may already show some or all of the
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                     10
   symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, the subject may also preferably suffer
   from or shall be suspected to suffer from pancreatitis and/or liver cirrhosis in addition.
   Preferably, the subject, however, is besides the aforementioned diseases and disorders
   apparently healthy. The said subject, preferably, is at increased risk of developing pancreatic
 5 cancer (Brand RE et al ,Gut. 2007;56:1460-9). More preferably, such a subject being at
   increased risk has one or more relatives suffering from pancreatic cancer, has a defined
   genetic predisposition for developing pancreatic cancer, including but not exclusive to Peutz
   Jeghers Syndrome, has one or more relatives suffering from pancreatitis, and/or has a
   defined genetic predisposition for developing pancreatitis.
10
   The term "determining the amount" as used herein refers to determining at least one
   characteristic feature of a biomarker to be determined by the method of the present
   invention in the sample. Characteristic features in accordance with the present invention are
   features which characterize the physical and/or chemical properties including biochemical
15 properties of a biomarker. Such properties include, e.g., molecular weight, viscosity, density,
   electrical charge, spin, optical activity, colour, fluorescence, chemoluminescence,
   elementary composition, chemical structure, capability to react with other compounds,
   capability to elicit a response in a biological read out system (e.g., induction of a reporter
   gene) and the like. Values for said properties may serve as characteristic features and can
20 be determined by techniques well known in the art. Moreover, the characteristic feature may
   be any feature which is derived from the values of the physical and/or chemical properties of
   a biomarker by standard operations, e.g., mathematical calculations such as multiplication,
   division or logarithmic calculus. Most preferably, the at least one characteristic feature allows
   the determination and/or chemical identification of the said at least one biomarker and its
25 amount. Accordingly, the characteristic value, preferably, also comprises information relating
   to the abundance of the biomarker from which the characteristic value is derived. For
   example, a characteristic value of a biomarker may be a peak in a mass spectrum. Such a
   peak contains characteristic information of the biomarker, i.e. the m/z information, as well as
   an intensity value being related to the abundance of the said biomarker (i.e. its amount) in
30 the sample.
   As discussed before, each biomarker comprised by a sample may be, preferably,
   determined in accordance with the present invention quantitatively or semi-quantitatively.
   For quantitative determination, either the absolute or precise amount of the biomarker will be
35 determined or the relative amount of the biomarker will be determined based on the value
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                   11
   determined for the characteristic feature(s) referred to herein above. The relative amount
   may be determined in a case were the precise amount of a biomarker can or shall not be
   determined. In said case, it can be determined whether the amount in which the biomarker is
   present is enlarged or diminished with respect to a second sample comprising said
 5 biomarker in a second amount. In a preferred embodiment said second sample comprising
   said biomarker shall be a calculated reference as specified elsewhere herein. Quantitatively
   analysing a biomarker, thus, also includes what is sometimes referred to as semi
   quantitative analysis of a biomarker.
10 Moreover, determining as used in the method of the present invention, preferably, includes
   using a compound separation step prior to the analysis step referred to before. Preferably,
   said compound separation step yields a time resolved separation of the metabolites
   comprised by the sample. Suitable techniques for separation to be used preferably in
   accordance with the present invention, therefore, include all chromatographic separation
15 techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC), high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), thin layer chromatography, size exclusion or affinity
   chromatography. These techniques are well known in the art and can be applied by the
   person skilled in the art without further ado. Most preferably, LC and/or GC are
   chromatographic techniques to be envisaged by the method of the present invention.
20 Suitable devices for such determination of biomarkers are well known in the art. Preferably,
   mass spectrometry is used in particular gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS),
   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), direct infusion mass spectrometry or
   Fourier transform ion-cyclotrone-resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), capillary
   electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography
25 coupled mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), quadrupole mass spectrometry, any sequentially
   coupled mass spectrometry, such as MS-MS or MS-MS-MS, inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS), ion mobility mass
   spectrometry or time of flight mass spectrometry (TOF). Most preferably, LC-MS and/or GC
   MS are used as described in detail below. Said techniques are disclosed in, e.g., Nissen
30 1995, Journal of Chromatography A, 703: 37-57, US 4,540,884 or US 5,397,894, the
   disclosure content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. As an alternative or in
   addition to mass spectrometry techniques, the following techniques may be used for
   compound determination: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), Fourier transform infrared analysis (FT-IR), ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, refraction
35 index (RI), fluorescent detection, radiochemical detection, electrochemical detection, light
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                  12
   scattering (LS), dispersive Raman spectroscopy or flame ionisation detection (FID). These
   techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art and can be applied without further
   ado. The method of the present invention shall be, preferably, assisted by automation. For
   example, sample processing or pre-treatment can be automated by robotics. Data
 5 processing and comparison is, preferably, assisted by suitable computer programs and
   databases. Automation as described herein before allows using the method of the present
   invention in high-throughput approaches.
   Moreover, the at least one biomarker can also be determined by a specific chemical or
10 biological assay. Said assay shall comprise means which allow to specifically detect the at
   least one biomarker in the sample. Preferably, said means are capable of specifically
   recognizing the chemical structure of the biomarker or are capable of specifically identifying
   the biomarker based on its capability to react with other compounds or its capability to elicit
   a response in a biological read out system (e.g., induction of a reporter gene). Means which
15 are capable of specifically recognizing the chemical structure of a biomarker are, preferably,
   antibodies or other proteins which specifically interact with chemical structures, such as
   receptors or enzymes. Specific antibodies, for instance, may be obtained using the
   biomarker as antigen by methods well known in the art. Antibodies as referred to herein
   include both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, as well as fragments thereof, such as
20 Fv, Fab and F(ab) 2 fragments that are capable of binding the antigen or hapten. The present
   invention also includes humanized hybrid antibodies wherein amino acid sequences of a
   non-human donor antibody exhibiting a desired antigen-specificity are combined with
   sequences of a human acceptor antibody. Moreover, encompassed are single chain
   antibodies. The donor sequences will usually include at least the antigen-binding amino acid
25 residues of the donor but may comprise other structurally and/or functionally relevant amino
   acid residues of the donor antibody as well. Such hybrids can be prepared by several
   methods well known in the art. Suitable proteins which are capable of specifically
   recognizing the biomarker are, preferably, enzymes which are involved in the metabolic
   conversion of the said biomarker. Said enzymes may either use the biomarker as a
30 substrate or may convert a substrate into the biomarker. Moreover, said antibodies may be
   used as a basis to generate oligopeptides which specifically recognize the biomarker. These
   oligopeptides shall, for example, comprise the enzyme's binding domains or pockets for the
   said biomarker. Suitable antibody and/or enzyme based assays may be RIA
   (radioimmunoassay), ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), sandwich enzyme
35 immune tests, electrochemiluminescence sandwich immunoassays (ECLIA), dissociation
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                     13
   enhanced lanthanide fluoro immuno assay (DELFIA) or solid phase immune tests.
   Moreover, the biomarker may also be determined based on its capability to react with other
   compounds, i.e. by a specific chemical reaction. Further, the biomarker may be determined
   in a sample due to its capability to elicit a response in a biological read out system. The
 5 biological response shall be detected as read out indicating the presence and/or the amount
   of the biomarker comprised by the sample. The biological response may be, e.g., the
   induction of gene expression or a phenotypic response of a cell or an organism. In a
   preferred embodiment the determination of the least one biomarker is a quantitative process,
   e.g., allowing also the determination of the amount of the at least one biomarker in the
10 sample
   As described above, said determining of the at least one biomarker can, preferably,
   comprise mass spectrometry (MS). Mass spectrometry as used herein encompasses all
   techniques which allow for the determination of the molecular weight (i.e. the mass) or a
15 mass variable corresponding to a compound, i.e. a biomarker, to be determined in
   accordance with the present invention. Preferably, mass spectrometry as used herein
   relates to GC-MS, LC-MS, direct infusion mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS, CE-MS, HPLC
   MS, quadrupole mass spectrometry, any sequentially coupled mass spectrometry such as
   MS-MS or MS-MS-MS, ICP-MS, Py-MS, TOF or any combined approaches using the
20 aforementioned techniques. How to apply these techniques is well known to the person
   skilled in the art. Moreover, suitable devices are commercially available. More preferably,
   mass spectrometry as used herein relates to LC-MS and/or GC-MS, i.e. to mass
   spectrometry being operatively linked to a prior chromatographic separation step. More
   preferably, mass spectrometry as used herein encompasses quadrupole MS. Most
25 preferably, said quadrupole MS is carried out as follows: a) selection of a mass/charge
   quotient (m/z) of an ion created by ionisation in a first analytical quadrupole of the mass
   spectrometer, b) fragmentation of the ion selected in step a) by applying an acceleration
   voltage in an additional subsequent quadrupole which is filled with a collision gas and acts
   as a collision chamber, c) selection of a mass/charge quotient of an ion created by the
30 fragmentation process in step b) in an additional subsequent quadrupole, whereby steps a)
   to c) of the method are carried out at least once and analysis of the mass/charge quotient of
   all the ions present in the mixture of substances as a result of the ionisation process,
   whereby the quadrupole is filled with collision gas but no acceleration voltage is applied
   during the analysis. Details on said most preferred mass spectrometry to be used in
35 accordance with the present invention can be found in WO 03/073464.
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                    14
   More preferably, said mass spectrometry is liquid chromatography (LC) MS and/or gas
   chromatography (GC) MS. Liquid chromatography as used herein refers to all techniques
   which allow for separation of compounds (i.e. metabolites) in liquid or supercritical phase.
 5 Liquid chromatography is characterized in that compounds in a mobile phase are passed
   through the stationary phase. When compounds pass through the stationary phase at
   different rates they become separated in time since each individual compound has its
   specific retention time (i.e. the time which is required by the compound to pass through the
   system). Liquid chromatography as used herein also includes HPLC. Devices for liquid
10 chromatography are commercially available, e.g. from Agilent Technologies, USA. Gas
   chromatography as applied in accordance with the present invention, in principle, operates
   comparable to liquid chromatography. However, rather than having the compounds (i.e.
   metabolites) in a liquid mobile phase which is passed through the stationary phase, the
   compounds will be present in a gaseous volume. The compounds pass the column which
15 may contain solid support materials as stationary phase or the walls of which may serve as
   or are coated with the stationary phase. Again, each compound has a specific time which is
   required for passing through the column. Moreover, in the case of gas chromatography it is
   preferably envisaged that the compounds are derivatised prior to gas chromatography.
   Suitable techniques for derivatisation are well known in the art. Preferably, derivatisation in
20 accordance with the present invention relates to methoxymation and trimethylsilylation of,
   preferably, polar compounds and transmethylation, methoxymation and trimethylsilylation of,
   preferably, non-polar (i.e. lipophilic) compounds.
   The term "reference" refers to values of characteristic features of each of the biomarker
25 which can be correlated to a medical condition, i.e. the presence or absence of the disease,
   diseases status or an effect referred to herein. Preferably, a reference is a threshold value
   (e.g., an amount or ratio of amounts) for a biomarker whereby values found in a sample to
   be investigated which are higher than or essentially identical to the threshold are indicative
   for the presence of a medical condition while those being lower are indicative for the
30 absence of the medical condition. It will be understood that also preferably, a reference may
   be a threshold value for a biomarker whereby values found in a sample to be investigated
   which are lower or identical than the threshold are indicative for the presence of a medical
   condition while those being higher are indicative for the absence of the medical condition.
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                                                 15
   In accordance with the aforementioned method of the present invention, a reference is,
   preferably, a reference obtained from a sample from a subject or group of subjects known to
   suffer from pancreatic cancer. In such a case, a value for the at least one biomarker found in
   the test sample being essentially identical is indicative for the presence of the disease.
 5
   Moreover, the reference, also preferably, could be from a subject or group of subjects known
   not to suffer from pancreatic cancer, preferably, an apparently healthy subject. In such a
   case, a value for the at least one biomarker found in the test sample being altered with
   respect to the reference is indicative for the presence of the disease. The same applies
10 mutatis mutandis for a calculated reference being, most preferably, the average or median
   for the relative value or the value for a degree of change of the at least one biomarker in a
   population of individuals (comprising the subject to be investigated). The relative values or
   degrees of changes of the at least one biomarker of said individuals of the population can be
   determined as specified elsewhere herein. How to calculate a suitable reference value,
15 preferably, the average or median, is well known in the art. The population of subjects
   referred to before shall comprise a plurality of subjects, preferably, at least 5, 10, 50, 100,
   1,000 or 10,000 subjects. It is to be understood that the subject to be diagnosed by the
   method of the present invention and the subjects of the said plurality of subjects are of the
   same species.
20
   The value for the at least one biomarker of the test sample and the reference values are
   essentially identical, if the values for the characteristic features and, in the case of
   quantitative determination, the intensity values are essentially identical. Essentially identical
   means that the difference between two values is, preferably, not significant and shall be
25 characterized in that the values for the intensity are within at least the interval between                                                1St
   and     9 9 th percentile,           5 th  and    9 5th percentile,      1 0 th  and    90 th percentile,     20  th  and  8 0 th percentile,
   3 0 th  and    7 0 th    percentile,        4 0 th and   6 0 th  percentile of the reference value, preferably, the                      5 0th,
   6 0 th 7 0 th 8 0 th        90   th or 9 5 th percentile of the reference value. Statistical test for determining
   whether two amounts are essentially identical are well known in the art and are also
30 described elsewhere herein.
   An observed difference for two values, on the other hand, shall be statistically significant. A
   difference in the relative or absolute value is, preferably, significant outside of the interval
   between         4 5 th    and     5 5 th  percentile,     4 0 th and    60   th percentile,    3 0 th and    70  th  percentile,   20 th and
35 8 0 th  percentile, 10 th and               9 0 th  percentile,    5 th  and     9 5 th percentile,    1 st and     99 th percentile of the
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                      16
   reference value. Preferred relative changes of the medians or degrees of changes are
   described in the accompanying Tables as well as in the Examples. In the Tables below, a
   preferred relative change for the biomarkers is indicated as "up" for an increase and "down"
   for a decrease in column "direction of change". Values for preferred degrees of changes are
 5 indicated in the column "estimated fold change". The preferred references for the
   aforementioned relative changes or degrees of changes are indicated in the Tables below as
   well. It will be understood that these changes are, preferably, observed in comparison to the
   references indicated in the respective Tables, below.
10 Preferably, the reference, i.e. values for at least one characteristic feature of the at least one
   biomarker or ratios thereof, will be stored in a suitable data storage medium such as a
   database and are, thus, also available for future assessments.
   The term "comparing" refers to determining whether the determined value of a biomarker is
15 essentially identical to a reference or differs there from. Preferably, a value for a biomarker is
   deemed to differ from a reference if the observed difference is statistically significant which
   can be determined by statistical techniques referred to elsewhere in this description. If the
   difference is not statistically significant, the biomarker value and the reference are
   essentially identical. Based on the comparison referred to above, a subject can be assessed
20 to suffer from the disease, or not.
   For the specific biomarkers referred to in this specification, preferred values for the changes
   in the relative amounts or ratios (i.e. the changes expressed as the ratios of the medians)
   are found in the Tables, below. Based on the ratios of the metabolites found in a subject
25 suffering from pancreatic cancer and an apparently healthy control (blood donors) or a non
   cancer group (blood donors, chronic pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis), respectively, and the
   calculated t-values as shown in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, or 4b below, it can be derived
   whether an increase or a decrease of a given biomarker of Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, or 4b
   is indicative for the presence of pancreatic cancer. Negative t-values for a biomarker indicate
30 that a decrease is indicative while positive t-values indicate that an increase of the biomarker
   is indicative for pancreatic cancer. It will be understood that the reference in said cases is
   derived from a subject or group of subjects known not to suffer from pancreatic cancer or is
   a calculated reference as defined elsewhere herein.

                                                             17
   The comparison is, preferably, assisted by automation. For example, a suitable computer
   program comprising algorithms for the comparison of two different data sets (e.g., data sets
   comprising the values of the characteristic feature(s)) may be used. Such computer
   programs and algorithms are well known in the art. Notwithstanding the above, a
 5 comparison can also be carried out manually.
   Advantageously, it has been found in the study underlying the present invention that the
   amounts of the specific biomarkers referred to above are indicators for pancreatic cancer.
   Accordingly, the at least one biomarker as specified above in a sample can, in principle, be
10 used for assessing whether a subject suffers from pancreatic cancer, or not. This is
   particularly helpful for an efficient diagnosis of the disease as well as for improving of the
   pre-clinical and clinical management of pancreatic cancer as well as an efficient monitoring
   of patients. Moreover, the findings underlying the present invention will also facilitate the
   development of efficient drug-based therapies or other interventions against pancreatic
15 cancer as set forth in detail below.
   In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
   variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify
20 the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.
   The definitions and explanations of the terms made above apply mutatis mutandis for the
   following embodiments of the present invention except specified otherwise herein below.
25
   The present invention further contemplates a method for diagnosing pancreas cancer in a
   subject comprising the steps of:
                (a)           determining in a sample of a subject suspected to suffer from pancreas
30                            cancer the amount of at least one ceramide or the amount of total ceramides;
                              and
                (b)           comparing the said amount of the at least one biomarker with a reference,
                              whereby pancreas cancer is to be diagnosed.
35 Preferably, said at least one ceramide is not ceramide (d18:1, C24:1).

                                                             18
   The sample in the aforementioned method has been, preferably, pre-treated by lipid
   fractionation.
 5 Lipid fractionation as used in this context refers to a process as, preferably, described in the
   accompanying Examples below. In particular, lipid fractionation can be achieved by
   extracting the total lipids from plasma by liquid/liquid extraction using chloroform/methanol.
   The lipid extracts obtained thereby are subsequently fractionated by normal phase liquid
   chromatography (NPLC) into eleven different lipid groups according to Christie (Journal of
10 Lipid Research (26), 1985, 507-512). The fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using
   electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) with
   detection of specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions for cholesterol esters
   (CE), free sterols (FS), sphingoymelins (SM), and ceramides (CER) respectively.
   Sphingosines and sphingosine-1-phosphates (SP) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using
15 electrospray ionization (ESI) with detection of specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
   transitions as described by Schmidt H et.al., Prostaglandins & other Lipid Mediators
   81(2006), 162-170. The fractions are further analyzed by GC-MS after derivatization with
   TMSH (Trimethyl sulfonium hydroxide), yielding the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)
   corresponding to the acyl moieties of the class-separated lipids. The concentrations of
20 FAME from C14 to C24 are determined in each fraction.
   For the aforementioned method of the invention, either the amount of at least one ceramide
   is used as a biomarker or the total ceramide amount. Preferably, the amount of at least one
   sphinogemyelin or the amount of total sphingomyelins is determined.

   The present invention further contemplates a method for diagnosing pancreas cancer in a
   subject comprising the steps of:
                (a)           determining in a sample of a subject suspected to suffer from pancreas
                              cancer the amount of at least one biomarker of Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

10 The present invention also relates to a method for health care management comprising the
   steps of the methods of the present invention and the further step of recommending and/or
   applying a health care measure to the subject if pancreatic cancer is diagnosed.
   Health care management as used herein refers to governing the application of suitable
15 health care measures to a subject according to its individual needs. Health care
   management is decisive for estimating the need for hospitalization and/or ambulant patient
   management.
   The term "health care measure" as used herein, accordingly, refers to any measure which is
20 applied to a subject within the context of managing its disease. Health care measures,
   preferably, encompass recommendations, and the application thereof, on monitoring
   measures and/or monitoring frequencies. Moreover, health care measures include
   recommendations, and the application thereof, on hospitalization (i.e. the admission to a
   hospital) or ambulant care or support. Health care measures also include life style
25 recommendations aiming to improve the disease situation and the application thereof as well
   as therapeutic measures such as the recommendation and/or the application of therapies
   referred to elsewhere herein in detail.
30 The present invention also relates to a method for identifying whether a subject is in need for
   a therapy of pancreatic cancer or a change of therapy comprising the steps of the methods
   of the present invention and the further step of identifying a subject in need if pancreatic
   cancer is diagnosed.

                                                     21
   The phrase "in need for a therapy of pancreatic cancer" as used herein means that the
   disease in the subject is in a status where therapeutic intervention is necessary or beneficial
   in order to ameliorate or treat pancreatic cancer or the symptoms associated therewith.
   Accordingly, the findings of the studies underlying the present invention do not only allow
 5 diagnosing pancreatic cancer in a subject but also allow for identifying subjects which should
   be treated by a pancreatic cancer therapy or whose pancreatic cancer therapy needs
   adjustment. Once the subject has been identified, the method may further include a step of
   making recommendations for a therapy of pancreatic cancer.
10 A therapy of pancreatic cancer as used in accordance with the present invention, preferably,
   comprises surgery, radiotherapy or drug treatment. Preferred surgery-based therapies
   include resection of the pancreas or parts thereof such as pancreaticoduodenectomy, tail
   pancreatectomy. total or partial pancreatoctomy, palliative bridging procedures. Drug-based
   therapies, preferably, include the administration of one or more drugs with antitumour
15 properties including but not exclusive to platinum derivatives, fluoropyrimidines, pyrimidine
   analogues, Gemcitabine, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids,
   topoisomerase inhibitors, targeted antibodies and tryosine kinase inhibitors.
20 The present invention further relates to a method for determining whether a therapy against
   pancreatic cancer is successful in a subject comprising the steps of the methods of the
   present invention and the further step of determining whether a therapy is successful if no
   pancreatic cancer is diagnosed.
25 It is to be understood that a pancreatic cancer therapy will be successful if pancreatic cancer
   or at least some symptoms thereof are treated or ameliorated compared to an untreated
   subject. Moreover, a therapy is also successful as meant herein if the disease progression
   can be prevented or at least slowed down compared to an untreated subject.
30
   The present invention also relates to a device or system for diagnosing pancreas cancer in a
   sample of a subject comprising:
   (a)       an analyzing unit for the said sample of the subject comprising a detector for at least
             one biomarker of Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, or 4b or at least one biomarker of Tables
35           6,7,8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13,14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, 29,

             30, 31 or 32 said detector allowing for the determination of the amount of the said at
             least one biomarker in the sample; and operatively linked thereto,
   (b)       an evaluation unit comprising a data processing unit and a data base, said data base
             comprising a stored reference, preferably a reference as specified above in connection
 5           with the method of the invention and, more preferably, a reference derived from a
             subject or group of subjects known to suffer from pancreas cancer, and said data
             processing unit having tangibly embedded an algorithm for carrying out a comparison,
             preferably as specified above in connection with the method of the invention, of the
             amount of the at least one biomarker determined by the analyzing unit and the stored
10           reference and for generating an output information based on which the diagnosis can
             be established.
   A device as used herein shall comprise at least the aforementioned units. The units of the
   device are operatively linked to each other. How to link the means in an operating manner
15 will depend on the type of units included into the device. For example, where the detector
   allows for automatic qualitative or quantitative determination of the biomarker, the data
   obtained by said automatically operating analyzing unit can be processed by, e.g., a
   computer program in order to facilitate the assessment in the evaluation unit. Preferably, the
   units are comprised by a single device in such a case. Said device may accordingly include
20 an analyzing unit for the biomarker and a computer or data processing device as evaluation
   unit for processing the resulting data for the assessment and for stabling the output
   information. Preferred devices are those which can be applied without the particular
   knowledge of a specialized clinician, e.g., electronic devices which merely require loading
   with a sample. The output information of the device, preferably, is a numerical value which
25 allows drawing conclusions on the presence or absence of pancreatic cancer and, thus, is
   an aid for diagnosis. More preferably, the output information is a preliminary diagnosis or an
   aid for diagnosis based on the aforementioned numerical value, i.e. a classifier which
   indicates whether the subject suffers from pancreatic cancer or not. Such a preliminary
   diagnosis may need the evaluation of further information which can be provided in the
30 device of the invention by including an expert knowledge database system.
   A preferred reference to be used as a stored reference in accordance with the device of the
   present invention is an amount for the at least one biomarker to be analyzed or values
   derived therefrom which are derived from a subject or group of subjects known to suffer from
35 pancreatic cancer. In such a case, the algorithm tangibly embedded, preferably, compares

                                                  23
   the determined amount for the at least one biomarker with the reference wherein an identical
   or essentially identical amount or value shall be indicative for the presence of pancreatic
   cancer in the subject.
 5 Alternatively, another preferred reference to be used as a stored reference in accordance
   with the device of the present invention is an amount for the at least one biomarker to be
   analyzed or values derived therefrom which are derived from a subject or group of subjects
   known not to suffer from pancreatic cancer. In such a case, the algorithm tangibly
   embedded, preferably, compares the determined amount for the at least one biomarker with
10 the reference wherein an amount or value which differs from the reference shall be indicative
   for the presence of pancreatic cancer in the subject. Preferred differences are those
   indicated as relative changes or degrees of changes for the individual biomarkers in the
   Tables below.
15 The units of the device, also preferably, can be implemented into a system comprising
   several devices which are operatively linked to each other. Depending on the units to be
   used for the system of the present invention, said means may be functionally linked by
   connecting each mean with the other by means which allow data transport in between said
   means, e.g., glass fiber cables, and other cables for high throughput data transport.
20 Nevertheless, wireless data transfer between the means is also envisaged by the present
   invention, e.g., via LAN (Wireless LAN, W-LAN). A preferred system comprises means for
   determining biomarkers. Means for determining biomarkers as used herein encompass
   means for separating biomarkers, such as chromatographic devices, and means for
   metabolite determination, such as mass spectrometry devices. Suitable devices have been
25 described in detail above. Preferred means for compound separation to be used in the
   system of the present invention include chromatographic devices, more preferably devices
   for liquid chromatography, HPLC, and/or gas chromatography. Preferred devices for
   compound determination comprise mass spectrometry devices, more preferably, GC-MS,
   LC-MS, direct infusion mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS, CE-MS, HPLC-MS, quadrupole
30 mass spectrometry, sequentially coupled mass spectrometry (including MS-MS or MS-MS
   MS), ICP-MS, Py-MS or TOF. The separation and determination means are, preferably,
   coupled to each other. Most preferably, LC-MS and/or GC-MS are used in the system of the
   present invention as described in detail elsewhere in the specification. Further comprised
   shall be means for comparing and/or analyzing the results obtained from the means for
35 determination of biomarkers. The means for comparing and/or analyzing the results may

   comprise at least one databases and an implemented computer program for comparison of
   the results. Preferred embodiments of the aforementioned systems and devices are also
   described in detail below.
 5 Furthermore, the present invention relates to a data collection comprising characteristic
   values of at least one biomarker being indicative for a medical condition or effect as set forth
   above (i.e. diagnosing pancreatic cancer in a subject, identifying whether a subject is in
   need for a therapy of pancreatic cancer or determining whether a pancreatic cancer therapy
   is successful).
10
   The term "data collection" refers to a collection of data which may be physically and/or
   logically grouped together. Accordingly, the data collection may be implemented in a single
   data storage medium or in physically separated data storage media being operatively linked
   to each other. Preferably, the data collection is implemented by means of a database. Thus,
15 a database as used herein comprises the data collection on a suitable storage medium.
   Moreover, the database, preferably, further comprises a database management system. The
   database management system is, preferably, a network-based, hierarchical or object
   oriented database management system. Furthermore, the database may be a federal or
   integrated database. More preferably, the database will be implemented as a distributed
20 (federal) system, e.g. as a Client-Server-System. More preferably, the database is structured
   as to allow a search algorithm to compare a test data set with the data sets comprised by
   the data collection. Specifically, by using such an algorithm, the database can be searched
   for similar or identical data sets being indicative for a medical condition or effect as set forth
   above (e.g. a query search). Thus, if an identical or similar data set can be identified in the
25 data collection, the test data set will be associated with the said medical condition or effect.
   Consequently, the information obtained from the data collection can be used, e.g., as a
   reference for the methods of the present invention described above. More preferably, the
   data collection comprises characteristic values of all biomarkers comprised by any one of
   the groups recited above.
30
   In light of the foregoing, the present invention encompasses a data storage medium
   comprising the aforementioned data collection.
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                  25
   The term "data storage medium" as used herein encompasses data storage media which
   are based on single physical entities such as a CD, a CD-ROM, a hard disk, optical storage
   media, or a diskette. Moreover, the term further includes data storage media consisting of
   physically separated entities which are operatively linked to each other in a manner as to
 5 provide the aforementioned data collection, preferably, in a suitable way for a query search.
   The present invention also relates to a system comprising:
   (a) means for comparing characteristic values of the at least one biomarker of a sample
10        operatively linked to
   (b) a data storage medium as described above.
   The term "system" as used herein relates to different means which are operatively linked to
   each other. Said means may be implemented in a single device or may be physically
15 separated devices which are operatively linked to each other. The means for comparing
   characteristic values of biomarkers, preferably, based on an algorithm for comparison as
   mentioned before. The data storage medium, preferably, comprises the aforementioned data
   collection or database, wherein each of the stored data sets being indicative for a medical
   condition or effect referred to above. Thus, the system of the present invention allows
20 identifying whether a test data set is comprised by the data collection stored in the data
   storage medium. Consequently, the methods of the present invention can be implemented
   by the system of the present invention.
   In a preferred embodiment of the system, means for determining characteristic values of
25 biomarkers of a sample are comprised. The term "means for determining characteristic
   values of biomarkers" preferably relates to the aforementioned devices for the determination
   of metabolites such as mass spectrometry devices, NMR devices or devices for carrying out
   chemical or biological assays for the biomarkers.
30 Moreover, the present invention relates to a diagnostic means comprising means for the
   determination of at least one biomarker selected from any one of the groups referred to
   above.
   The term "diagnostic means", preferably, relates to a diagnostic device, system or biological
35 or chemical assay as specified elsewhere in the description in detail.
   10224210_1 (GHMatters) P97114.AU.1

                                                     26
   The expression "means for the determination of at least one biomarker" refers to devices or
   detection agents which are capable of specifically recognizing the biomarker. Suitable
   devices may be spectrometric devices such as mass spectrometry, NMR devices or devices
 5 for carrying out chemical or biological assays for the biomarkers. Suitable detection agents
   may be compounds which specifically detect the biomarkers. Detection as used herein may
   be a two-step process, i.e. the compound may first bind specifically to the biomarker to be
   detected and subsequently generate a detectable signal, e.g., fluorescent signals,
   chemiluminescent signals, radioactive signals and the like. For the generation of the
10 detectable signal further compounds may be required which are all comprised by the term
   "means for determination of the at least one biomarker". Compounds which specifically bind
   to the biomarker are described elsewhere in the specification in detail and include,
   preferably, enzymes, antibodies, aptameres, ligands, receptors or other biological molecules
   or chemicals which specifically bind to the biomarkers.
15
   Further, the present invention relates to a diagnostic composition comprising at least one
   biomarker selected from any one of the groups referred to above.
   The at least one biomarker selected from any of the aforementioned groups will serve as a
20 biomarker, i.e. an indicator molecule for a medical condition or effect in the subject as set for
   the elsewhere herein. Thus, the biomarker molecules itself may serve as diagnostic
   compositions, preferably, upon visualization or detection by the means referred to in herein.
   Thus, a diagnostic composition which indicates the presence of a biomarker according to the
   present invention may also comprise the said biomarker physically, e.g., a complex of an
25 antibody and the biomarker to be detected may serve as the diagnostic composition.
   Accordingly, the diagnostic composition may further comprise means for detection of the
   metabolites as specified elsewhere in this description. Alternatively, if detection means such
   as MS or NMR based techniques are used, the molecular species which serves as an
   indicator for the risk condition will be the at least one biomarker comprised by the test
30 sample to be investigated. Thus, the at least one biomarker referred to in accordance with
   the present invention shall serve itself as a diagnostic composition due to its identification as
   a biomarker.
   In general, the present invention contemplates the use of at least one biomarker of Tables
35 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, or 4b or a detection agent therefor or at least one biomarker of Tables 6,

   be manufactured based on the at least one biomarker or the detection agent therefor is well
   known to those skilled in the art. For example, antibodies or aptameres which specifically
   bind to the at least one biomarker can be produced. Similarly, the biomarkers itself may be
   used as such compositions, e.g., within complexes or in modified or derivatizsed form, e.g.,
30 when analysed by GCMS.

   The invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples which are not intended to
   restrict or limit the scope of this invention.
   Example 1: Sample preparation and MS Analysis
10
   The study comprised 80 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients, 80 patients with alcohol
   induced liver cirrhosis and 80 patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis as well as 80
   healthy volunteers (blood donors). Patients and healthy volunteers were matched for age,
   gender and BMI. For all patients and healthy volunteers a blood sample was collected.
15 Plasma was prepared by centrifugation, and samples were stored at -80        0C until
   measurements were performed.
   The analysis of the plasma samples revealed biomarker candidates which where classified
   in two categories. The analysis of the plasma samples was carried out as follows:
20
   Human plasma samples were prepared and subjected to LC-MS/MS and GC-MS or SPE
   LC-MS/MS (hormones) analysis as described in the following:
   Proteins were separated by precipitation from blood plasma. After addition of water and a
25 mixture of ethanol and dichlormethan the remaining sample was fractioned into an aqueous,
   polar phase (polar fraction) and an organic, lipophilic phase (lipid fraction).
   For the transmethanolysis of the lipid extracts a mixture of 140 pl of chloroform, 37 pl of
   hydrochloric acid (37% by weight HCI in water), 320 pl of methanol and 20 pl of toluene was
30 added to the evaporated extract. The vessel was sealed tightly and heated for 2 hours at
   100 C, with shaking. The solution was subsequently evaporated to dryness. The residue
   was dried completely.
   The methoximation of the carbonyl groups was carried out by reaction with methoxyamine
35 hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine, 100 I for 1.5 hours at 600C) in a tightly sealed vessel. 20

   pl of a solution of odd-numbered, straight-chain fatty acids (solution of each 0.3 mg/mL of
   fatty acids from 7 to 25 carbon atoms and each 0.6 mg/mL of fatty acids with 27, 29 and 31
   carbon atoms in 3/7 (v/v) pyridine/toluene) were added as time standards. Finally, the
   derivatization with 100 pl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA)
 5 was carried out for 30 minutes at 600C, again in the tightly sealed vessel. The final volume
   before injection into the GC was 220 pl.
   For the polar phase the derivatization was performed in the following way: The
   methoximation of the carbonyl groups was carried out by reaction with methoxyamine

   pl of a solution of odd-numbered, straight-chain fatty acids (solution of each 0.3 mg/mL of
   fatty acids from 7 to 25 carbon atoms and each 0.6 mg/mL of fatty acids with 27, 29 and 31
   carbon atoms in 3/7 (v/v) pyridine/toluene) were added as time standards. Finally, the
   derivatization with 50 pl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was
15 carried out for 30 minutes at 600C, again in the tightly sealed vessel. The final volume before
   injection into the GC was 110 pl.
   The GC-MS systems consist of an Agilent 6890 GC coupled to an Agilent 5973 MSD. The
   autosamplers are CompiPal or GCPal from CTC.

   For the analysis usual commercial capillary separation columns (30 m x 0,25 mm x 0,25 pm)
   with different poly-methyl-siloxane stationary phases containing 0 % up to 35% of aromatic
   moieties, depending on the analysed sample materials and fractions from the phase
   separation step, were used (for example: DB-1 ms, HP-5ms, DB-XLB, DB-35ms, Agilent
25 Technologies). Up to 1 pL of the final volume was injected splitless and the oven
   temperature program was started at 70     0C and ended at 340     0C  with different heating rates
   depending on the sample material and fraction from the phase separation step in order to
   achieve a sufficient chromatographic separation and number of scans within each analyte
   peak. Furthermore RTL (Retention Time Locking, Agilent Technologies) was used for the
30 analysis and usual GC-MS standard conditions, for example constant flow with nominal 1 to
   1.7 ml/min. and helium as the mobile phase gas, ionisation was done by electron impact with
   70 eV, scanning within a m/z range from 15 to 600 with scan rates from 2.5 to 3 scans/sec
   and standard tune conditions.

   The HPLC-MS systems consisted of an Agilent 1100 LC system (Agilent Technologies,
   Waldbronn, Germany) coupled with an API 4000 Mass spectrometer (Applied
   Biosystem/MDS SCIEX, Toronto, Canada). HPLC analysis was performed on commercially
   available reversed phase separation columns with C18 stationary phases (for example:
 5 GROM ODS 7 pH, Thermo Betasil C18). Up to 10 pL of the final sample volume of
   evaporated and reconstituted polar and lipophilic phase was injected and separation was
   performed with gradient elution using methanol/water/formic acid or acetonitrile/water/formic
   acid gradients at a flowrate of 200 pL/min.
10 Mass spectrometry was carried out by electrospray ionisation in positive mode for the non
   polar fraction and negative or positive mode for the polar fraction using multiple-reaction
   monitoring-(MRM)-mode and fullscan from 100 - 1000 amu.
   Steroids and their metabolites were measured by online SPE-LC-MS (Solid phase
15 extraction-LC-MS For steroids and related metabolites, quantification was achieved by
   means of stable-isotope-labelled standards, and absolute concentrations were calculated.
   Analysis of complex lipids in plasma samples:
20
   Total lipids were extracted from plasma by liquid/liquid extraction using chloroform/methanol.
   The lipid extracts were subsequently fractionated by normal phase liquid chromatography
   (NPLC) into eleven different lipid groups according to Christie (Journal of Lipid Research
   (26), 1985, 507-512).
25
   The fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using electrospray ionization (ESI) and
   atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) with detection of specific multiple reaction
   monitoring (MRM) transitions for cholesterol esters (CE), free sterols (FS), sphingoymelins
   (SM), and ceramides (CER) respectively. Sphingosines and sphingosine-1 -phosphates
30 (SP) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using electrospray ionization (ESI) with detection of
   specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions as described by Schmidt H et.al.,
   Prostaglandins & other Lipid Mediators 81(2006), 162-170. Metabolites in the Tables below
   are derived from one of these fractions include the respective abbreviation in their name.

   The lipid classes Monoacylglycerides (MAG), Triacylglycerides (TAG), Phosphatidylcholines
   (PC), Phosphatidylserines (PS), Phosphatidylinositoles (PI), Lysophosphatidylcholines
   (LPC), Diacylglycerols (DAG), Free fatty acids (FFA) were measured by GC-MS.
 5 The fractions are analyzed by GC-MS after derivatization with TMSH (Trimethyl sulfonium
   hydroxide), yielding the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) corresponding to the acyl moieties
   of the class-separated lipids. The concentrations of FAME from C14 to C24 are determined
   in each fraction.

   respective abbreviation in front of their name separated by an underscore.
   Example 2: Data analysis and statistical evaluation
   Plasma samples were analyzed in randomized analytical sequence design with pooled
15 samples (so called "Pool") generated from aliquots of each sample. The raw peak data were
   normalized to the median of pool per analytical sequence to account for process variability
   (so called "ratios"). Ratios were log10 transformed to approach a normal distribution of data.
   Statistical analysis was done by a simple linear model (ANOVA) with the following fixed
   effects: Disease, body mass index (BMI), age, gender and storage time (storage):
20
             Disease + BMI + age + gender + storage
   The ANOVA factors "age", "BMI" and "storage" were set as numerical factors, the factor
   "gender" was set to the reference "male" and the factor "disease" was set to either healthy
25 volunteers (Blood donors) as reference or, in a separate ANOVA model, to the to non
   cancer group (blood donors, chronic pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis) as reference.
   From the results of the ANOVA model, three different approaches for identification of
   biomarkers for pancreatic cancer were applied. These different approaches resulted in
30 different biomarker categories that are explained in Table 1 and the identified biomarkers are
   listed in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b,4a and 4b below.

Example 3: Analysis of serum metabolites
Serum samples were obtained from the patients described in the aforementioned Examples
1. The samples were pre-treated, analyzed by MS as described in Example 1 and
statistically evaluated essentially as described Examples 1 and 2, above.
The estimated fold changes, t- and p-values found for the metabolite biomarkers in the
serum samples were essentially as described in any one of Tables 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a or 4b
and the estimated fold change, direction of change (i.e. up or down regulation) and the
significance values could be, therefore, essentially confirmed for another sample type.
Example 4: Analysis and evaluation of further plasma samples
Additionally plasma samples from a second centre were collected from 80 pancreatic
adenocarcinoma patients and 80 patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis. Patients were
matched for age, gender and BMI. Plasma was prepared and analysed by MS as described
in example 1 and statistically evaluated as described in Table 5. Abbreviations of lipid
classes are as described in Table 2b.

             or group of subjects known not to suffer from pancreatic cancer or is a calculated
             reference.
3.           The method of claim 1, wherein said reference is derived from a sample of a subject
             or group of subjects known to suffer from pancreatic cancer.
4.           The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said at least one biomarker is a
             biomarker of category 1 or category 2.
5.           The method of claim 4, wherein said subject exhibits pancreatitis as an underlying
             pancreatic disease.
6.           The method of claim 1, wherein said reference is derived from a subject or group of
             subjects suffering from pancreatitis and wherein the said at least one biomarker is
             from table 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 27, 28 or 29.
7.           The method of claim 1, wherein said reference is derived from a subject or group of
             subjects suffering from liver cirrhosis and wherein the said at least one biomarker is
             from table 18, 19, 20, 30, 31 or 32.
8.           The method of claim 1, wherein said reference is derived from a subject or group of
             subjects suffering from pancreatitis and/or liver cirrhosis and wherein the said at least
             one biomarker is from table 12, 13, 14, 24, 25 or 26.

9.           A method for identifying whether a subject is in need of a pancreas cancer therapy
             comprising the steps of the method of any one of claims 1 to 8 and the further step of
             identifying a subject in need of a pancreas cancer therapy if said subject is to be
             diagnosed to suffer from pancreas cancer.
10.          A method for determining whether a therapy against pancreatic cancer is successful
             in a subject comprising the steps of the method of any one of claims 1 to 8 and the
             further step of determining whether a therapy is successful if no pancreatic cancer is
             diagnosed.
