   COMPUTATIONALLY OPTIMIZED BROADLY REACTIVE ANTIGENS FOR HIN1
                                             INFLUENZA
         The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian patent application
number 2013352179 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present specification.
                                                FIELD
         This disclosure concerns optimized influenza hemagglutinin proteins that elicit broadly
reactive immune responses to HINI virus isolates and their use as vaccines.
                                            BACKGROUND
         Influenza virus is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family. There are three subtypes of
influenza viruses, designated influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. The influenza virion
contains a segmented negative-sense RNA genome, which encodes the following proteins:
hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M1), proton ion-channel protein (M2),
nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB 1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2),
polymerase acidic protein (PA), and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2). The HA, NA, M1, and M2 are
membrane associated, whereas NP, PB1, PB2, PA, and NS2 are nucleocapsid associated proteins.
The M1 protein is the most abundant protein in influenza particles. The HA and NA proteins are
envelope glycoproteins, responsible for virus attachment and penetration of the viral particles into
the cell, and the sources of the major immunodominant epitopes for virus neutralization and
protective immunity. Both HA and NA proteins are considered the most important components for
prophylactic influenza vaccines.
         Each year, seasonal influenza causes over 300,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths in the
U.S. alone (Simonsen et al., Lancet Infect Dis 7:658-66, 2007). The emergence of the novel HINI
influenza virus in 2009 demonstrated how quickly a new influenza pandemic can sweep across the
world.
         There are currently two influenza vaccine approaches licensed in the United States - the
inactivated, split vaccine and the live-attenuated virus vaccine. The inactivated vaccines can
                                                  -1 -

efficiently induce humoral immune responses but generally only poor cellular immune responses.
Live virus vaccines cannot be administered to immunocompromised or pregnant patients due to
their increased risk of infection. Thus, a need exists for a broadly protective influenza virus
vaccine.
                                             SUMMARY
         Disclosed herein is the generation of optimized HINI influenza HA polypeptides for
eliciting a broadly reactive immune response to HINI influenza virus isolates. The optimized HA
polypeptides were developed through a series of HA protein alignments, and subsequent generation
of consensus sequences, based on selected HINI viruses isolated from 1918-2012.

no more than 8, no more than 9 or no more than 10 amino acid substitutions relative to SEQ ID
NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID
NO: 7. In some embodiments, the HA polypeptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 8. In some
embodiments, the influenza HA polypeptide lacks the N-terminal methionine residue.
         Isolated nucleic acid molecules and vectors encoding the recombinant HA polypeptides are
also provided by the present disclosure. Further provided are isolated cells comprising such
vectors.

        Unless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage.
Definitions of common terms in molecular biology may be found in Benjamin Lewin, Genes V,
published by Oxford University Press, 1994 (ISBN 0-19-854287-9); Kendrew et al. (eds.), The
Encyclopedia ofMolecular Biology, published by Blackwell Science Ltd., 1994 (ISBN 0-632

Desk Reference, published by VCH Publishers, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 1-56081-569-8).
        In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of the disclosure, the following
explanations of specific terms are provided:
        Adjuvant: A substance or vehicle that non-specifically enhances the immune response to
an antigen. Adjuvants can include a suspension of minerals (alum, aluminum hydroxide, or
phosphate) on which antigen is adsorbed; or water-in-oil emulsion in which antigen solution is
emulsified in mineral oil (for example, Freund's incomplete adjuvant), sometimes with the
inclusion of killed mycobacteria (Freund's complete adjuvant) to further enhance antigenicity.
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (such as those including a CpG motif) can also be used as
adjuvants (for example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,194,388; 6,207,646; 6,214,806; 6,218,371;
6,239,116; 6,339,068; 6,406,705; and 6,429,199). Adjuvants also include biological molecules,
such as costimulatory molecules. Exemplary biological adjuvants include IL-2, RANTES, GM
CSF, TNF-a, IFN-7, G-CSF, LFA-3, CD72, B7-1, B7-2, OX-40L and 41 BBL.
        Administer: As used herein, administering a composition to a subject means to give, apply
or bring the composition into contact with the subject. Administration can be accomplished by any
of a number of routes, such as, for example, topical, oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,
intraperitoneal, intravenous, intrathecal and intradermal.
        Antibody: An immunoglobulin molecule produced by B lymphoid cells with a specific
amino acid sequence. Antibodies are evoked in humans or other animals by a specific antigen
(immunogen). Antibodies are characterized by reacting specifically with the antigen in some
demonstrable way, antibody and antigen each being defined in terms of the other. "Eliciting an
antibody response" refers to the ability of an antigen or other molecule to induce the production of
antibodies.
        Antigen: A compound, composition, or substance that can stimulate the production of
antibodies or a T-cell response in an animal, including compositions that are injected or absorbed
into an animal. An antigen reacts with the products of specific humoral or cellular immunity,
including those induced by heterologous immunogens. In some embodiments of the disclosed
compositions and methods, the antigen is an influenza HA protein.
                                                   -5 -

        Codon-optimized: A "codon-optimized" nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid sequence that
has been altered such that the codons are optimal for expression in a particular system (such as a
particular species of group of species). For example, a nucleic acid sequence can be optimized for
expression in mammalian cells. Codon optimization does not alter the amino acid sequence of the
encoded protein.
        Fusion protein: A protein generated by expression of a nucleic acid sequence engineered
from nucleic acid sequences encoding at least a portion of two different (heterologous) proteins.
To create a fusion protein, the nucleic acid sequences must be in the same reading frame and
contain to internal stop codons. For example, a fusion protein includes an influenza HA fused to a
heterologous protein.
        Hemagglutinin (HA): An influenza virus surface glycoprotein. HA mediates binding of
the virus particle to a host cells and subsequent entry of the virus into the host cell. The nucleotide
and amino acid sequences of numerous influenza HA proteins are known in the art and are
publically available, such as those deposited with GenBank. HA (along with NA) is one of the two
major influenza virus antigenic determinants.
        Immune response: A response of a cell of the immune system, such as a B-cell, T-cell,
macrophage or polymorphonucleocyte, to a stimulus such as an antigen or vaccine. An immune
response can include any cell of the body involved in a host defense response, including for
example, an epithelial cell that secretes an interferon or a cytokine. An immune response includes,
but is not limited to, an innate immune response or inflammation. As used herein, a protective
immune response refers to an immune response that protects a subject from infection (prevents
infection or prevents the development of disease associated with infection). Methods of measuring
immune responses are well known in the art and include, for example, measuring proliferation
and/or activity of lymphocytes (such as B or T cells), secretion of cytokines or chemokines,
inflammation, antibody production and the like.
        Immunogen: A compound, composition, or substance which is capable, under appropriate
conditions, of stimulating an immune response, such as the production of antibodies or a T-cell
response in an animal, including compositions that are injected or absorbed into an animal. As
used herein, an "immunogenic composition" is a composition comprising an immunogen (such as
an HA polypeptide).
                                                   -6-

        Immunize: To render a subject protected from an infectious disease, such as by
vaccination.
        Influenza virus: A segmented negative-strand RNA virus that belongs to the
Orthomyxoviridae family. There are three types of Influenza viruses, A, B and C. Influenza A
viruses infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans, horses, marine mammals,
pigs, ferrets, and chickens. In animals, most influenza A viruses cause mild localized infections of
the respiratory and intestinal tract. However, highly pathogenic influenza A strains, such as H5N1,
cause systemic infections in poultry in which mortality may reach 100%. In 2009, HINI influenza
was the most common cause of human influenza. A new strain of swine-origin HINI emerged in
2009 and was declared pandemic by the World Health Organization. This strain was referred to as
"swine flu." HINI influenza A viruses were also responsible for the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918,
the Fort Dix outbreak in 1976, and the Russian flu epidemic in 1977-1978.
        Isolated: An "isolated" biological component (such as a nucleic acid, protein or virus) has been
substantially separated or purified away from other biological components (such as cell debris, or other
proteins or nucleic acids). Biological components that have been "isolated" include those components
purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces recombinant nucleic acids, proteins
or viruses (or VLPs), as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acids or peptides.
        Linker: One or more amino acids that serve as a spacer between two polypeptides of a fusion
protein.
        Matrix (Ml) protein: An influenza virus structural protein found within the viral envelope.
M1 is thought to function in assembly and budding.
        Neuraminidase (NA): An influenza virus membrane glycoprotein. NA is involved in the
destruction of the cellular receptor for the viral HA by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues from
carbohydrate moieties on the surfaces of infected cells. NA also cleaves sialic acid residues from
viral proteins, preventing aggregation of viruses. NA (along with HA) is one of the two major
influenza virus antigenic determinants.
        Operably linked: A first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic acid
sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second
nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter
affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Generally, operably linked DNA
                                                   -7-

sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein-coding regions, in the same reading
frame.
        Optimized influenza HA protein: As used herein, "optimized influenza HA protein" refers to
the HA protein consensus sequence generated by sequence alignments of selected HINI influenza
viruses isolated between 1918-2012 (as described in Example 1 below). The nucleotide sequences
encoding optimized HA proteins were (or can be) further optimized for expression in mammalian cells
via codon-optimization and RNA optimization (such as to increase RNA stability). Optimized influenza
HA proteins disclosed herein (and set forth herein as SEQ ID NOs: 1-7) are also referred to as
"COBRA" sequences. Optimized HA polypeptides are designed to elicit broadly reactive immune
responses in a subject. In the context of the present disclosure, "broadly reactive" means the protein
sequence elicits an immune response in a subject that is sufficient to inhibit, neutralize or prevent
infection of a broad range of influenza viruses (such as most or all influenza viruses within a specific
subtype). In some instances, the optimized influenza HA protein is capable of eliciting an immune
response, such as a protective immune response, against most or all HINI influenza virus isolates.
        Outbreak: As used herein, an influenza virus "outbreak" refers to a collection of virus isolates
from within a single country in a given year.
        Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
(vehicles) useful in this disclosure are conventional. Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences, by E.
W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and
formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of one or more therapeutic compositions, such as
one or more influenza vaccines, and additional pharmaceutical agents.
        In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration
being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that
include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline,
balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions
(for example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can
include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In
addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can
contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents,
                                                    -8-

preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan
monolaurate.
        Polypeptide: A polymer in which the monomers are amino acid residues which are joined
together through amide bonds. When the amino acids are alpha-amino acids, either the L-optical
isomer or the D-optical isomer can be used. The terms "polypeptide" or "protein" as used herein
are intended to encompass any amino acid sequence and include modified sequences such as
glycoproteins. The term "polypeptide" is specifically intended to cover naturally occurring
proteins, as well as those which are recombinantly or synthetically produced. The term "residue" or
"amino acid residue" includes reference to an amino acid that is incorporated into a protein,
polypeptide, or peptide.
        Conservative amino acid substitutions are those substitutions that, when made, least
interfere with the properties of the original protein, that is, the structure and especially the function
of the protein is conserved and not significantly changed by such substitutions. Examples of
conservative substitutions are shown below.

         Conservative substitutions generally maintain (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone
in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or
hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.
         The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in protein
properties will be non-conservative, for instance changes in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, for
example, seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, for example, leucyl,
isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other
residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain, for example, lysyl, arginyl, or histadyl, is
substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, for example, glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a residue
having a bulky side chain, for example, phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having a
side chain, for example, glycine.
         Preventing, treating or ameliorating a disease: "Preventing" a disease refers to
inhibiting the full development of a disease. "Treating" refers to a therapeutic intervention that
ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition after it has begun to develop.
"Ameliorating" refers to the reduction in the number or severity of signs or symptoms of a disease.
         Promoter: A promoter is an array of nucleic acid control sequences which direct
transcription of a nucleic acid. A promoter includes necessary nucleic acid sequences near the start
site of transcription. A promoter also optionally includes distal enhancer or repressor elements. A
"constitutive promoter" is a promoter that is continuously active and is not subject to regulation by
external signals or molecules. In contrast, the activity of an "inducible promoter" is regulated by an
external signal or molecule (for example, a transcription factor). In some embodiments herein, the
promoter is a CMV promoter.
         Purified: The term "purified" does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a
relative term. Thus, for example, a purified peptide, protein, virus, VLP or other active compound
is one that is isolated in whole or in part from naturally associated proteins and other contaminants.
In certain embodiments, the term "substantially purified" refers to a peptide, protein, virus, VLP or
other active compound that has been isolated from a cell, cell culture medium, or other crude
preparation and subjected to fractionation to remove various components of the initial preparation,
such as proteins, cellular debris, and other components.
                                                  - 10 -

        Recombinant: A recombinant nucleic acid, protein, virus or VLP is one that has a sequence that
is not naturally occurring or has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise
separated segments of sequence. This artificial combination is often accomplished by chemical
synthesis or, more commonly, by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, for
example, by genetic engineering techniques.
        Sequence identity: The similarity between amino acid or nucleic acid sequences is expressed in
terms of the similarity between the sequences, otherwise referred to as sequence identity. Sequence
identity is frequently measured in terms of percentage identity (or similarity or homology); the higher
the percentage, the more similar the two sequences are. Homologs or variants of a given gene or protein
will possess a relatively high degree of sequence identity when aligned using standard methods.
        Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Various programs
and alignment algorithms are described in: Smith and Waterman, Adv. Apple. Math. 2:482, 1981;

        Subject: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes both human and
non-human mammals, such as non-human primates.
        Therapeutically effective amount: A quantity of a specified agent sufficient to achieve a
desired effect in a subject being treated with that agent. For example, this may be the amount of an
influenza virus vaccine useful for eliciting an immune response in a subject and/or for preventing
infection or disease caused by influenza virus. Ideally, in the context of the present disclosure, a
therapeutically effective amount of an influenza vaccine is an amount sufficient to increase
resistance to, prevent, ameliorate, and/or treat infection caused by influenza virus in a subject
without causing a substantial cytotoxic effect in the subject. The effective amount of an influenza
vaccine useful for increasing resistance to, preventing, ameliorating, and/or treating infection in a
                                                  - 11 -

subject will be dependent on, for example, the subject being treated, the manner of administration
of the therapeutic composition and other factors.
        Transformed: A transformed cell is a cell into which has been introduced a nucleic acid
molecule by molecular biology techniques. As used herein, the term transformation encompasses
all techniques by which a nucleic acid molecule might be introduced into such a cell, including
transfection with viral vectors, transformation with plasmid vectors, and introduction of naked
DNA by electroporation, lipofection, and particle gun acceleration.
        Vaccine: A preparation of immunogenic material capable of stimulating an immune
response, administered for the prevention, amelioration, or treatment of disease, such as an
infectious disease. The immunogenic material may include, for example, attenuated or killed
microorganisms (such as attenuated viruses), or antigenic proteins, peptides or DNA derived from
them. Vaccines may elicit both prophylactic (preventative) and therapeutic responses. Methods of
administration vary according to the vaccine, but may include inoculation, ingestion, inhalation or
other forms of administration. Inoculations can be delivered by any of a number of routes,
including parenteral, such as intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular. Vaccines may be
administered with an adjuvant to boost the immune response.
        Vector: A vector is a nucleic acid molecule allowing insertion of foreign nucleic acid
without disrupting the ability of the vector to replicate and/or integrate in a host cell. A vector can
include nucleic acid sequences that permit it to replicate in a host cell, such as an origin of
replication. An insertional vector is capable of inserting itself into a host nucleic acid. A vector
can also include one or more selectable marker genes and other genetic elements. An expression
vector is a vector that contains the necessary regulatory sequences to allow transcription and
translation of an inserted gene or genes. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the vector
encodes an influenza HA, NA or M1 protein. In some embodiments, the vector is the pTR600
expression vector (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0106798; Ross et al., Nat
Immunol. 1(2):102-103, 2000; Green et al., Vaccine 20:242-248, 2001).
        Virus-like particle (VLP): Virus particles made up of one of more viral structural
proteins, but lacking the viral genome. Because VLPs lack a viral genome, they are non-infectious.
In addition, VLPs can often be produced by heterologous expression and can be easily purified.
Most VLPs comprise at least a viral core protein that drives budding and release of particles from a
                                                  - 12 -

host cell. One example of such a core protein is influenza M1. In some embodiments herein, an
influenza VLP comprises the HA, NA and/or M1 proteins. Influenza VLPs can be produced by
transfection of host cells with plasmids encoding the HA and NA proteins, and optionally the M1
protein. After incubation of the transfected cells for an appropriate time to allow for protein
expression (such as for approximately 72 hours), VLPs can be isolated from cell culture
supernatants. Example 2 provides an exemplary protocol for purifying influenza VLPs from cell
supernatants. In this example, VLPs are isolated by low speed centrifugation (to remove cell
debris), vacuum filtration and ultracentrifugation through 20% glycerol. Other methods of
producing influenza VLPs are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent Application
Publication Nos. 2006/0263804; 2008/0031895; 2010/0166769; and 2010/0239610).
         Unless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure
belongs. The singular terms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless context clearly
indicates otherwise. Similarly, the word "or" is intended to include "and" unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise. Hence "comprising A or B" means including A, or B, or A and B. It is further
to be understood that all base sizes or amino acid sizes, and all molecular weight or molecular mass
values, given for nucleic acids or polypeptides are approximate, and are provided for description.
Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the
practice or testing of the present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below.

        In some embodiments disclosed herein, the HA polypeptides lack the N-terminal
methionine residue. Thus, in some examples, provided are HA polypeptides comprising residues 2
566 of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-5 and 8, or comprising residues 2-565 of SEQ ID NO: 6.
        The COBRA amino acid sequences can be reverse translated and optimized for expression
in mammalian cells, including codon usage and RNA optimization (GeneArt; Regensburg,
Germany). The optimized nucleic acid sequences can be inserted into an appropriate expression
vector, such as the pTR600 expression vector (U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2002/0106798; Ross et al., Nat Immunol. 1(2):102-103, 2000; Green et al., Vaccine 20:242-248,
2001).
V.      Influenza
        Influenza viruses are segmented negative-strand RNA viruses that belong to the
Orthomyxoviridae family. There are three types of Influenza viruses, A, B and C. Influenza A
viruses infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans, horses, marine mammals,
pigs, ferrets, and chickens. In animals, most influenza A viruses cause mild localized infections of
the respiratory and intestinal tract. However, highly pathogenic influenza A strains, such as H5N1,
cause systemic infections in poultry in which mortality may reach 100%. Animals infected with
influenza A often act as a reservoir for the influenza viruses and certain subtypes have been shown
to cross the species barrier to humans.
        Influenza A viruses can be classified into subtypes based on allelic variations in antigenic
regions of two genes that encode surface glycoproteins, namely, hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA) which are required for viral attachment and cellular release. Currently, sixteen
subtypes of HA (HI-H16) and nine NA (Ni -N9) antigenic variants are known for influenza A
virus. Previously, only three subtypes were known to circulate in humans (HiNi, HiN2, and
H3N2). However, in recent years, the pathogenic H5NI subtype of avian influenza A has been
                                                  - 20 -

reported to cross the species barrier and infect humans as documented in Hong Kong in 1997 and
2003, leading to the death of several patients.
        In animals, most influenza A viruses cause mild localized infections of the respiratory and
intestinal tract. However, highly pathogenic influenza A strains, such as H5N 1, cause systemic
infections in poultry in which mortality may reach 100%. In 2009, HINI influenza was the most
common cause of human influenza. A new strain of swine-origin HINI emerged in 2009 and was
declared pandemic by the World Health Organization. This strain was referred to as "swine flu."
HINI influenza A viruses were also responsible for the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, the Fort Dix
outbreak in 1976, and the Russian flu epidemic in 1977-1978.
        The influenza A virus genome encodes nine structural proteins and one nonstructural (NS 1)
protein with regulatory functions. The influenza virus segmented genome contains eight negative
sense RNA (nsRNA) gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS, HA and NA) that encode at least
ten polypeptides, including RNA-directed RNA polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA),
nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), hemagglutinin (subunits HA1 and HA2), the matrix
proteins (M1 and M2) and the non-structural proteins (NS 1 and NS2) (Krug et al., In "The
Influenza Viruses," R. M. Krug, ed., Plenum Press, N.Y., 1989, pp. 89 152).
        Influenza virus' ability to cause widespread disease is due to its ability to evade the immune
system by undergoing antigenic change, which is believed to occur when a host is infected
simultaneously with both an animal influenza virus and a human influenza virus. During mutation
and reassortment in the host, the virus may incorporate an HA and/or NA surface protein gene from
another virus into its genome, thereby producing a new influenza subtype and evading the immune
system.
        HA is a viral surface glycoprotein generally comprising approximately 560 amino acids and
representing 25% of the total virus protein. It is responsible for adhesion of the viral particle to,
and its penetration into, a host cell in the early stages of infection. Cleavage of the virus HAO
precursor into the HAl and HA2 sub-fragments is a necessary step in order for the virus to infect a
cell. Thus, cleavage is required in order to convert new virus particles in a host cell into virions
capable of infecting new cells. Cleavage is known to occur during transport of the integral HAO
membrane protein from the endoplasmic reticulum of the infected cell to the plasma membrane. In
the course of transport, hemagglutinin undergoes a series of co- and post-translational
                                                   - 21 -

modifications including proteolytic cleavage of the precursor HA into the amino-terminal fragment
HA1 and the carboxy terminal HA2. One of the primary difficulties in growing influenza strains in
primary tissue culture or established cell lines arises from the requirement for proteolytic cleavage
activation of the influenza hemagglutinin in the host cell.
        Although it is known that an uncleaved HA can mediate attachment of the virus to its
neuraminic acid-containing receptors on a cell surface, it is not capable of the next step in the
infectious cycle, which is fusion. It has been reported that exposure of the hydrophobic amino
terminus of HA2 by cleavage is required so that it can be inserted into the target cell, thereby
forming a bridge between virus and target cell membrane. This process is followed by fusion of the
two membranes and entry of the virus into the target cell.
        Proteolytic activation of HA involves cleavage at an arginine residue by a trypsin-like
endoprotease, which is often an intracellular enzyme that is calcium dependent and has a neutral pH
optimum. Since the activating proteases are cellular enzymes, the infected cell type determines
whether the HA is cleaved. The HA of the mammalian influenza viruses and the nonpathogenic
avian influenza viruses are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage only in a restricted number of cell
types. On the other hand, HA of pathogenic avian viruses among the H5 and H7 subtypes are
cleaved by proteases present in a broad range of different host cells. Thus, there are differences in
host range resulting from differences in hemagglutinin cleavability which are correlated with the
pathogenic properties of the virus.
        Neuraminidase (NA) is a second membrane glycoprotein of the influenza viruses. The
presence of viral NA has been shown to be important for generating a multi-faceted protective
immune response against an infecting virus. For most influenza A viruses, NA is 413 amino acid
in length, and is encoded by a gene of 1413 nucleotides. Nine different NA subtypes have been
identified in influenza viruses (NI, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8 and N9), all of which have been
found among wild birds. NA is involved in the destruction of the cellular receptor for the viral HA
by cleaving terminal neuraminic acid (also called sialic acid) residues from carbohydrate moieties
on the surfaces of infected cells. NA also cleaves sialic acid residues from viral proteins,
preventing aggregation of viruses. Using this mechanism, it is hypothesized that NA facilitates
release of viral progeny by preventing newly formed viral particles from accumulating along the
cell membrane, as well as by promoting transportation of the virus through the mucus present on
                                                  - 22 -

the mucosal surface. NA is an important antigenic determinant that is subject to antigenic
variation.
         In addition to the surface proteins HA and NA, influenza virus comprises six additional
internal genes, which give rise to eight different proteins, including polymerase genes PB 1, PB2
and PA, matrix proteins M1 and M2, nucleoprotein (NP), and non-structural proteins NS 1 and NS2
(Horimoto et al., Clin MicrobiolRev. 14(1):129-149, 2001).
         In order to be packaged into progeny virions, viral RNA is transported from the nucleus as a
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex composed of the three influenza virus polymerase proteins, the
nucleoprotein (NP), and the viral RNA, in association with the influenza virus matrix 1 (M1)
protein and nuclear export protein (Marsh et al., J Virol, 82:2295-2304, 2008). The M1 protein that
lies within the envelope is thought to function in assembly and budding. A limited number of M2
proteins are integrated into the virions (Zebedee, J. Virol. 62:2762-2772, 1988). They form
tetramers having H+ ion channel activity, and when activated by the low pH in endosomes, acidify
the inside of the virion, facilitating its uncoating (Pinto et al., Cell 69:517-528, 1992). Amantadine
is an anti-influenza drug that prevents viral infection by interfering with M2 ion channel activity,
thus inhibiting virus uncoating.
        NS1, a nonstructural protein, has multiple functions, including regulation of splicing and
nuclear export of cellular mRNAs as well as stimulation of translation. The major function of NS1
seems to be to counteract the interferon activity of the host, since an NS1 knockout virus was viable
although it grew less efficiently than the parent virus in interferon-nondefective cells (Garcia
Sastre, Virology 252:324-330, 1998).
        NS2 has been detected in virus particles (Richardson et al., Arch. Virol. 116:69-80, 1991;
Yasuda et al., Virology 196:249-255, 1993). The average number of NS2 proteins in a virus
particle was estimated to be 130-200 molecules. An in vitro binding assay shows direct protein
protein contact between M1 and NS2. NS2-M1 complexes have also been detected by
immunoprecipitation in virus-infected cell lysates. The NS2 protein is thought to play a role in the
export of RNP from the nucleus through interaction with M1 protein (Ward et al., Arch. Virol.
140:2067-2073, 1995).

VI.     Influenza VLPs and Administration Thereof
        Influenza VLPs comprising an optimized HA (such as the HA having the amino acid
sequence set forth as any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-8) are provided herein. The influenza VLPs are
generally made up of the HA, NA and M1 proteins. The production of influenza VLPs has been
described in the art and is within the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art. For example,
influenza VLPs can be produced by transfection of host cells with plasmids encoding the HA, NA
and M1 proteins. After incubation of the transfected cells for an appropriate time to allow for
protein expression (such as for approximately 72 hours), VLPs can be isolated from cell culture
supernatants. Example 2 below provides an exemplary protocol for purifying influenza VLPs from
cell supernatants.  In this example, VLPs are isolated by low speed centrifugation (to remove cell
debris), vacuum filtration and ultracentrifugation through 20% glycerol.
        The influenza VLPs disclosed herein can be used as influenza vaccines to elicit a protective
immune response against HiNi influenza viruses.
        Influenza VLPs, or compositions thereof, can be administered to a subject by any of the
routes normally used for introducing recombinant virus into a subject. Methods of administration
include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous,
subcutaneous, vaginal, rectal, intranasal, inhalation or oral. Parenteral administration, such as
subcutaneous, intravenous or intramuscular administration, is generally achieved by injection.
Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid
forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Injection
solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind
previously described. Administration can be systemic or local.
        Influenza VLPs, or compositions thereof, are administered in any suitable manner, such as
with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in
part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to
administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of
pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure.
        Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions,
suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene
glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous
                                                   - 24 -

carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and
buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose
and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and
nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the
like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials,
anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like.
         Some of the compositions may potentially be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable
acid- or base-addition salt, formed by reaction with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid,
hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid,
and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic
acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, or by reaction with an
inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and organic
bases such as mono-, di-, trialkyl and aryl amines and substituted ethanolamines.
         Administration can be accomplished by single or multiple doses. The dose administered to
a subject in the context of the present disclosure should be sufficient to induce a beneficial
therapeutic response in a subject over time, or to inhibit or prevent HIN1 influenza virus infection.
The dose required will vary from subject to subject depending on the species, age, weight and
general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection being treated, the particular
composition being used and its mode of administration. An appropriate dose can be determined by
one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.
         Provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions which include a therapeutically effective
amount of the influenza VLPs alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline,
dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The carrier and composition can be
sterile, and the formulation suits the mode of administration. The composition can also contain
minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a
liquid solution, suspension, emulsion, tablet, pill, capsule, sustained release formulation, or powder.
The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as
triglycerides. Oral formulations can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of
mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, and magnesium
                                                  - 25 -

carbonate. Any of the common pharmaceutical carriers, such as sterile saline solution or sesame
oil, can be used. The medium can also contain conventional pharmaceutical adjunct materials such
as, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, buffers,
preservatives and the like. Other media that can be used with the compositions and methods
provided herein are normal saline and sesame oil.
         The influenza VLPs described herein can be administered alone or in combination with
other therapeutic agents to enhance antigenicity. For example, the influenza VLPs can be
administered with an adjuvant, such as Freund incomplete adjuvant or Freund's complete adjuvant.
         Optionally, one or more cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, RANTES, GM-CSF, TNF-a,
or IFN-y, one or more growth factors, such as GM-CSF or G-CSF; one or more molecules such as
OX-40L or 41 BBL, or combinations of these molecules, can be used as biological adjuvants (see,
for example, Salgaller et al., 1998, J Surg. Oncol. 68(2):122-38; Lotze et al., 2000, CancerJ Sci.
Am. 6(Suppl 1):S61-6; Cao et al., 1998, Stem Cells 16(Suppl 1):251-60; Kuiper et al., 2000, Adv.
Exp. Med. Biol. 465:381-90). These molecules can be administered systemically (or locally) to the
host.
         A number of means for inducing cellular responses, both in vitro and in vivo, are known.
Lipids have been identified as agents capable of assisting in priming CTL in vivo against various
antigens. For example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,662,907, palmitic acid residues can be
attached to the alpha and epsilon amino groups of a lysine residue and then linked (for example, via
one or more linking residues, such as glycine, glycine-glycine, serine, serine-serine, or the like) to
an immunogenic peptide. The lipidated peptide can then be injected directly in a micellar form,
incorporated in a liposome, or emulsified in an adjuvant. As another example, E. coli lipoproteins,
such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinlyseryl-serine can be used to prime tumor specific CTL when
covalently attached to an appropriate peptide (see, Deres et al., Nature 342:561, 1989). Further, as
the induction of neutralizing antibodies can also be primed with the same molecule conjugated to a
peptide which displays an appropriate epitope, two compositions can be combined to elicit both
humoral and cell-mediated responses where that is deemed desirable.
         Although administration of VLPs containing an optimized HA protein is exemplified
herein, one of skill in the art would understand that it is also possible to administer the optimized
                                                 - 26 -

influenza HA protein itself (in the absence of a viral particle) or as a fusion protein to elicit an
immune response in a subject.
        The following examples are provided to illustrate certain particular features and/or
embodiments. These examples should not be construed to limit the disclosure to the particular
features or embodiments described.
                                            EXAMPLES
Example 1: Generation of COBRA sequences for H1N1 influenza
        Influenza A HINI HA amino acid sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza
Virus Resource database. HINI HA proteins of isolates from 1918-2012 were used for generating
consensus sequences. Seven different consensus sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 1-7) were generated
using the following methods:
1.      COBRA Method X-1 (1918-2012)
        Sequences were organized by the date of isolation and nine primary consensus sequences
were generated using isolates from 1918-1934 (8), 1935-1947 (13), 1948-1957 (12), 1977-1983
(69), 1984-1991 (19), 1992-1999 (59), 2000-2006 (339), 2007-2008 (722) and 2009-2012 (207). A
second layer consensus sequence of viruses isolated from 1948-1991 was generated using the three
primary consensus layers from the 1948-1957, 1977-1983 and 1984-1991 groups. As shown in
FIG. 2, the final consensus sequence (third layer; SEQ ID NO: 1) was generated by alignment of
six primary layer consensus sequences (1918-1934, 1935-1947, 1992-1999, 2000-2006, 2007-2008
and 2009-2012) and the second layer consensus sequence (1948-1991).
2.      COBRA Method X-2 (1933-1947)
        Sequences were organized by the date of isolation to generate three primary consensus
sequences: 1933-1936 (11), 1940-1946 (8) and 1947 (1). The final consensus sequence (SEQ ID
NO: 2) was generated by aligning the three primary consensus sequences, as shown in FIG. 2.
                                                 - 27 -

3.      COBRA Method X-3 (1978-2008)
        Sequences were organized by the date of isolation and five primary consensus sequences
were generated using isolates from 1978-1983 (65), 1984-1991 (19), 1992-1999 (59), 2000-2006
(339) and 2007-2008 (722). A second layer consensus sequence of viruses isolated from 1978
1991 was generated using the two primary consensus layers from the 1978-1983 and 1984-1991
groups. As shown in FIG. 3, the final consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3) was generated by
alignment of three primary layer consensus sequences (1992-1999, 2000-2006 and 2007-2008) and
the second layer consensus sequence (1978-1991).
4.      COBRA Method X-4 (1918-2005)
        Sequences were organized by the date of isolation and eight primary consensus sequences
were generated using isolates from 1918-1934 (8), 1935-1947 (13), 1948-1957 (12), 1977-1983
(68), 1984-1986 (9), 1987-1991 (12), 1992-1999 (59) and 2000-2005 (263). Two second layer
consensus sequences (1918-1957 and 1978-1991) were generated. The 1918-1957 secondary
consensus sequence was generated using the three primary consensus layers from the 1918-1934,
1935-1947 and 1948-1957 groups. The 1978-1991 secondary consensus sequence was generated
using the three primary consensus layers from the 1977-1983, 1984-1986 and 1987-1991 groups.
As shown in FIG. 4, the final consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 4) was generated by alignment of
two primary layer consensus sequences (1992-1999 and 2000-2005) and the two second layer
consensus sequences (1918-1957 and 1978-1991). This sequence is de-glycosylated at positions
142 and 177.
5.      COBRA Method X-5 (1982-2012)
        Sequences were organized by the date of isolation and seven primary consensus sequences
were generated using isolates from 1982-1983 (4), 1984-1986 (9), 1987-1991 (12), 1992-1999 (27),
2000-2006 (339), 2007-2008 (722) and 2009-2012 (207). One second layer consensus sequence
(1982-1986) was generated using the two primary consensus layers from the 1982-1983 and 1984
1986 groups. As shown in FIG. 5, the final consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 5) was generated by
alignment of five primary layer consensus sequences (1987-1991, 1992-1999, 2000-2006, 2007
2008 and 2009-2012) and the second layer consensus sequence (1982-1986).
                                               -28-

6.      COBRA Method X-6 (1999-2012)
        Sequences were organized by the date of isolation to generate four primary consensus
sequences: 1999(5), 2000-2006 (339), 2007-2008 (722) and 2009-2012 (207). The final consensus
sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6) was generated by aligning the four primary consensus sequences, as
shown in FIG. 6.
7.      COBRA Method A-5 (1918-2008)
        Sequences were organized by date of isolation and 12 primary consensus sequences were
generated using isolates from 1918 (1), 1976 (4), 2009-2011 (123), 1933-1934 (8), 1935-1947 (13),
1948-1957 (12), 1977-1983 (68), 1984-1986 (9), 1987-1991 (12), 1992-1999 (27), 2000-2005 (59)
and 2006-2008 (798). Four secondary consensus sequences were generated by grouping the
primary consensus sequences according to "swine" sequences or by date (1933-1957, 1977-2005
and 2006-2008), as shown in FIG. 7. The final consensus sequence (the third layer consensus; SEQ
ID NO: 7) was generated by alignment of the four secondary consensus sequences.
        The COBRA amino acid sequence generated according to any of the both methods can be
reverse translated and optimized for expression in mammalian cells, including codon usage and
RNA optimization (GeneArt; Regensburg, Germany). The optimized nucleic acid sequences can
be inserted into the pTR600 expression vector (U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2002/0106798; Ross et al., Nat Immunol. 1(2):102-103, 2000; Green et al., Vaccine 20:242-248,
2001), or any other suitable vector for expression.
Example 2: Preparation of and immunization with influenza VLPs
        The following methods can be used to produce and characterize influenza VLPs comprising
an optimized HA. Exemplary methods for immunization of mice, ferrets and macaques are also
described below (see also, Giles and Ross, Vaccine 29(16):3043-3054, 2011).

        293T cells are transiently transfected with plasmids expressing M1, NA and an optimized
HA, and incubated for 72 hours at 37C. The M1, NA and HA coding sequences can be codon
                                                 - 29 -

optimized for expression in mammalian cells. Supernatants are collected and cell debris is
removed by low speed centrifugation followed by vacuum filtration through a 0.22 tm sterile filter.
VLPs are purified via ultracentrifugation (100,000 x g through 20% glycerol, weight per volume)
for 4 hours at 4'C. The pellets are subsequently resuspended in PBS pH 7.2 and stored in single
use aliquots at -80'C until use. Total protein concentration is determined by Micro BCATM Protein
Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).
Dose determination
        HA specific content can be determined by western blot and densitometry. Purified
recombinant COBRA HA and purified VLPs are prepared in standard total protein amounts and are
electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blot is
probed with mouse polyclonal antisera from influenza infected mice and the HA-antibody
complexes are detected using a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
(Southern Biotech; Birmingham, AL, USA). HRP is detected by chemiluminescent substrate
(Pierce Biotechnology; Rockford IL, USA) and exposed to X-ray film (ThermoFisher; Pittsburgh,
PA, USA). Density of bands is determined using ImageJ software (NIH). Density of recombinant
HA bands is used to calculate a standard curve and the density of the purified VLPs is interpolated
using the results from the recombinant HA.
Mouse studies
        BALB/c mice (Mus musculis, females, 6-8 weeks old) can be purchased from Harlan
Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Mice are housed in microisolator units and allowed free
access to food and water and are cared for under USDA guidelines for laboratory animals. Mice
are vaccinated with one of three doses of purified COBRA HA VLPs (1.5 tg, 0.3 pig or 0.06 Lg),
based upon HA content from a densitometry assay, via intramuscular injection at week 0 and then
boosted with the same dose at week 3. Vaccines at each dose are formulated with alum adjuvant
(Imject Alum, Pierce Biotechnology; Rockford, IL, USA), CpG oligonucleotides, or vehicle alone.
Fourteen to twenty-one days after each vaccination, blood is collected from anesthetized mice via
the retro-orbital plexus and transferred to a microfuge tube. Tubes are centrifuged and sera is
removed and frozen at -80  5'C. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) serum antibody titer for each
                                                 - 30 -

vaccine group is determined at week 5 using representative reassortant viruses or COBRA HA
VLPs.
        Three weeks after final vaccination, mice are challenged intranasally with a highly
pathogenic HINI virus in a volume of 50pl. After infection, mice are monitored daily for weight
loss, disease signs and death for 14 days after infection. Individual body weights, sickness scores
(Toapanta and Ross, RespiratoryResearch 10(1): 112, 2009) and death are recorded for each group
on each day after inoculation.
Ferret studies
        Fitch ferrets (Mustelaputoriusfuro, female, 6-12-months of age), influenza naive and de
scented, can be purchased from Marshall Farms (Sayre, PA, USA). Ferrets are pair housed in
stainless steel cages (Shor-line, Kansas City, KS, USA) containing Sani-chips Laboratory Animal
Bedding (P.J. Murphy Forest Products, Montville, NJ, USA). Ferrets are provided with Teklad
Global Ferret Diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) and fresh water ad libitum. The COBRA
HA VLPs are diluted in PBS, pH 7.2 to achieve final concentration. Ferrets are vaccinated with
one of two doses of purified COBRA VLPs (15 pg, 3 tg), based upon HA content as determined
by densitometry assay, via intramuscular injection in the quadriceps muscle in a volume of 0.25 ml
at week 0 and then boosted with the same dose at week 3. Vaccines are stored at -80'C prior to use
and formulated with alum adjuvant (Imject Alum; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA)
immediately prior to use. Animals are monitored for adverse events including weight loss,
temperature, decrease in activity, nasal discharge, sneezing and diarrhea weekly during the
vaccination regimen. Prior to vaccination, animals are confirmed by HAI assay to be seronegative
for circulating influenza A and influenza B viruses. Fourteen to twenty-one days after each
vaccination, blood is collected from anesthetized ferrets via the anterior vena cava and transferred
to a microfuge tube. Tubes are centrifuged and sera is removed and frozen at -80  5'C. HAI
serum antibody titer for each vaccine group is determined at week 5 using representative
reassortant viruses or COBRA HA VLPs.
        Three weeks after final vaccination, ferrets are challenged intranasally with a highly
pathogenic HINI virus in a volume of 1 ml. After infection, ferrets are monitored daily for weight
loss, disease signs and death for 14 days after infection. Individual body weights, sickness scores,
                                                 -31  -

and death are recorded for each group on each day after inoculation. Nasal washes are performed
by instilling 3 ml of PBS into the nares of anesthetized ferrets each day for 7 days after inoculation.
Washes are collected and stored at -80'C until use.
Primate immunizations
        Cynomolgus macaques (Macacafascicularis,male, 3-5 years old) can be purchased from
Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Macaques are vaccinated with purified COBRA
HA VLPs (15 ptg), based upon HA content from a densitometry assay, via intramuscular injection
at week 0 and then boosted with the same dose at weeks 3 and 6. Vaccines are formulated with
alum adjuvant (Imject Alum, Pierce Biotechnology; Rockford, IL, USA) immediately prior to use.
Twenty-one days after each vaccination, blood is collected from anesthetized macaques via the
femoral vein and transferred to a serum separator tube. Tubes are allowed to activate clotting
followed by centrifugation and sera is removed and frozen at -80  5'C. End point IgG titers and
HAI serum antibody titer for each vaccine group is determined at week 5 using representative
reassortant viruses or COBRA HA VLPs.
        Three weeks after final vaccination, macaques are challenged by intranasal, intratracheal,
and orbital inoculation with a highly pathogenic HINI virus in a volume of 1 ml. After infection,
macaques are monitored daily for weight loss, disease signs and death for 5 days after infection.
Individual body weights, sickness scores and death are recorded for each group on each day after
inoculation.
Example 3: HAI studies following immunization of mice with COBRA HA-containing VLPs
        Influenza VLPs containing COBRA HA were generated as described in Example 2. Female
BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were vaccinated intramuscularly with 3 pig of VLPs containing
Method X-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1), Method X-2 (SEQ ID NO: 2), Method X-3 (SEQ ID NO: 3), Method
X-4 (SEQ ID NO: 4), Method X-5 (SEQ ID NO: 5), or Method X-6 (SEQ ID NO: 6) COBRA HA.
Mice were vaccinated at week 0 (prime dose) and boosted at weeks 4 and 12. Vaccines were
formulated with alum adjuvant (Imject Alum, Pierce Biotechnology; Rockford, IL, USA). At
weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 14, blood samples were collected from anesthetized mice via the retro-orbital
                                                 - 32 -

plexus. At week 14, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against a panel of influenza viruses
were determined. Also at week 14, mice were challenged intranasally with pathogenic HiNi virus.
