                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention provides methods to promote the differentiation of pluripotent
       stem cells into insulin producing cells. In particular, the present invention provides a
       method to produce a population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the
       pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein greater than 50% of the cells in the
       population co-express PDX1 and NKX6.1.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0003] Advances in cell-replacement therapy for Type I diabetes mellitus and a shortage of
       transplantable islets of Langerhans have focused interest on developing sources of
       insulin-producing cells, or R cells, appropriate for engraftment. One approach is the
       generation of functional R cells from pluripotent stem cells, such as, for example,
       embryonic stem cells.
[0004] In vertebrate embryonic development, a pluripotent cell gives rise to a group of cells
       comprising three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) in a process
       known as gastrulation. Tissues such as, for example, thyroid, thymus, pancreas, gut,
       and liver, will develop from the endoderm, via an intermediate stage. The
       intermediate stage in this process is the formation of definitive endoderm. Definitive
       endoderm cells express a number of markers, such as, HNF3 beta, GATA4, MIXL1,
       CXCR4 and SOX17.
[0005] Formation of the pancreas arises from the differentiation of definitive endoderm into
       pancreatic endoderm. Cells of the pancreatic endoderm express the pancreatic
       duodenal homeobox gene, PDX1. In the absence of PDX1, the pancreas fails to
                                             - 1-

       develop beyond the formation of ventral and dorsal buds. Thus, PDXI expression
       marks a critical step in pancreatic organogenesis. The mature pancreas contains,
       among other cell types, exocrine tissue and endocrine tissue. Exocrine and endocrine
       tissues arise from the differentiation of pancreatic endoderm.
[0006] Cells bearing the features of islet cells have reportedly been derived from embryonic
       cells of the mouse. For example, Lumelsky et al. (Science 292:1389, 2001) report
       differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to insulin-secreting structures similar to
       pancreatic islets. Soria et al. (Diabetes 49:157, 2000) report that insulin-secreting
       cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells normalize glycemia in streptozotocin
       induced diabetic mice.
[0007] In one example, Hori et al. (PNAS 99: 16105, 2002) disclose that treatment of mouse
       embryonic stem cells with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (LY294002)
       produced cells that resembled     P cells.
[0008] In another example, Blyszczuk et al. (PNAS 100:998, 2003) reports the generation of
       insulin-producing cells from mouse embryonic stem cells constitutively expressing
       Pax4.
[0009] Micallef et al. reports that retinoic acid can regulate the commitment of embryonic
       stem cells to form PDXI positive pancreatic endoderm. Retinoic acid is most
       effective at inducing Pdx1 expression when added to cultures at day 4 of embryonic
       stem cell differentiation during a period corresponding to the end of gastrulation in
       the embryo (Diabetes 54:301, 2005).
[0010] Miyazaki et al reports a mouse embryonic stem cell line over-expressing Pdx1. Their
       results show that exogenous Pdx1 expression clearly enhanced the expression of
       insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, neurogenin3, p48, Pax6, and Hnf6 genes in the
       resulting differentiated cells (Diabetes 53: 1030, 2004).
[0011] Skoudy et al. reports that activin A (a member of the TGF-P superfamily) upregulates
       the expression of exocrine pancreatic genes (p48 and amylase) and endocrine genes
       (Pdxl, insulin, and glucagon) in mouse embryonic stem cells. The maximal effect
       was observed using InM activin A. They also observed that the expression level of
       insulin and Pdxl mRNA was not affected by retinoic acid; however, 3nM FGF7
                                                     2

       treatment resulted in an increased level of the transcript for Pdx 1 (Biochem. J. 379:
       749, 2004).
[0012] Shiraki et al. studied the effects of growth factors that specifically enhance
       differentiation of embryonic stem cells into PDX 1 positive cells. They observed that
       TGF-p2 reproducibly yielded a higher proportion of PDX1 positive cells (Genes
       Cells. 2005 Jun; 10(6): 503-16.).
[0013] Gordon et al. demonstrated the induction of brachyury [positive]/ HNF3 beta
       [positive] endoderm cells from mouse embryonic stem cells in the absence of serum
       and in the presence of activin along with an inhibitor of Wnt signaling (US
       2006/0003446A1).
[0014] Gordon et al. (PNAS, Vol 103, page 16806, 2006) states "Wnt and TGF-beta/ nodal/
       activin signaling simultaneously were required for the generation of the anterior
       primitive streak".
[00151 However, the mouse model of embryonic stem cell development may not exactly
       mimic the developmental program in higher mammals, such as, for example, humans.
[0016] Thomson et al. isolated embryonic stem cells from human blastocysts (Science
       282:114, 1998). Concurrently, Gearhart and coworkers derived human embryonic
       germ (hEG) cell lines from fetal gonadal tissue (Shamblott et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
       Sci. USA 95:13726, 1998). Unlike mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be
       prevented from differentiating simply by culturing with Leukemia Inhibitory Factor
       (LIF), human embryonic stem cells must be maintained under very special conditions
       (U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,806; WO 99/20741; WO 01/51616).
[0017] D'Amour et al. describes the production of enriched cultures of human embryonic
       stem cell-derived definitive endoderm in the presence of a high concentration of
       activin and low serum (Nature Biotechnology 2005). Transplanting these cells under
       the kidney capsule of mice resulted in differentiation into more mature cells with
       characteristics of some endodermal organs. Human embryonic stem cell-derived
       definitive endoderm cells can be further differentiated into PDX1 positive cells after
       addition of FGF-10 (US 2005/0266554A1).
                                                    3

[0018] D'Amour et al. (Nature Biotechnology - 24, 1392 - 1401 (2006)) states: "We have
       developed a differentiation process that converts human embryonic stem (hES) cells
       to endocrine cells capable of synthesizing the pancreatic hormones insulin, glucagon,
       somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide and ghrelin. This process mimics in vivo
       pancreatic organogenesis by directing cells through stages resembling definitive
       endoderm, gut-tube endoderm, pancreatic endoderm and endocrine precursor en route
       to cells that express endocrine hormones".
[0019] In another example, Fisk et al. reports a system for producing pancreatic islet cells
       from human embryonic stem cells (US2006/0040387A1). In this case, the
       differentiation pathway was divided into three stages. Human embryonic stem cells
       were first differentiated to endoderm using a combination of sodium butyrate and
       activin A. The cells were then cultured with TGF-p antagonists such as Noggin in
       combination with EGF or betacellulin to generate PDX 1 positive cells. The terminal
       differentiation was induced by nicotinamide.
[0020] In one example, Benvenistry et al. states: "We conclude that over-expression of
       PDX1 enhanced expression of pancreatic enriched genes, induction of insulin
       expression may require additional signals that are only present in vivo" (Benvenistry
       et al, Stem Cells 2006; 24:1923-1930).
[0021] In another example, Grapin-Botton et al. states: "Early activation of Ngn3 almost
       exclusively induced glucagon+ cells while depleting the pool of pancreas progenitors.
       As from E 11.5, PDX- I progenitors became competent to differentiate into insulin
       [positive] and PP [positive] cells" (Johansson KA et al, Developmental Cell 12, 457
       465, March 2007).
[0022] For example, Diez et al. states; "At 9 and 10 weeks, most of the glucagon positive
       cells co-expressed insulin, although distinct insulin-only cells were clearly detectable
       at these stages. Cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon were observed during the
       whole period studies (9 to 21 weeks) but they represent merely a small fraction of the
       total insulin and glucagon expressing cells." (J Histochem Cytochem. 2009
       Sep;57(9):811-24. 2009 Apr 13.)
[0023] In one example, Chen et al states "(-) -indolactam V [(ILV)] activates protein kinase
       C signaling and directs the pancreatic specification of hESCs that have already been
                                                   4

       committed to the endoderrn lineage.. .ILV and retinoic acid function through a related
       mechanism.. .ILV shows a stronger induction of PDX-l expressing cells (percentage
       of cells expressing PDX-1) than does retinoic acid." (Nature Chemical Biology 5,
       195-196 (April 2009) doi: 10.103 8/nchembio0409-195).
[0024] Lyttle et al states: "NKX6-1 co-localised only with insulin cells, indicating that
       NKX6-1 is exclusively involved in human beta cell development." (Diabetologia
       2008 Jul: 51(7):1169-80, 2008).
[0025] Therefore, there still remains a significant need to develop in vitro methods to
       generate a functional insulin expressing cell, that more closely resemble a p cell. The
       present invention takes an alternative approach to improve the efficiency of
       differentiating human embryonic stem cells toward insulin expressing cells, by
       generating a population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic
       endoderm lineage, wherein greater than 50% of the cells in the population co-express
       PDX-I and NKX6. 1.
                                              SUMMARY
[0026] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a population of cells expressing
       markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein greater than 50%
       of the cells in the population co-express PDX1 and NKX6. 1.
[0027] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method to differentiate a
       population of pluripotent stem cells into a population of cells expressing markers
       characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, comprising the steps of:
       a. Culturing a population of pluripotent stem cells,
       b. Differentiating the population of pluripotent stem cells into a population of cells
           expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage, and
       c. Differentiating the population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the
           definitive endoderm lineage into a population of cells expressing markers
           characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, by treating the population of
           cells expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage with
           medium supplemented with a protein kinase C activator.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0034] For clarity of disclosure, and not by way of limitation, the detailed description of the
       invention is divided into the following subsections that describe or illustrate certain
       features, embodiments or applications of the present invention.
                                                    6

                                                 Definitions
[0035] Stem cells are undifferentiated cells defined by their ability at the single cell level to
       both self-renew and differentiate to produce progeny cells, including self-renewing
       progenitors, non-renewing progenitors, and terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells
       are also characterized by their ability to differentiate in vitro into functional cells of
       various cell lineages from multiple germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm),
       as well as to give rise to tissues of multiple germ layers following transplantation and
       to contribute substantially to most, if not all, tissues following injection into
       blastocysts.
[0036] Stem cells are classified by their developmental potential as: (1) totipotent, meaning
       able to give rise to all embryonic and extraembryonic cell types; (2) pluripotent,
       meaning able to give rise to all embryonic cell types; (3) multipotent, meaning able to
       give rise to a subset of cell lineages but all within a particular tissue, organ, or
       physiological system (for example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can produce
       progeny that include HSC (self- renewal), blood cell restricted oligopotent
       progenitors, and all cell types and elements (e.g., platelets) that are normal
       components of the blood); (4) oligopotent, meaning able to give rise to a more
       restricted subset of cell lineages than multipotent stem cells; and (5) unipotent,
       meaning able to give rise to a single cell lineage (e.g., spermatogenic stem cells).
[0037] Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized ("uncommitted") or less
       specialized cell acquires the features of a specialized cell such as, for example, a
       nerve cell or a muscle cell. A differentiated or differentiation-induced cell is one that
       has taken on a more specialized ("committed") position within the lineage of a cell.
       The term "committed", when applied to the process of differentiation, refers to a cell
       that has proceeded in the differentiation pathway to a point where, under normal
       circumstances, it will continue to differentiate into a specific cell type or subset of cell
       types, and cannot, under normal circumstances, differentiate into a different cell type
       or revert to a less differentiated cell type. De-differentiation refers to the process by
       which a cell reverts to a less specialized (or committed) position within the lineage of
       a cell. As used herein, the lineage of a cell defines the heredity of the cell, i.e., which
       cells it came from and what cells it can give rise to. The lineage of a cell places the
       cell within a hereditary scheme of development and differentiation. A lineage
                                                      7

       specific marker refers to a characteristic specifically associated with the phenotype of
       cells of a lineage of interest and can be used to assess the differentiation of an
       uncommitted cell to the lineage of interest.
[0038] "Cells expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage", or
       "Stage 1 cells", or "Stage 1", as used herein, refers to cells expressing at least one of
       the following markers: SOX17, GATA4, HNF3 beta, GSC, CERI, Nodal, FGF8,
       Brachyury, Mix-like homeobox protein, FGF4 CD48, eomesodermin (EOMES),
       DKK4, FGF17, GATA6, CXCR4, C-Kit, CD99, or OTX2. Cells expressing markers
       characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage include primitive streak precursor
       cells, primitive streak cells, mesendoderm cells and definitive endoderm cells.
[0039] "Cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage", as used
       herein, refers to cells expressing at least one of the following markers: PDXl,
       NKX6.1, HNFI beta, PTF1 alpha, HNF6, HNF4 alpha, SOX9, HB9 orPROXI. Cells
       expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage include
       pancreatic endoderm cells, primitive gut tube cells, and posterior foregut cells.
[0040] "Definitive endoderm", as used herein, refers to cells which bear the characteristics of
       cells arising from the epiblast during gastrulation and which form the gastrointestinal
       tract and its derivatives. Definitive endoderm cells express the following markers:
       HNF3 beta, GATA4, SOX 17, Cerberus, OTX2, goosecoid, C-Kit, CD99, and MIXL 1.
[0041] "Markers", as used herein, are nucleic acid or polypeptide molecules that are
       differentially expressed in a cell of interest. In this context, differential expression
       means an increased level for a positive marker and a decreased level for a negative
       marker. The detectable level of the marker nucleic acid or polypeptide is sufficiently
       higher or lower in the cells of interest compared to other cells, such that the cell of
       interest can be identified and distinguished from other cells using any of a variety of
       methods known in the art.
[0042] "Pancreatic endocrine cell", or "Pancreatic hormone expressing cell", or "Cells
       expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endocrine lineage" as used herein,
       refers to a cell capable of expressing at least one of the following hormones: insulin,
       glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide.
                                                     8

                    Isolation, Expansion and Culture of Pluripotent Stem Cells
                               Characterizationof PluripotentStem Cells
[0043] Pluripotent stem cells may express one or more of the stage-specific embryonic
       antigens (SSEA) 3 and 4, and markers detectable using antibodies designated Tra-I
       60 and Tra-1-81 (Thomson et al., Science 282:1145, 1998). Differentiation of
       pluripotent stem cells in vitro results in the loss of SSEA-4, Tra 1-60, and Tra 1-81
       expression (if present) and increased expression of SSEA-1. Undifferentiated
       pluripotent stem cells typically have alkaline phosphatase activity, which can be
       detected by fixing the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then developing with
       Vector Red as a substrate, as described by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories,
       Burlingame Calif.). Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells also typically express
       OCT4 and TERT, as detected by RT-PCR.
[0044] Another desirable phenotype of propagated pluripotent stem cells is a potential to
       differentiate into cells of all three germinal layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and
       ectoderm tissues. Pluripotency of pluripotent stem cells can be confined, for
       example, by injecting cells into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice,
       fixing the teratomas that form using 4% paraformaldehyde, and then examining them
       histologically for evidence of cell types from the three germ layers. Alternatively,
       pluripotency may be determined by the creation of embryoid bodies and assessing the
       embryoid bodies for the presence of markers associated with the three germinal
       layers.
[0045] Propagated pluripotent stem cell lines may be karyotyped using a standard G-banding
       technique and compared to published karyotypes of the corresponding primate
       species. It is desirable to obtain cells that have a "normal karyotype," which means
       that the cells are euploid, wherein all human chromosomes are present and not
       noticeably altered.
                                                     9

                                    Sources of PluripotentStem Cells
[0046] The types of pluripotent stem cells that may be used include established lines of
       pluripotent cells derived from tissue formed after gestation, including pre-embryonic
       tissue (such as, for example, a blastocyst), embryonic tissue, or fetal tissue taken any
       time during gestation, typically but not necessarily before approximately 10 to 12
       weeks gestation. Non-limiting examples are established lines of human embryonic
       stem cells or human embryonic germ cells, such as, for example the human
       embryonic stem cell lines H1, H7, and H9 (WiCell). Also contemplated is use of the
       compositions of this disclosure during the initial establishment or stabilization of such
       cells, in which case the source cells would be primary pluripotent cells taken directly
       from the source tissues. Also suitable are cells taken from a pluripotent stem cell
       population already cultured in the absence of feeder cells. Also suitable are mutant
       human embryonic stem cell lines, such as, for example, BGOlv (BresaGen, Athens,
       GA).
[0047] In one embodiment, human embryonic stem cells are prepared as described by
       Thomson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,780; Science 282:1145, 1998; Curr. Top. Dev.

[0048] In one embodiment, pluripotent stem cells are cultured on a layer of feeder cells that
       support the pluripotent stem cells in various ways. Alternatively, pluripotent stem
       cells are cultured in a culture system that is essentially free of feeder cells, but
       nonetheless supports proliferation of pluripotent stem cells without undergoing
       substantial differentiation. The growth of pluripotent stem cells in feeder-free culture
       without differentiation is supported using a medium conditioned by culturing
       previously with another cell type. Alternatively, the growth of pluripotent stem cells
       in feeder-free culture without differentiation is supported using a chemically defined
       medium.

       according to the methods disclosed in US20020072117. Alternatively, pluripotent
       stem cells may be cultured in culture media derived according to the methods

       embodiment, the suitable culture substrate is an extracellular matrix component, such
       as, for example, those derived from basement membrane or that may form part of
       adhesion molecule receptor-ligand couplings. In one embodiment, a the suitable
       culture substrate is MATRIGEL@ (Becton Dickenson). MATRIGEL@ is a soluble
       preparation from Engelbreth-Holm Swarm tumor cells that gels at room temperature
       to form a reconstituted basement membrane.

       and in the presence of a medium that promotes cell survival, propagation, and
       retention of the desirable characteristics. All these characteristics benefit from careful
       attention to the seeding distribution and can readily be determined by one of skill in
       the art.

            Formation of Cells Expressing Markers Characteristic of the Pancreatic
                          Endoderm Lineage from Pluripotent Stem Cells
[0057] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for producing a
       population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm
       lineage from pluripotent stem cells, comprising the steps of
           a. Culturing a population of pluripotent stem cells,
           b. Differentiating the population of pluripotent stem cells into a population of
               cells expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage, and
           c. Differentiating the population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the
               definitive endoderm lineage into a population of cells expressing markers
               characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, by treating the population of
               cells expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage with
               medium supplemented with a protein kinase C activator.
[0058] In one aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a population of
       cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein
       greater than 50% of the population co-express PDX-l and NKX6. 1. In an alternate
       embodiment, the present invention provides a population of cells expressing markers
       characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein greater than 60% of the
       population co-express PDX-1 and NKX6.1. In an alternate embodiment, the present
       invention provides a population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the
       pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein greater than 70% of the population co-express
       PDX-1 and NKX6.1. In an alternate embodiment, the present invention provides a
       population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm
       lineage, wherein greater than 80% of the population co-express PDX- 1 and NKX6. 1.
       In an alternate embodiment, the present invention provides a population of cells
       expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein greater
       than 90% of the population co-express PDX- 1 and NKX6. 1.
[0059] In one aspect of the present invention, the population of cells expressing markers
       characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage may be further treated to form a
                                                   13

       population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endocrine
       lineage.
[0060] The efficiency of differentiation may be determined by exposing a treated cell
       population to an agent (such as an antibody) that specifically recognizes a protein
       marker expressed by cells expressing markers characteristic of the desired cell type.
[0061] Methods for assessing expression of protein and nucleic acid markers in cultured or
       isolated cells are standard in the art. These include quantitative reverse transcriptase
       polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Northern blots, in situ hybridization (see, e.g.,
       Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et aL, eds. 2001 supplement)), and
       immunoassays such as immunohistochemical analysis of sectioned material, Western
       blotting, and for markers that are accessible in intact cells, flow cytometry analysis
       (FACS) (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, New
       York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1998)).
[0062] Characteristics of pluripotent stem cells are well known to those skilled in the art, and
       additional characteristics of pluripotent stem cells continue to be identified.
       Pluripotent stem cell markers include, for example, the expression of one or more of
       the following: ABCG2, CRIPTO, FOXD3, CONNEXIN43, CONNEXIN45, OCT4,
       SOX2, NANOG, hTERT, UTFI, ZFP42, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, Tra 1-60, Tra 1-81.
[0063] After treating pluripotent stem cells with the methods of the present invention, the
       differentiated cells may be purified by exposing a treated cell population to an agent
       (such as an antibody) that specifically recognizes a protein marker, such as CXCR4,
       expressed by cells expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm
       lineage.
[0064] Pluripotent stem cells suitable for use in the present invention include, for example,
       the human embryonic stem cell line H9 (NIH code: WA09), the human embryonic
       stem cell line HI (NIH code: WAO 1), the human embryonic stem cell line H7 (NIH
       code: WA07), and the human embryonic stem cell line SA002 (Cellartis, Sweden).
       Also suitable for use in the present invention are cells that express at least one of the
       following markers characteristic of pluripotent cells: ABCG2, CRIPTO, CD9,

       consisting of SOX17, GATA4, HNF3 beta, GSC, CERI, Nodal, FGF8, Brachyury,
       Mix-like homeobox protein, FGF4, CD48, eomesodermin (EOMES), DKK4, FGF 17,
       GATA6, CXCR4, C-Kit, CD99, and OTX2. Suitable for use in the present invention
       is a cell that expresses at least one of the markers characteristic of the definitive
       endoderm lineage. In one aspect of the present invention, a cell expressing markers
       characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage is a primitive streak precursor cell.
       In an alternate aspect, a cell expressing markers characteristic of the definitive
       endoderm lineage is a mesendoderm cell. In an alternate aspect, a cell expressing
       markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage is a definitive endoderm
       cell.
[0066] Markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage are selected from the group
       consisting of PDX1, NKX6.1, HNFI beta, PTF1 alpha, HNF6, HNF4 alpha, SOX9,
       HB9 and PROX1. Suitable for use in the present invention is a cell that expresses at

[0067] Markers characteristic of the pancreatic endocrine lineage are selected from the group
       consisting of NGN3, NEUROD, NKX2.2, PDX1, NKX6.1, PAX4, and PAX6. In one
       embodiment, a pancreatic endocrine cell is capable of expressing at least one of the
       following hormones: insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide.
       Suitable for use in the present invention is a cell that expresses at least one of the
       markers characteristic of the pancreatic endocrine lineage. In one aspect of the
       present invention, a cell expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endocrine
       lineage is a pancreatic endocrine cell. The pancreatic endocrine cell may be a
       pancreatic hormone-expressing cell. Alternatively, the pancreatic endocrine cell may

                           Characteristicof the Definitive Endoderm Lineage
[0069] Formation of cells expressing markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm
       lineage may be determined by testing for the presence of the markers before and after
       following a particular protocol. Pluripotent stem cells typically do not express such
       markers. Thus, differentiation of pluripotent cells is detected when cells begin to
       express them.
[0070] Pluripotent stem cells may be differentiated into cells expressing markers
       characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage by any method in the art or by any
       method proposed in this invention.

       markers characteristic of the definitive endoderm lineage according to the methods
       disclosed in D'Amour et al, Nature Biotechnology 23, 1534 - 1541 (2005).

                   Formation of the Population of Cells of the Present Invention
[0099] Cells of the human embryonic stem cells line HI were cultured on MATRIGEL*
       (1:30 dilution) (BD Biosciences; Cat # 356231)- coated dishes with RPMI medium
       (Invitrogen; Cat #: 22400) + 0.2% FBS + 100 ng/ml activin A (PeproTech; Cat #120
       14) + 20 ng/ml WNT-3a (R&D Systems; Cat # 1324-WN/CF) for one day, followed
       by treatment with RPMI media supplemented with 0.5% FBS + 100 ng/ml activin A
       for an additional two days (Stage 1), then,
                a. DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS + 50 ng/ml FGF7 for three days (Stage 2), then
                b. DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27+0.25 pM Cyclopamine- KAAD + 2 pM
                   Retinoic acid (RA) + 100 ng/ml of Noggin for four days (Stage 3), then
                   either
                                                   21

                c. Treatment 1: DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27 for four days (stage 4
                    basal media- BM), or
                d. Treatment 2: DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27 + 100 ng/ml Noggin + 1
                    pM ALK5 inhibitor II for four days (stage 4), or
                e. Treatment 3: DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27 + 100 ng/ml Noggin + 1
                    piM ALK5 inhibitor II + 20nM Phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)
                    (Calbiochem, cat#524390) for four days (Stage 4).
[0100] Cultures were sampled in duplicate on stage 4 day 4, and imaging was performed
       using an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). Images from 100 fields per well
       were acquired to compensate for any cell loss during the bioassay and subsequent
       staining procedures. Measurements for total cell number, total PDX I expressing
       cells, total NKX6.1 expressing cells and total CDX-2 expressing cells were obtained
       from each well using the IN Cell Developer Toolbox 1.7 (GE Healthcare) software.
       Averages and standard deviations were calculated for each replicate data set. Total
       PDXi, NKX6.1 and CDX-2 expressing cells were reported as a percentage of the
       total cell population.
[0101] As shown in Figure 2A, in all experimental populations at the end of stage 4, day 4,
       approximately 92% 4%of the cells in the population expressed PDX 1. However,
       treatment with PDBu (a protein kinase C activator) evoked a significant increase in
       the percentage of NKX6.1 expressing cells in the PDX 1 expressing population
       (Figure 2A), when compared to populations of cells treated with either basal media
       (Treatment 1), or ALK5 inhibitor II plus Noggin (Treatment 2). In the PDBu treated
       group, 88%  4.2% of total population expressed NKX6.1, while 62%  8% of the
       cells receiving treatment 2 expressed NKX6. 1, and 46.7  0.2% of the cells receiving
       treatment 1 expressed NKX6. 1. Most of the NKX6. 1-expressing cells at stage 4 also
       expressed PDX1. These observations were confirmed by overlaying the images of
       PDX1 expression and NKX6.1 expression obtained from a given cell population
       (Figure I A). These data indicate that treatment of the cells with medium
       supplemented with a protein kinase C activator increased the percentage of cells that
       co-express PDXI and NKX6.1 in a population of cells that express markers
       characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage.
                                                  22

[0102] In the population of cells that received treatment 1, 10% of the cells expressed CDX2
       (an intestinal marker) (Figure 2A). Less than 5% of the cells expressed CDX2 in
       populations of cells that received either treatment 2 or 3. In any case, most of the
       CDX2 expressing cells did not co-express PDX 1 and NKX6. 1.
[0103] Parallel populations of Stage 3 cells were also treated with the following protein
       kinase C activators - phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) at a concentration of 20
       nM (Calbiochem #524400), or [(2S, 5S)-(E, E)-8-(5-(4-(Trifluoromethyl)pheny)-2,4
       pentadienoylamino)benzolactam] (TPB) at a concentration of 50 nM (Calbiochem
       #565740), substituted for PDBu in treatment 3 above. At the end of stage 4, day 4,
       91% of the cells of the population treated with PMA, and 90% of the cells of the
       population treated with TPB expressed NKX6. 1. No significant difference was
       observed in total PDX1 expressing cells among all the treatments. See Figure 2B.
[0104] This example demonstrates that protein kinase C activators can be used at a relatively
       low concentration to facilitate the up-regulation of NKX6.1 expression, and increase
       the percentage of cells co-expressing PDX 1 and NKX6.1 within a population of cells
       expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage.

[0105] Cells of the human embryonic stem cells line H I were cultured on MATRIGEL*
       (1:30 dilution)- coated dishes with RPMI medium + 0.2% FBS + 100 ng/ml activin A

[0106] Five to six-week-old male scid-beige mice (C. Bgh- Ib/Ubmsac-Prkde""-Lysf
       N7) were purchased from Taconic Farms. Mice were housed in microisolator cages
       with free access to sterilized food and water. In preparation for surgery, mice were
       identified by ear tagging and their body weight measured and their blood glucose
       determine by a hand held glucometer (One Touch, LifeScan).
[0107] Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isolflurane and oxygen and the surgical site
       was shaved with small animal clippers. Mice were dosed with 0.1 mg.kg Buprenex
       subcutaneously pre-operatively. The surgical site was prepared with successive
       washes of 70% isopropyl alcohol and 10% povidone-iodide.
[0108] Cells at the end of stage four were mechanically scored using a 1-ml glass pipette and
       subsequently transferred to non-adherent plates for culture overnight. During the
       preoperative preparation of the mice, the cells were centrifuged in a 1.5 ml microfuge
       tube and most of the supernatant removed, leaving just enough to collect the pellet of
       cells. The cells were collected into a Rainin Pos-D positive displacement pipette and
       the pipette was inverted to allow for the cells to settle by gravity. The excess media
       was dispensed leaving a packed cell preparation for transplant.
[0109] For transplantation, a 24G x %" I.V. catheter was used to penetrate the kidney capsule
       and the needle was removed. The catheter was then advanced under the kidney
       capsule to the distal pole of the kidney. The Pos-D pipette tip was placed firmly in
       the hub of the catheter and the 5 million cells dispensed from the pipette through the
       catheter under the kidney capsule and delivered to the distal pole of the kidney. The
       kidney capsule was sealed with a low temperature cautery and the kidney was
       returned its original anatomical position. In parallel, cell aggregates containing 5
       million cells were loaded into the 50-pl device using Post-D pipette tip. The 50-pl
       devices were purchased from TheraCyte, Inc (Irvine, CA). The device was sealed by
       medical adhesive silicone type A (Dow Coming, Cat#l 29109) after the loading, and
       implanted subcutaneously into SICD/Bg mice (animal Nos.3 and 4). The muscle was
       closed with continuous sutures using 5-0 vicryl and the skin closed with wound clips.
       Mice were dosed with 1.0 mg.kg Metacam subcutaneously post-opemtively. The
       mouse was removed from the anesthesia and allowed to fully recover.
                                                   24

[0110] Following transplantation, mice were weighed once per week and blood glucose
       measured twice a week. At various intervals following transplantation, mice were
       dosed with 3 g/kg glucose IP and blood drawn via the retro-orbital sinus 60 minutes
       following glucose injection into microfuge tubes containing a small amount of
       heparin. The blood was centrifuged and the plasma placed into a second microfuge
       tube and frozen on dry ice and then stored at -80*C until human c-peptide assay was
       performed. Human c-peptide levels were determined using the Mercodia/ALPCO
       Diagnotics Ultrasensitive C-peptide ELISA (Cat No. 80-CPTHU-EOI, Alpco
       Diagnostics, NH) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
[0111] Human C-peptide was detected in animal serum as early as 4 to 6 weeks in both
       kidney capsule group and the group received Theracyte device after transplantation
       and increased over time (Figures 3A and 3B). At the end of three months, we were
       able to detect significant amount of circulating human C-peptide in response to
       glucose administration in 100% of the animals in both the kidney capsule and the
       group transplanted with the Theracyte device. Glucose stimulated serum level of
       human C-peptide in the kidney capsule group was 1.7 0.5 ng/ml after three month
       (n-4), and human C-peptide in the mice received Theracyte device transplantation
       was 1 0.5 ng/ml (n=2) (Figure 3C).
[0112] This example demonstrates that PDXI and NKX6.1 co-expressing cell population
       generated by protein kinase C activators has the competency to further differentiate
       into insulin-secreting cells in vivo. The potency of further differentiation into insulin
       secreting cells does not depend on the local environment. We demonstrate that PDX 1
       and NKX6.1 co-expressing cells can further differentiate into insulin-secreting cells in
       both kidney capsule and within the immunoprotective device in subcutaneous site.

       for an additional two days (Stage 1), then,
                a. DMEM/F12 + 2% FBS + 50 ng/ml FGF7 for three days (Stage 2), then
                b. DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27+ 0.25 pM Cyclopamine- KAAD + 2 pM
                    Retinoic acid (RA) + 100 ng/ml of Noggin for four days (Stage 3), then
                    either
                c. Treatment 4: DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27 + 20nM PDBu+100 ng/ml

                d. Treatment 5: DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27 + 100 ng/ml Noggin + 1
                    pM ALKS inhibitor II + 20nM PDBu for four days (Stage 4), or
                e. Treatment 6: DMEM-High glucose + 1% B27 + 50 ng/ml FGF10 + 20nM
                    PDBu for four days (Stage 4).
[01141 The effect of additional factors on the protein kinase C activator-mediated increase in
       the percentage of cells that co-express PDX1 and NKX6.1 was investigated. Cultures
       were sampled in duplicate on stage 4 day 4, and imaging analysis was performed as
       described in Example I above. The expression of ISLI and NEURODI were also
       recorded.
[0115] In this study, the majority of the population of cells expressing markers characteristic
       of the pancreatic endoderm lineage were positive for the expression of PDX 1. Most
       of the PDX 1 expressing cells were also co-positive for NKX6. 1. As shown in Table
       1, the addition of PKC activator alone facilitated the formation of NKX6.1 expressing
       cells in the population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic
       endoderm lineage (treatment 4). By day 4 of stage 4, 93% of the total population was
       NKX6.1 positive, and almost all of the NKX6.1 expressing cells were positive for the
       expression of PDX1.
[0116] The addition of ALK5 inhibitor II to the medium supplemented with the protein
       kinase C activator (treatment 5) had no effect on the increases in NKX6.1 expression
       observed. 57.1% of the cells in the population expressed NEUROD I and 52.4% of
                                                   26

           the cells in the population expressed ISLI, suggesting an increase in the percentage of
           endocrine precursor cells in the population, following this treatment. See Table 1.
[0117]     PCR analysis on the samples obtained from this example revealed that the expression
           of PDX1, NKX6.1 and PTFI alpha increased in populations of cells that received
           treatment 4, when compared to cells that received treatment 5. See Figures 4A-4D.
           On the other hand, a significant increase in the expression of NGN3 was observed in
           cells that received ALK5 inhibitor 2 and PDBu (treatment 5). See Figures 4A-4D.
[0118]     The effect of the addition of FGF1O to the medium supplemented with the protein
           kinase C activator (treatment 6) was also investigated. The addition of FGF10 at a
           concentration of 50ng/ml in combination with PDBu (treatment 6) generated a
           population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm
           lineage wherein 9 0% of the cells in the population expressed NKX6. 1, however, a lot
           of NKX6.1 expressing cells were also CDX2 positive. See Table 1. The level of
           mRNA for PDX1, NKX6.1 and PTFI alpha did not increase over that observed in
           cells treated with PDBu and Noggin. See Figures 4A-4D.
[0119]     This example demonstrates that a protein kinase C activator at a relatively low
           concentration (approximately 20nM) in combination with BMP inhibitor can be used
           to generate a population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic
           endoderm lineage, wherein greater than 90% of the cells co-express PDX 1 and
           NKX6.1.

[0121] Cultures were sampled in duplicate on stage 4 day 4, and imaging was performed
       using an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). Images from 100 fields per well
       were acquired to compensate for any cell loss during the bioassay and subsequent
       staining procedures. Measurements for total cell number, total PDX I expressing
       cells, total NKX6.1 expressing cells and total CDX2 expressing cells were obtained
       from each well using the IN Cell Developer Toolbox 1.7 (GE Healthcare) software.
       Averages and standard deviations were calculated for each replicate data set. Total
       PDXI, NKX6.1 and CDX-2 expressing cells were reported as a percentage of the
       total cell population.

[0122] In the populations of cells treated with T7 followed by T9 media, approximately 80%
       of the cells in the population expressed NKX6. 1. See Table 2. In populations of cells
       treated with T7 followed by T10 media, 90% of the cells expressed NKX6. 1,
       however, more CDX2 expressing cells were observed in this treatment. See Table 2.
       Treating populations of cells with T7 followed by T 1 media created a population of
       cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein
       93% of the cells in the population expressed NKX6. 1. Most NKX6.1 expressing cells
       in the populations also expressed PDX1.
[0123] Cultures treated with T8 followed by T9 media created a population of cells
       expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein 56.7%
       of the cells in the population expressed NKX6. 1. See Table 2. Cultures treated with
       T8 followed by T10 media created a population of cells expressing markers
       characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm lineage, wherein 63.5% of the cells in the
       population expressed NKX6. 1, we observed more CDX2 expressing cells following
       this treatment. See Table 2. Cultures treated with T8 followed by TI I media created
       a population of cells expressing markers characteristic of the pancreatic endoderm
       lineage, wherein 74% of the cells in the population expressed NKX6. 1. See Table 2.
       Most of the NKX6.1 expressing cells also expressed PDX 1.
[0124] PCR analysis also supported the IN Cell analysis, in that treatment with retinoic acid,
       cyclopamine and Noggin at stage three followed by addition of a PKC activator at
       stage 4 resulted in an increase in mRNA levels of NKX6.1 and PTF1 alpha by stage
       four day four (Figures 5A-5D).
