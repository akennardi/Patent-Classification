        PULMONARY DELIVERY OF mRNA TO NON-LUNG TARGET CELLS
                                  RELATED APPLICATIONS
 [0001]          This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.
61/657,452, filed on June 8, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
                                        BACKGROUND
 [0002]          Conventional gene therapy involves the use of DNA for insertion of desired
genetic information into host cells. The DNA introduced into the cell is usually integrated
into the genome of one or more transfected cells, allowing for long-lasting action of the
introduced genetic material in the host. While there may be substantial benefits to such
sustained action, integration of exogenous DNA into a host genome may also have many
deleterious effects. For example, it is possible that the introduced DNA will be inserted into
an intact gene, resulting in a mutation which impedes or even totally eliminates the function
of the endogenous gene. Thus, gene therapy with DNA may result in the impairment of a
vital genetic function in the treated host, such as e.g., elimination or deleteriously reduced
production of an essential enzyme or interruption of a gene critical for the regulation of cell
growth, resulting in unregulated or cancerous cell proliferation. In addition, with
conventional DNA based gene therapy it is necessary for effective expression of the desired
gene product to include a strong promoter sequence, which again may lead to undesirable
changes in the regulation of normal gene expression in the cell. It is also possible that the
DNA based genetic material will result in the induction of undesired anti-DNA antibodies,
which in turn, may trigger a possibly fatal immune response.
[0003]           In contrast to DNA, the use of RNA as a gene therapy agent is substantially
safer because (1) RNA does not involve the risk of being stably integrated into the genome of
the transfected cell, thus eliminating the concern that the introduced genetic material will
disrupt the normal functioning of an essential gene, or cause a mutation that results in
deleterious or oncogenic effects; (2) extraneous promoter sequences are not required for
effective translation of the encoded protein, again avoiding possible deleterious side effects;
(3) in contrast to plasmid DNA (pDNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) is devoid of
                                                1

 WO 2013/185069                                                              PCT/US2013/044771
immunogenic CpG motifs so that anti-RNA antibodies are not generated; and (4) any
deleterious effects that do result from mRNA based on gene therapy would be of limited
duration due to the relatively short half-life of RNA. Moreover in many applications, the
transient nature of mRNA transfer to cells, i.e., wherein the duration of any therapeutic effect
is limited by the life span of the mRNA and the protein product in the cells, is more desirable
than the potentially longer lasting effect achieved using DNA based gene therapy. In
addition, it is not necessary for mRNA to enter the nucleus to perform its function, thus
avoiding a major barrier to DNA based gene therapy.
 [0004]          One reason that mRNA based gene therapy has not been used more in the past
is that mRNA is far less stable than DNA, especially when it reaches the cytoplasm of a cell
and is exposed to degrading enzymes. The presence of a hydroxyl group on the second
carbon of the sugar moiety in mRNA causes steric hinderance that prevents the mRNA from
forming the more stable double helix structure of DNA and thus makes the mRNA more
prone to hydrolytic degradation. As a result, until recently, it was widely believed that
mRNA was too labile to withstand transfection protocols.
 [0005]          Advances in RNA stabilizing modifications have sparked more interest in the
use of mRNA in place of plasmid DNA in gene therapy. Yet, in spite of increased stability of
modified mRNA, delivery of mRNA to cells in vivo in a manner allowing for therapeutic
levels of protein production is still a challenge, particularly for mRNA encoding full length
proteins. Some success has been achieved using viral vectors to introduce mRNA into a host,
however mRNA transfection using viral vectors can result in an adverse immune response.
In some circumstances, the viral vector may even integrate into the host genome. In addition,
production of clinical grade viral vectors is also expensive and time consuming. Targeting
delivery of the introduced genetic material using viral vectors can also be difficult to control.
 [0006]          Non-viral delivery of mRNA can be achieved using injection of naked nucleic
acids, polyplexes, lipoplexes or liposome entrapped mRNA, biolistic delivery via gene gun,
particulate carrier mediated delivery, and electroporation. Non-viral transfection or delivery
vehicles are generally less-toxic, less immunogenic, and easier and less expensive to prepare
than viral vectors for delivery of mRNA. Certain delivery vehicles, such as cationic lipid or
polymer delivery vehicles may also help protect the transfected mRNA from endogenous
RNases.

 WO 2013/185069                                                                PCT/US2013/044771
 [00071          Liposomal delivery of nucleic acids has been employed as a means of
effectuating the site-specific delivery of encapsulated plasmid DNA, antisense
oligonucleotides, short interfering RNA and microRNA-based therapies. However the
efficient, therapeutically effective, delivery of mRNAs to targeted cells and tissues, as well as
the subsequent transfection of such targeted cells and tissues remains a technical challenge,
particularly for delivery of mRNAs encoding full length proteins. It is important to design
liposomal delivery systems that provide sufficient stability to reach desired target cells and
the ability to efficiently release their encapsulated materials to such target cells to allow for
translation of functional protein at therapeutically effective levels.
 [0008]          Many cationic lipids that are employed to construct such liposomal-based
delivery vehicles are toxic to the targeted cells when used to deliver therapeutically effective
amounts of the encapsulated agent. Accordingly, the toxicity associated with cationic lipid
represents a significant obstacle to their general use as non-viral delivery vehicles,
particularly in the quantities necessary to successfully deliver therapeutically effective
amounts of mRNA to target cells.
 [0009]          To date, significant progress using mRNA gene therapy has been made in
applications, particularly for which low levels of translation has not been a limiting factor,
such as immunization with mRNA encoding antigens. Clinical trials involving vaccination
against tumor antigens by intradermal injection of naked or protamine-complexed mRNA
have demonstrated feasibility, lack of toxicity, and promising results. X. Su et al., Mol.
Pharmaceutics8:774-787 (2011). However, low levels of translation can restrict the
exploitation of mRNA based gene therapy in other applications which require higher levels of
sustained stability of the mRNA encoded protein to exert a prolonged biological or
therapeutic effect.
 [0010]          In addition, because mRNA gene therapy benefits are relatively transient as
compared to DNA based gene therapy, repeated administration, and typically by injection,
are often required to provide long term effects. Thus, more efficient transfection in vivo and
the ability to deliver mRNA noninvasively and/or to mucosal sites would improve the
prospects for successful application of mRNA gene therapy.

 [0011]         The present invention encompasses the surprising discovery that nanoparticle
based formulations of mRNA are able to translocate following pulmonary delivery, i.e., move
intact by either active or passive means from the lung to the systemic blood supply and
subsequently to be deposited in different non-lung cells or tissues, such as, e.g., the liver.
This translocation of the nanoparticle comprising an mRNA encoding a therapeutic protein,
such as, e.g., beta-galactosidase, constitutes non-invasive systemic delivery of an active
pharmaceutical ingredient beyond the lung to result in the production of a functional protein
to systemically accessible non-lung cells or tissues.

                                          DEFINITIONS
[0050]           In order for the present invention to be more readily understood, certain terms
are first defined below. Additional definitions for the following terms and other terms are set
forth throughout the specification.
[0051]           Amino acid: As used herein, term "amino acid," in its broadest sense, refers to
any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain. In some
embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H2N-C(H)(R)-COOH. In some
embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, an
amino acid is a synthetic amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is a d-amino acid;
in some embodiments, an amino acid is an 1-amino acid. "Standard amino acid" refers to any
of the twenty standard 1-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides.
"Nonstandard amino acid" refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids,
regardless of whether it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. As used
herein, "synthetic amino acid" encompasses chemically modified amino acids, including but
not limited to salts, amino acid derivatives (such as amides), and/or substitutions. Amino
acids, including carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acids in peptides, can be modified by
methylation, amidation, acetylation, protecting groups, and/or substitution with other
chemical groups that can change the peptide's circulating half-life without adversely
affecting their activity. Amino acids may participate in a disulfide bond. Amino acids may
comprise one or posttranslational modifications, such as association with one or more
chemical entities (e.g., methyl groups, acetate groups, acetyl groups, phosphate groups,
formyl moieties, isoprenoid groups, sulfate groups, polyethylene glycol moieties, lipid
moieties, carbohydrate moieties, biotin moieties, etc.). The term "amino acid" is used
interchangeably with "amino acid residue," and may refer to a free amino acid and/or to an
amino acid residue of a peptide. It will be apparent from the context in which the term is
used whether it refers to a free amino acid or a residue of a peptide.
[0052]           Animal: As used herein, the term "animal" refers to any member of the animal
kingdom. In some embodiments, "animal" refers to humans, at any stage of development. In
                                                 12

some embodiments, "animal" refers to non-human animals, at any stage of development. In
certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a
rabbit, a monkey, a dog, a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, and/or a pig). In some
embodiments, animals include, but are not limited to, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians,
fish, insects, and/or worms. In some embodiments, an animal may be a transgenic animal,
genetically-engineered animal, and/or a clone.
 [0053]          Approximately or about: As used herein, the term "approximately" or "about,"
as applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar to a stated
reference value. In certain embodiments, the term "approximately" or "about" refers to a
range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%,             12 %,
 110%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6 %, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2 %, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or
less than) of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the
context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value).
 [0054]          Dosing regimen: A "dosing regimen" (or "therapeutic regimen"), as that term
is used herein, is a set of unit doses (typically more than one) that are administered
individually to a subject, typically separated by periods of time. In some embodiments, a
given therapeutic agent has a recommended dosing regiment, which may involve one or more
doses. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen comprises a plurality of doses each of which
are separated from one another by a time period of the same length; in some embodiments, a
dosing regime comprises a plurality of doses and at least two different time periods
separating individual doses.
 [0055]          Expression: As used herein, "expression" of a nucleic acid sequence refers to
one or more of the following events: (1) production of an RNA template from a DNA
sequence (e.g., by transcription); (2) processing of an RNA transcript (e.g., by splicing,
editing, 5' cap formation, and/or 3' end formation); (3) translation of an RNA into a
polypeptide or protein; and/or (4) post-translational modification of a polypeptide or protein.
In this application, the terms "expression" and "production," and grammatical equivalent, are
used inter-changeably.
[0056]           Improve, increase,or reduce: As used herein, the terms "improve," "increase"
or "reduce," or grammatical equivalents, indicate values that are relative to a baseline
measurement, such as a measurement in the same individual prior to initiation of the
treatment described herein, or a measurement in a control subject (or multiple control subject)

in the absence of the treatment described herein. A "control subject" is a subject afflicted
with the same form of disease as the subject being treated, who is about the same age as the
subject being treated.
[0057]           In Vitro: As used herein, the term "in vitro" refers to events that occur in an
artificial environment, e.g., in a test tube or reaction vessel, in cell culture, etc., rather than
within a multi-cellular organism.
[0058]           In Vivo: As used herein, the term "in vivo" refers to events that occur within a
multi-cellular organism, such as a human and a non-human animal. In the context of cell
based systems, the term may be used to refer to events that occur within a living cell (as
opposed to, for example, in vitro systems).
[0059]           messenger RNA (mRNA): As used herein, the term "messenger RNA
(mRNA)" refers to a polynucleotide that encodes at least one polypeptide. mRNA as used
herein encompasses both modified and unmodified RNA. mRNA may contain one or more
coding and non-coding regions.
[0060]           Nucleic acid: As used herein, the term "nucleic acid," in its broadest sense,
refers to any compound and/or substance that is or can be incorporated into a polynucleotide
chain. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid is a compound and/or substance that is or can be
incorporated into a polynucleotide chain via a phosphodiester linkage. In some
embodiments, "nucleic acid" refers to individual nucleic acid residues (e.g., nucleotides
and/or nucleosides). In some embodiments, "nucleic acid" refers to a polynucleotide chain
comprising individual nucleic acid residues. In some embodiments, "nucleic acid"
encompasses RNA as well as single and/or double-stranded DNA and/or cDNA.
Furthermore, the terms "nucleic acid," "DNA," "RNA," and/or similar terms include nucleic
acid analogs, i.e., analogs having other than a phosphodiester backbone. For example, the so
called "peptide nucleic acids," which are known in the art and have peptide bonds instead of
phosphodiester bonds in the backbone, are considered within the scope of the present
invention. The term "nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence" includes all
nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and/or encode the same
amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and/or RNA may include
introns. Nucleic acids can be purified from natural sources, produced using recombinant
expression systems and optionally purified, chemically synthesized, etc. Where appropriate,
e.g., in the case of chemically synthesized molecules, nucleic acids can comprise nucleoside
                                                 14

 WO 2013/185069                                                               PCT/US2013/044771
analogs such as analogs having chemically modified bases or sugars, backbone
modifications, etc. A nucleic acid sequence is presented in the 5' to 3' direction unless
otherwise indicated. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid is or comprises natural
nucleosides (e.g., adenosine, thymidine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine, deoxyadenosine,
deoxythymidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine); nucleoside analogs (e.g., 2
aminoadenosine, 2-thiothymidine, inosine, pyrrolo-pyrimidine, 3-methyl adenosine, 5

oxoadenosine, 8-oxoguanosine, 0(6)-methylguanine, and 2-thiocytidine); chemically
modified bases; biologically modified bases (e.g., methylated bases); intercalated bases;
modified sugars (e.g., 2'-fluororibose, ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, arabinose, and hexose); and/or
modified phosphate groups (e.g., phosphorothioates and 5'-N-phosphoramidite linkages). In
some embodiments, the present invention is specifically directed to "unmodified nucleic
acids," meaning nucleic acids (e.g., polynucleotides and residues, including nucleotides
and/or nucleosides) that have not been chemically modified in order to facilitate or achieve
delivery.
[0061]            Patient: As used herein, the term "patient" or "subject" refers to any organism
to which a provided composition may be administered, e.g., for experimental, diagnostic,
prophylactic, cosmetic, and/or therapeutic purposes. Typical patients include animals (e.g.,

used herein, refers to substances that, within the scope of sound medical judgment, are
suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive
toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a
reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
[0063]            Polypeptide: As used herein, a "polypeptide", generally speaking, is a string
of at least two amino acids attached to one another by a peptide bond. In some embodiments,
a polypeptide may include at least 3-5 amino acids, each of which is attached to others by
way of at least one peptide bond. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
                                                  15

polypeptides sometimes include "non-natural" amino acids or other entities that nonetheless
are capable of integrating into a polypeptide chain, optionally.
 [0064]          Protein: As used herein, the term "protein" of "therapeutic protein" refers to a
polypeptide (i.e., a string of at least two amino acids linked to one another by peptide bonds).
Proteins may include moieties other than amino acids (e.g., may be glycoproteins,
proteoglycans, etc.) and/or may be otherwise processed or modified. Those of ordinary skill
in the art will appreciate that a "protein" can be a complete polypeptide chain as produced by
a cell (with or without a signal sequence), or can be a characteristic portion thereof. Those of
ordinary skill will appreciate that a protein can sometimes include more than one polypeptide
chain, for example linked by one or more disulfide bonds or associated by other means.
Polypeptides may contain -amino acids, d-amino acids, or both and may contain any of a
variety of amino acid modifications or analogs known in the art. Useful modifications
include, e.g., terminal acetylation, amidation, methylation, etc. In some embodiments,

and combinations thereof. The term "peptide" is generally used to refer to a polypeptide
having a length of less than about 100 amino acids, less than about 50 amino acids, less than
20 amino acids, or less than 10 amino acids. In some embodiments, proteins are antibodies,
antibody fragments, biologically active portions thereof, and/or characteristic portions
thereof.
 [0065]          Subject: As used herein, the term "subject" refers to a human or any non
human animal (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cattle, swine, sheep, horse or primate). A
human includes pre- and post-natal forms. In many embodiments, a subject is a human
being. A subject can be a patient, which refers to a human presenting to a medical provider
for diagnosis or treatment of a disease. The term "subject" is used herein interchangeably
with "individual" or "patient." A subject can be afflicted with or is susceptible to a disease or
disorder but may or may not display symptoms of the disease or disorder.
 [0066]          Therapeutically effective amount: As used herein, the term "therapeutically
effective amount" of a therapeutic agent means an amount that is sufficient, when
administered to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or
condition, to treat, diagnose, prevent, and/or delay the onset of the symptom(s) of the disease,
disorder, and/or condition. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a

therapeutically effective amount is typically administered via a dosing regimen comprising at
least one unit dose.
 [0067]         Treatment: As used herein, the term "treatment" (also "treat" or "treating")
refers to any administration of a substance (e.g., provided compositions) that partially or
completely alleviates, ameliorates, relives, inhibits, delays onset of, reduces severity of,
and/or reduces incidence of one or more symptoms, features, and/or causes of a particular
disease, disorder, and/or condition (e.g., influenza). Such treatment may be of a subject who
does not exhibit signs of the relevant disease, disorder and/or condition and/or of a subject
who exhibits only early signs of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. Alternatively or
additionally, such treatment may be of a subject who exhibits one or more established signs
of the relevant disease, disorder and/or condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be
of a subject who has been diagnosed as suffering from the relevant disease, disorder, and/or
condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be of a subject known to have one or more
susceptibility factors that are statistically correlated with increased risk of development of the
relevant disease, disorder, and/or condition.

mRNA and mRNA Synthesis
 [0070]          mRNAs according to the present invention may be synthesized according to
any of a variety of known methods. For example, mRNAs according to the present invention
may be synthesized via in vitro transcription (IVT). Briefly, IVT is typically performed with
a linear or circular DNA template containing a promoter, a pool of ribonucleotide
triphosphates, a buffer system that may include DTT and magnesium ions, and an appropriate
RNA polymerase (e.g., T3, T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase), DNAse I, pyrophosphatase, and/or
RNAse inhibitor. The exact conditions will vary according to the specific application.
 [0071]          In some embodiments, for the preparation of mRNA according to the
invention, a DNA template is transcribed in vitro. A suitable DNA template typically has a
promoter, for example a T3, T7 or SP6 promoter, for in vitro transcription, followed by
desired nucleotide sequence for a desired mRNA and a termination signal.
 [0072]          Desired mRNA sequence according to the invention may be determined and
incorporated into a DNA template using standard methods. For example, starting from a
desired amino acid sequence a virtual reverse translation is carried out based on the
degenerated genetic code. Optimization algorithms may then be used for selection of suitable
codons. Typically, the G/C content can be optimized to achieve the highest possible G/C
content on one hand, taking into the best possible account the frequency of the tRNAs
according to codon usage on the other hand. The optimized RNA sequence can be

to calculate stabilizing and destabilizing properties or, respectively, regions of the RNA.
 [0073]          mRNA according to the present invention may be synthesized as unmodified
or modified mRNA. In some embodiments, the mRNA may include one or more chemical or
structural modifications to abrogate mRNA interaction with toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7,
TLR8, and retinoid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) to reduce immunogenicity as well as improve
stability of the mRNA.
 [0074]          For example, in certain embodiments, the mRNA may be modified as
described in U.S. patent publication 2009/0286852 (incorporated herein by reference), to
comprise one or more pseudouridine residues. Kormann et al., Nature Biotechnology

TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and RIG-I and increase stability of the mRNA. See EP245923 1. In yet
other embodiments, the mRNA may be modified to reduce immunogenicity as described in
European Application EP10742089 (incorporated herein by reference).
[0075]           In other embodiments, modifications of mRNA can include, for example,
modifications of the nucleotides of the RNA. An modified mRNA according to the invention
can thus include, for example, backbone modifications, sugar modifications or base
modifications. In some embodiments, mRNAs encoding a protein of interest may be
synthesized from naturally occurring nucleotides and/or nucleotide analogues (modified
nucleotides) including, but not limited to, purines (adenine (A), guanine (G)) or pyrimidines

 [0076]          In some embodiments, mRNAs may contain RNA backbone modifications.
Typically, a backbone modification is a modification in which the phosphates of the
backbone of the nucleotides contained in the RNA are modified chemically. Exemplary
backbone modifications typically include, but are not limited to, modifications from the
group consisting of methylphosphonates, methylphosphoramidates, phosphoramidates,
phosphorothioates (e.g. cytidine 5'-O-(1-thiophosphate)), boranophosphates, positively
charged guanidinium groups etc., which means by replacing the phosphodiester linkage by
other anionic, cationic or neutral groups.
 [0077]          In some embodiments, mRNAs may contain sugar modifications. A typical
sugar modification is a chemical modification of the sugar of the nucleotides it contains
including, but not limited to, sugar modifications chosen from the group consisting of 2'
deoxy-2'-fluoro-oligoribonucleotide (2'-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, 2'-fluoro-2'
deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate), 2'-deoxy-2'-deamine-oligoribonucleotide (2'-amino-2'
deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, 2'-amino-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate), 2'-0
alkyloligoribonucleotide, 2'-deoxy-2'-C-alkyloligoribonucleotide (2'-O-methylcytidine 5'
triphosphate, 2'-methyluridine 5'-triphosphate), 2'-C-alkyloligoribonucleotide, and isomers
thereof (2'-aracytidine 5'-triphosphate, 2'-arauridine 5'-triphosphate), or azidotriphosphates
(2'-azido-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, 2'-azido-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate).
 [0078]          In some embodiments, mRNAs may contain modifications of the bases of the
nucleotides (base modifications). A modified nucleotide which contains a base modification
is also called a base-modified nucleotide. Exemples of such base-modified nucleotides
include, but are not limited to, 2-amino-6-chloropurine riboside 5'-triphosphate, 2

 [0079]         In certain embodiments, stabilizing modifications may be made to either or
both the 3' and 5' ends of the mRNA and include, e.g., end capping, polyA tail, replacement
of unstable non-coding sequences (such as adenylate uridylate rich elements (AREs) or
addition or 3' or 5' untranslated sequences from stable mRNA (such as, e.g., p-globin, actin,
GAPDH, tubulin, histone, or citric acid cycle enzyme mRNA). Stabilizing modifications
may also be made within the mRNA, and include, e.g., codon optimization and/or
modification of the Kozak sequence. and/or incorporation of modified nucleosides (such as,
e.g., pyrrolo-pyrimidine, C5-iodouridine, 2-amino adenosine, and 2-thiothymidine). In
certain embodiments, the modified mRNA used in the methods and compositions of the
invention include a 5' untranslated sequence from CMV immediate-early 1 (IEl) gene:

CGUGCCAAGAGUGACUCACCGUCCUUGACACG,                           wherein X, if present is GGA (SEQ
ID NO:1), or a sequence that is at least 90% or at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO:1, or a
and/or a 3'untranslated sequence from human growth hormone (hGH) gene:

NO:2), or a sequence that is at least 90% or at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO:2, to
improve the nuclease resistance and/or improve the half-life of the mRNA. In addition to
increasing the stability of the mRNA polynucleotide sequence, it has been surprisingly
discovered the inclusion of the untranslated sequence of CMV immediate-early 1 (IEl) gene
and/or the untranslated sequence from the hGH gene further enhances the translation of the
mRNA.
 [0080]         Typically, mRNA synthesis includes the addition of a "cap" on the N-terminal
(5') end, and a "tail" on the C-terminal (3') end. The presence of the cap is important in
providing resistance to nucleases found in most eukaryotic cells. The presence of a "tail"
serves to protect the mRNA from exonuclease degradation.
 [0081]         Thus, in some embodiments, mRNAs of the current invention include a 5' cap
structure. A 5' cap is typically added as follows: first, an RNA terminal phosphatase
                                               21

 WO 2013/185069                                                              PCT/US2013/044771
removes one of the terminal phosphate groups from the 5' nucleotide, leaving two terminal
phosphates; guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is then added to the terminal phosphates via a
guanylyl transferase, producing a 5'5'5 triphosphate linkage; and the 7-nitrogen of guanine is
then methylated by a methyltransferase. Examples of cap structures include, but are not
limited to, m7G(5')ppp (5'(A,G(5')ppp(5')A and G(5')ppp(5')G.
 [0082]          In some embodiments, mRNAs of the current invention include a 3' poly(A)
tail structure. A poly-A tail on the 3' terminus of mRNA typically includes about 10 to 300
adenosine nucleotides (e.g., about 10 to 200 adenosine nucleotides, about 10 to 150
adenosine nucleotides, about 10 to 100 adenosine nucleotides, about 20 to 70 adenosine
nucleotides, or about 20 to 60 adenosine nucleotides). In some embodiments, mRNAs of the
current invention include a 3' poly(C) tail structure. A suitable poly-C tail on the 3' terminus
of mRNA typically include about 10 to 200 cytosine nucleotides (e.g., about 10 to 150
cytosine nucleotides, about 10 to 100 cytosine nucleotides, about 20 to 70 cytosine
nucleotides, about 20 to 60 cytosine nucleotides, or about 10 to 40 cytosine nucleotides). The
poly-C tail may be added to the poly-A tail or may substitute the poly-A tail.
 [0083]          In some embodiments, mRNAs of the current invention include a 5' and/or 3'
untranslated region. In some embodiments, a 5' untranslated region includes one or more
elements that affect an mRNA's stability or translation, for example, an iron responsive
element. In some embodiments, a 5' untranslated region may be between about 50 and 500
nucleotides in length.
 [0084]          In some embodiments, a 3' untranslated region includes one or more of a
polyadenylation signal, a binding site for proteins that affect an mRNA's stability of location
in a cell, or one or more binding sites for miRNAs. In some embodiments, a 3' untranslated
region may be between 50 and 500 nucleotides in length or longer.

 [0085]          The mRNAs used in the compositions and methods of the invention may be
used to express full length, truncated, native or modified protein for delivery to non-lung
tissue and cells. In some embodiments, the mRNA comprises at least one mRNA species
encoding a protein (i.e. a therapeutic protein). In some embodiments, the mRNA comprises a

in a single transcript. In some embodiments, the mRNA encodes a chimeric protein, in which
one or more protein sequences which are not naturally associated with the native protein are
linked by a peptide bond in the resulting chimeric protein during expression. In some
embodiments, the mRNA may be used to express a partial or full length protein comprising
cellular activity at a level equal to or greater than that of the native protein. In some
embodiments, the mRNA may be used to express a partial or full length protein with cellular
activity at a level equal to or less than that of the native protein.
[0086]           In some embodiments the mRNA encodes an intracellular protein. In some
embodiments, the mRNA encodes a cytosolic protein. In some embodiments, the mRNA
encodes a protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton. In some embodiments, the mRNA
encodes a protein associated with the plasma membrane. In some specific embodiments, the

some embodiments, the mRNA encodes a nuclear protein. In some specific embodiments, the
mRNA encodes a transcription factor. In some embodiments, the mRNA encodes a
chaperone protein. In some embodiments, the mRNA encodes an intracellular enzyme (e.g.,

metabolism, DNA repair, transcription and/or translation. In some embodiments, the mRNA
encodes an extracellular protein. In some embodiments, the mRNA encodes a protein
associated with the extracellular matrix. In some embodiments the mRNA encodes a
secreted protein. In specific embodiments, the mRNA used in the composition and methods
of the invention may be used to express functional proteins or enzymes that are excreted or
secreted by one or more target cells into the surrounding extracellular fluid (e.g., mRNA
encoding hormones and neurotransmitters)
[0087]           In some embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention provide
for delivery of mRNA encoding a secreted protein. In some embodiments, the compositions
and methods of the invention provide for delivery of mRNA encoding one or more secreted

 [0096]         In certain embodiments, the mRNA used in the compositions and methods of
the invention may encode an antibody. In some embodiments, the mRNA may encode a
protein that is made up of subunits that are encoded by more than one gene. For example, the
protein may be a heterodimer, wherein each chain or subunit of the is encoded by a separate
gene. Alternatively, a single mRNA may be engineered to encode more than one subunit. In
one embodiment, the mRNA may encode full length antibodies (both heavy and light chains

of the variable and constant regions) or fragments of antibodies (e.g. Fab, Fv, or a single
chain Fv (scFv) to confer immunity to a subject.
 [0097]         As used herein, the term "heavy chain" encompasses all types of naturally
occurring heavy chains of different classes of immunoglobulins, including but not limited to,
IgM(p), IgD (s), IgG(7), IgA(a.), and IgE(c), and biologically active variants thereof.
Typically, a heavy chain according to the present invention contains the N-terminal variable
region responsible for antigen recognition, typically including CDR 1, CDR 2 and CDR 3,
separated by four framework regions (FRI, FR2, FR2, and FR4). Typically, the N-terminal
variable region contains about 100 to 110 or more amino acids. In some embodiments, a
heavy chain according to the present invention contains one or more of constant domains
(e.g., CHi, CH2 , and/or CH3 ). In some embodiments, an mRNA encoding a heavy chain of
an antibody is of or greater than 0.3 kb, 0.5 kb, 0.75 kb, 1.0 kb, 1.25 kb, 1.5 kb, 1.75 kb, 2.0
kb, 2.5 kb, 3.0 kb, 3.5 kb, 4.0 kb in length.
 [0098]         As used herein, the term "light chain" encompasses all types of naturally
occurring light chains of different classes of immunoglobulins, including but not limited to     K
or 1 isotypes, and biologically active variants thereof. Typically, a light chain according to
the present invention comprises an N-terminal variable domain (VL). In some embodiments,
a light chain according to the present invention contains a C-terminal constant domain (CL).
In some embodiments, an mRNA encoding a light chain of an antibody is of or greater than
0.1 kb, 0.2 kb, 0.3 kb, 0.4 kb, 0.5 kb, 0.6 kb, 0.7 kb, 0.8 kb, 0.9 kb, 1.0 kb, 1.25 kb, 1.5 kb,
 1.75 kb, 2.0 kb, 2.5 kb, or 3.0 kb in length.
 [0099]         According to the present invention, a heavy chain and light chain of an
antibody may be encoded and delivered by a single mRNA or separate mRNAs. It is
contemplated that it may be advantageous to deliver heavy chain encoding mRNA and light
chain encoding mRNA at varying ratios in order to optimize production of fully assembled
functional antibodies.
 [0100]         In some embodiments, the mRNA may additionally encode one or more
secretory leader sequences which are operably linked to and direct secretion of an antibody,
antibody fragment(s), or other protein(s). Suitable secretory leader sequences are described,
for example, in US 2008/0286834 Al. While one embodiment of the present invention relates
to methods and compositions useful for conferring immunity to a subject (e.g., via the
translation of mRNA encoding functional antibodies), the inventions disclosed herein and
                                                88

 WO 2013/185069                                                                  PCT/US2013/044771
contemplated hereby are broadly applicable. In an alternative embodiment the compositions
of the present invention encode antibodies that may be used to transiently or chronically
effect a functional response in subjects. For example, the mRNA of the present invention
may encode a functional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody, which upon translation and
secretion from target cell may be useful for targeting and/or inactivating a biological target
(e.g., a stimulatory cytokine such as tumor necrosis factor).
Lipid Carrier Vehicles
 [0101]          The use of lipid carrier vehicles to facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids to
target cells is contemplated by the present invention. Lipid carrier vehicles (e.g., liposomes
and lipid-derived nanoparticles) are generally useful in a variety of applications in research,
industry, and medicine, particularly for their use as transfer vehicles of diagnostic or
therapeutic compounds in vivo (Lasic, Trends Biotechnol., 16: 307-321, 1998; Drummond et
al., Pharmacol. Rev., 51: 691-743, 1999) and are usually characterized as microscopic
vesicles having an interior aqua space sequestered from an outer medium by a membrane of
one or more bilayers. Bilayer membranes of liposomes are typically formed by amphiphilic
molecules, such as lipids of synthetic or natural origin that comprise spatially separated
hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains (Lasic, Trends Biotechnol., 16: 307-321, 1998).
Bilayer membranes of the liposomes can also be formed by amphiphilic polymers and
surfactants (e.g., polymerosomes, niosomes, etc.).
 [0102]          In the context of the present invention, a lipid carrier vehicle typically serves
to transport mRNA to a target cell. One unexpected and advantageous feature of the current
invention, was the observation that pulmonary administration of mRNA, which is
encapsulated within a lipid carrier vehicle, results in delivery of mRNA and/or the protein to
non-lung tissue and cells. For the purposes of the present invention, the liposomal transfer
vehicles are prepared to contain the desired nucleic acids. The process of incorporation of a
desired entity (e.g., a nucleic acid) into a liposome is often referred to as "loading" (Lasic, et
al., FEBS Lett., 312: 255-258, 1992). The liposome-incorporated nucleic acids may be
completely or be partially located in the interior space of the liposome, within the bilayer
membrane of the liposome, or associated with the exterior surface of the liposome membrane.
The incorporation of a nucleic acid into liposomes is also referred to herein as
                                                 89

 WO 2013/185069                                                               PCT/US2013/044771
"encapsulation" wherein the nucleic acid is entirely contained within the interior space of the
liposome. The purpose of incorporating a mRNA into a transfer vehicle, such as a liposome,
is often to protect the nucleic acid from an environment which may contain enzymes or
chemicals that degrade nucleic acids and/or systems or receptors that cause the rapid
excretion of the nucleic acids. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present invention,
the selected transfer vehicle is capable of enhancing the stability of the mRNA contained
therein. The liposome can allow the encapsulated mRNA to reach the target cell and/or may
preferentially allow the encapsulated mRNA to reach non-lung tissue and cells, following
pulmonary delivery.
 [0103]          In some embodiments, a suitable lipid carrier vehicle is formulated as a lipid
nanoparticle. As used herein, the phrase "lipid nanoparticle" and "lipid carrier vehicle" and
"lipid-derived nanoparticle" are all used interchangeably, and refer to a delivery vehicle
comprising one or more lipids (e.g., cationic lipids, non-cationic lipids, cholesterol-based
lipids, and PEG-modified lipids). The contemplated lipid nanoparticles may be prepared by
including multi-component lipid mixtures of varying ratios employing one or more cationic
lipids, non-cationic lipids, cholesterol-based lipids, and PEG-modified lipids. Examples of
suitable lipids include, for example, the phosphatidyl compounds (e.g., phosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingolipids,
cerebrosides, and gangliosides).
 [0104]          Cationic liposome/mRNA complexes can help to protect mRNA from
enzymatic degradation and facilitate intracellular delivery by interacting with the negatively
charged cell membrane. However, the cationic surface of these lipoplexes also mediates
strong interactions with negatively charged proteins that serve to reduce the half-life of the
lipoplexes in vivo. This effect may be reduced by employing one or more of a mechanism to
reduce the interaction between the cationic liposome/mRNA complex and negatively charged
proteins. In most embodiments, the delivery vehicles used in the compositions and methods
of the invention comprise nanoparticles constructed from a combination of one or more
cationic lipids, non-cationic lipids, such as neutral or helper lipids, and PEG-modified lipids.

 [01061          In some embodiments, a suitable delivery vehicle is formulated as a lipid
nanoparticle. Lipid nanoparticles of the current invention comprise one or more lipids (e.g.,
cationic lipids, non-cationic lipids, cholesterol-based lipids, and PEG-modified lipids). Also
contemplated is the use of polymers as transfer vehicles, whether alone or in combination
with other delivery vehicles. In some embodiments, the delivery vehicle is selected based
upon its ability to facilitate pulmonary delivery and translocation to non-lung tissue.
 [0107]          As used herein, liposomal delivery vehicles, e.g. lipid nanoparticles, are
usually characterized as microscopic vesicles having an interior aqua space sequestered from
an outer medium by a membrane of one or more bilayers. Bilayer membranes of liposomes
are typically formed by amphiphilic molecules, such as lipids of synthetic or natural origin
that comprise spatially separated hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains (Lasic, Trends
Biotechnol., 16: 307-321, 1998). Bilayer membranes of the liposomes can also be formed by
amphophilic polymers and surfactants (e.g., polymerosomes, niosomes, etc.). In the context
of the present invention, a liposomal delivery vehicle typically serves to transport a desired
mRNA to a target tissue. The incorporation of a nucleic acid into liposomes is also referred
to herein as "encapsulation" wherein the nucleic acid is entirely contained within the interior
space of the liposome. The purpose of incorporating a mRNA into a transfer vehicle, such as
a liposome, is often to protect the nucleic acid from an environment which may contain
enzymes or chemicals that degrade nucleic acids and/or systems or receptors that cause the
rapid excretion of the nucleic acids. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a suitable delivery
vehicle is capable of enhancing the stability of the mRNA contained therein and/or facilitate
the delivery of mRNA to the target cell or tissue.
 [0108]          In certain embodiments of the invention, the carrier is formulated using a
polymer as a carrier, alone or in combination with other carriers. Suitable polymers may
include, for example, polyacrylates, polyalkycyanoacrylates, polylactide, polylactide
polyglycolide copolymers, polycaprolactones, dextran, albumin, gelatin, alginate, collagen,
chitosan, cyclodextrins, protamine, PEGylated protamine, PLL, PEGylated PLL and
polyethylenimine (PEI). When PEI is present, it may be branched PEI of a molecular weight
ranging from 10 to 40 kDA, e.g., 25 kDa branched PEI (Sigma #408727).
 [0109]          In some embodiments, a suitable delivery vehicle contains a cationic lipid. As
used herein, the phrase "cationic lipid" refers to any of a number of lipid species that have a
net positive charge at a selected pH, such as physiological pH. Several cationic lipids have
                                                91

been described in the literature, many of which are commercially available. Particularly
suitable cationic lipids for use in the compositions and methods of the invention include those
described in international patent publications WO 2010/053572 (and particularly, CI 2-200
described at paragraph [00225]) and WO 2012/170930, both of which are incorporated herein

combined with the neutral lipid, dioleoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine or "DOPE" or other
cationic or non-cationic lipids into a liposomal transfer vehicle or a lipid nanoparticle, and

 [0113]         In some embodiments, a suitable delivery vehicle contains one or more non
cationic lipids, In some embodiments, a non-cationic lipid is a neutral lipid, i.e., a lipid that
does not carry a net charge in the conditions under which the composition is formulated
and/or administered. Such exemplary non-cationic or neutral lipids can be chosen from
DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3
phosphocholine), DOPE (1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), DPPE (1,2
dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), DMPE (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3
phosphoethanolamine), DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(l'-rac-glycerol)), and
cholesterol.
 [0114]         The use of cholesterol-based cationic lipids is also contemplated by the
present invention. Such cholesterol-based cationic lipids can be used, either alone or in
combination with other cationic or non-cationic lipids. Suitable cholesterol-based cationic
lipids include, for example, DC-Choi (N,N-dimethyl-N-ethylcarboxamidocholesterol), 1,4
bis(3-N-oleylamino-propyl)piperazine (Gao, et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 179, 280
(1991); Wolf et al. BioTechniques 23, 139 (1997); U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,335), or ICE.
 [0115]         In other embodiments, suitable lipid nanoparticles comprising one or more
cleavable lipids, such as, for example, one or more cationic lipids or compounds that
comprise a cleavable disulfide (S-S) functional group (e.g., HGT4001, HGT4002, HGT4003,
HGT4004 and HGT4005), as further described in U.S. Provisional Application No:
61/494,745, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their

 [0116]         In addition, several reagents are commercially available to enhance
transfection efficacy. Suitable examples include LIPOFECTIN (DOTMA:DOPE)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), LIPOFECTA INE (DOSPA:DOPE) (Invitrogen),
LIPOFECTAMINE2000. (Invitrogen), FUGENE, TRANSFECTAM (DOGS), and

 [01171          In some embodiments, the cationic lipid may comprise a molar ratio of about
 1% to about 90%, about 2% to about 70%, about 5% to about 50%, about 10% to about 40%
of the total lipid present in the transfer vehicle, or preferably about 20% to about 70% of the
total lipid present in the transfer vehicle.
 [0118]          The use of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified phospholipids and derivatized
lipids such as derivatized cerarmides (PEG-CER), including N-Octanoyl-Sphingosine-l
[Succinyl(Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol)-2000] (C8 PEG-2000 ceramide) is also
contemplated by the present invention, either alone or preferably in combination with other
lipids together which comprise the transfer vehicle (e.g., a lipid nanoparticle). Contemplated
PEG-modified lipids include, but is not limited to, a polyethylene glycol chain of up to 5 kDa
in length covalently attached to a lipid with alkyl chain(s) of C6-C20 length. The addition of
such components may prevent complex aggregation and may also provide a means for
increasing circulation lifetime and increasing the delivery of the lipid-nucleic acid
composition to the target cell, (Klibanov et al. (1990) FEBS Letters, 268 (1): 235-237), or
they may be selected to rapidly exchange out of the formulation in vivo (see U.S. Pat. No.
5,885,613).
 [0119]          Particularly useful exchangeable lipids are PEG-ceramides having shorter acyl
chains (e.g., C14 or C 18). The PEG-modified phospholipid and derivitized lipids of the
present invention may comprise a molar ratio from about 0% to about 20%, about 0 .5 % to
about 2 0%, about 1% to about 15%, about 4% to about 10%, or about 2 % of the total lipid
present in the liposomal transfer vehicle.
 [0120]          The present invention also contemplates the use of non-cationic lipids. As
used herein, the phrase "non-cationic lipid" refers to any neutral, zwitterionic or anionic lipid.
As used herein, the phrase "anionic lipid" refers to any of a number of lipid species that carry
a net negative charge at a selected H, such as physiological pH. Non-cationic lipids include,
but are not limited to, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
(DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG),
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE),
palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine
(POPE), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-l
carboxylate (DOPE-mal), dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DPPE),
dimyristoylphosphoethanolamine (DMPE), distearoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DSPE),

 16-0-monomethyl PE, 16-0-dimethyl PE, 18-1-trans PE, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl
phosphatidyethanolamine (SOPE), cholesterol, or a mixture thereof. Such non-cationic lipids
may be used alone, but are preferably used in combination with other excipients, for example,
cationic lipids. When used in combination with a cationic lipid, the non-cationic lipid may
comprise a molar ratio of 5% to about 90%, or preferably about 10 % to about 70% of the
total lipid present in the transfer vehicle.
 [0121]          In particular embodiments, a suitable transfer vehicle (e.g., a lipid
nanoparticle) is prepared by combining multiple lipid and/or polymer components. For
example, a transfer vehicle may be prepared using C12-200, DOPE, chol, DMG-PEG2K at a
molar ratio of 40:30:25:5, or DODAP, DOPE, cholesterol, DMG-PEG2K at a molar ratio of
 18:56:20:6, or HGT5000, DOPE, chol, DMG-PEG2K at a molar ratio of 40:20:35:5, or
HGT5001, DOPE, chol, DMG-PEG2K at a molar ratio of 40:20:35:5. The selection of
cationic lipids, non-cationic lipids and/or PEG-modified lipids which comprise the lipid
nanoparticle, as well as the relative molar ratio of such lipids to each other, is based upon the
characteristics of the selected lipid(s), the nature of the intended target cells, the
characteristics of the mRNA to be delivered. Additional considerations include, for example,
the saturation of the alkyl chain, as well as the size, charge, pH, pKa, fusogenicity and
toxicity of the selected lipid(s). Thus the molar ratios may be adjusted accordingly. For
example, in embodiments, the percentage of cationic lipid in the lipid nanoparticle may be
greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 30%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%,
greater than 60%, or greater than 70%. The percentage of non-cationic lipid in the lipid
nanoparticle may be greater than 5%, greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 30%,
or greater than 40%. The percentage of cholesterol in the lipid nanoparticle may be greater
than 10%, greater than 2 0%, greater than 3 0%, or greater than 4 0%. The percentage of PEG
modified lipid in the lipid nanoparticle may be greater than 1%, greater than 2%, greater than
5%, greater than 10%, or greater than 20%.
 [0122]          In certain embodiments, suitable lipid nanoparticles of the invention comprise
at least one of the following cationic lipids: C12-200, HGT4003, HGT5000, HGT5001, RE
 1, RE-2, RE3, GL-67 and ICE. In some specific embodiments, a suitable lipid nanopartical is
formulated without using the cationic lipid GL-67. In some embodiments, suitable transfer
vehicle comprises cholesterol and/or a PEG-modified lipid. In some embodiments, suitable
transfer vehicles comprises DMG-PEG2K. In some embodiments, suitable transfer vehicle

 [01231          The lipid carrier vehicles for use in the compositions of the invention can be
prepared by various techniques which are presently known in the art. Multilamellar vesicles
(MLV) may be prepared conventional techniques, for example, by depositing a selected lipid
on the inside wall of a suitable container or vessel by dissolving the lipid in an appropriate
solvent, and then evaporating the solvent to leave a thin film on the inside of the vessel or by
spray drying. An aqueous phase may then added to the vessel with a vortexing motion which
results in the formation of MLVs. Uni-lamellar vesicles (ULV) can then be formed by
homogenization, sonication or extrusion of the multi-lamellar vesicles. In addition,
unilamellar vesicles can be formed by detergent removal techniques.
 [0124]          In certain embodiments of this invention, the compositions of the present
invention comprise a transfer vehicle wherein the mRNA is associated on both the surface of
the transfer vehicle and encapsulated within the same transfer vehicle. For example, during
preparation of the compositions of the present invention, cationic liposomal transfer vehicles
may associate with the mRNA through electrostatic interactions. For example, during
preparation of the compositions of the present invention, cationic liposomal transfer vehicles
may associate with the mRNA through electrostatic interactions.
 [0125]          In some embodiments, the compositions and methods of the invention
comprise mRNA encapsulated in a lipid carrier vehicle. In some embodiments, the one or
more mRNA species may be encapsulated in the same lipid carrier vehicle. In some
embodiments, the one or more mRNA species may be encapsulated in different lipid carrier
vehicles. In some embodiments, the mRNA is encapsulated in one or more lipid carrier
vehicles, which differ in their lipid composition, molar ratio of lipid components, size, charge
(Zeta potential), targeting ligands and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the
one or more lipid carrier vehicles may have a different composition of cationic lipids, neutral
lipid, PEG-modified lipid and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments the one or
more lipid carrier vehicles may have a different molar ratio of cationic lipid, neutral lipid,
cholesterol and PEG-modified lipid used to create the lipid carrier vehicle.

Delivery Methods
 [0126]          The route of delivery used in the methods of the invention allows for non
invasive, self-administration of the therapeutic compositions of the invention. The methods
of the invention involve intratracheal or pulmonary administration by aerosolization,
nebulization, or instillation of compositions comprising mRNA encoding a therapeutic
protein in a suitable transfection or lipid carrier vehicles as described above.

capable of functioning as a biological depot or reservoir for production and secretion of the
protein encoded by the mRNA, applicants have discovered that administration of the
compositions of the invention to the lung via aerosolization, nebulization, or instillation
results in the distribution of even non-secreted proteins outside the lung cells. Without
wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is contemplated that nanoparticle
compositions of the invention pass, through the lung airway-blood barrier, resulting in
translation of the intact nanoparticle to non-lung cells and tissues, such as, e.g., the heart, the
liver, the spleen, where it results in the production of the encoded protein in these non-lung
tissues. Thus, the utility of the compositions and methods of the invention extend beyond
production of therapeutic protein in lung cells and tissues of the lung and can be used to
delivery to non-lung target cells and/or tissues They are useful in the management and
treatment of a large number of diseases, and in particular peripheral diseases which result
from both secreted and non-secreted protein and/or enzyme deficiencies (e.g., one or more
lysosomal storage disorders). In certain embodiments, the compositions of the invention,
used in the methods of the invention result in the distribution of the mRNA encapsulated
nanoparticles and production of the encoded protein in the liver, spleen, heart, and/or other
non-lung cells. For example, administration of the compositions of the present inventions,
such as, e.g., a nanoparticle comprising mRNA encoding beta galactosidase (a non-secreted
protein), by aerosolization, nebulization, or instillation to the lung will result in the
composition itself and its protein product (e.g., functional beta galactosidase protein) will be
detectable in both the local cells and tissues of the lung, as well as in peripheral target cells,
tissues and organs as a result of translocation of the mRNA and delivery vehicle to non-lung
cells.

 [0128]           In certain embodiments, the compositions of the invention may be employed
in the methods of the invention to specifically target peripheral cells or tissues. Following the
pulmonary delivery, it is contemplated that the compositions of the invention cross the lung
airway-blood barrier and distribute into cells other than the local lung cells. Accordingly, the
compositions disclosed herein may be administered to a subject by way of the pulmonary
route of administration, using a variety of approach known by those skilled in the art (e.g., by
inhalation), and distribute to both the local target cells and tissues of the lung, as well as in
peripheral non-lung cells and tissues (e.g., cells of the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, skeletal
muscle, lymph nodes, brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma). As a result, both the local cells
of the lung and the peripheral non-lung cells can serve as biological reservoirs or depots
capable of producing and/or secreting a translation product encoded by one or more
polynucleotides. Accordingly, the present inventions are not limited to the treatment of lung
diseases or conditions, but rather can be used as a non-invasive means of facilitating the
delivery of polynucleotides, or the production of enzymes and proteins encoded thereby, in
peripheral organs, tissues and cells (e.g., hepatocytes) which would otherwise be achieved
only by systemic administration. Exemplary peripheral non-lung cells include, but are not
limited to, hepatocytes, epithelial cells, hematopoietic cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells,
bone cells, stem cells, mesenchymal cells, neural cells, cardiac cells, adipocytes, vascular
smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, beta cells, pituitary cells,
synovial lining cells, ovarian cells, testicular cells, fibroblasts, B cells, T cells, reticulocytes,
leukocytes, granulocytes and tumor cells.
 [0129]           Following administration of the composition to the subject, the protein product
encoded by the mRNA (e.g., a functional protein or enzyme) is detectable in the peripheral
target tissues for at least about one to seven days or longer following administration of the
composition to the subject. The amount of protein product necessary to achieve a therapeutic
effect will vary depending on the condition being treated, the protein encoded, and the
condition of the patient. For example, the protein product may be detectable in the peripheral
target tissues at a concentration (e.g., a therapeutic concentration) of at least 0.025-1.5 pg/ml
(e.g., at least 0.050 pg/ml, at least 0.075 pg/ml, at least 0.1 pg/ml, at least 0.2 pg/ml, at least

 [0130]         It has been demonstrated that nucleic acids can be delivered to the lungs by
intratracheal administration of a liquid suspension of the nucleic acid composition and
inhalation of an aerosol mist produced by a liquid nebulizer or the use of a dry powder
apparatus such as that described in U.S. patent 5,780,014, incorporated herein by reference.
 [0131]         In certain embodiments, the compositions of the invention may be formulated
such that they may be aerosolized or otherwise delivered as a particulate liquid or solid prior
to or upon administration to the subject. Such compositions may be administered with the
assistance of one or more suitable devices for administering such solid or liquid particulate
compositions (such as, e.g., an aerosolized aqueous solution or suspension) to generate
particles that are easily respirable or inhalable by the subject. In some embodiments, such
devices (e.g., a metered dose inhaler, jet-nebulizer, ultrasonic nebulizer, dry-powder-inhalers,
propellant-based inhaler or an insufflator) facilitate the administration of a predetermined
mass, volume or dose of the compositions (e.g., about 0.5 mg/kg of mRNA per dose) to the
subject. For example, in certain embodiments, the compositions of the invention are
administered to a subject using a metered dose inhaler containing a suspension or solution
comprising the composition and a suitable propellant. In certain embodiments, the
compositions of the invention may be formulated as a particulate powder (e.g., respirable dry
particles) intended for inhalation. In certain embodiments, compositions of the invention
formulated as respirable particles are appropriately sized such that they may be respirable by
the subject or delivered using a suitable device (e.g., a mean D50 or D90 particle size less
than about 500pm, 400pm, 300pm, 250pm, 200pm, 150pm, 100pm, 75pm, 50Pm, 25pm,

Example 1: Comparison of unmodified and modified mRNA in naked form or in
               nanoparticles by intratrachael administration
[0132]          Overview: Mice were intratracheally (IT) sprayed either with unmodified or
modified mRNA (25% of both cytidine-5'-triphosphate and uridine-5'-triphosphate were
replaced by 5-methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate and 2-thiouridine-5'-triphosphate, respectively)
coding for firefly luciferase (FFL) either in naked form or encapsulated in lipid based
nanoparticles (NPs) for single dose administration. Luciferase production was measured by
in vivo Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) at different time points post IT spray. Organs from
mice treated with C12-200 based NPs at a dose amounting to 20 pg/mouse were prepared for
histopathological analysis. To assess biodistribution of complexes post IT spray, in vitro
luciferase production was measured in the organs prepared from the euthanized mice treated
with doses corresponding to 5 and 10 pg C 12-200 based NPs per mouse.

[0133]          Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation: Aliquots of 50 mg/mL ethanolic solutions of
C12-200, DOPE, Choleterol, and DMG-PEG2000 were mixed in a molar ratio of 40:30:25:5,
respectively, and diluted with ethanol to 3 mL final volume. Separately, an aqueous buffered
solution (10 mM citrate/150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5) of FFL or modified FFL mRNA was
prepared from a 1 mg/mL stock. The lipid solution was injected rapidly into the aqueous

mRNA solution and shaken to yield a final suspension in 20% ethanol. The resulting
nanoparticle suspension was filtered, diafiltrated with Ix PBS (pH 7.4), concentrated and
stored at 2-8'C.
[0134]         Messenger RNA was synthesized via in vitro transcription process using a
cDNA template encoding FFL protein with predetermined untranslated regions. The
resulting RNA construct was processed further incorporating a Cap 1 structure on the 5' end
and a poly-A tail length of~200 adenosine bases.
[0135]         Modified messenger RNA was synthesized in a similar fashion as stated above
with 25% of the uridine bases substituted with 2-thiouridine triphosphate and 25% of the
cytidine bases substituted with 5-methylcytidine triphosphate.
[0136]         Female Balb/c mice were purchased from Elevage-Janvier, France. The mice
were 10 weeks old at the start of the experiment. Mice were weighed prior to the start of the
experiment and assigned to one of the following four group (n=6 mice per group): group I
IT spray with FFL mRNA; group II - IT spray with modified FFL mRNA; group III - IT
spray with FFL-mRNA in C 12-200 based lipid nanoparticle; group IV - IT spray with
modified FFL-mRNA in C12-200 based lipid nanoparticle. Each mouse was sprayed with
20pg of the respective mRNA/NPs. The required amount of mRNA/NPs per group were
suspended just before application in DEPC treated (0. 1%) RNase free water (Serva, Catalog
number: 39798, Lot P060383), to a total volume of 50 pl/mouse. NPs were also
characterized by size and zeta potential measurements. These measurements were performed
in water and are tabulated as Table 5.

[0137]         Luciferase production was measured by in vivo BLI at 6 hours post
application. Whereas almost negligible amount of exogenous mRNA-derived protein could
be detected with naked mRNA, the nanoparticle formulations, independent of modifications,
showed significant levels of luciferase production in the entire thoracic region and upper
                                              102

abdomen (Figure 1). Compared to modified FFL, the unmodified FFL mRNA resulted in
approximately 2-3 fold higher luminescence at 6 hours (Figure 2).
 [0138]         (Figures 1A and B), very low (close to background) level luminescence could
be detected with naked mRNA. In mice treated with lipid nanoparticles, independent of
modifications, increased luciferase production (-2-3 fold), compared to 6 hour time point,
was observed 24 hours after treatment (Figure 3A and B). No significant difference could
be observed between luciferase production from FFL or modified FFL mRNA (Figure 3C).
 [0139]         The mice treated with naked mRNA, were followed further in the experiment
and two additional doses at weekly intervals were applied. BLI was performed at different
time points post application. The BLI images at 24 hours post application, the time point of
maximum luminescence (Figure 3), are shown in Figure 4 (naked FFL mRNA) and Figure
5 (naked modified FFL mRNA). With a few exceptions, no noticeable luciferase production
was observed for any of the measured mice (compare the scales in Figures 4 and 5 with
Figure 3).
        B.      IT spray of FFL and modified FFL mRNA in C12-200 based nanoparticles-5
                pg per mouse and 10 pg per mouse
 [0140]         IT spray experiments were performed with reduced doses of 5 and
 10pg/mouse. The C12-200 based nanoparticle formulation was as described in Example 1.
 [0141]         Experimental Design: Female Balb/c mice were purchased from Elevage
Janvier, France. The mice were 19 weeks old at the start of the experiment. Mice were
weighed prior to the start of the experiment. The C 12-200 based lipid nanoparticles were
suspended just before application in DEPC treated (0. 1%) RNase free water (Serva, Catalog
number: 39798, Lot P060383), to a total volume of 50 pl/mouse. The following four groups
were tested (n=5 mice per group): group I - IT spray with FFL mRNA in C12-200 based
nanoparticles (5 pg/mouse); group II - IT spray with FFL mRNA in C12-200 based
nanoparticles (10 pg/mouse); group III - IT spray with modified FFL mRNA in C12-200
based nanoparticles (5 pg/mouse); and group IV - IT spray with modified FFL mRNA in
C12-200 based nanoparticles (10 pg/mouse). One mouse from group III and IV died during
IT spray. Thus, the remaining number of animals for these groups was four. At 6 hours post
application, all animals showed piloerection and reduced motility. Moreover, one mouse
                                              103

WO 2013/185069                                                                PCT/US2013/044771
from each of the higher dose groups (groups II and IV) was dead at this time point. BLI
imaging was performed for the mice at 6 hours post application.
[0142]          Using FFL mRNA at the doses of 5pg/mouse resulted in extremely low levels
of luciferase production. With the 10 pg/mouse dose, greater production was observed which
was concentrated in the liver (Figure 6A). The difference between the applied doses was not
very evident in the modified FFL mRNA groups (Figure 6B). Comparing the mice from
group II (FFL mRNA) with group IV (modified FFL mRNA) revealed higher luminescence
in the former (compare Figure 6A panel 1, 2 with panel 1 in Figure 6B).
[0143]          Luciferase production at 24 hours was significantly enhanced compared to 6
hours post IT spray (Figure 7A and 7B). Moreover, higher production was observed using
FFL mRNA as compared to modified FFL mRNA (Figure 7C). Similar results were
obtained in Example 1 with the dose of 20 pg/mouse. Internal organs (heart, liver, lungs,
liver, spleen and kidney) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for in-vitro luciferase measurements.
[0144]          Biodistribution after IT spray: The isolated organs were homogenized in the
frozen state using a mortar and pestel, weighed and lysed in a solution containing Lysis
buffer (25 mM TRIS-Cl 0,1% Triton x-100; pH 7.4) and Complete-Protease-Inhibitor
(Roche). Spleen, heart and kidneys were lysed in 250 pl, whereas lungs and liver were lysed
in 400 pl. After incubation on ice for 20 min, samples were centrifuged at 10.000 rpm, 4 'C
for 10 min. Luciferase activity was measured using 100 pl of the supernatant. Each sample
was measured in duplicates and mean values from duplicates were used in analysis. All
organs except the kidneys were positive for luciferase activity (Figure 8). In accordance
with our BLI data, maximum luminescence was observed in liver and lungs. FFL-mRNA
resulted in higher protein production compared to modified -FFL-mRNA and a dose
dependency was evident.
         C.     IT spray of modified FFL mRNA in HGT5001 based nanoparticles-20pg per
                mouse
[0145]          An IT spray experiment was performed with an HGT5001 based nanoparticle
formulation.
[0146]          Lipid nanoparticle formulation: Aliquots of 50 mg/mL ethanolic solutions of
HGT5001:DOPE:Cholesterol:DMG-PEG2K were mixed in a molar ratio of 40:20:35:5,

respectively, and diluted with ethanol to 3 mL final volume. Separately, an aqueous buffered
solution (10 mM citrate/150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5) of FFL or modified FFL mRNA was
prepared from a 1 mg/mL stock. The lipid solution was injected rapidly into the aqueous
mRNA solution and shaken to yield a final suspension in 20% ethanol. The resulting
nanoparticle suspension was filtered, diafiltrated with 1x PBS (pH 7.4) followed by distilled
RNAse-free water, concentrated and stored at 2-8'C.
[0147]          Experimental Design: Female Balb/c mice were purchased from Elevage
Janvier, France. The mice were 13 weeks old at the start of the experiment. Mice were
weighed prior to the start of the experiment. The lipid nanoparticles were suspended just
before application in DEPC treated (0.1%) RNase free water (Serva, Catalog number: 39798,
Lot P0603 83), to a total volume of 50 pl/mouse.
[0148]          IT Spray and BLI: Each mouse was IT sprayed with 20 pg of the HGT5001
based nanoparticle formulation in a total volume of 50 I/mouse. BLI imaging was
performed for the mice at 6 hrs post application.
[0149]          Significantly lower luminescence values were observed with the HGT5001
based nanoparticles when compared to the corresponding time point with the C12-200 based
nanoparticles and no increase in protein production from 6 to 24 hours was observed (Figure
9 and Figure 10).
[0150]          In an independent experiment testing C12-200 and HGT5001 based
nanoparticle formulations, following BLI imaging (Figure 11), mice were euthanized and
organs (heart, lungs, liver, spleen and kidney) were evaluated by histology (Figure 12). FFL
production was confirmed in the lung and liver for both C 12-200 based NPs and HGT501 1
based NPs.
        D.      IT spray of Modified FFL mRNA -- non- nanoparticledelivery
[0151]          Naked mRNA resulted in low efficiency without perfluorocarbon treatment.
IT aerosolization of encapsulated mRNA lead to protein production in lungs, liver, spleen,
and heart. FFL and modified FFL were equally efficient with respect to protein production
and with a dose-response.

 WO 2013/185069                                                               PCT/US2013/044771
 [0152]         Various delivery vehicles were tested, including polethylenimines (L-PEI
22kDa, br-PEI 25 kDa), copolymers of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate
(OEGMA) and N,N-dimethylaminoehtyl methacrylate (DMAEMA), MLRI:DOPE, DOTAP,
DMRIE-C, and Lipofectamine, and did not show luminescence in non-lung cells. In contrast,
C12-200 and HGT5001 based lipid nanoparticle formulations resulted in significant protein
production in non-lung cells following pulmonary delivery.
 [0153]         These observations indicate that only the nanoparticle formulations were able
to translocate intact, by either active or passive means, from the lung to the systemic blood
supply and subsequently to be deposited in different tissues, such as the liver. This
translocation of an intact mRNA encoding a cytosolic protein, firefly luciferase, constitutes
non-invasive systemic delivery of an active pharmaceutical ingredient beyond the lung to
result in the production of a functional protein to systemically accessible tissues.
        E.      Nebulization of modified FFL mRNA with PEI based lipid nanoparticles
 [0154]         Mice that received modified FFL mRNA in PEI based nanoparticles showed
luminescence in the lung (Figure 13). Luciferase production was greater with modified FFL
mRNA (panels 1, 2) compared to unmodified FFL mRNA (panels 3, 4).
Example 2: Evaluation of nanoparticle migration by measuring lipid in non-lung
                target cells
 [0155]         To identify the passage of intact nanoparticles in non-lung tissues, aliquots of
50 mg/mL ethanolic solutions of C12-200, DOPE, Chol, DMG-PEG2000 and 1,2
dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)
(ammonium salt) are mixed in a molar ratio of 40:29:25:5:1, respectively, and diluted with
ethanol to 3 mL final volume. Separately, an aqueous buffered solution (10 mM citrate/150
mM NaCl, pH 4.5) of non-secreted protein, such as beta-galactosidase or FFL (modified or
unmodified) mRNA is prepared from a 1 mg/mL stock. The lipid solution is injected rapidly
into the aqueous mRNA solution and shaken to yield a final suspension in 20% ethanol. The
resulting nanoparticle suspension iss filtered, diafiltrated with Ix PBS (pH 7.4), concentrated
and stored at 2-8'C.

 [0156]           Messenger RNA is synthesized via in vitro transcription process using a
cDNA template encoding beta-galactosidase or FFL protein with predetermined untranslated
regions. The resulting mRNA construct is processed further incorporating a Cap 1 structure
on the 5' end and a poly-A tail length of ~200 adenosine bases.
 [0157]           Modified messenger RNA is synthesized in a similar fashion as stated above
with 25% of the uridine bases substituted with 2-thiouridine triphosphate and 25% of the
cytidine bases substituted with 5-methylcytidine triphosphate.
 [0158]           Female Balb/c mice are purchased from Elevage-Janvier, France. The mice
are 10 weeks old at the start of the experiment. Mice are weighed prior to the start of the
experiment. Each mouse is sprayed with 20pg of the respective mRNA/NPs comprising
unmodified and modified mRNA in fluorescently labeled C12-200 based lipid nanoparticles.
The mRNA encapsulated nanoparticles are suspended just before application in DEPC treated
(0.1%) RNase free water (Serva, Catalog number: 39798, Lot P060383), to a total volume of
50 pl/mouse. Six hours after treatment mice are killed and organs are excised for histological
examination of NP distribution by fluorescence microscopy on 6 pm cryosections.
 [0159]           Alternatively, mRNA is radioactively labeled with, e.g. 1123 according to the
method of Commerford as described in detail by Terebesi et al (Terebesi J, Kwok KY, Rice
KG. Anal Biochem. 1998 Oct 1;263(1):120-3). The labeling mixture is separated using a PD
 10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) with water as eluent.
The iodinated mRNA is mixed with unlabeled mRNA resulting in the desired amounts of
mRNA which is formulated with lipids as described above and IT aerosolized to the mice
lungs. At a desired time point, mice are killed and radioactivity of the organs is measured
using a gamma counter.
 [0160]           The above examples demonstrate mRNA can be effectively delivered to non
lung cells or tissues through pulmonary administration using the methods and compositions
described herein. In the representative examples above, mRNA delivery was evaluated using
the fluorescent firefly luciferase reporter protein encoded by a codon optimized sequence of
modified mRNA. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that such
examples are merely representative of a wide range of mRNAs and proteins that can be
delivered according to the present invention. In particular, it will be readily apparent to one
skilled in the art that the compositions and methods of the current invention may be used to

 [0161]         From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the
essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope
thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various
usages and conditions.
