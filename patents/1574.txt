                                           ABSTRACT
         Systems and methods are provided that allow a proprietor of a location or merchant to
which a user is interacting through a third party to send a push notification to a user device
associated with the user using the third party as a proxy. The provided systems and methods
may assign an interaction identifier to the user and interaction when an interaction request is
received by the third party that may be later used to identify the user and user device to which
a notification received from the proprietor or merchant will be pushed. The user may be able
to define rules and settings that limit the scope and timing of the push notifications that can
be received, and the third party may determine if notifications received from the proprietor or
merchant meet these rules and settings before pushing the notifications to the user device and
user.

           PROXIED PUSH NOTIFICATIONS BASED ON USER INTERACTION
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Application No. 14/146,53 1, filed January 2,
2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0001A] Also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, is PCT/US2014/070675
(published as WO 2015/102889), filed on 16 December 2014.
BACKGROUND
Technical Field
[0002] Embodiments disclosed herein are related to push notifications on mobile devices. In
particular, embodiments disclosed herein may allow a merchant or location to use a user's
interaction with the merchant or location via a third party as a proxy to send push notification
to the user's mobile device.
Related Art
[0003] Due to the increase in use of mobile devices and the improved networking and online
capabilities of these mobile devices, merchants having physical "brick and mortar"
storefronts may also have an online presence to enhance a user's experience while at the
physical storefront. Users may be able to interact with the merchant or location via a third
party that facilitates the interaction. The interaction may include offline and online
interactions, such as performing online transactions, checking in to receive advertisements,
specials, and other information, and the like. For example, a third party such as PayPal, Inc.
of San Jose, CA, may facilitate user interaction with the merchant or location by providing
options for selecting, ordering, and paying for items, providing convenience for both the user
and the merchant. Additional interactions may be facilitated by other third parties or the same
third party, and may include sending advertisements, specials, offers, and the like. While the
third party may be able to provide information to the user based on an interaction, the
merchant or location may be limited to providing information to users via an e-mail, short
messaging service (SMS) message, or voice call, all of which require the user to provide
personal information to the merchant or location. Certain mobile operating systems allow for
third parties to push notifications to a user's mobile device. However, these operating
systems require that a specific application or "app" be first installed on the user's mobile
device before allowing for push notifications. Since installing an app for each location or
merchant that a user may visit may be time consuming and tedious, locations or merchants

may not be able to conveniently send information to the users and, thus, may not be able to
fully benefit from interactions facilitated by the third party.
[0003A]       Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction
or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood, regarded as relevant,
and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0013] In the following description specific details are set forth describing certain
embodiments. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the disclosed
embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. The specific
embodiments presented are meant to be illustrative, but not limiting. One skilled in the art
may realize other material that, although not specifically described herein, is within the scope
and spirit of this disclosure.

[0014] What is needed are systems and methods for allowing a location or merchant to be
able to provide information and content to a user that is interacting with the location or
merchant through a third party without requiring the user to provide personal contact
information to the location or merchant or requiring the user to install location or merchant
specific software.
[0015] Consistent with some embodiments, there is provided a system. The system includes a
network interface component configured to receive an interaction request from a user for an
interaction with a location through the system, receive a notification to provide to the user,
the notification including an interaction identifier, and push the notification to a user device
associated with the interaction identifier. The system also includes one or more processors
configured to process the interaction request, assign the interaction identifier to the user, and
look up the user device using the received interaction identifier, the identifier specifying the
user device to which the notification is to be pushed. The system further comprises a memory
storing the interaction identifier.
[0016] Consistent with some embodiments, there is also provided a method. The method
includes steps of processing a request from a user to interact with a location, assigning an
interaction identifier to the user, providing the location with information related to the user
and the interaction, and pushing a notification received from the location to the user using the
assigned interaction identifier. The method may be embodied in computer-readable media.
[0017] Consistent with some embodiments, there is further provided a method. The method
includes steps of receiving interaction information from a remote server, the interaction
information indicating that a user is interacting with a location associated with the one or
more processors through the remote server, generating a notification to be sent to the user,
and sending the notification to the remote server to push to a user device associated with the
user. The method may be embodied in computer-readable media.
[0018] Embodiments described herein may allow a merchant or location to send notifications
to a device of a user interacting with the merchant or location through a third party through
one or more applications installed on the user device that are associated with the third party
and used for the interaction. In particular, embodiments described herein may assign the user
and/or user device and the interaction a specific interaction identifier that may be used by the
third party to send certain notifications on behalf of the merchant or location to the user or
user device.
[0019] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a networked system 100, consistent with some
embodiments. System 100 includes a user device 102, a location or merchant device 104

(location and merchant may be used interchangeably herein, with location being general and
merchant being a specific type of location at which a user can also interact with to conduct
transactions for goods and services), and a remote server 106 in communication over a
network 108. Remote server 106 may be a payment service provider server that may be
maintained by a payment service provider, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, CA. Remote
server 106 may be maintained by other service providers in different embodiments. Remote
server 106 may also be maintained by an entity with which sensitive credentials and
information may be exchanged with user device 102. Remote server 106 may further be one
or more servers that hosts functionality for users to "check in" to a location, merchant, event,
and the like. Checking in may provide the user that checks in with special offers, deals, and
the like, and may let the merchant or other proprietor of the location or event know that the
user is there. The user may also check in to a location for social purposes to let friends and
contacts of the user know that they have checked in. Remote server 106 may be more
generally a web site, an online content manager, a service provider, such as a bank, or other
entity who provides content to a user requiring user authentication or login. In general,
remote server 106 may be a single server or a collection of servers that acts as a third party
facilitator for a user 110 to interact with a location or merchant. Moreover, as used herein, an
"interaction" may be a request to a third party such as remote server 106 to create a
relationship between a location or merchant and user 110 for purposes including transaction,
offers, payments, subscriptions, check in, and the like.
[0020] Network 108, in one embodiment, may be implemented as a single network or a
combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, network 108 may
include the Internet and/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks,
and/or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example, the network
may comprise a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., cellular phone network) adapted
to communicate with other communication networks, such as the Internet.
[0021] User device 102, in one embodiment, may be implemented using any appropriate
combination of hardware and/or software configured for wired and/or wireless
communication over network 108. For example, user device 102 may be implemented as a
wireless telephone (e.g., smart phone), tablet, personal digital assistant (PDA), notebook
computer, personal computer, a connected set-top box (STB) such as provided by cable or
satellite content providers, or a video game system console, a head-mounted display (HMD)
or other wearable computing device, including a wearable computing device having an
eyeglass projection screen, and/or various other generally known types of computing devices.

[0022] User device 102 may include any appropriate combination of hardware and/or
software having one or more processors and capable of reading instructions stored on a
tangible non-transitory machine-readable medium for execution by the one or more
processors. Consistent with some embodiments, user device 102 includes a machine-readable
medium, such as a memory (not shown) that includes instructions for execution by one or
more processors (not shown) for causing user device 102 to perform specific tasks. In some
embodiments, the instructions may be executed by the one or more processors in response to
interaction by user 110. For example, such instructions may include browser application 112
such as a mobile browser application, which may be used to provide a user interface to permit
user 110 to browse information available over network 108, including information hosted by
remote server 106. For example, browser application 112 may be implemented as a web
browser to view information available over network 108. Browser application 112 may
include a graphical user interface (GUI) that is configured to allow user 110 to interface and
communicate with remote server 106 or other servers managed by content providers or
merchants via network 108. For example, user 110 may be able to access websites to find and
purchase items, as well as access user account information or web content using browser
application 112. As another example, user 110 may be able to interact with a merchant or
location through remoter server 104 using browser application 112.
[0023] User device 102 may also include a check in application 114 that may allow user 110
to interact with a location or merchant through remote server 104 by checking in to the
location or merchant using a check in platform or service such as may be provided by PayPal,
Inc. of San Jose, CA, Foursquare of New York, NY, Facebook, Inc., of Menlo Park, CA,
Yelp, Inc., of San Francisco, CA, or Google+ of Google, Inc. of Mountain View, CA, and
implemented by remote server 106. In some embodiments, check in application 114 may
include multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) for checking in to one or more of
the check in platforms or services. In some embodiments, checking in to a location or
merchant while visiting a location or merchant may allow user 110 to interact with the
merchant or location by providing user 110 with exclusive deals or offers, or may allow user
110 to interact with the merchant or location by allowing user 110 to conduct transactions
with the merchant or location, such as purchasing and paying for items.
[0024] User device 102 may also include a payment application 116 that may be used by user
110 using user device 102 to interact with a merchant or location by making a payment. In
some embodiments, the interaction provided by payment application 116 may be facilitated
by remote server 106 as a payment processor. In some embodiments, functionalities and

interactions provided by check in application 114 and payment application 116 may actually
be provided by a single application. User device 102 may include other applications 118 as
may be desired in one or more embodiments to provide additional features available to user
110, including accessing a user account with remote server 106. For example, applications
118 may include interfaces and communication protocols that allow the user to receive and
transmit information through network 108 and to remote server 106 and other online sites.
Applications 118 may also include security applications for implementing client-side security
features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate APIs over network
108 or various other types of generally known programs and/or applications. Applications
118 may include mobile applications downloaded and resident on user device 102 that
enables user 110 to access content through the applications.
[0025] Location device 104 may be implemented using any appropriate combination of
hardware and/or software configured for wired and/or wireless communication over network
108. Location device 104 may include any appropriate combination of hardware and/or
software having one or more processors and capable of reading instructions stored on a
tangible non-transitory machine-readable medium for execution by the one or more
processors. Consistent with some embodiments, location device 104 includes a
machine-readable medium, such as a memory (not shown) that includes instructions for
execution by one or more processors (not shown) for causing location device 104 to perform
specific tasks. In some embodiments, the instructions may be executed by the one or more
processors in response to a proprietor of a location. Further, location device 104 may be a
device such as a point-of-sale (POS) device, a server associated with a location, and a
combination thereof.
[0026] Location device 104 may include a database 120 identifying available items which
may be made available for viewing and purchase by user 110. Database 120 may include
descriptions, images, and pricing of the items. Location device 104 may also include a
location interface application 122 which may be configured to serve information over
network 108 to browser application 112, check in application 114, and/or payment
application 116 of user device 102 though network 108 and/or via remote server 106. In some
embodiments, user 110 may interact with the merchant or location via remote server 106
through browser application 112, check in application 114, and/or payment application 116
over network 108 in order to view various products, food items, or services identified in
database 118, such that a user of location device 104 may be capable of monitoring such
interaction through location interface application 122. In some embodiments, location

interface application 122 may allow a user of location device 104 to monitor and interact with
users, such as user 110, based on transactions that user 110 has performed with the location
or merchant via remote server 106, or based on a user check in at the location via remote
server 106. For example, location interface application 122 may show information about user
110, such as if user 110 has checked into the location, if user 110 has purchased an item, or if
user 110 has ordered an item for pick up at the location. In some embodiments, location
interface application 122 may allow a user 126 of location device 104 to send one or more
push notifications to user device 102 using remote server 106 as a proxy. In particular, when
user 110 interacts with a location through remote server 106 using check in application 114
or payment application 116, the check in or payment may be processed by remote server 104,
and user 110 may provide permission to remote server 106 as part of the check in or payment
to receive messages from remote server 104. Consequently, location interface application 122
may allow user 126 to send a notification to remote server 104, which may then push the
notification to check in application 114 and/or payment application 116 of user device 102, as
is described herein in greater detail.
[0027] Location device 104 may also include a checkout application 124 which may be
configured to facilitate the purchase by user 110 of goods or services (referred to collectively
as "items") identified by location interface application 122. Checkout application 124 may be
configured to accept payment information from or on behalf of user 110 through remote
server 106 over network 108. For example, checkout application 124 may receive and
process a payment confirmation from remote server 106, as well as transmit transaction
information to remote server 106 and receive information from remote 106. Checkout
application 124 may also be configured to accept one or more different funding sources for
payment including payments processed by remote server 106. In some embodiments, user
126 may use location interface application 122 in concert with checkout application 124 to
interact with user 110 through remote server 106 to facilitate the transaction of items.
[0028] Although applications 112-118 in user device 102 and applications 120-124 in
location device 104 describe specific functionalities provided and facilitated by each separate
application, in some embodiments, one or more of the functionalities provided by the
separate applications may be provided by a single application. For example, the
functionalities provided by check in application 114 and payment application 116 may be
provided by a single application. Similarly, the functionalities of location interface
application 122 and checkout application 124 may be provided by a single application. In
                                               -7-

some embodiments, the single application capable of providing such functionalities on user
device 102 and location device 104 may be provided by PayPal, Inc., of San Jose, CA.
[0029] Remote server 106, according to some embodiments, may be maintained by an online
payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, CA, which may provide processing for
online financial and information transactions on behalf of user 110. Remote server 106,
according to some embodiments, may also be maintained by a service that processes check
ins so that user 126 or others know that user 110 is at the location. Remote server 106 may
include at least check in application 128, which may be configured to facilitate a user
interaction with a location to check user 110 in to a location, and then provide user check in
information to location device 104. In some embodiments, checking user device 102 in to a
location may allow user 110 and user device 102, to access features, specials, offers, and the
like offered by the location. In some embodiments, these features, specials, offers, and the
like may be provided and processed by remote server 106 on behalf of the location.
[0030] Remote server 106 may also include a payment application 130 that may allow user
110 to interact with a location or merchant by processing payments for user 110 to the
location or merchant. In some embodiments, payment application 130 may be configured to
interface with payment application 116 and/or checkout application 124 to receive payment
details, user information, merchant/location information, and additional information for
processing a payment on behalf of user 110. Payment application 130 may also be capable of
interfacing with check in application 128 such that when a check in is processed a payment
may be authorized for the location in which user 110 is checking in to. In some embodiments,
functionalities provided by check in application 128 and payment application 130 may
actually be provided by a single application. Remote server 106 may also include an account
database 132 that includes account information 134 for users having an account on remote
server 106, such as user 110. In some embodiments, payment application 130 may process
payments based on information in account information 134 of account database 132.
Moreover, check ins received from user device 102 may also be processed based on
information in account information 134 of account database 132. Certain user information
stored in account information 134 may also be provided to location device 104 when user 110
interacts with a location via remote server 106. Furthermore, account information 134 may
include one or more personal preferences, settings, and rules, that are set by user 110
describing rules for receiving notifications from remote server 106 that will be pushed by
check in application 114 or payment application 116. Remote server 106 may include other
applications 136 and may also be in communication with one or more external databases 138,

that may provide additional information that may be used by remote server 106. In some
embodiments, databases 138 may be databases maintained by third parties, and may include
third party account information of user 110.
[0031] Although discussion has been made of applications and applications on user device
102, location device 104, and remote server 106, the applications may also be, in some
embodiments, modules. Module, as used herein, may refer to a software module that

[0037] FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example interface 300 provided by location interface
application 122, on a display component 210 of location device 104, consistent with some
                                               _1 1-

embodiments. As shown in FIG. 3, interface 300 includes entries 302 and 304 for user 110
and user 306 that are currently interacting with the location. In some embodiments, interface
300 may only provide entries for users that are interacting with the location via remote server
106. Other interactions via other servers may have other interfaces accordingly.
[0038] As shown in FIG. 3, entry 302 may include a photo of user 110, as well as interaction
information related to interactions user 110 may be engaging in with the location via remote
server 106, including that user 110 is currently checked in and has paid for an item. If user
110 had ordered an item ahead of time, the contents and details of the order may be included
in entry 302 so that user 126 may be able to prepare the order for user 110 and present it to
user 110 when user 110 arrives at the location based on the photo of user 110. As shown in
FIG. 3, entry 304 may include a photo of user 306 along with interaction information, such
that user 306 has only checked into the location. Additional interaction information or
personal information may be presented in entries 302 and 304, such as provided by remote
server 106 in accordance with permissions set by user 110 and 306. In some embodiments,
entries 302 and 304 may be displayed based on information received from remote server 106
concerning an interaction facilitated by remote server 106. Such received information may
include an interaction identifier that may include some or all of the information displayed in
entries 302 and 304 and may be mapped to the user and the interaction on remoter server 106.
Interface 300 may also allow user 126 to send a notification to an interacting user, such as
user 110 or user 306. In some embodiments, interface 300 may provide the ability to send a
notification in each entry 302 and 304, such as shown in FIG. 3. In other embodiments, a
single send notification button, check box, and the like may be provided in interface 300 so
that user 126 can select an entry 302 or 304 and the select the button to send a notification. In
accordance with some embodiments, the notifications may be sent to the checked in user
using remote server 106 as a proxy.
[0039] FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example interface 400 provided by location interface
application 122 for sending a notification to an interacting user, consistent with some
embodiments. If a user 126 wants to send a notification to an interacting user displayed in
interface 300, user 126 may be presented with interface 400. As shown in FIG. 4, interface
400 provides user 126 with options for creating the notification to be sent to a selected user
which, as shown in FIG. 4, is user 110. The options may include a notification type 402, a
time for delivery 404, and a text box 406. In some embodiments, the notification type and
time may be drop down boxes or scroll wheels, as shown in FIG. 4, but may also be
presented in other ways. Similarly, text box 406 may be replaced with predetermined
                                               -1 %

messages and the like. Notification type 402, time 404, and text box 406 are examples of
some options that may be included in a notification. Other options not shown in FIG. 4 or
described herein may be included and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure.
Once user 126 has created a notification with the content and options of their choosing, user
126 may select the send button 408 which will cause one or more data packets including the
notification content as well as an interaction identifier 110 to remote server 106 for sending
to user device 102.
[0040] FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a flow for sending a notification to a user device using
remote server 106 as a proxy, consistent with some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 5, when
user device 102 interacts with a merchant or location through remote server 106, user may
first send a request to remote server 106, and remote server 106 may process the request and
assign an interaction identifier to the user and interaction. In some embodiments, the
interaction identifier may be mapped to user 110, device 102, and may provide information
about the interaction, such as whether it is a transaction, a check in, or a combination thereof.
In some embodiments, the request may be sent by a beacon, such as a Bluetooth@ or BLE
beacon, or an NFC beacon. Moreover, the interaction identifier may be associated with and/or
mapped to user 110 and/or user device 102 in account information 134 corresponding to user
102.
[0041] Remote server 106 may then send interaction information to location device 104. The
interaction information may include information about user 110, such as a photo of user, a
user ID, personal information such as name, details related to the interaction with the location
facilitated and processed by remote server 104. The interaction information may also include
the assigned interaction identifier. Location interface application 122 executing on location
device 104 may receive and display this interaction information in interface 300, such as
shown in FIG. 3. In some embodiments, location device 104 may only receive the interaction
identifier and location interface application 122 may call remote server 104 for details to
create interface 300 using the interaction identifier. When user 126 wants to send a
notification to user 110, user 126 may select an option to send the notification, such as shown
in FIG. 3, which may present user 126 with interface 400 for preparing, creating, and/or
generating the notification, as shown in FIG. 4. The notification may be an offer, such as a
sale offer or an upselling offer, or an offer for credit at the location. The notification may be
an advertisement. The notification may also be a receipt or bill of sale, or a notification that
an order is ready for pickup.

[0042] Once the notification is ready, it may be sent along with the interaction identifier to
remote server 106. Based on the interaction identifier, remote server 106 may look up user
and/or user device associated or mapped to the interaction identifier. Remote server 106 may
then check the notification against one or more user-defined and/or system-defined rules. In
some embodiments, user 110 may be able to specify the type of notifications that will be
received on user device 102, the timing of such notifications, and the like. Such settings may
be stored in account information 134 of account database 132. Remote server 106 may also
have system-defined rules that may limit the type and content of notifications that will be
pushed to users. When the received notification is determined to be acceptable based on the
user-defined and system-defined rules, remote server 106 will push the notification to user
device 102 where it may be received by at least one of browser application 112, check in
application 114, and payment application 116, and displayed by display component 210 of
user device 102. Since user 110 already has installed these applications on user device 102,
user 110 will be able to receive notifications pushed from remote server 106 on behalf of a
user 126 without needing to install additional applications specific to the location or
providing personal contact information to the location.
[0043] FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a process 600 for receiving notifications from a
location with which a user is interacting, consistent with some embodiments. For the purpose
of illustration, FIG. 6 may be described with reference to any of FIGS. 1-5. Process 600
shown in FIG. 6 may be embodied in computer-readable instructions for execution by one or
more processors such that one or more of the steps of the method may be performed by
processing component 206 of user device 102. As shown in FIG. 6, process 600 may begin
when user device 102 sends an interaction request (602). In some embodiments, user 110
may interact with browser application 112, check in application 114, or payment application
116 installed on user device 102 to send a request to remote server 106 to interact with a
location or merchant. In some embodiments, the request may be automatically sent to remote
server 106 based on instructions in an application installed on user device 102 and executed
by processing component 206 in response to a setting for automatic interactions at a location,
the automatic interactions being facilitated by Bluetooth@, BLE, NFC, and the like.
Moreover, the interaction request may be a request to check in, a request to transact and may
include payment information, for example information for authorizing a payment to complete
an order.
[0044] User device 102 may receive a notification from remote server 106 (604). In some
embodiments, the received notification may be a receipt, an offer or advertisement, an
                                               Ad-

indication that an order is ready, and the like, and may be received by an installed application
such as browser application 112, check in application 114, or payment application 116.
Moreover, the received notification may be from the location or merchant with which user
110 was interacting with through remote server 106. Applications installed on user device
102 may include instructions that when executed by processing component 206 causes the
notification to be displayed by display component 210 of user device 102 (606). In some
embodiments, user 110 may be able to set rules, settings, and preferences for receiving
notifications using user device 102. Such settings and preferences may be set in a settings
feature of browser application 112, check in application 114, or payment application 116 by
user 110 and may be provided to remote server 104 where they may be stored in account
information 134 of account database 132. The settings and rules may determine the types of
notifications that user 110 permits to be pushed to user device 102 as well as the timings of
the notifications.
[0045] FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a process 700 for sending notifications to an
interacting user using remote server 106 as a proxy, consistent with some embodiments. For
the purpose of illustration, FIG. 7 may be described with reference to any of FIGS. 1-5.
Process 700 shown in FIG. 7 may be embodied in computer-readable instructions for
execution by one or more processors such that one or more of the steps of the method may be
performed by processing component 206 of merchant device 104. As shown in FIG. 7,
process 700 may begin when location device 104 receives interaction information including
an interaction identifier from remote server 104 indicative of user 110 interacting with the
merchant or location via remote server 104 (702). In some embodiments, location interface
application 122 may include instructions that, when executed by processing component 206
of location device 104, causes interface 300 to be displayed by display component 210 of
location device 104. Interface 300 may show display information related to the interaction of
a user with the merchant or location.
[0046] User 126 may monitor interface 300 and may view the interaction information and
take other actions while a user interaction is valid (704), but may not be able to take any
actions when user 110 is no longer actively interacting with the location through remote
server 104, or such interaction has expired based on an expiration period set by user, remote
server 104, and/or the location (706). In some embodiments, user 126 may want to send a
notification to user 110 (708). This may be effected, for example, by selecting a send
message button in interface 300, including in individual entries 302 or 304 for user 110 or
306. User 126 may then be provided with interface 400 where user 126 may be able to create
                                                -1 rN-

the notification and enter notification details (710). In some embodiments, the notification
details may include a type of notification 402, a time period associated with delivery of the
notification 404, and additional text 406 associated with the notification. Once the
notification is ready to be sent to user 110, location interface application 122 of location
device 104 may be configured to send the notification to remote server 106 over network 108
(712). In some embodiments, the notification may be sent to remote server 106 along with the
interaction identifier. Remote server 106 may then act push the notification to user device
102 through an application installed on user device 102 associated with remote server 104,
such as browser application 112, check in application 114, or payment application 116.
[0047] FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a process 800 for pushing a notification to an
interacting user as a proxy for a merchant or location, consistent with some embodiments. For
the purpose of illustration, FIG. 8 may be described with reference to any of FIGS. 1-5.
Process 800 shown in FIG. 8 may be embodied in computer-readable instructions for
execution by one or more processors such that one or more of the steps of the method may be
performed by processing component 206 of remote server 106. As shown in FIG. 8, process
800 includes remote server 106 receiving an interaction request from user 110 (802). In some
embodiments, the interaction request may include information sufficient for use be remote
server 106 to perform an action consistent with the request. Such information may include a
user id or user name, password, or other credentials, a location identification, provided by
GPS or other identifier. The information may be provided to remote server 106 automatically
facilitated by one or more beacons or dongles communicating with user device 102 over a
Bluetooth@, BLE, or NFC communications protocol.
[0048] Remote server 106 may then process the check in (804). In some embodiments,
remote server 106 may use the information received along with the request to authenticate
user 110 and user device 102 to remote server 106. Such authentication may include
matching received information to information stored in account information 134 of account
database 132 and may allow user 110 to interact with a merchant or location through remote
server 104. Processing the request may also include looking up location information related
to location information received as part of the request. Remote server 106 may then assign an
interaction identifier to user 110 and/or user device 102 and the requested interaction (806).
This interaction identifier may be associated with an account of user 110 in account
information 134. Remote server 106 may then provide interaction information including the
interaction identifier to location device 104 (808). In some embodiments, check in application
128 or payment application 130 may interface with location interface application 122 such
                                                -1 CN

that interface 300 shows users that are currently interacting with the location, including user
110, along with the relevant interaction information. Moreover, remote server 106 may
monitor the user interaction and, in some embodiments, monitor an expiration time associated
with the interaction, which may be between 1-3 hours, for example and, in some examples,
may be about 2 hours. When user 110 is determined to no longer be interacting with the
location or merchant, whether by expiration or signing out or similar (810), remote server 104
may update the system (812), which may then provide an indication to location device 104
such that the interaction information is no longer viewable in interface 300.
[0049] While user 110 interaction continues, remote server 106 may receive a notification
from location device 104 to push to user device 102 (814). The notification may include the
interaction identifier. The notification also may include notification details, such as a
notification type, delivery time, notification text, images, links, and the like. Processing
component 206 of remote server 106 may then lookup the user and/or user device based on
the interaction identifier provided by location device 104 (816). When the user and/or user
device 102 has been located, remote server 106 may then determine whether the notification
meets user-defined and system-defined rules for notifications (818). In some embodiments,
the user-defined and system-defined rules may specify what types of notifications are
permitted, how long after check in they should be sent, times of day at which they should not
be sent, and the like. When the notification meets the user-defined and system-defined rules,
remote server 106 may push the notification to the device associated with the interaction
identifier. As a result, user 126 may be able to push notifications to a user interacting with the
location or merchant through remote server 106 using remote server 106 as a proxy.
