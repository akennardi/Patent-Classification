                           COMPOSITIONS IN WASHING MACHINES
                                               Abstract
The present invention provides a method of dispensing a plurality of treating compositions into a
multistage automatic washing machine, as well as a dispensing device comprising an associated
reservoir for collection of wash liquor and at least two chambers containing a treating composition.
Said chambers are activated in response to an input from a sensor.

                                               -1
   A Method and a Device for Controlled Dosing of Treating
                     Compositions in Washing Machines
   This invention relates to the process of using multiple deter
 5 gent    compositions,         rinse   aids,    and other additives          within      one
   complete wash cycle of an automatic washing machine.
   The    various      cleaning      compositions      may   be     dosed   into   the    ma
   chine at varying quantities, times,                  sequences, and for varying
10 durations during a washing machine cycle.                        The use of multiple
   cleaning        compositions         allows     for   increased        and    optimized
   cleaning performance.
   Current      conventional         systems    used     in    automatic      dishwashers
15 only    dose     one     detergent    composition      per     wash   cycle    with     the
   optional addition of a rinse agent composition at the very end
   of the washing machine cycle.                  The detergent        compositions are
   primarily       either      enzymatic    based    or   incorporate       a  hypohalite
   oxidative       bleach      (e.g.   sodium hypochlorite,           sodium dichloroi
20 socyanurate, etc.).
   Enzymatic detergents provide              excellent cleaning on enzyme sen
   sitive    soils        (primarily protein       and   starch based)        but  fail     to
   provide performance            on hard to      remove    stains,     such as     coffee,
25 tea, and tomato stains.
   Hypohalite        based     (for   example,     chlorine      bleach    based)    deter
   gents    provide excellent           cleaning    on the hard to         remove    stains
   but fail to provide performance on the enzyme sensitive soils.

                                                       -2
   Because       enzymes       and   hypohalite            oxidizing         bleaches        are     incom
   patible within the same formula matrix, the consumer must make
   a trade-off decision on performance and use one detergent com
   position        or    the   other.           This      presents        an   obvious       dilemma         to
 5 the     consumer       -  whether         to    get     good      cleaning        on   an   enzymatic
   sensitive        stain     to the detriment                of a     hard to remove            stain       or
   vice versa.
   The use       of multiple         detergent           compositions           within      one    washing
10 machine       cycle      would mitigate this                 trade-off         decision       and pro
   vide      optimal      performance          across       the range         of   stains      and     soils
   normally        encountered          in      an    automatic           dishwasher.            However,
   given the incompatibility of enzyme based detergents and hypo
   halite      detergents,          the       detergent          compositions           must      be     kept
15 separate        and dosed at          different          times so        that     the performance
   of each detergent is not affected by the presence of the other
   detergent.
   Thus,      an    object      of    the        present        invention         is     to   provide           a
20 method of dispensing a plurality of treating compositions into
   a multistage automatic washing machine comprising an operating
   device       in    the    machine,          the      device       comprising          at   least       two
   chambers,         each      chamber          containing           a    treating         composition,
   wherein the chambers              are      activated in            response to input from a
25 sensor,        characterized           in     that      the     device        has    an   associated
   reservoir for collection of wash liquor.
   A plurality of reservoirs may be present.
30 Another object of the present invention is to provide a device
   for     dispensing        a   plurality            of    treating         compositions           into       a

                                                    -3
   multistage       automatic        washing        machine      comprising           cartridge        in
   the      machine,    the      cartridge        including       at    least       two     chambers,
   each      chamber    containing          a   treating       composition,             wherein      the
   chambers       are   activated         in    response       to    input        from     a    sensor,
 5 characterized         in    that    the     device      has   an    associated           reservoir
   for collection of wash liquor.
   In a further object of the present invention there is provided
   a removable, automatic washing machine independent device, for
10 dispensing       a  plurality         of treating         compositions            in      a multi
   stage automatic washing machine, comprising
   a) a cartridge, the cartridge including at least two chambers,
   each chamber containing a treating composition,
   b)    at least     one    sensor,      wherein the         chambers         of the cartridge
15 are      activated     in     response      to     inputs    from      the        at    least     one
   sensor,
   c) a reservoir for the collection of wash liquor in the multi
   stage automatic washing machine, and
   characterised        in    that    the     sensor     is   located within the                 device
20 such that it can monitor the wash liquor in the reservoir.
   The      device    may    have    a     cartridge        with    at     least        7   chambers,
   preferably       10    chambers,        more     preferably        at    least       15    chambers
   and most preferably at least 18 chambers.
25
   The device may be powered by battery.
   The device may dispense at least two different treating compo
   sitions.       For   example,        these       may    comprise       a    detergent          and    a
30 booster agent or a detergent and a rinse aid.

                                                           -4
   Preferably            the     device      will       dispense       at    least       three   different
   treating compositions. Each composition may be dispensed inde
   pendently based on the sensory inputs.
 5 The     device        may have         software         to   control       the     dispensing of the
   treating compositions based on the sensory inputs.
   The      device        is    ideally       completely          washing          machine     independent
   being        able       to     be    placed         inside      any     commercially          available
10 washing machine.
   With the use of the method and device of the                                         invention it has
   been      found that            optimal        (and highly          sophisticated)           device     op
   eration          can      be   achieved.            This     has    been        speculated     as     being
15 because          of many        factors       including        that      (in      comparison      to many
   prior        art      documents)         the        device      is    able        to   discern      phases
   within a machine cycle wherein the amount of wash liquor / wa
   ter is        low / zero, e.g. such as a drying phase.                                    [These phases
   typically           are     indicative         a    change     in    the nature          of a   cycle    of
20 a machine            and thus are          a     significant         guiding feature].                Addi
   tionally            when     the     reservoir           contains       a     detectable       level     of
   wash      liquor         the    parameters           of    said water          can    be   measured     and
   the     right        level      of the       right       detergent        may      be  dosed    into    the
   wash liquor.                Overall the device enables intelligent                            dosing of
25 detergent            compositions           (in     terms     of the        total      levels    and    the
   contents           thereof)         at   various          points      of    a     wash    cycle    in   re
   sponse to the wash conditions being experienced.
   Generally            the     reservoir          is     integrated         into      the    device.       As
30 such      it     is    preferred        that       the     reservoir         is    disposed     adjacent
   to the remainder of the device.

                                                          -5
   Preferably the sensors are disposed within the reservoir, e.g.
   at    or     near      the    bottom         thereof.            By    doing        this       it     has    been
   found       that      the    amount        of     "dead      time"      in     which       the       device    is
   unable        to    respond         to,    for     example,        water        presence          in    the ma
 5 chine        (and      any    attributed             properties          of     said      water)         is   re
   duced.           Further,        it     is   postulated           that      situating           the     sensors
   in    a    reservoir         enables         more       accurate         monitoring             of     changing
   parameters than could be achieved in a closed reservoir
10 Preferably the sensors                      are in the         same plane.                This is useful
   in that each sensor is then equally exposed to the wash liquor
   to    ensure        that     overall         operation         of the         device        is     optimized.
   It is appreciated the sensors                           could have different                      sizes, thus
   in this regard it                 is meant          that at least a portion of a sens
15 ing      part      of     each       sensor      is    preferably            in     or    near        the    same
   plane as the remaining sensors.
   Where       a    plurality           of    reservoirs          are     present           sensors         may   be
   housed within separate reservoirs.
20
   Preferably           the    reservoir          fills      in    accordance            with       the     follow
   ing formula:
                                          (Vmin     -   Vomin)     /   Cav >H
25
   Where:
   Vo-i"      = Volume of water lost per minute                               (mm3)
   V.  -mi _  = Volume of water collected per minute (mm3 )
   Cav   =   average cross              sectional        area     (mm 2 )
30 H = Height from base of trough to top edge of sensor                                                 (mm)

                                                     -6
   Preferably       the      reservoir       empties            in    accordance        with     the    fol
   lowing formula:
                                            V-mn       /    Cav    >H
 5
   By  filling       /   emptying       in     accordance             with       one  or     more   of    the
   formulae above it has been found that optimal device operation
   may be achieved.               It is    suspected that this is at least partly
   due   to    quick      filling       and     /   or       emptying           times,      which   enable
10 speedy recognition of washing cycle start points and / or emp
   tying     /  drainage          points.        It      is     these        points    that    are    often
   associated       with       the need      for a          release          of   a  detergent      compo
   nent and / or conversely the ceasing of release of a detergent
   component.
15
   Preferably       (when water / wash liquor is present) the reservoir
   reaches a state in which it contains an amount of water / wash
   liquor to sense             the properties              of same in less              than 1 minute.
   Preferably       (when water          /   wash        liquor        is    absent)     the    reservoir
20 reaches     a   state        in   which     it      empties           in    less   than     1   minute.
   This    enables       detection        of the          shortest           draining     periods      in   a
   wash     cycle,     which       may  be     as    short          as     4  minutes,       more   likely
   shorter than 2 minutes, more likely shorter than 1 minute.
25 Most    preferably         then    the filling             /    emptying time is            less     than
   30  seconds to account for short draining cycles.                                      In which case
   the formulae may be represented below:
                                    (V -mi"  -    Vo m in)       / Cav >2H
30
                                           Vomin     /     Cav >2H

                                                   -7
   The     inlet      (and    possibly      the     outlet)       may  have     a   cover       which
   aids the prevention of any soil particles, present                                in the wash
   liquor,        from building       up    in   the      reservoir.       Such a        cover    may
   be in      the    form of a net        /   gauze      which allows wash           liquor      (but
 5 not suspended particles) to enter the reservoir.
   The     water     throughput      within      a    dishwasher may        change       depending
   on the dishwasher model and manufacturer. It                            is therefore nec
   essary for the trough to be designed for the lowest throughput
10 in order for the trough to fill within 30seconds for all dish
   washer systems.
                                             TM
   The Bosh         SGS58MO2EU      Logixx       model has proved           to have        the low
   est throughput of the different dishwashers tested. This dish
15 washer        was   therefore      considered          the   appropriate        for      the   ex
   perimental          work    to   develop      a     design     equation      for     the     water
   trough.
   The     water     trough     should be       designed       within the       specifications
20 of     the    following       equations      in     order     for  it   to    operate        accu
   rately        for   its    desired      function.         The   function       of    the     water
   trough is         for water to       collect        within the trough,            to submerge
   sensors        within     30   seconds.      These       sensors   can    be   used       for the
   detection         of    the    conditions        of     the   water     within       the     dish
25 washer.        Depending      on the     water       conditions       or how     they       change
   the device can follow a algorithm which decides at what                                     stages
   formulation should be dispensed.

     In     order      to   detail         the     general    mass      balance        in    terms      of  the
 5 parameters            of    the      water       trough,       in    a    dishwasher           system,        a

   placed and f, the                  filling of the dishwasher. The change in the
   volumetric           flow      due      to    a   change     in    each     of    these        parameters
   was      determined.           The     data was      then interpolated                 into     a  formula
   for the inflow of water into the device. This formula was then
15 inserted into the mass balance.

   a    function        of a2:        the     size    of the      draining        hole,       g:   accelera
   tion due to gravity and z: the final height of the fluid after
   filling.           Bernoulli's             energy     balance         was     therefore           used     to
   create         a    formula         for      the    flow     of     water      out       of    the    water
25 trough. This formula was then inserted into the mass balance
   Bernoulli's energy balance can be applied to the container. As
   there       can     be   no     creation         or  destruction          of    energy        the    sum of
   the energy at point 2 must be equal to the sum of the starting
30 energy        at    point       1.     The     following       equation        gives       the     flow    of
   fluid       at    the    height         inserted      rather        then the         mean      volumetric

   function the mean of the two points will give a slightly lower
 5 value         what      it   should      be   for  a   square   root   function.    However
   this difference is considered minimum enough to be negligible.

   Assumptions:
 5       1.  Considering          quasi-static             state     where   the draining         of the
             main     cup    volume        is    approximately           equal   to  0     on   a    short
             time period dt.
         2. Considering           friction          to be       negligible.     This   is     the    fric
             tion     associated           with       sear      force   at   the  containers           edge
10           and turbulence.
         3. Considering the correction factor for a3,                              area of the vo
             lumetric       outflow         of    fluid       to be    negligible    and therefore
             a3 to be approximately equal to a2.
15 It     is    important        to     note     that      the above       equations      and   assump
   tions are not limiting to the present invention. They are pro
   vided        as   an   example        of     how     to    calculate     the  required       parame
   ters      of the      collection            reservoir         for   optimum performance.              The
   skilled         person     will be able              to vary the        equations       (or provide
20 their        own)    above      to derive           the     time   for   drainage     that     is     de

   function of A:            the angle of the collecting area, a:                          the hori

   tainer, r:     the position within the dishwasher, D: the drawer
   in which it is placed and f:             the filling of the dishwasher.
   Each of these parameters were assumed independent of each
 5 other in the testing.
   The Bosh Logixx         TM SGS58MO2EU dishwasher was tested to have the
   lowest through-put of the dishwashers available                   and was
   therefore considered to be the most appropriate machine to
10 perform the testing. This is because the dishwasher with the
   lowest throughput will have the lowest rate of accumulation of
   water and therefore the water trough should be designed for
   this dishwasher in order for the filling conditions to be ap
   propriate for all dishwashers.

   This testing was preformed in the dishwasher using different
   size containers.
   The   data   results       were  interpolated       using  Newton's   interpola

   approximately equal to a2.
   The greater     time spent       at    lower         z values     than higher         z values
   are  considered        negligible      and        therefore      the  change       in     height
15 is  assumed   linear        with  time.         This     should be     a    reasonable           as
   sumption   as   VJ       " >>V"          ie.        The   flow  into    the     system        is     a
   lot  greater then the flow out of the system and therefore the
   flow out of the system will have a lower influence on the rate
   of  accumulation.         Therefore      Mz       is   used within       this     formula         to
20 indicate the mean height of the fluid.
   All  other  influences         such     as      fluid      temperature        and   viscosity
   were considered negligible.

   The     dosing    is     preferably          based     upon     feedback       from   a   sensor
   within      the  device        that     determines        a  feature      of the     load such
   as the      amount     of    soil     thereon        and  /  or a    feature      of   the wash
   liquor,       such    as   the      temperature         thereof.       In this      way    a  de
 5 sired      chamber     in     the     device       may   then    be  activated.          At   the
   same     time,   one     or     more     other      chamber(s)      may   be    "locked    out",
   unable to dose its              (their) material into the machine.
   The     sensor   may     include        one     or more     of the    following       types    of
10 sensor:      turbidity sensor, temperature                     sensor, water / moisture
   sensor, water hardness sensor, light sensor, conductivity sen
   sor, vibration/ sound sensor.
   The     device   may     have       further       sensors     (for example        of the     kind
15 above) which are, whilst associated with the device, distanced
   there from.          For example the device may associate with a rela
   tively      remote     sensor which            is   disposed in      another      part of the
   machine and / or in a water inlet, water outlet.
20 In     addition     or    as    an    alternative         the    sensors     within     the   ma
   chine may be used to detect the type or quality of load or wa
   ter hardness at the                appropriate time.              Generally, but not al
   ways,     this occurs at the beginning of the cycle.                              Such detec

   Most    preferably       the automatic          washing machine          is    an automatic
   dishwashing machine.
   Optionally       a  plurality         of devices       may be     provided       within         the
10 automatic       dishwashing        machine,       wherein     each    device     has      a   plu
   rality of chambers for holding/dosing a treating composition.
   Most    preferably        the    chambers       of   the   device       contain       at    least
   two different treating compositions.                       Optionally each treating
15 composition differs from each other treating composition.
   The   treating      composition          may   comprise     a   single treating             agent
   or compositions,            or alternatively          may comprise          a plurality           of
   treating agents or compositions.
20
   The types of treating agents which can be placed individually
   into the separate chambers include enzymatic detergents, hypo
   halite/peroxygen            detergents,         water     treatment         agents,         rinse
   aids, anti-lime scale removers, sanitizers, perfumes, and sur
25 face repair agents.
   By operation of these chambers                    individually it          has been found
   that the device enables intelligent dosing of detergent compo
   sitions        (in   terms      of     the     total     levels      and     the      contents

   A typical dishwashing cycle consists of a pre-rinse segment, a
 5 wash segment, two more rinse segments,                          and finally, a dry seg
   ment.         Some dish washing machines may have an additional                             seg
   ment such as treating segments                      (for example, a water treatment
   segment         or   an     anti-lime       scale     segments) .        A   timing      device
   within the dishwasher is responsible for precisely controlling
10 all     of    the    electrical       circuits       and   activating       the   components
   associated with each segment.
   Preferably the cartridge chamber that is activated in the pre
   rinse       segment        contains     an    enzymatic       detergent     and/or     surfac

   For use with a typical multistage dishwashing machine the car

 5 empty.          The      filling       of     each      cartridge            may     be     dependent        upon
   the      nature       of      the    dishwasher           machine          cycle,        e.g.     whether        or

    (2)    The     timer         opens      a   water-inlet           valve     and   when     the     water
   reaches       the     appropriate            level        in   the    dishwasher      tub,      the      wa
   ter-inlet valve closes.                       The timer           advances to activate a mo
   tor-driven          pump,         which     sends        water     through      the   pump       housing

   the spray arms to rotate and spray water over the dishes.
    (3)   As     the water becomes                 soiled with            food particles, the wa
   ter    circulates             through       a    filtration           system     which     eliminates
10 food particles from the water.
    (4)   At     the     end       of     the   rinse        segment,       the   timer    signals          the
   machine to empty the water into the home's drain system.                                               If a
   cycle     requires           another       rinse       segment,        the timer     activates           the
15 machine       to    refill,          rinse    and drain before              going into         the main
   wash segment.
    (5)    For     the main           wash     segment,         the    timer     signals     the     deter
   gent    dispenser            to open and           empty its         contents     into    the water
20 filled tub.
    (6)    The hot water and detergent are pumped throughout the ma
   chine     to     break         down     and   loosen         soil    on    dishes    and     utensils.
   The   timer       then        directs       the      pump     to   drain     the   tub    and     refill
25 with clean, hot water for final rinse segments.
    (7)    Once      the       final       rinse      segments        are     completed,       the     auto
   matic drying period begins.
30 As   can be       appreciated,             at   certain         points within        the above           cy
   cles,     the     treating            agents     discussed         herein      can  be    dosed        into

   the    washing      machine        to    perform       rinsing,        cleaning,      disinfect
   ing,    water     treating,         and      other      tasks     for    which     the    treating
   agents are designed.
 5 For example, during segment                     (2),    a water treatment agent could
   be    dosed   into      the     washing machine             to   address       any water        hard
   ness issues.           Of course this will vary depending upon the wa
   ter quality of the individual user.                            Thereafter, a rinse agent
   could also be dosed.
10
   For    segment      (5),       an enzymatic          detergent        could be      dosed       first
   into the washing machine and allowed to work.                                   Then a segment
    (5A) could be envisioned where there is a short rinse and then
   segment      (5B)      would      then      dose     a   hypohalite         detergent.            Then
15 segment     (6) would then follow.
   As    mentioned above, there                  can   be    a  variety       of different           seg
   ments which can be placed in a variety of sequences to define
   a    cycle.       The      various        cycles       can    be    pre-programmed           by     the
20 washing     machine          manufacturer          or     could     be   programmed          by     the
   user.     Also      envisioned         are     sensors       within the washing machine
   that    could     sense        the  article        load and        the    soil    load.        In     so
   doing,     the     amount        of    treating         agent      to   be     dosed     could        be
   changed to meet the load requirements.
25
   In practice,          the      washing       machine       user    will     load    the     washing
   machine     with      articles       to     be   cleaned.         After      selecting       a    pre
   programmed cycle or selecting segments which form a cycle, the
   washing machine is turned on.

   Water hardness       sensors    can be used.       The water hardness          sensor
   could   be   an   ion    selective     electrode      or   detectors      which     can
   measure   the   amount      of calcium      and/or magnesium        in   the water.
   The sensor can be preset such that depending upon the hardness
 5 of the    water,    an    appropriate      amount    of water      treating     agent
   can  be   added.      Water hardness         is  classified      by the U.S.        De
   partment of Interior and the Water Quality Association and can
   range from soft water          (0-17 mg/l or ppm of hardness) to moder
   ately hard water         (60-120 mg/l or ppm of hardness) to hard wa
10 ter  (120-180 mg/l or ppm of hardness) to very hard water (>180
   mg/l or ppm of hardness).            The amount of water treatment agent
   needed to be added to adjust              the incoming water to an appro
   priate water hardness          can be programmed         into the sensor.           Ad
   ditionally, various types of water treatment agents are avail
15 able   and the     sensor     can  be   programmed      to   identify     the   water
   treatment agents        in   the cartridge       through manufacturer's           sen
   sors identifying the agents which are placed on a cartridge.
   Once   the water      hardness     has   been    adjusted     to   an   appropriate
20 level,   infrared      and/or    ultra violet       sensors    which     are placed
   within the washing machine can do a survey of the load to de
   termine    the type      and quantity       of load.       For   example,     the     IR
   and/or UV     sensors      could send out       signals     to survey the load.
   Both enzyme     sensitive and hard to remove               stains,     as discussed
25 above, could be detected.             If the majority of the stains were
   detected    to   be hard to       remove     stains,    for   example,     red con
   taining    stains    which     could   be     indicative     of   a   tomato    based
   stain -   identified above as preferably treated by the use of a
   hypohalite detergent.            If detected,       then   a logic      switch    con
30 nected to the       sensor would then send a signal                to the chamber
   containing     the    hypohalite     to    be   dispensed     and    thus   a   first

                                    -23
   wash  segment  could be   commenced.     Thereafter,    once this wash
   segment  was  complete,   the water   in   the  cavity   could be  dis
   charged, new water loaded, again check for water hardness, and
   then the enzymatic detergent could be charged into the machine
 5 and the   second wash   segment   could commence.       Once this  wash
   segment was complete, the water in the cavity could be removed
   and the rinse segment(s) could commence.
   Those in the art will appreciate that if the IR and/or UV sen
10 sors  detected  more   protein  type    stains    (for  example,  egg),
   then the first wash segment would be conducted using an amount
   of enzymatic detergent dosed into the cavity.          The second wash
   segment  would  then  be   conducted   using   the   hypohalite  deter
   gent.
