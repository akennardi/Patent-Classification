SMOKE ALARM DEVICE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION MODULE
THEREFOR
Field
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a smoke alarm device and a wireless communication
module therefor, more particularly to a smoke alarm device with a controller and an input/output
interface and a wireless communication module therefor.
Background
[0002] For many years, regulatory requirements have been enforced to require safety inspector
to carry out regular and on-demand safety inspections for smoke alarm devices, particularly for
rental properties. Such safety compliance requirements entail scheduling of an inspection time
where one is expected to be present to provide access to the inspector at the time and location of
the scheduled inspection, which can be inconvenient.
[0003] Moreover, such access may not always be requested or available. In a scenario where a
smoke alarm at an unoccupied dwelling is falsely triggered and needs to be deactivated during a
late night, such access may not be readily available and may warrant forced entry, which may
result in damage.
Object of Invention
[0004] It is an object of the present disclosure to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.
Summary of Invention
[0005] According to one aspect, there is provided a wireless communication module for a
smoke alarm device, the smoke alarm device having a controller and an input/output (I/O)
interface operatively associated therewith, wherein the wireless communication module is
adapted to permit data communication from the controller via the I/O interface through the
wireless communication module via a wireless network, wherein the wireless communication
module is compliant with a cellular-based communication protocol.

                                                   2
[0006] According to another aspect, there is provided a smoke alarm device comprising: a
controller; and a wireless communication module operable to permit data communication from
the controller therethrough via a wireless network, wherein the wireless communication module
is compliant with a cellular-based communication protocol.
[0007] It is envisaged that a platform may be provided for remote control and monitoring of the
smoke alarm devices via the network. The platform may, for example, be provided by a server
device and configured to receive information (e.g., status information) from the smoke alarm
devices via the network. Information thus received by the platform may be accessible by client
devices (e.g., smartphones) via the network. Remote monitoring of the smoke alarm devices by,
for example, real estate agents may thus be realised. The real estate agents may thus monitor, for
example, alarm statuses associated with their rental properties and, in the event of an alarm
abnormality, respond accordingly. Remote control of the smoke alarm devices may also be
realised by way of the platform. For example, control signals may be sent from the platform to
silent one or more of the smoke alarm devices. Control signals for other purposes may also be
sent. The platform may also be configured to allow partial or full access. For example, real
estate agents may be provided with full access for internally monitoring and actioning alert
while non-agent users may be provided with partial access.
Brief Description of Drawings
[0008] At least one embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described with reference
to the accompanying drawings, of which:
[0009] Figure 1 shows an example system according to the present disclosure; and
[0010] Figure 2 shows a functional block diagram of each smoke alarm device in the system of
Figure 1.
Detailed Description
[0011] Like elements are denoted by similar reference numerals in the accompanying drawings.
[0012] Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a system comprising a plurality of smoke alarm
devices 10, a network 20 (e.g., the Internet), a first computing device 30 in the form of a cellular

                                                  3
telephone, a second computing device 40 in the form of a personal computer (PC), a third
computing device 50 in the form of a server device associated with a database (not shown).
[0013] The smoke alarm devices 10 are shown to be arranged at a dwelling. In this embodiment,
some of the smoke alarm devices 10 lack integrated communication modules while others of the
smoke alarm devices 10' have integrated communication modules.
[0014] Specifically, Figure 2A shows a functional block diagram of each smoke alarm 10
including a controller 12 and an input/output (1/0) interface 14 electrically connected thereto.
The smoke alarm 10 is provided with a communication module 16, which is connected to the
controller 12 via the I/O interface 14. The communication module 16 is adapted to permit data
communication to and from the controller 12 via the 1/0 interface 14 through the
communication module 16 via the network 20.
[0015] Figure 2B shows a functional block diagram of each smoke alarm device 10' including a
controller 12' and a communication module 16'operatively associated therewith. The
communication module 16' is operable to permit data communication from the controller 12
therethrough via the network 20.
[0016] Data communication to and from each smoke alarm device 10, 10' may be directly via
the network 20 or via another one of the smoke alarm device 10, 10'. That is to say, the smoke
alarm devices 10, 10' are operable to form an ad-hoc on-demand network capable of data
routing thereamong (e.g., routing). Data transmission among the smoke alarm devices 10 is
implemented at least one of wirelessly and wiredly.
[0017] In the presence of a dedicated gateway router device (not shown) at the dwelling, such
data communication may take place via the gateway router device. That is, the gateway router
device may serve as a gateway to an external network (e.g., the network 20). Where there is no
dedicated router device, one of the smoke alarm devices 10 may serve as a gateway for similar
purposes.
[0018] The communication module 16, 16' of each smoke alarm device 10, 10' is compatible
with at least one of cellular-based (e.g., 3G, 4G, LTE, as well as low-power cellular-based
protocols such as Sigfox, Cat M1, NarrowBand IoT), IEEE 802.11-based (e.g., WiFi and MiFi),
LoRa-based, and IEEE 802.15-based (e.g., Bluetooth and ZigBee) communication protocols.

                                                  4
The communication module 16, 16' may also be compatible with other suitable communication
protocols not described herein.
[0019] Depending on the configuration of the communication modules 16, 16', the network may
comprise a base station for cellular communication.
[0020] The controller 12, 12' is configured to send status information of the corresponding
smoke alarm device 10, 10' via the corresponding communication module 16, 16' through the
network 20 to at least one of the devices 30-50. Where the communication module 16, 16' is
capable of cellular communication, the status information is, in one configuration, sent in the
form of a short messaging service (SMS) message. Communication to the communication
module 16, 16' via the network 20 may also be in the form of an SMS message. The status
information may also be sent in any other suitable forms, such as emails, telephone calls, and
notifications (e.g., smartphone applications).
[0021] In this embodiment, the controller 12, 12' is configured to send the status information on
a regular basis. In other embodiments, the controller 12, 12' may be configured to send the
status information upon receipt of a polling signal received via the network 20 from, for
example, the server device 50. The status information may also be sent by the controller 12, 12'
in response to a one-off request signal received from the devices 30, 40 via the network 20.
[0022] For each smoke alarm devices 10, the communication module 16 is adapted to be
powered by the corresponding smoke alarm 10, more particularly by a battery therein. Where
the smoke alarm devices 10 are powered by a mains power source, the communication module
16 may also be powered by the mains power source directly or indirectly via the battery.
[0023] In this embodiment, the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' are configured to form a logical
group in the ad-hoc network, where operation of the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' is controlled
in accordance with a control signal received via the network 20 from the devices 30-50.
Specifically, data communicated from one of the smoke alarm device 10, 10' to another one of
the smoke alarm device 10, 10' may serve to control operation thereof. In the ad-hoc network of
Figure 1, the control signal is received by the controller 12, 12' of one of the smoke alarm
devices 10, 10' via the network 20, causing the controller 12, 12' to control operation of the
smoke alarm device 10, 10' accordingly and to send a corresponding signal to another one of the
smoke alarm device 10, 10' in the logical group. The controller 12, 12' of said another one of

                                                  5
the smoke alarm device 10, 10', upon receipt of the corresponding signal, controls operation of
said another one of the smoke alarm device 10, 10' and sends a further corresponding signal to
yet another one of the smoke alarm device 10, 10'. In such a manner, only one control signal
needs to be sent to the logical group of smoke alarm devices 10, 10 to cause control operation
thereof. For example, the control signal may cause the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' to emit an
alarm signal. The control signal may also cause the smoke alarm to acknowledge (e.g., to
silence) an alarm signal.
[0024] It should be noted that said one of the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' may also be pre
configured to perform similar operations among the logical group.
[0025] Alternatively, communication among the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' may be achieved
via the network 20. One smoke alarm device 10, 10' may send data to another smoke alarm
device 10, 10' via a cellular base station forming part of the network 20.
[0026] For each smoke alarm devices 10, the communication module 16 may be arranged
within or outside of a cover of the smoke alarm device 10. Where the cover is of a size
incapable of accommodating the communication module 16, the cover may be replaced with one
with a more suitable size to accommodate the communication module 16.
[0027] Depending on the form of the I/O interface 14, the communication module 16 may be
connected thereto by means of, for example, soldering and connectors.
[0028] One or more of the devices 30-50 may be configured to run a software package suitable
for receiving and collecting data from the smoke alarm devices 10, 10'. The data thus received
may relate to, for example, a battery status, a mains power status (e.g., connection and
disconnection) and an alarm/alert status. Such data may also indicate battery removal, battery
percentage, and alarm device malfunction,
[0029] By virtue of the communication modules 16, 16', the status of one or more of the smoke
alarm devices 10, 10' can be provided remotely to associated devices 30-50, which eliminates or
alleviates the abovementioned inconveniences of the prior art arrangements where access to the
dwelling for inspection of smoke alarm devices has to be requested and arranged beforehand.

                                                  6
[0030] In particular, where the wireless communication module 16, 16' is compatible with a
cellular-based communication protocol, control and monitoring of the smoke alarm devices 10,
10' may be achieved without the need for a local area network (e.g., 802.11) or the like to be
arranged. Such is useful in that the monitoring and control of each device 10, 10' can be
achieved independent of presence and reliability of a local area network. In an example
scenario, such remote monitoring can be performed for smoke alarm devices located at rental
properties even without the need for tenants of the properties to first arrange for Internet
connections. In addition, because cellular networks are operated by service providers rather than
individuals and are generally designed to be more robust than local area networks, the smoke
alarm devices 10, 10' are more reliable at least insofar as remote control and remote monitoring
are concerned. The cellular capability in concert with ad-hoc network forming capability, one or
more cellular connections provided by one or more of the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' may be
used for communication of all of smoke alarm devices 10, 10' with the devices 30-50, thereby
saving implementation costs.
[0031] It is envisaged that a service portal may be provided on one or more of the devices 30-50
for the purpose of monitoring and control of the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' as described
above.
[0032] In the event of fire, data sent from the smoke alarm devices 10, 10' indicates an
abnormal status, allowing relevant personnel and authorities to be notified of the event.
[0033] It is also envisaged that further functionalities, such as monitoring and reporting in
relation to carbon monoxide and air quality, be implemented in the devices 10, 10'.
