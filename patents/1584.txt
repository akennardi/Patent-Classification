                               A RECREATIONAL DEVICE FOR PETS
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]        The present invention relates to a recreational device for pets and, more particularly
to a pet restraint.
BACKGROUND
[0002]        Many parks, beaches and other public places require that dogs be on a leash at all
times. Dog owners are limited in their ability to relax in these public places due to the fact that
they have to restrain their dogs at all times.
[0003]        A stake can be placed into the ground and a leash can be tied to it. However, stakes
can be levered out of the ground by a dog pulling on the leash. Moreover, stakes are only
configured to be placed in dirt, and not on other surfaces, such as sand, concrete, timber decks,
snow or rocky terrain.
[0004]        A portable restraint for a dog was disclosed in prior art United States Patent
publication number US 20070289555 (although this does not constitute an admission that the
publication forms part of the common general knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other
country). However, that portable restraint can be easily tipped over by a dog. In addition, the
restraint can also choke the dog if it puts sufficient force on the leash.
[0005]        Animal tethers are disclosed in US 7984698, US 4738222 and US 4546730.
However these devices are bulky for storage when not in use and are not easily transported.
[0006]        It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to herein, this
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part of the common
general knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0007]        The present invention is directed to a recreational device for pets, which may at
least partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned disadvantages or provide the
consumer with a useful or commercial choice.
[0008]        With the foregoing in view, the present invention in one form, resides broadly in a

                                                   2
recreational device for pets and, more particularly to a pet restraint.
[0009]       Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any
one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.
The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as an
acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common general
knowledge.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0010]       According to the present invention there is provided a restraint device for at least
one animal, the device comprising:
    (a) a base attached to the ground;
    (b) a flexible shaft supported in the base and configured to absorb a pull force from the

be activated by the user of the device.
Preferably, the height of the flexible shaft which is supported in the base is adjustable. More
preferably, the height of the flexible shaft may be adjusted by using a bung which is inserted
into the shaft and causes it to bulge at a point where it abuts a hole in the base and thereby
affixes the height of the shaft in the base.
Preferably, the flexible shaft is configured to receive a shade implement.
Preferably, the shaft includes a plug which is affixed to the end of the shaft within the base and
is wider than the hole in the base so that the shaft cannot be fully withdrawn out of the top of
the base.

                                                    3
Preferably, the attachment point may be rotatable to provide for free movement of the animal
around the flexible shaft without its leash becoming tangled or wrapped around.
Preferably, resistive forces of the flexible shaft increases with the increasing pull force of the
animal to prevent an initial resistive force of flexible shaft chocking the animal.
Preferably, at least one pair of opposing edges of the platform is configured to interlock to
provide for stable wrapping of the platform around the base for transportation. Preferably, the
platform is configured to be covered with material to provide stability for the base.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0020]        Figures 1 to 6 show an embodiment of the present invention as a device 10 for
restraining a dog 12. The device 10 has a platform 14 which is configured to receive a base 16.
A rim 18 of the base 16 holds it in the platform 14 (see figure 3). The base 16 has a lid 20
which has a hole 22 that supports a flexible shaft 24. The flexible shaft 24 is configured to
receive a post 34 of an umbrella 26 in one end of the shaft 24. The umbrella 26 provides shade
for the dog 12. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that other animals can be restrained
with the device 10 without departing from the scope of the present invention.
[0021]       A bowl 28 can be removably attached to the lid 20. Pins 30 on the lid 20 connect
with holes 29 on the bowl 28 in order to support the bowl 28 on the lid 20. The bowl 28 is
collapsible for ease of storage.
[0022]        The base 16 has a compartment 32 (see figures 3 and 4) which is waterproof and
air- tight. It can be used for storage of objects such as a user's keys, wallet or phone. The
compartment 32 also has the capacity to hold water and food for the dog 12. The water or food
can be dispensed into the bowl 28 via a dispenser (not shown) on activation by the dog 12 or
owner.
[0023]       As shown in figures 5 and 6, the flexible shaft 24 is configured to receive a post 34
of the umbrella 26 in a first end 36 of the flexible shaft 24. At the opposite end of the flexible
shaft 24 there is a shaft end cap 38 which holds a clip 40. A leash 42 (see Figures 1 and 2) of
the dog 12 can be attached to the clip 40. The clip 40 is connected to a D-ring 43 which is
connected to a swivel pin 44 through a washer 46.
[0024]       A rotatable collar ring 27 (see Figure 1) is attached to the post 34 of the umbrella
26. A quick release spring clip 29 (see Figure 1) enables the leash 42 to be connected to the
rotatable collar ring 27.   The dog 12 can then run around the device 10 without its leash 42
becoming tangled or wrapped around the post 34 of the umbrella 26.
[0025]       As shown in figure 2, the flexible shaft 24 can be positioned so that the clip 40 is
upward. The leash 42 of the dog 12 can then be attached to the clip 40. In this embodiment of
the invention, the umbrella 26 is not used.
[0026]        The flexible shaft 24 is made of a composition of flexible polyurethane with the
following properties:

                           (1-lb                                                          lb mass)
                           mix)
[0027]       The flexible shaft 24 is so flexible that it would fold when pulled by the dog 12 on
the leash 42 if not for a bung 48 (see Figures 3 to 6). The bung 48 is made of acetylene plastic.
It provides rigidity to the flexible shaft 24. The bung 48 is jammed into the flexible shaft 24.
At the point in which it is jammed it creates a bulge in the flexible shaft 24. The bulge holds
the flexible shaft 24 against the hole 22 in the lid 20. The position of the bung 48 determines
the height of the flexible shaft 24 in the bung 48. The height of the flexible shaft 24 can be
increased for a large dog and decreased for a small dog. The bung 48 can be pulled out of the
flexible shaft 24 by a draw string 50 (shown in Figure 4), which is affixed to the bung 48 using
a nut 52 (shown in Figures 5 and 6).
[0028]        As shown in figure 2, the shaft 24 is configured to flex to an angle from the
horizontal 0 when the dog 12 moves away from the shaft 24. This enables the resistive force of
the pole to increase with the increasing pull force of the dog, without providing an instant
resistive force on the leash 42 which could otherwise choke the dog 12.
[0029]        The flexible shaft 24 also confers an order of magnitude higher resistive force on
the shaft 24 of the present invention than the rigid poles of the prior art. Rigid poles are easily
levered out of the ground because all of the force exerted by the leash of the dog levers the base
of the pole out of the ground.
[0030]       A plug 54 (shown in Figures 3 and 4) is inserted into the end 36 of the flexible shaft
24 after insertion of the flexible shaft 24 through the lid 20 and the base 16. The plug 54 has
sloping edges, with the bottom of the plug 24 being larger than the hole 22 in the lid 20. The
plug 54 prevents the shaft 24 from being pulled out of the hole 22 in the lid 20 by the force of
the dog 12 pulling on the leash 42 which is connected to the flexible shaft 24.
[0031]       The platform 14 can be anchored to the ground by various means of fasteners (for
example tent pegs) through the holes 56. The platform 14 can also be buried under sand, rocks

                                                  6
or snow. In addition, the platform 14 could be bolted to concrete pavements outside cafes or
veterinary surgeries, nailed to a timber deck, anchored to the tray of utility vehicles, anchored to
the ground at camp sites, or in parks, alongside football fields, or on beaches.
[0032]       The platform 14 has interlocking edges. This enables additional platforms to be
connected to the central platform 14. This increases the surface area over which sand or other
material can be deposited in order to cover the central platform 14 and anchor it to the ground.
The platform 14 is made of a flexible and resilient material such as rubber. When the platform
14 is to be transported, two sides of the platform 14 can be wrapped over or around the base 16
and interlocked together, so that the platform 14 forms a cylindrical shape. The restraint device
10 can then be packed into a bag for easy transport and storage when not in use.
