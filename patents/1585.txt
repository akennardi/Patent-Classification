  the Summary Section of the present application for patent. Most compounds of
  the invention contain one or more asymmetric centers, such that the compounds
  may exist in enantiomeric as well as in diastereomeric forms. In fact, most of
  the compounds of the present invention have two asymmetric carbons adjacent
   to one another and therefore can exist in erythro or threo form, with each of
   these two forms having dextrorotatory(D) or levorotary (L) enantiomers.
   Although the threo form is generally preferred in accordance with the present
   invention for analgesic activity, unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the
    scope of the present invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers and
    diastereomeric or racemic mixtures. In light of the foregoing, it should be

WO 2006/081273                                                    PCT/US2006/002557

clearly understood that the designation "DL" or "(+/-)" or "(±)" in this
application includes the pure dextrorotatory enantiomer, the pure levorotatory
enantiomer and all racemic mixtures, including mixtures where the two
enantiomers are present in equal or in unequal proportions. Moreover, for
simplicity sake in many of the structural formulas, such as in the example
below, only one of the enantiomers is actually shown but when the designation
"DL" or "(+/-)" or or "(1)" appears it also includes the enantiomeric form
(mirror image) of the structure actually shown in the formula.
        For Example:
                               OH  0
                                      No

                           DL-threo (only one enantiomer shown)
        Thus, in the example above, only one enantiomer is shown, but because
 the designation "DL" (or or "(+/-)" or "(±)") appears below the formula, its
 'optical isomer

                                DL-threo (the other enantiomer shown)
  and all racemic mixtures of the two optical isomers are also included.
         In the case of some compounds of the present invention one enantiomer
  of the threo, and in some cases of the erythro, enantiomers is significantly more
  active as an analgesic than the other enantiomer of the same pair. For 'this reason
  the isolated enantiomer which is significantly more active than the other is

considered a novel and inventive composition even if the racenic mixture or the
other opposite enantiomer of the same compound have already been described
in the prior art.
        Some of the novel compounds of the present invention contain three or
more asymmetric centers. An example is the following compound

         Keeping the foregoing examples in mind the reader one of ordinary skill
  in the art should readily understand the scope of each described example,
  although in a broad sense all isomers, enantiomers and racemic mixtures are
  within the scope of the invention.
         The term "alkyl" in the general description and defiition of the
   compounds includes straight chain as well as branch-chained alkyl groups.
          Generally speaking the compounds of the invention may form salts with
   pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, and such pharmaceutically

acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula 1 and of Formula 2 are also
within the scope of the invention.
        Referring now to the novel compounds of Formula 1, in a class of
preferred compounds of the invention none of the W, X and Y groups is a
heteroatom. Within this class, compounds are preferred where the sum of m, n
 and q is 3 and the aromatic group is unsubstituted or substituted with one or
 more halogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbons, or halogen substituted alkyl of 1 to 6

         In another class of preferred compounds in accordance with Formula 1
 one of the variables W, X and Y represents a heteroatom, preferably nitrogen
  and the sum of m, n and q is 3.
         In still another class of preferred compounds in accordance with Formula
  1 one or two of the variables W, X and Y represent a heteroatom, selected from
  N, 0 or S and the sum of m, n and q is 2.
          Referring still to the compounds of Formula 1, compounds are preferred
  where R4 is H or an acyl group, more preferably H.
          With reference to the variables R3, compounds in accordance with
   Formula 1 are preferred where both R 3 groups are Hand where one R3 group is
   H and the other is benzyl, monohalogeno, dihalogeno, methyl or methoxy
   substituted benzyl, cyclohexyl, an alkyl of 1 to 7 carbons, COR 7, COOR 7 where
   R is alkyl of 1 to 15 carbons, benzyloxy, phenyl, methoxyphenyl, monohalogen

   alkyl of 1 to 3 carbons.
          Presently still more preferred are Compounds of Formula 2 where R1 and
   R2 jointly with the nitrogen form a five-membered ring, where both R3 groups
   are hydrogen and where one of the R3 groups is hydrogen and the other is

          The presently most preferred novel compounds of the invention are
   disclosed with their structural formulas in the ensuing Tables and or description,
    showing activity of exemplary compounds relevant to their ability to act as
    analgesics and/or immunostimulants.
             BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, MODES OF ADMINISTRATION
           The novel compounds of the invention have analgesic and/or
    immunostimulant activity in mammals. Some of the compounds described in

WO 2006/081273                                                     PCT/US2006/002557
                                          14
the introductory section which per se are known in the art, have been discovered
by the present inventors to also have analgesic effect in mammals. To the best
of the knowledge of the present inventors the analgesic or immunostimulant
biological activity of the known compounds was not known before the present
 discovery.
               An art-accepted model or assay for measuring an analgesic effect
 of a compound in chronic pain (in particular peripheral neuropathy) is the model
 known as Kim and Chung 1992, Pain 150, pp 355-363 (Chung model). This
 model involves the surgical ligation of the L5 (and optionally the L6) spinal
 nerves on one side in experimental animals,. Rats recovering from the surgery
 gain weight and display a level of general activity similar to that of normal rats.
 However, these rats develop abnormalities of the foot, wherein the hindpaw is
 moderately everted and the toes are held together. More importantly, the
 hindpaw on the side affected by the surgery appears to become sensitive to low
 threshold mechanical stimuli and will perceive pain instead of the faint
  sensation of touch. This sensitivity to normally non-painful touch, called "tactile
  allodynia", develops within the first week after surgery and lasts for at least two
  months. The allodynia response includes lifting the affected hindpaw to escape
  from the stimulus, licking the paw and holding it in the air for many seconds.
  None of these responses is normally seen in the control group.
          To produce the tactile allodynia, rats are anesthetized before surgery.
  The surgical site is shaved and prepared either with betadine or Novacaine.
  Incision is made from the thoracic vertebra Xl11 down toward the sacrum.
   Muscle tissue is separated from the spinal vertebra (left side) at the L4 - S2
   levels. The L6 vertebra is located and the transverse process is carefully
   removed with a small rongeur to expose the L4 - L6 spinal nerves. The L5 and
   L6 spinal nerves are isolated and tightly ligated with 6-0 silk thread. The same

WO 2006/081273                                                       PCT/US2006/002557
                                           15
procedure is done on the right side as a control, except no ligation of the spinal
nerves is performed.
         After a complete hemostasis is confined, the wounds are sutured. A
small amount of antibiotic ointment is applied to the incised area, and the rat is
transferred to the recovery plastic cage under a regulated heat-temperature lamp.
         On the day of the experiment, at least seven days after the surgery,
typically six rats per test group are administered the test drugs by intraperitoneal
 (i.p.) injection or oral gavage (p.o.). For i.p. administration, the compounds are
 formulated in H 2 0 and given in a volume of 1 ml/kg body weight by injecting
 into the intraperitoneal cavity. For p.o. administration, the compounds are
 formulated in H 2 0 and given in a volume of 1 ml/kg body weight using an 18
 gauge, 3 inch gavage needle that is slowly inserted through the esophagus into
 the stomach.
          Tactile allodynia is'assessed via von Frey hairs, which are a series of fine
  hairs with incremental differences in stiffness. Rats are placed in a plastic cage
  with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to acclimate for approximately 30
  minutes. To establish the pre-drug baseline, the von Frey hairs are applied
  perpendicularly through the mesh to the mid-plantar region of the rats' hindpaw
  with sufficient force to cause slight buckling and held for 6-8 seconds. The
  applied force has been calculated to range from 0.41 to 15.1 grams. If the paw is
  sharply withdrawn, it is considered a positive response. A normal animal will
  not respond to stimuli in this range, but a surgically ligated paw will be
  withdrawn in response to a 1-2 gram hair. The 50% paw withdrawal threshold is
  determined using the method of Dixon, W.J., Ann. Rev. Phariacol.Toxicol.
   20:441-462 (1980) hereby incorporated by reference. Tactile allodynia is
   measured prior to and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after drug administration. The
   post-drug threshold is compared to the pre-drug threshold and the percent

WO 2006/081273                                                      PCT/US2006/002557
                                           16
reversal of tactile sensitivity is calculated based on a normal threshold of 15.1
grams.
        Table 1 below indicates the degree of pain reversal obtained in the Chung
model with exemplary compounds of the invention. The intraperitonial (i.p.)
 and/or intravenous (iv) administration of the compounds was in doses ranging
 from 1 pg/kg to 300 gg/kg or 3 mg/kg PO and the peak percentage of reversal
 of allodynia was measured at 15, 30 or 60 minutes after administration, as is
 indicated in the table. Data are expressed as the highest   o allodynia reversal
 (out of 3 time points: 15 min, 30 min, or 60 min. post-drug) with a minimum of
 a 20% allodynia reversal in the rat Chung model. Comparisons between groups
 (drug treated vs. saline treated) were made using a two-tailed, 2-sample,
 unpaired t-test. Compounds that are not shown which were not statistically
  analgesic following an IP dose of 300 ug/kg, but may still be analgesic.
  Compounds that do not exhibit significant analgesia at 100 mg/kg are not
  considered to be analgesic.

        An art accepted method for measuring immuno stimulation comprises
 systemic administration of compounds to assay for the ability to stimulate the
 immune system, possibly due to nonspecific upregulation of the

WO 2006/081273                                                      PCT/US2006/002557
                                         27
hemolymphoreticular system. This upregulation could result in increased
numbers of lymphocytes of both T- and B-cell lineage. Although applicant does
not wish to be bound by the biological theory of the immunostimulation, actual
immunostimulatory efficacy of the compounds can be demonstrated in vivo by
assaying splenic size in response to adminstration of the test compound to
laboratory test species rats. Animals dosed at 200 mg/kg of Compound 22 of
this invention exhibited a twentyfive percent increase in spleen size
which demonstrates immunostinmulatory potential of the compound. Generally
 speaking any compound that exhibits splenic enlargement following dosing of
 200 mg/kg or less may be considered an immunostimulant.
 Modes of Administration:
         The compounds of the invention may be administered at
 pharmaceutically effective dosages. Such dosages are normally the minimum
 dose necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect; in the treatment of
 chromic pain, this amount would be roughly that necessary to reduce the
 discomfort caused by the pain to tolerable levels. For human adults such doses
 generally will be in the range 0.1-5000 mg/day; more preferably in the range 1
 to 3000 mg/day, still more preferably in the range of 10 mg to 1000 mg/day.
 However, the actual amount of the compound to be administered in any given
 case will be determined by a physician taking into account the relevant
 circumstances, such as the severity of the pain, the age and weight of the
 patient, the patient's general physical condition, the cause of the pain, and the
 route of administration.
         The compounds are useful in the treatment of pain in a manual;
 particularly a human being. Preferably, the patient will be given the compound
  orally in any acceptable form, such as a tablet, liquid, capsule, powder and the
  like. However, other routes may be desirable or necessary, particularly if the

WO 2006/081273                                                     PCT/US2006/002557
                                           28
patient suffers from nausea. Such other routes may include, without exception,
transdermal, intraperitonial, parenteral, subcutaneous, intranasal, intrathecal,
intramuscular, intravenous and intrarectal modes of delivery. Another aspect of
the invention is drawn to therapeutic compositions comprising the novel
compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these
compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Such an excipient may
be a carrier or a diluent; this is usually mixed with the active compound, or
permitted to dilute or enclose the active compound. If a diluent, the carrier may
be solid, semi-solid, or liquid material that acts as an excipient or vehicle for the
 active compound. The formulations may also include wetting agents,
 emulsifying agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents, and/or flavoring
 agents. If used as in an ophthalmic or infusion format, the formulation will
 usually contain one or more salt to influence the osmotic pressure of the
 formulation.
        In another aspect, the invention is directed to methods for the treatment of
 pain, particularly chronic pain, through the administration of one or more of the
 novel or otherwise known compounds of the invention, or of pharmaceutically
 acceptable salts thereof to a mammal in need thereof. As indicated above, the
 compound will usually be formulated in a form consistent with the desired
 mode of delivery.
        Compounds of the invention which are immunostimulants are
  administered subject to the same basic principles as the compounds having
  analgesic activity, in doses which are best determined on a case-by-case and/or
  species-by-species and, in case of humans, at times on a patient-by-patient
 basis. Generally speaking the effective dose will be in the range of 10 pLg/kg to
  200 mg/kg.

WO 2006/081273                                                    PCT/US2006/002557
                                           29
       In this regard it is noted that the compounds of the threo configuration are
more likely to have the analgesic activity, compounds of the erythro
configuration are more likely to have immunostimulant activity, and among the
erythro compounds those with an.S configuration at carbon 2 of the propionic
acid moiety are likely to have stronger inunno stimulant activity.
       SYNTHETIC METHODS FOR OBTAINING THE COMPOUNDS OF THE
                             INVENTION, EXPERIMENTAL
        The compound of the invention can be synthesized by utilizing the
synthetic methods described in the experimental below, or such modifications of
the below described experimental methods which will become readily apparent
to those skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure.
GENERAL
      1H NMR     spectra were recorded at ambient temperature with an Avance
300 (Bruker) spectrometer. The compounds were analyzed by reverse phase
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters
Autopurification System equipped with a Waters 2525 Pump, a Waters 2696
photodiode array detector, and a XTerra column (Part. No. 186000482, 5 ptm,
 C18, 4.5 x 50 mm).
 The HPLC method used was a gradient of 5 % solvent B to 100 % in 7 min.
 Solvent A was H20 with 0.05 % TFA and solvent B was CH 3CN with 0.05 %
 TFA (Method A).
 Melting points were measured with a Bichi B-545 melting point apparatus and
 were uncorrected. To isolate reaction products the solvent were removed by
 evaporation using a vacuum rotatory evaporator, the water bath temperature not
 exceeding 40 'C.

      Absolute configuration of compounds of the invention, where applicable,
can generally speaking be determined in accordance with methods known in the
state of the art, such as X-ray christallography. Compounds 203 and 204 are
mentioned as examples for which the absolute configurations were determined
by X-ray christallography analysis of the corresponding (1S)-camphanylamide
D-(10) camphorsulfonic acid salt. As a result Compound 204 was assigned (2S,
3R). Its enantiomer, Compound 203 was assigned by default the (2R, 3S)
absolute configuration.

         Thus, in accordance with General Scheme 1, methyl isocyanoacetate (or
 ethyl isocyanoacetate available commercially) is reacted with an "amine" which
 includes the R** groups to provide the 2-isocyanoacetic acid aide derivative
 shown in the general scheme. Typical examples for the amines used in the
 reaction are pyrrolidine, piperidine, azetidine, morpholine, 2,5-dihydro-1H
 pyrrole, dialkylamines such as diethylanine, 3-fluoro-, 3,3-difluoro or 3
 hydroxy substituted pyrrolidines. Specific examples of these "amines" abound
  in the experimental description. The 2-isocyanoacetic acid aide derivative is
  then reacted in the presence of base (such as KOH) with an "aldehyde" which
  includes the R* group to provide a trans "oxazoline" with high

reaction scheme 1. The trans oxazoline is then treated with a strong acid, such
as HCl, to open the ring and to provide the threo-3-substituted-3-hydroxy-2
amino-propionic acid amides (with threo:erythroratios generally > 97:3) of the
invention as shown in General Scheme 1.

pyridyl group can be substituted with an R* group (as defined in connection
with Scheme 1) and the indoline can be susbstituted with other weak
nucleophilic amines of the formula NH(R**) 2 (R"* defined as in connection
with Reaction Scheme 1) to provide other compounds of Formula 1 analogous
to compounds 242 and 243.
        Isomerically pure and/or enantiomerically pure compounds and further,
derivatives of the 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-2-amino-propionic acid aides are
obtained by separation techniques and reactions which, per se, are well known
to the synthetic chemist. The experimental section of the present invention
 abounds in examples of such separation techniques and reactions. Some of the
typical separation techniques and reactions are generally described below.
        Separation of threo and erythro isomers, when both are formed in the
 reactions leading to the compounds of the invention, can typically be separated
 by chromatographic methods. The more abundantly formed threo isomers can
 also be converted into the erythro isomers by oxidizing to the ketone level the
 hydroxyl group in the 3 position of the propanoic acid moiety and subsequently
 reducing the resulting ketone to the hydroxyl level. (See, for example, the
 preparation of Compound 219).
         Separation of enantiomeric mixtures can be performed on Chiralpack
 columns which are well known in the art. (See, for example, the preparation of
 Compound 204).
         The amino function in the 2-position of the propanoic acid moiety is,
 generally speaking, more reactive towards acylation and carbamoylation than
 the hydroxyl group in the 3 position. Therefore, acylated derivatives of the 2
  amino function can be prepared by using acyl chlorides such as acetyl chloride
  and hexanoyl chloride. (See, Method G and the preparation of Compound 51).
  Carbamate derivatives of the 2-amino function can be obtained by using

WO 2006/081273                                                       PCT/US2006/002557
                                           35
chloroformates, such as benzylchlorofonnate. (See, foi- example, the
preparation of Compound 58). The tertiary butyl carbamoyl function can also
serve as a removable protecting group of the 2-amino function. (see for example
the preparation of Compounds 219 and 224). When the 2-amino function of the
compounds of the invention is already acylated or bears a carbamoyl group,
then the 3-hydroxy group of the propanoic acid moiety can be subjected to
acylation by reagents such as acetic anhydride. (See for example the
preparation of Compound 217).
        Alkylation of the 2-amino function is readily performed by condensing
the compound bearing the 2-NH 2 group with an aldehyde to obtain a Schiff base
intermediate which can be reduced, without isolation, to provide the N-alkyl,
 arylalkyl or heteroaryl-alkyl compound. The procedure described for preparing
 Compound 234 can be generalized to make compounds of the invention where
 the 2-amino function bears an aryl( hydroxy)alkyl or heteroaryl(hydroxy)alkyl
 group.
        Several compounds of the invention of Formula 2 can be obtained by
 derivatization of compounds of Formula 1, or by such modification of the
 synthetic routes leading to compounds of Formula 1 which will become readily
 apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure. For
 example, compounds of Formula 2 where R9 is OH or OR,, and Rio is alkyl
  can be made by using a "ketone" bearing the RIO group, instead of the
  "aldehyde" in General Reaction Scheme 1.
        Compounds of Formula 2 where the R9 and Ri0 groups jointly form an
  oxime (NOH) group can be obtained by oxidizing the 3-hydroxyl group of the
  propanoic acid moiety to the ketone stage and reacting the resulting ketone with
  hydroxylamine.

15 mL of a mixture CH 2Cl 2:2-PrOH (9:1). The organic phase was dried over
MgSO 4 and evaporated to afford 163 mg (70 %) of the corresponding free base
of Compound 214.
Analytical chiral separation:
        20 pL of a 1 mg/mL solution of Compound 214 were injected on
Chiralpak AD: flow-rate = 1 mL/min, temperature = 25 0 C, mobile phase
hexane:ethanol= 7:3, detection on UV 220 nm and on polarimeter, first eluted
diastereoisomer Compound 248 Rtl(-) = 20.94 min, second eluted
diastereoisomer Rt2(+) = 24.77 min, kl(-) = 5.93, k2(+) = 7.20, ca   = 1.21 and
resolution Rs = 1.21. The integration of the UV signal gives 42 % for the first
 diastereoisomer compound 248 and 58 % for the second Compound 249 (the
 UV response is different for the two diastereoisomers).
 Semi-preparative chiral separation:
        170 mg of the free base of Compound 214 were dissolved in 6 mL of
 ethanol, and 30 pL of this solution were injected every 9 min on Chiralpak AD
 H, flow-rate = 2 m/min, mobile phase hexane:ethanol = 7:3, detection on UV
 220 nm. 195 successive injections were done. The two main fractions were
 identified on UV and collected in two different flasks. The solvent was removed
 in vacuo at 30 'C. The resulting solid was dissolved in 50 ml of CH 2Cl 2 and
 then filtered on a 0.45 pm millipore membrane. After evaporation of CH 2 Cl 2,
 the solid was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol and then filtered. For the free base
 of the first diastereoisomer, a new series of injections was needed to remove
 two UV-visible impurities collected in the same flask: in the same
 chromatographic conditions, 30 injections of 100 p.L of a 25 mg/mL solution
 were made every 20 min. The salts Compound 248 and Compound 249 were
