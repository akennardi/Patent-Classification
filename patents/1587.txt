                                  Auto Twine Watering for Plants
 Abstraction
IAPPY TWINE WATERING SPIKE" probe is working as the following
  1)  Dripping water drop by drop self-watering feed for indoor and outdoor plants.
  2)  Controlling drop by drop with constant volume rate by capillary action in nature trees.
  3)  Emitting drop by drop with constant flow rate from full to last drop of empty bottle.
  4)  Dripping Rate from few drops per minute to few drops per hour suitable weeks/months.
  5) Estimate the total time dripping for each bottle by convert 20 drops as same as 1 cm 3 or 1ml

                                    TWINE-HAPPY WATERING SPIKE-INNOVATION
                                      Auto Twine Watering for Plants
    A. Descriptions
        1: Capillary action (sometimes capillarity, capillary motion, or wicking) is the ability of a
liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition to, external forces like
gravity.
        2: U-tube downward drips water by a drop at constant flow rate with gravitation-density force.
        3: Cotton string works as narrow tube for Capillary action to drive volume water up (h2) and
        downward for rate (hi) in Fig3
    B. How does it work
    1) (a) "Water Level Gate" has designed to control water level in (e) "Water buffer reservoir" and
        regulate water level from (f) "Water storage reservoir" to set steady level of water surface from base
        bottom (h3 ) in (Fig4)
    2) (al) "Air pressure & Water release Gate" has designed to control air pressure inside bottle for
        release water to (e) "Water buffer reservoir" from (f) "Water storage reservoir" when pressure is
        balancing in (f) "Water storage reservoir" then water to stop releasing, (h3) is always same level.
    3) (b) "Control volume rate lever" has designed to control level water "h2 " (fig4) to control volume water
        to drive up by capillary action by cotton rope.
    4) (c) "Control flow rate lever" has designed to control level water "h1 " length (fig4) to control flow rate
        by capillary gravity action by length cotton rope. "hi" long is fast rate or "hi" short is slow rate
        dropping.
    5) (h) "water cap" lever has fabricated between (a) "Water Level Gate", (b)"Control volume rate lever"
        and (c) "Control flow rate lever" to seal water over flow of (e) "Water buffer reservoir".
