APPARATUS FOR SPREADING AND FINISHING A SPREADABLE MATERIAL
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates to an apparatus for spreading and press finishing a
spreadable material. More particularly, the present invention provides an apparatus for
shaping and finishing external corners, internal corners, edges of substrates and the like
with a spreadable material.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002] The following discussion of the background art is intended to facilitate an
understanding of the present invention only. The discussion is not an acknowledgement
or admission that any of the material referred to is or was part of the common general
knowledge as at the priority date of the application.
[0003] In both commercial and residential buildings, walls and other substrate surfaces
are typically finished with a final cementitious, gypsum or lime based surface coating.
Such finishing requires a semi-soft coating to be applied to a substrate and then evenly
spread out to achieve a flat and uniform surface finish. Whilst standard trowels are
employed to spread various materials evenly and smoothly across flat surfaces, their
use is limited when intricate shapes and sharp like angles are encountered.
[0004] During the finishing process, the corners (whether inside or outside) where two
adjacent corner walls meet a plaster coating is applied more or less "rounded" or sharp
to obtain a relatively mechanically durable finish in the corner region and also for
aesthetic purposes. Achieving a uniform and smooth finish is a slow and difficult task,
requiring skill on the part of the user. Due to their rigid construction, flat surface
standard trowels do not assist in the finishing of corners to a high standard. As would
be understood by a person skilled in the art, the common method of finishing corners is
to use a piece of pliable material, such as cardboard or plastic, which is then manually
bent into a curvature which matches that of the corner. The makeshift tool is then
dragged along the corner surface. Such makeshift means lack structural integrity and
are difficult to grip and control, and thus leaving a poorly finished surface with variations
in the radii of corner surfaces.

                                               2
[0005] Therefore, those skilled in the art will appreciate that it would be highly desirable
to provide a tool adapted for finishing and applying various plaster materials to corners,
edges and the like which will greatly facilitate the efficiency and uniformity by which
such corners, edges and the like may be formed with a plaster material in a smooth
rounded or sharp configuration.
[0006] The present invention seeks to overcome, or at least ameliorate, one or more of
the deficiencies of the prior art mentioned above, or to provide the consumer with a
useful and effective commercial choice.
[0007] Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word
comprises" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to
imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any
other integer or group of integers.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0008] In accordance with the present invention there is provided an apparatus for
spreading a spreadable material the apparatus comprising:
       a planar body portion having at least one recess extending from an outer edge of
       the planar body portion; and
       a wiper blade,
wherein at least a portion of the wiper blade extends across the or each recess.
[0009] Preferably, the planar body portion is constructed from a rigid material. In one
form of the present invention, the planar body material is manually flexible.
[0010] In one form of the present invention, the planar body portion comprises two or
more recesses. In one form of the present invention, the planar body portion comprises
three or more recesses. Preferably, where the apparatus comprises multiple recesses,
a portion of the wiper extends across each recess.
[0011] In one form of the present invention, the planar body portion is constructed from
a material selected from the group consisting of: metals, plastics (material consisting of
any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are

                                              3
malleable and can be moulded into solid objects), vinyls and elastomeric compounds,
solid metal material, alloys such as titanium, zinc and aluminium alloys, HST aluminium,
431 stainless steel, 17-4 stainless steel, Ti-alloy, galvanized steel, margin metal, bi
metal, tungsten insert, injection moulded plastics, ceramics, graphite, boron, KEVLAR@
material and other synthetic materials, carbon fibre, resin, fiberglass, composites, wood,
laminated wood, and compositions thereof.
[0012] In a preferred form of the present invention, the wiper blade is constructed from a
soft pliable material. Preferably, the wiper blade is constructed of an elastomeric
material.   More preferably, the wiper blade is constructed from any one of the following
materials: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
polyethylene terephthalate, polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), ethylene propylene diene
(EPDM) rubber, nitrile rubber, styrene butadine rubber, silicon rubber, liquid silicon
rubber.
[0013] In one form of the present invention, the wiper blade is underlayed beneath the
planar body portion such that at least a portion of the wiper blade extends across the or
each recess.
[0014] In one form of the present invention the wiper blade is directly bonded to the
planar body portion. In a highly preferred form of the present invention, the bottom face
of the planar body portion is provided with an inset adapted to receive the wiper blade
therein.
[0015] In an alternative form of the present invention, the wiper blade is integrally
formed with the planar body portion. When the wiper blade is integrally formed with the
planar body portion it is envisaged that the wiper blade and planar body portion may
both be constructed of the same material. Preferably, where the wiper blade and planar
body portion are integrally formed, the thickness of the wiper blade is less than the
planar body. It is envisaged that the thinner material will be more pliable than the
thicker material.
[0016] In one form of the present invention, the wiper blade is shaped to adapt to a wall
corner. Preferably, the profile of the portion of the wiper blade that extends across the
or each recess is shaped to adapt to a wall corner.      It is envisaged that the wiper blade
may be shaped in any manner to further assist in the finishing of the corner. Preferably,

                                              4
the wiper blade is preformed with an upward deformation. More preferably, the profile
of the wiper blade describes an arc spanning the width of the or each recess.
Alternatively, the wiper blade is pitched across the or each recess in an apex
configuration. Where the wiper blade is not integrally formed with the planar body
portion, it is envisaged that the wiper blade will pass from the bottom face of the planar
body portion upwardly through the or each recess and down through the or each recess
to the bottom face of the planar body portion.
[0017] In one form of the present invention the or each recess is generally 'V shaped,
having its greatest width at the edge of the planar body portion.
[0018] In one form of the present invention, the edges of the or each recess are
reinforced. Preferably, spines are placed on the top face of the planar body portion
along the edges of the or each recess.
[0019] In one form of the present invention, the working edge of the wiper blade extends
a distance beyond the edge of the planar body portion.
[0020] In one form of the present invention, a handle is provided on the planar body
surface. In one form of the present invention, the handle is integrally formed with the
planar body portion. In an alternative form of the present invention, the handle is
removably attached to the planar body portion. It is envisaged that where the handle is
removably attached, a handle receiving portion is provided on the planar body surface
to receive the handle.
[0021] In one form of the present invention, the apparatus further comprises an
attachment suitable for delivering the material to be spread. Preferably the attachment
it adapted to be positioned on a caulk tube.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0023] In Figures 1 to 6 there is shown an apparatus 10 for spreading a spreadable
material in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus
10 comprises a planar body portion 12 and a wiper blade 14.
[0024] The planar body portion 12 is provided with a top face 16, an opposite bottom
face 18, first and second edges 20, 22, respectively, a rear edge 24 and a forward
working edge 26. A recess 28 is provided in the planar body portion 12. The recess 28
is defined by edges 29. The recess 28 extends from the forward working edge 26 into
to the planar body portion. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the recess 26 is
generally 'V,' shaped, being wider at the working edge 26, with the width gradually
reducing as the recess 28 extends into the body portion 12. The recess 28 is
particularly characterised by an arcuate central portion 30 at the point at which the

                                                6
recess 28 terminates. The arcuate central portion 30 is adapted to allow for a certain
amount of flex of the wiper blade 14.
[0025] The planar body portion 12 is formed from a sheet of relatively rigid, but manually
pliable material. The character of the material from which the planar body portion 12 is
formed must be such that, while manually pliable, the apparatus is sufficiently rigid to
maintain its shape during the normal course of use to form and finish corners and edges
of a structure with a spreadable material. To provide additional strength to the planar
body portion 12, spines 31 may be disposed on the top face 16.
[0026] The wiper blade 14 is underlayed beneath the planar body portion 12 on the
bottom face 18. The wiper blade 14 is constructed from a single piece of elastomeric
material which is preferably injected moulded or adhesively bonded directly to the
planar body portion 12. The wiper blade 14 is provided with a forward wiping edge 32
which extends forwardly beyond the forward working edge 26 of the planar body portion
12. As best shown in Figures 2 and 3, the wiper blade 14 extends across the recess
28. As shown in Figure 5, the bottom face 18 of the planar body portion 12 is be
provided with an insert 34 which is adapted to receive the wiper blade 14.
[0027] The wiper blade 14 may be fabricated from any suitable material such as natural
or synthetic rubbers, polyvinylchloride or other elastomeric plastics.
[0028] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus 10 is adapted
for use in the finishing of corners. It is envisaged that a user will align the corner to be
finished with the recess 28 so as to engage the wiper blade 14 with the corner. The
apparatus 10 can then be manually moved along the edge of the corner and the wiper
blade 14 will smooth the spreadable material as the apparatus is moved along the edge.
In such a manner, the flex of the wiper blade 14 is limited by the dimensions of the
recess.
[0029] In the embodiment shown in the figures, the wiper blade 14 has a shaped central
portion 36 provided at the portion of the wiper blade 14 that extends across the recess
28. The curved central portion 36 is preformed with an upward deformation to define a
corner engaging deformation 38. In this arrangement, the wiper blade 14 passes from
the bottom of the planar body portion 12 upwards through the recess 28 and around the
edges 29. The corner engaging deformation 38 shown in the Figures is generally

                                                7
curved throughout its width to define a bell shape. It is envisaged that the shaped
central portion 36 could also comprise two opposed and converging faces which come
together at an apex.
[0030] On the top face 16 of the planar body portion 12 there is provided with a handle
receiving portion 40. The handle receiving portion 40 is provided with a handle
engagement channel 42 which is adapted to releasably receive a handle 44 (as shown
in Figure 1). The handle 44 is provided with an engaging portion 46, which is adapted
to be received by the handle engagement channel 42. The handle 44 also comprises a
hand engagement portion 48 and stem 50 connecting the hand engagement portion 48
and the engaging portion 46. In is envisaged that the handle 44 may alternatively be
integrally formed with the planar body portion 10.
[0031] As indicated previously, the apparatus is designed to apply and smooth various
compounds and plasters to outside corners and edges of structures having various
radii. In use, a wet plaster material will be typically applied roughly to a corner section.
A user (not shown) will then be able to smooth over and finish the corner using the
apparatus 10 of the present invention. In order to do so, the user will position the
apparatus 10 adjacent to the corner to be smoothed such that the corner is aligned with
and located within the recess 28. As the apparatus is positioned closer to the corner,
the corner will engage with the wiper blade 14. In the embodiment shown in the
Figures, the corner will be received within the corner engaging deformation 38. As the
user places pressure onto the apparatus 10, the wiper blade 14 will flex to mould to the
shape of the corner, whilst simultaneously spreading and smoothing spreadable
material.
[0032] It is envisaged that the apparatus 10 of the present invention may be used to
spread a wide range of spreadable materials. Suitable spreadable materials include
plasters, cement, lime based plasters, putty, render, gypsum compounds, mastics,
epoxies, polished plasters, stuccos, adhesives, grouts, mortars, waterproof coatings
and sealants.
[0033] The flexing of the wiper blade will be limited by the rigid edges 29 of the recess
28 The user will then move the apparatus along the length of the corner and the wiper
blade 14 will serve to uniformly spread the material as the apparatus is moved along.
The shape of the wiper blade, particularly if it is preformed with an upward deformation,

                                               8
along with the constant limitation of flex imposed by the edges of the recess, will serve
to conform and smooth the material to the desired shape uniformly along the corner.
[0034] In Figure 7 there is shown an apparatus 100 for spreading a spreadable material
in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In as much as the
apparatus 100 shares features with apparatus 10, like numerals denote like parts.
[0035] In addition to the features of apparatus 10, apparatus 100 further comprises an
attachment 102. The attachment 102 has an outlet nozzle 104 and an attachment point
106. The attachment 102 is disposed in the arcuate central portion 30 such the outlet
nozzle passes through the recess 28 in the planar body portion 12. The attachment 102
is adapted to deliver the material to be spread under the wiper blade 14. In the
embodiment shown in Figure 7, the attachment point 106 is adapted to attach the
attachment 102 to a caulk tube (not shown). In this manner, a user will be able to apply
the spreadable material form the caulk tube to the corner, whilst simultaneously
smoothing the corner.
[0036] In Figures 8 to 10, there is shown an apparatus 200 for spreading a spreadable
material in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. In as much as
the apparatus 200 shares features with apparatus 10, like numerals denote like parts.
The apparatus 200 comprises a planar body portion 12 and a wiper blade 14.
[0037] The planar body portion 12 is provided with a top face 16, an opposite bottom
face 18, first and second edges 20, 22, respectively, a rear edge 24 and a forward
working edge 26. In this embodiment, three recesses 28 are provided in the planar
body portion 12. Each recess 28 is defined by edges 29. Each recess 28 extends from
the forward working edge 26 into to the planar body portion. In the embodiment shown
in the figures, the recess 26 is generally 'V,' shaped, being wider at the working edge
26, with the width gradually reducing as the recess 28 extends into the body portion 12.
Each recess 28 is particularly characterised by an arcuate central portion 30 at the point
at which the recess 28 terminates. The arcuate central portion 30 is adapted to allow for
a certain amount of flex of the wiper blade 14.
[0038] The planar body portion 12 is formed from a sheet of relatively rigid, but manually
pliable material. The character of the material from which the planar body portion 12 is
formed must be such that, while manually pliable, the apparatus is sufficiently rigid to

                                              9
maintain its shape during the normal course of use to form and finish corners and edges
of a structure with a spreadable material. To provide additional strength to the planar
body portion 12, spines 31 may be disposed on the top face 16.
[0039] The wiper blade 14 is underlayed beneath the planar body portion 12 on the
bottom face 18. The wiper blade 14 is constructed from a single piece of elastomeric
material which is preferably injected moulded or adhesively bonded directly to the
planar body portion 12. The wiper blade 14 is provided with a forward wiping edge 32
which extends forwardly beyond the forward working edge 26 of the planar body portion
12. As best shown in Figure 9, the wiper blade 14 extends across the recesses 28.
[0040] The wiper blade 14 may be fabricated from any suitable material such as natural
or synthetic rubbers, polyvinylchloride or other elastomeric plastics.
[0041] In the embodiment shown in the figures, the wiper blade 14 has a shaped central
portion 36 provided at the portion of the wiper blade 14 that extends across the
recesses 28. The curved central portion 36 is preformed with an upward deformation to
define a corner engaging deformation 38. In this arrangement, portions the wiper blade
14 passes from the bottom of the planar body portion 12 upwards through each
respective recess 28 and around the edges 29. The corner engaging deformation 38
shown in the Figures 8 to 10 is generally curved throughout its width to define a bell
shape. It is envisaged that the shaped central portion 36 could also comprise two
opposed and converging faces which come together at an apex.
[0042] Unlike apparatus 10, apparatus 200 is not shown to include a handle receiving
portion 40. It is envisaged that the arrangement shown in Figure 8 to 10 is intended to
be used as a hand tool, whereby a user will grip the apparatus 200 with their hand to
operate it.   It should be noted that a handle receiving portion 40 similar to apparatus 10
may be incorporated into apparatus 200.
[0043] As indicated previously, the apparatus 200 is designed to apply and smooth
various compounds and plasters to outside corners and edges of structures having
various radii.    Unlike apparatus 10, apparatus 200 is provided with three recces 28 and
as a result, the user is provided with a choice of three positions in which to engage with
the outside corners and edges of structures.        The inventors have found this to be
particularly advantageous in for applications where there is not always enough

                                               10
clearance on either side of the outside corners and edges of structures to accommodate
a the full width of the planar body portion 14.       In these circumstances, the use may
select one of the non-central recces 28, thereby reducing the distance between the
recces 38 and the relevant first and second edges 20, 22.             This ensures that the
operation of the apparatus 200 is not impeded by the planer body portion 14.
[0044] Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is
susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described. The
invention includes all such variation and modifications. The invention also includes all
of the steps, features, formulations and compounds referred to or indicated in the
specification, individually or collectively and any and all combinations or any two or
more of the steps or features.
