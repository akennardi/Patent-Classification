BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         In humans, the high affinity receptor for folate comes in three isoforms: alpha,
beta, and gamma. The alpha and beta forms are typically bound to the membranes of
cells by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. They recycle between
extracellular and endocytic compartments and are capable of transporting folate into the
cell. Soluble forms of FRax may be derived by the action of proteases or phospholipase
on membrane anchored folate receptors.
         Folate receptor alpha (also referred to as FRa, FR-alpha, FOLR-1 or FOLR1) is
expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues, including those of the choroid plexus, lung,
thyroid, kidney, uterus, breast, Fallopian tube, epididymis, and salivary glands.
Weitman, SD et al. Cancer Res 52: 3396-3401 (1992); Weitman SD et al, CancerRes
52: 6708-6711. Overexpression of FRa has been observed in various cancers, including
lung cancer (e.g., bronchioalveolar carcinomas, carcinoid tumors, and non-small cell
lung cancers, such as adenocarcinomas); mesothelioma; ovarian cancer; renal cancer;
brain cancer (e.g., anaplas tic ependymoma, cerebellar juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma,
and brain metastases); cervical cancer; nasopharyngeal cancer; mesodermally derived
tumor; squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; endometrial cancer; endometrioid
adenocarcinomas of the ovary, serous cystadenocarcinomas, breast cancer; bladder
cancer; pancreatic cancer; bone cancer (e.g., high-grade osteosarcoma); pituitary cancer
(e.g., pituitary adenomas); colorectal cancer and medullary thyroid cancer. See e.g.,

(2007). In some types of cancers (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck),
a higher level of FRa expression is associated with a worse prognosis, whereas in other
types of cancers (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancers), a higher level of FRa expression is
associated with a better prognosis. See, e.g., Iwakiri S et al. Annals of Surgical
Oncology, 15(3): 889-899; Saba N.F. et al. Head Neck, 31(4): 475-481 (2009).
         Earlier detection of cancer improves survival rates and quality of life. To
improve the likelihood of early detection and treatment, a pressing need exists for non
invasive methods for diagnosing cancer, for determining the level of risk of developing
cancer, and for predicting the progression of cancer. The present invention satisfies
these needs for FRa-expressing cancers.

and drawings.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
         Figure 1 is a schematic depiction of an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
(ECLIA) method for assessing the FRa in urine as described in the Examples. MOV18
antibody attached to solid supports bound FRu in urine. The FRu was subsequently
detected by binding to Ru-labeled MORAb-003 antibody.
         Figure 2 shows the distribution of FRu levels in the urine of ovarian cancer
subjects and normal control subjects as measured by ECLIA (see Example 1).
         Figure 3 depicts the detection of FRu in urine of ovarian cancer patients (pale
band on lane 1, clear band on lane 2) using immunoblotting (see Example 5).
         Figure 4 shows the distribution of FRu levels in the urine of ovarian cancer
subjects and normal control subjects as measured by ECLIA after the urine was treated
with guanidine, as described in Example 7.
         Figure 5 depicts an ROC curve showing the sensitivity and specificity of the
ECLIA measurement of FRu levels in urine after the urine was treated with guanidine,
                                            34

as described in Example 7. The area under the curve (AUC) measures the accuracy of
the test in separating ovarian cancer from control subjects. A cutoff value (above which
the test results were considered abnormal) of 9100 pg/mL was used.
         Figure 6 shows the distribution of FRa levels in ovarian cancer (OC) and normal
control subjects after correction for creatinine levels. There is a statistically significant
difference between ovarian cancer patients and controls in creatinine-corrected levels of
FRa (p=0.007) (see Example 8).
         Figure 7 depicts an ROC analysis of creatinine-corrected FRa levels determined
using electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA) of guanidine-treated urine samples (see
Example 8).
         Figure 8 is a schematic depiction of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method
used for assessing the level of FRa (i.e., FRa) in samples, as described in Example 9.
MOV-18 served as the capture antibody, which bound FRa from biological fluids. The
FRa was detected by binding to biotinylated MORAb-003, which was detected using
avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (avidin-HRP).
         Figure 9 depicts results obtained for the measurement of FRa in serum using
one- and two-step incubation procedures, as described in Example 9.
         Figure 10 is a schematic depiction of the three different combinations of capture
and detector antibodies that were used with the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method for
assessing the level of FRa in human plasma, as described in Example 11.
         Figure 11 shows the plasma concentrations of FRa (pg/mL) for individual
subjects determined using EIA with three combinations of capture and detector
antibodies, as described in Example 11.
         Figure 12 depicts the relationship between OD values and FRa concentrations
(see Example 11).
         Figure 13 shows the distribution of plasma FRa concentrations in subjects with
ovarian cancer and normal control subjects as determined using EIA (see Example 12).
         Figure 14 depicts the correlation between FRa plasma concentrations determined
using EIA and ECLIA (see Example 12).
         Figure 15 shows correlations between ECLIA measures of FRa levels in serum
and urine. The correlation for lung cancer patients was r=0.24 (upper panel) and the
correlation for ovarian cancer patients was r--0.76 (lower panel) (see Example 13).
                                            35

         Figure 16 shows the correlation of serum versus plasma FRa levels for assays
conducted using pair 1 (see Example 16).
         Figure 17 shows the correlation of serum versus plasma FRa levels for assays
conducted using pair 2 (see Example 16).
         Figure 18 shows the correlation of serum FRa levels for assays conducted using
pair 1 versus pair 2 (see Example 16).
         Figure 19 shows the correlation of plasma FRa levels for assays conducted using
pair 1 versus pair 2 (see Example 16).
         Figure 20 shows the intraday correlation of serum FRa levels for assays
conducted using pair 2 (Example 16).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention is based, at least in part, on the unexpected discovery that
folate receptor alpha (FRa), not bound to a cell, is found at elevated levels in the body
fluids, for example, urine or serum, of a subject having an FRca-expressing cancer such
as lung or ovarian cancer as compared to a control sample. Moreover, the present
invention is based, at least in part, on the identification of an immunological assay that
exhibits the necessary sensitivity for assessing FRa levels in samples, where prior
attempts to do so repeatedly failed. As a result, the present invention provides methods
for diagnosing an FRca-expressing cancer by assessing levels of an FRa not bound to a
cell in samples derived from the subject. Indeed, the present invention overcomes the
challenges observed during prior attempts to develop an FRa based diagnostic assay for
FRa-expressing cancers such as ovarian cancer by providing an immunological assay
capable of accurately assessing levels of FRa not bound to a cell in samples.
         Accordingly, methods and kits for assessing whether a subject has or is at risk for
developing an FRa-expressing cancer and, further, for assessing the progression of FRa
expressing cancer are provided. In various embodiments, the methods involve the
comparison of levels of FRa not bound to a cell in samples, for example, urine and
serum, as compared to control levels, in assessing the presence, degree or risk of
development of ovarian cancer in the subject. In particular embodiments, the methods
involve the use of the MORAb-003 antibody, antibodies that bind the same epitope as
the MORAb-003 antibody or antibodies having SEQ ID NO: 1 (GFTFSGYGLS) as
CDRH1, SEQ ID NO:2 (MISSGGSYTYYADSVKG) as CDRH2, SEQ ID NO:3
                                             36

(HGDDPAWFAY) as CDRH3, SEQ ID NO:4 (SVSSSISSNNLH) as CDRL1, SEQ ID
NO:5 (GTSNLAS) as CDRL2 and SEQ ID NO:6 (QQWSSYPYMYT) as CDRL3, in
assessing the levels of FRa not bound to a cell in a sample, e.g., urine or serum.
Alternatively or in addition, the MOV 18 antibody or an antibody that binds the same
epitope of the MOV18 antibody, the 548908 antibody, an antibody that binds the same
epitope of the 548908 antibody, the 6D398 antibody or an antibody that binds the same
epitope of the 548908 antibody may be used in accordance with the methods of the
present invention.
         Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following
subsections:
I.       Definitions
         As used herein, each of the following terms has the meaning associated with it in
this section.
         The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e.
to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an
element" means one element or more than one element.
         As used herein, the term "subject" refer to human and non-human animals,
including veterinary subjects. The term "non-human animal" includes all vertebrates,
e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as non-human primates, mice, rabbits, sheep,
dog, cat, horse, cow, chickens, amphibians, and reptiles. In a preferred embodiment, the
subject is a human.
         The terms "cancer" or "tumor" are well known in the art and refer to the
presence, e.g., in a subject, of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer-causing
cells, such as uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic potential, rapid growth
and proliferation rate, and certain characteristic morphological features. Cancer cells are
often in the form of a tumor, but such cells may exist alone within a subject, or may be
non-tumorigenic cancer cells, such as leukemia cells. As used herein, the term "cancer"
includes pre-malignant as well as malignant cancers.
         As used herein, an "FRa-expressing cancer" includes any type of cancer
characterized in that the cancer cells express FRa. In particular embodiments, the FRa
expressing cancer includes cancerous conditions characterized in that the cancer cells are
                                             37

capable of secreting, shedding, exporting or releasing FRa in such a manner that
elevated levels of FRa are detectable in a biological sample from the subject. FRa
expressing cancers include, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g., bronchioalveolar
carcinomas, carcinoid tumors, and non-small cell lung cancers, such as
adenocarcinomas); mesothelioma; ovarian cancer; renal cancer; brain cancer (e.g.,
anaplastic ependymoma and cerebellar juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma); cervical cancer;
nasopharyngeal cancer; mesodermally derived tumor; squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck; endometrial cancer; endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the ovary, serous
cystadenocarcinomas, breast cancer; bladder cancer; pancreatic cancer; bone cancer
(e.g., high-grade osteosarcoma); pituitary cancer (e.g., pituitary adenoma). See e.g.,
U.S. Patent No. 7,754,698; U.S. Patent Application No. 2005/0232919; WO
2009/132081; Bueno R et al. Jof Thoracic and CardiovascularSurgery, 121(2) : 225
233 (2001); Elkanat H & Ratnam M. Frontiers in Bioscience, 11, 506-519 (2006);
Franklin, WA et al. Int J Cancer, Suppl 8: 89-95 (1994); Hartman L.C. et al. Int J
Cancer 121: 938-942 (2007); Iwakiri S et al. Annals of Surgical Oncology, 15(3): 889
899; Weitman, SD et al. CancerRes 52: 3396-3401 (1992); Saba N.F. et al. Head Neck,
31(4): 475-481 (2009); Yang R et al. Clin Cancer Res 13: 2557-2567 (2007). In a
particular embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is ovarian cancer. In another
embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is lung cancer such as non-small cell lung
cancer. In other embodiments, the FRa-expressing cancer is colorectal cancer and
medullary thyroid cancer.
          As used herein, a subject who is "afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer " is
one who is clinically diagnosed with such a cancer by a qualified clinician (for example,
by the methods of the present invention), or one who exhibits one or more signs or
symptoms (for example, elevated levels of FRa in biological fluids) of such a cancer and
is subsequently clinically diagnosed with such a cancer by a qualified clinician (for
example, by the methods of the present invention). A non-human subject that serves as
an animal model of FRa-expressing cancer may also fall within the scope of the term a
subject "afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer."
          The term "ovarian cancer" refers to the art recognized disease and includes each
of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC; >90% of ovarian cancer in Western countries), germ
cell tumors (circa 2-3% of ovarian cancer), and stromal ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer
is stratified into different groups based on the differentiation of the tumor tissue. In
                                            38

grade I, the tumor tissue is well differentiated. In grade II, tumor tissue is moderately
well differentiated. In grade III, the tumor tissue is poorly differentiated. This grade
correlates with a less favorable prognosis than grades I and II.
         Ovarian cancer is stratified into different stages based on the spread of the
cancer. Stage I is generally confined within the capsule surrounding one (stage IA) or
both (stage IB) ovaries, although in some stage I (i.e. stage IC) cancers, malignant cells
may be detected in ascites, in peritoneal rinse fluid, or on the surface of the ovaries.
Stage II involves extension or metastasis of the tumor from one or both ovaries to other
pelvic structures. In stage IIA, the tumor extends or has metastasized to the uterus, the
fallopian tubes, or both. Stage JIB involves extension of the tumor to the pelvis. Stage
IIC is stage IIA or JIB in which malignant cells may be detected in ascites, in peritoneal
rinse fluid, or on the surface of the ovaries. In stage III, the tumor comprises at least one
malignant extension to the small bowel or the omentum, has formed extrapelvic
peritoneal implants of microscopic (stage IIIA) or macroscopic (< 2 centimeter diameter,
stage IIIB; > 2 centimeter diameter, stage IIIC) size, or has metastasized to a
retroperitoneal or inguinal lymph node (an alternate indicator of stage IIIC). In stage IV,
distant (i.e. non-peritoneal) metastases of the tumor can be detected.
         The durations of the various stages of ovarian cancer are not presently known,
but are believed to be at least about a year each (Richart et al., 1969, Am. J. Obstet.
Gynecol. 105:386). Prognosis declines with increasing stage designation. For example,
5-year survival rates for human subjects diagnosed with stage I, II, III, and IV ovarian
cancer are 80%, 57%, 25%, and 8%, respectively.
         Each of the foregoing types, groups and stages of ovarian cancer are
encompassed by the term "ovarian cancer" as used herein.
         As used herein, the term "lung cancer" refers to a disease in tissues of the lung
involving uncontrolled cell growth, which, in some cases, leads to metastasis. Lung
cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women. The
majority of primary lung cancers are carcinomas of the lung, derived from epithelial
cells. The main types of lung cancer are small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In a particular embodiment, the FRa-expressing
cancer is a non-small cell lung cancer.
         Small cell lung cancer or small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a malignant
cancer of the lung, wherein the cancer cells have a flat shape and scanty cytoplasm;
                                             39

therefore, SCLC is sometimes called "oat cell carcinoma." SCLC is generally more
metastatic than NSCLC and is sometimes seen in combination with squamous cell
carcinomas.
         As used herein, the term "non-small cell lung cancer," also known as non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), refers to epithelial lung cancer other than small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC). There are three main sub-types: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell
lung carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Other less common types of non-small
cell lung cancer include pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and
unclassified carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas account for approximately 40% of lung
cancers, and are the most common type of lung cancer in people who have never
smoked. Squamous cell carcinomas account for about 25% of lung cancers. Squamous
cell carcinoma of the lung is more common in men than in women and is even more
highly correlated with a history of tobacco smoking than are other types of lung
carcinoma. There are at least four variants (papillary, small cell, clear cell, and basaloid)
of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Large cell lung carcinomas are a heterogeneous
group of malignant neoplasms originating from transformed epithelial cells in the lung.
Large cell lung carcinomas are carcinomas that lack light microscopic characteristics of
small cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.
         Different staging systems are used for SCLC and NSCLC. SCLC is categorized
as limited disease confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax or as extensive disease with
metastasis beyond the ipsilateral hemithorax.
         NSCLC may be categorized using the tumor-nodes-metastasis (TNM) staging
system. See Spira J & Ettinger, D.S. Multidisciplinary management of lung cancer, N
Engl J Med, 350:382- (2004) (hereinafter Spira); Greene FL, Page DL, Fleming ID, Fritz
AG, Balch CM, Haller DG, et al (eds). AJCC CancerStaging Manual. 6th edition. New

(eds). International Union Against Cancer. TNM classificationof malignant tumours. 6th
edition. New York: Wiley-Liss (2002) (hereinafter Sobin). In addition, NSCLC is
typically treated according to the stage of cancer determined by the following
classification scheme (see http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/non-small
cell-lung/Patient/page2#Keypoint10).
                                            40

        In the occult (hidden) stage, cancer cells are found in sputum (mucus coughed up
from the lungs), but no tumor can be found in the lung by imaging or bronchoscopy, or
the tumor is too small to be checked.
        In stage 0 (carcinoma in situ), abnormal cells are found in the lining of the
airways. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.
Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.
        Stage I, in which cancer has formed, is divided into stages IA and IB.
        In Stage IA, the tumor is in the lung only and is 3 centimeters or smaller.
        In Stage IB, the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and one or more of the
following is true: (i) The tumor is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 5
centimeters; (ii) cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters
below where the trachea joins the bronchus; (iii) cancer has spread to the innermost
layer of the membrane that covers the lung; (iv) part of the lung has collapsed or
developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the
bronchus.
        In Stage IIA, cancer has spread to certain lymph nodes on the same side of the
chest as the primary tumor; the cancer is (a) 5 cm or smaller, (b) has spread to the main
bronchus, and/or (c) has spread to the innermost layer of the lung lining. OR, cancer has
not spread to lymph nodes; the cancer is (d) larger than 5 cm but not larger than 7 cm,
(e) has spread to the main bronchus, and/or (f) has spread to the innermost layer of the
lung lining. Part of the lung may have collapsed or become inflamed. Stage IIA is
divided into two sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found,
and whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes. In the first section, cancer has spread to
lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer
are within the lung or near the bronchus. Also, one or more of the following is true: (i)
the tumor is not larger than 5 centimeters, (ii) cancer has spread to the main bronchus
and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus, (iii) cancer has
spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung, (iv) part of the lung
has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the
trachea joins the bronchus. In the second section, cancer has not spread to lymph nodes
and one or more of the following is true: (i) the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but
not larger than 7 centimeters, (ii) cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2
centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus, (iii) cancer has spread to the
                                            41

innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung, (iv) part of the lung has collapsed
or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins
the bronchus.
         In Stage IIB, cancer has spread to certain lymph nodes on the same side of the
chest as the primary tumor; the cancer is (a) larger than 5 cm but not larger than 7 cm,
(b) has spread to the main bronchus, and/or (c) has spread to the innermost layer of the
lung lining. Part of the lung may have collapsed or become inflamed. Alternatively, (d)
the cancer is larger than 7 cm; (e) has spread to the main bronchus, (f) the diaphragm,
(g) the chest wall or the lining of the chest wall; and/or (h) has spread to the membrane
around the heart. There may be one or more separate tumors in the same lobe of the
lung; cancer may have spread to the nerve that controls the diaphragm; the whole lung
may have collapsed or become inflamed. Stage JIB is divided into two sections
depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and whether there is
cancer in the lymph nodes. In the first section, cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes
on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are within the
lung or near the bronchus. Also, one or more of the following is true: (i) the tumor is
larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters, (ii) cancer has spread to the
main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus,
(iii) cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung, (iv)
part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in
the area where the trachea joins the bronchus. In the second section, cancer has not
spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true: (i) the tumor is larger
than 7 centimeters, (ii) cancer has spread to the main bronchus (and is less than 2
centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus), the chest wall, the diaphragm,
or the nerve that controls the diaphragm, (iii) cancer has spread to the membrane around
the heart or lining the chest wall, (iv) the whole lung has collapsed or developed
pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung), (v) there are one or more separate tumors in the
same lobe of the lung.
         Stage IA is divided into three sections depending on the size of the tumor,
where the tumor is found, and which lymph nodes have cancer (if any). In the first
section of Stage IIIA, cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as
the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are near the sternum (chest bone) or where the
bronchus enters the lung. Also, the tumor may be any size; part of the lung (where the
                                             42

trachea joins the bronchus) or the whole lung may have collapsed or developed
pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung); there may be one or more separate tumors in
the same lobe of the lung; and cancer may have spread to any of the following: (i) main
bronchus, but not the area where the trachea joins the bronchus, (ii) chest wall, (iii)
diaphragm and the nerve that controls it, (iv) membrane around the lung or lining the
chest wall, (iv) membrane around the heart. In the second section of Stage IIIA, cancer
has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes
with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus. Also, the tumor may be any size;
the whole lung may have collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the
lung); there may be one or more separate tumors in any of the lobes of the lung with
cancer; and cancer may have spread to any of the following: (i) main bronchus, but not
the area where the trachea joins the bronchus, (ii) chest wall, (iii) diaphragm and the
nerve that controls it, (iv) membrane around the lung or lining the chest wall, (v) heart or
the membrane around it, (vi) major blood vessels that lead to or from the heart, (vi)
trachea, (vii) esophagus, (viii) nerve that controls the larynx (voice box), (ix) sternum
(chest bone) or backbone, (x) carina (where the trachea joins the bronchi). In the third
section of Stage IIIA, cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and the tumor may be
any size, and cancer has spread to any of the following: (i) heart, (ii) major blood vessels
that lead to or from the heart, (iii) trachea, (iv) esophagus, (v) nerve that controls the
larynx (voice box), (vi) sternum (chest bone) or backbone, (vi) carina (where the trachea
joins the bronchi).
        Stage HIB is divided into two sections depending on the size of the tumor, where
the tumor is found, and which lymph nodes have cancer. In the first section, cancer has
spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone or to lymph nodes on the opposite side of
the chest as the tumor; the tumor may be any size; part of the lung (where the trachea
joins the bronchus) or the whole lung may have collapsed or developed pneumonitis
(inflammation of the lung); there may be one or more separate tumors in any of the lobes
of the lung with cancer; and cancer may have spread to any of the following: (i) main
bronchus, (ii) chest wall, (iii) diaphragm and the nerve that controls it, (iv) membrane
around the lung or lining the chest wall, (iv) heart or the membrane around it, (v) major
blood vessels that lead to or from the heart, (vi) trachea, (vii) esophagus, (viii) nerve that
controls the larynx (voice box), (ix) sternum (chest bone) or backbone, (x) carina (where
the trachea joins the bronchi). In the second section of Stage IIIB, cancer has spread to
                                             43

lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor; the lymph nodes with cancer are
near the sternum (chest bone) or where the bronchus enters the lung; the tumor may be
any size; there may be separate tumors in different lobes of the same lung; and cancer
has spread to any of the following: (i) heart, (ii) major blood vessels that lead to or from
the heart, (iii) trachea, (iv) esophagus, (v) nerve that controls the larynx (voice box), (vi)
sternum (chest bone) or backbone, (vii) carina (where the trachea joins the bronchi).
        In Stage IV, the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to lymph
nodes. One or more of the following is true: there are one or more tumors in both lungs;
cancer is found in fluid around the lungs or the heart; cancer has spread to other parts of
the body, such as the brain, liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, or bone.
        Accordingly, in various embodiments of the foregoing invention, the lung cancer
may be stratified into any of the preceding stages (e.g., occult, stage 0, stage IA, stage
IB, stage IIA, stage JIB, stage IIIA, stage IIIB or stage IV) based on assessing of the
levels of FRa not bound to a cell, such as a normal or cancerous cell, in a sample (for
example, urine or serum) of a subject.
        As used herein, the term "folate receptor alpha" (also referred to as FRa, FR
alpha, FOLR-1 or FOLR1) refers to the alpha isoform of the high affinity receptor for
folate. Membrane bound FRa is attached to the cell surface by a glycosyl
phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor), recycles between extracellular and endocytic
compartments and is capable of transporting folate into the cell. FRa is expressed in a
variety of epithelial tissues including those of the female reproductive tract, placenta,
breast, kidney proximal tubules, choroid plexus, lung and salivary glands. Soluble
forms of FRa may be derived by the action of proteases or phospholipase on membrane
anchored folate receptors.
        The consensus nucleotide and amino acid sequences for human FRa are set forth
herein as SEQ ID NOs: 24 and 25, respectively. Variants, for example, naturally
occurring allelic variants or sequences containing at least one amino acid substitution,
are encompassed by the terms as used herein.
        As used herein, the term "not bound to a cell" refers to FRa that is not attached
to the cellular membrane of a cell, such as a cancerous cell. In a particular embodiment,
the FRa not bound to a cell is unbound to any cell and is freely floating or solubilized in
biological fluids, e.g., urine or serum. For example, the FRa may be shed, secreted or
                                             44

exported from normal or cancerous cells, for example, from the surface of cancerous
cells, into biological fluids.
         The "level" of folate receptor alpha not bound to a cell, as used herein, refers to
the level of folate receptor alpha protein as determined using any method known in the
art for the measurement of protein levels. Such methods include, for example,
electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), hyperdiffusion chromatography, fluid or gel
precipitin reactions, absorption spectroscopy, a colorimetric assays, spectrophotometric
assays, flow cytometry, immunodiffusion (single or double), solution phase assay,
immunoelectrophoresis, Western blotting, radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunofluorescent assays, and
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (exemplified below), and the like. In a
preferred embodiment, the level is determined using antibody-based techniques, as
described in more detail herein.
         It is generally preferable to immobilize either an antibody or binding protein
specific for FRa not bound to a cell on a solid support for Western blots and
immunofluorescence techniques. Suitable solid phase supports or carriers include any
support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well-known supports or carriers
include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases,
natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite.
         One skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody
or antigen, and will be able to adapt such support for use with the present invention. For
example, protein isolated from a subject sample (e.g., urine or serum) can be run on a
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immobilized onto a solid phase support such as
nitrocellulose. The support can then be washed with suitable buffers followed by
treatment with the labeled antibody. The solid phase support can then be washed with
the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on
the solid support can then be detected by conventional means. Means of detecting
proteins using electrophoretic techniques are well known to those of skill in the art (see
generally, R. Scopes (1982) ProteinPurification,Springer-Verlag, N.Y.; Deutscher,
(1990) Methods in Enzymology Vol. 182: Guide to ProteinPurification,Academic
Press, Inc., N.Y.).
                                            45

        Other standard methods include immunoassay techniques which are well known
to one of ordinary skill in the art and may be found in Principles And Practice Of
Immunoassay, 2nd Edition, Price and Newman, eds., MacMillan (1997) and Antibodies,
A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane, eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ch. 9
(1988), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
        Antibodies used in immunoassays to determine the level of expression of folate
receptor alpha may be labeled with a detectable label. The term "labeled", with regard
to the binding agent or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the binding
agent or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the
binding agent or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the binding agent or antibody
by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. An example of indirect
labeling includes detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled
secondary antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is labeled, e.g., radio-labeled,
chromophore-labeled, fluorophore-labeled, or enzyme-labeled. In another embodiment,
the antibody is an antibody derivative (e.g., an antibody conjugated with a substrate or
with the protein or ligand of a protein-ligand pair (e.g., biotin-streptavidin), or an
antibody fragment (e.g., a single-chain antibody, an isolated antibody hypervariable
domain) which binds specifically with FRa not bound to a cell.
        In one embodiment of the invention, proteomic methods, e.g., mass
spectrometry, are used. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that consists of
ionizing chemical compounds to generate charged molecules (or fragments thereof) and
measuring their mass-to-charge ratios. In a typical mass spectrometry procedure, a
sample is obtained from a subject, loaded onto the mass spectrometry, and its
components (e.g., FRa) are ionized by different methods (e.g., by impacting them with
an electron beam), resulting in the formation of charged particles (ions). The mass-to
charge ratio of the particles is then calculated from the motion of the ions as they transit
through electromagnetic fields.
        For example, matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) or surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time
of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) which involves the application of a
sample, such as urine or serum, to a protein-binding chip (Wright, G.L., Jr., et al. (2002)

(2001) CancerRes 61:6029) can be used to determine the level of FRa.
         Furthermore, in vivo techniques for determination of the level of FRa not bound
to a cell include introducing into a subject a labeled antibody directed against FRa,
which binds to and transforms FRa into a detectable molecule. The presence, level, or
location of the detectable FRa not bound to a cell in a subject may be determined using
standard imaging techniques.
         The term "sample" as used herein refers to a collection of similar fluids, cells, or
tissues isolated from a subject, as well as fluids, cells, or tissues present within a subject.
In preferred embodiments the sample is a biological fluid containing FRa not bound to a
cancerous cell. Biological fluids are typically liquids at physiological temperatures and
may include naturally occurring fluids present in, withdrawn from, expressed or
otherwise extracted from a subject or biological source. Certain biological fluids derive
from particular tissues, organs or localized regions and certain other biological fluids
may be more globally or systemically situated in a subject or biological source.
Examples of biological fluids include blood, serum and serosal fluids, plasma, lymph,
urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, ocular fluids, cystic fluid, tear drops, feces, sputum,
mucosal secretions of the secretory tissues and organs, vaginal secretions, gynecological
fluids, ascites fluids such as those associated with non-solid tumors, fluids of the pleural,
pericardial, peritoneal, abdominal and other body cavities, fluids collected by bronchial
lavage and the like. In a particular embodiment, the sample is urine or serum. In
another embodiment, the sample does not include ascites or is not an ascite sample. In
another embodiment, the sample does not include peritoneal fluid or is not peritoneal
fluid.
         In one embodiment, the sample is removed from the subject. In another
embodiment, the sample is present within the subject. Biological fluids may also include
liquid solutions contacted with a subject or biological source, for example, cell and
organ culture medium including cell or organ conditioned medium, lavage fluids and the
like.
         In some embodiments, only a portion of the sample is subjected to an assay for
determining the level of FRa not bound to a cell, or various portions of the sample are
subjected to various assays for determining the level of FRa not bound to a cell. Also,
in many embodiments, the sample may be pre-treated by physical or chemical means
                                            47

prior to the assay. For example, in embodiments discussed in more detail in the
Examples section, samples, for example, urine samples, were subjected to
centrifugation, dilution and/or treatment with a solubilizing substance (e.g., guanidine
treatment) prior to assaying the samples for FRa not bound to a cell. Such techniques
serve to enhance the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of the assays of the present
invention.
         The term "control sample," as used herein, refers to any clinically relevant
control sample, including, for example, a sample from a healthy subject not afflicted
with ovarian cancer, a sample from a subject having a less severe or slower progressing
ovarian cancer than the subject to be assessed, a sample from a subject having some
other type of cancer or disease, and the like. A control sample may include a sample
derived from one or more subjects. A control sample may also be a sample made at an
earlier timepoint from the subject to be assessed. For example, the control sample could
be a sample taken from the subject to be assessed before the onset of the FRa expressing
cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer, at an earlier stage of disease, or before the
administration of treatment or of a portion of treatment. The control sample may also be
a sample from an animal model, or from a tissue or cell lines derived from the animal
model, of the FRa expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer. The level of FRa
not bound to a cell in a control sample that consists of a group of measurements may be
determined based on any appropriate statistical measure, such as, for example, measures
of central tendency including average, median, or modal values.
         The term "control level" refers to an accepted or pre-determined level of FRa
which is used to compare with the level of FRa in a sample derived from a subject. In
one embodiment, the control level of FRa is based on the level of FRa not bound to a
cell in sample(s) from a subject(s) having slow disease progression. In another
embodiment, the control level of FRa not bound to a cell is based on the level in a
sample from a subject(s) having rapid disease progression. In another embodiment, the
control level of FRa is based on the level of FRa not bound to a cell in a sample(s) from
an unaffected, i.e., non-diseased, subject(s), i.e., a subject who does not have an FRa
expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer. In yet another embodiment, the
control level of FRa is based on the level of FRa not bound to a cell in a sample from a
subject(s) prior to the administration of a therapy for ovarian cancer. In another
embodiment, the control level of FRa is based on the level of FRa not bound to a cell in
                                            48

a sample(s) from a subject(s) having an FRa expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian
cancer that is not contacted with a test compound. In another embodiment, the control
level of FRa is based on the level of FRa not bound to a cell in a sample(s) from a
subject(s) not having an FRa expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer that is
contacted with a test compound. In one embodiment, the control level of FRa is based
on the level of FRa not bound to a cell in a sample(s) from an animal model of an FRa
expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer, a cell, or a cell line derived from the
animal model of an FRa expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer.
        In one embodiment, the control is a standardized control, such as, for example, a
control which is predetermined using an average of the levels of FRa not bound to a cell
from a population of subjects having no FRa expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian
cancer. In still other embodiments of the invention, a control level of FRa is based on
the level of FRa not bound to a cell in a non-cancerous sample(s) derived from the
subject having an FRa expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer. For example,
when a laparotomy or other medical procedure reveals the presence of ovarian cancer in
one portion of the ovaries, the control level of FRa may be determined using the non
affected portion of the ovaries, and this control level may be compared with the level of
FRa in an affected portion of the ovaries. Similarly, when a biopsy or other medical
procedure reveals the presence of a lung cancer in one portion of the lungs, the control
level of FRa may be determined using the non-affected portion of the lungs, and this
control level may be compared with the level of FRa in an affected portion of the lungs.
        As used herein, "a difference" between the level of folate receptor alpha not
bound to a cell in a sample from a subject (i.e., a test sample) and the level of folate
receptor alpha not bound to a cell in a control sample refers broadly to any clinically
relevant and/or statistically significant difference in the level of folate receptor alpha in
the two samples. In an exemplary embodiment, the difference is selected based on a
cutoff value determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, an
example of which is presented in Example 6.
        In other embodiments, the difference must be greater than the limits of detection
of the method for determining the level of FRa not bound to a cell. It is preferred that
the difference be at least greater than the standard error of the assessment method, and
preferably a difference of at least about 2-, about 3-, about 4-, about 5-, about 6-, about
7-, about 8-, about 9-, about 10-, about 15-, about 20-, about 25-, about 100-, about 500-,
                                             49

about 1000-fold or greater than the standard error of the assessment method. The
difference may be assessed by any appropriate comparison, including any appropriate
parametric or nonparametric descriptive statistic or comparison. For example, "an
increase" in the level of FRa not bound to a cell may refer to a level in a test sample that
is about two, and more preferably about three, about four, about five, about six, about
seven, about eight, about nine, about ten or more times more than the level of FRa in the
control sample. An increase may also refer to a level in a test sample that is preferably
at least about 1.5, and more preferably about two, about three, about four, about five or
more standard deviations above the average level of FRa in the control sample.
Likewise, "a decrease" in the level of FRa not bound to a cell may refer to a level in a
test sample that is preferably at least about two, and more preferably about three, about
four, about five, about six, about seven, about eight, about nine, about ten or more times
less than the level of FRa in the control sample. A decrease may also refer to a level in
a test sample that is preferably at least about 1.5, and more preferably about two, about
three, about four, about five or more standard deviations below the average level of FRa
in the control sample.
         As used herein, the term "contacting the sample" with an FRa binding agent,
e.g., an anti-FRa antibody, includes exposing the sample, or any portion thereof with the
agent or antibody, such that at least a portion of the sample comes into contact with the
agent or antibody. The sample or portion thereof may be altered in some way, such as
by subjecting it to physical or chemical treatments (e.g., dilution or guanidine
treatment), prior to the act of contacting it with the agent or antibody.
         The term "antibody" as used herein, comprises four polypeptide chains, two
heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains, interconnected by disulfide bonds, as well as
any functional (i.e., antigen-binding) fragment, mutant, variant, or derivation thereof,
which retains the essential epitope binding features of an Ig molecule. Such mutant,
variant, or derivative antibody formats are known in the art, and include molecules such
as Fab fragments, Fab' fragments, F(ab') 2 fragments, Fd fragments, Fabc fragments, Sc
antibodies (single chain antibodies), diabodies, individual antibody light chains,
individual antibody heavy chains, chimeric fusions between antibody chains and the
like. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and
IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass.
                                            50

         Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated
herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant
region is comprised of three domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is
comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a
light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain,
CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability,
termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are
more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of
three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the
following order: FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. Light chains are
classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha,
delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE,
respectively.
         The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that
interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the
binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the
immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical
complement system.
         The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, as used herein, refers to one
or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen
(e.g., FRa not bound to a cell). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of
an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of
binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an
antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH,
CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab
fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting
of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of
a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb including VH and VL domains; (vi) a dAb
fragment (Ward et al. (1989) Nature 341, 544-546), which consists of a VH domain; (vii)
a dAb which consists of a VH or a VL domain; and (viii) an isolated complementarity
determining region (CDR) or (ix) a combination of two or more isolated CDRs which
may optionally be joined by a synthetic linker. Furthermore, although the two domains
of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined,
                                           51

using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a
single protein chain in which the VL and     VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules
(known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242, 423-426; and
Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5879-5883). Such single chain
antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen-binding
portion" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional
techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility
in the same manner as are intact antibodies. Antigen-binding portions can be produced
by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact
immunoglobulins.
        The term "antibody", as used herein, includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal
antibodies, murine antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, and human
antibodies, and those that occur naturally or are recombinantly produced according to
methods well known in the art.
        In one embodiment, an antibody for use in the methods of the invention is a
bispecific antibody. A "bispecific antibody" is an artificial hybrid antibody having two
different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies
can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of
Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, (1990) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79,
315-321; Kostelny et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148, 1547-1553.
        In another embodiment, an antibody for use in the methods of the invention is a
camelid antibody as described in, for example, PCT Publication WO 94/04678, the
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
        A region of the camelid antibody that is the small, single variable domain
identified as VHH  can be obtained by genetic engineering to yield a small protein having
high affinity for a target, resulting in a low molecular weight, antibody-derived protein
known as a "camelid nanobody". See U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,808; see also Stijlemans et al.,
2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279: 1256-126 1; Dumoulin et al., 2003 Nature 424: 783-788;
Pleschberger et al., 2003 Bioconjugate Chem. 14: 440-448; Cortez-Retamozo et al.,
2002 Int. J. Cancer 89: 456-62; and Lauwereys et al., 1998 EMBO J. 17: 3512-3520.
Engineered libraries of camelid antibodies and antibody fragments are commercially
available, for example, from Ablynx, Ghent, Belgium. Accordingly, a feature of the
present invention is a camelid nanobody having high affinity for FRa.
                                             52

         In other embodiments of the invention, an antibody for use in the methods of the
invention is a diabody, a single chain diabody, or a di-diabody.
         Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific molecules in which   VH and VL domains are
expressed on a single polypeptide chain, connected by a linker that is too short to allow
for pairing between the two domains on the same chain. The       VH and VL domains pair
with complementary domains of another chain, thereby creating two antigen binding
sites (see e.g., Holliger et al., 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak et
al., 1994 Structure 2:1121-1123). Diabodies can be produced by expressing two
polypeptide chains with either the structure    VHA-VLB  and  VHB-VLA (VH-VL
configuration), or  VLA-VHB    and  VLB-VHA (VL-VH   configuration) within the same cell.
Most of them can be expressed in soluble form in bacteria.
         Single chain diabodies (scDb) are produced by connecting the two diabody
forming polypeptide chains with linker of approximately 15 amino acid residues (see
Holliger and Winter, 1997 Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 45(3-4):128-30; Wu et al.,
 1996 Immunotechnology, 2(1):21-36). scDb can be expressed in bacteria in soluble,
active monomeric form (see Holliger and Winter, 1997 Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,
45(34): 128-30; Wu et al., 1996 Immunotechnology, 2(1):21-36; Pluckthun and Pack,
 1997 Immunotechnology, 3(2): 83-105; Ridgway et al., 1996 Protein Eng., 9(7):617-21).
         A diabody can be fused to Fc to generate a "di-diabody" (see Lu et al., 2004 J.
Biol. Chem., 279(4):2856-65).
         FRa binding molecules that exhibit functional properties of antibodies but derive
their framework and antigen binding portions from other polypeptides (e.g.,
polypeptides other than those encoded by antibody genes or generated by the
recombination of antibody genes in vivo) may also be used in the methods of the present
invention. The antigen binding domains (e.g., FRa binding domains) of these binding
molecules are generated through a directed evolution process. See U.S. Pat. No.
7,115,396. Molecules that have an overall fold similar to that of a variable domain of an
antibody (an "immunoglobulin-like" fold) are appropriate scaffold proteins. Scaffold
proteins suitable for deriving antigen binding molecules include fibronectin or a
fibronectin dimer, tenascin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, ICAM, titin, GCSF-receptor,
cytokine receptor, glycosidase inhibitor, antibiotic chromoprotein, myelin membrane
adhesion molecule PO, CD8, CD4, CD2, class I MHC, T-cell antigen receptor, CD1, C2
and I-set domains of VCAM-1, I-set immunoglobulin domain of myosin-binding protein
                                             53

C, I-set immunoglobulin domain of myosin-binding protein H, I-set immunoglobulin
domain of telokin, NCAM, twitchin, neuroglian, growth hormone receptor,
erythropoietin receptor, prolactin receptor, interferon-gamma receptor,    P
galactosidase/glucuronidase, j-glucuronidase, transglutaminase, T-cell antigen receptor,
superoxide dismutase, tissue factor domain, cytochrome F, green fluorescent protein,
GroEL, and thaumatin.
         "Specific binding" when used in the context of antibodies, or antibody
fragments, represents binding via domains encoded by immunoglobulin genes or
fragments of immunoglobulin genes to one or more epitopes of a protein of interest, but
which do not substantially recognize and bind other molecules in a sample containing a
mixed population of antigenic molecules. Typically, an antibody binds to a cognate
antigen with a Kd of less than about 1x10- 8 M, as measured by a surface plasmon
resonance assay or a cell binding assay.
         As used herein, a folate receptor alpha "binding agent" includes an antibody that
binds FRu not bound to a cell as well as non-antibody binding agents. To generate non
antibody binding agents or binding molecules, a library of clones can be created in
which sequences in regions of the scaffold protein that form antigen binding surfaces
(e.g., regions analogous in position and structure to CDRs of an antibody variable
domain immunoglobulin fold) are randomized. Library clones are tested for specific
binding to the antigen of interest (e.g., FRu) and for other functions (e.g., inhibition of
biological activity of FRu). Selected clones can be used as the basis for further
randomization and selection to produce derivatives of higher affinity for the antigen.
         High affinity binding molecules are generated, for example, using the tenth
module of fibronectin III ( 10Fn3) as the scaffold, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,818,418
and 7,115,396; Roberts and Szostak, 1997 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 94:12297; U.S.
Pat. No. 6,261,804; U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,558; and Szostak et al. W098/31700, the entire
contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
         Non-antibody binding molecules can be produced as dimers or multimers to
increase avidity for the target antigen. For example, the antigen binding domain is
expressed as a fusion with a constant region (Fc) of an antibody that forms Fc-Fc
dimers. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,396, the entire contents of which are incorporated
herein by reference.
                                            54

         An "antigen" is a molecule recognized by the immune system; the term
originally came from "antibody generator" and includes a molecule that binds
specifically to an antibody. At the molecular level, an antigen is characterized by its
ability to be bound at the antigen-binding site of an antibody. In the present invention,
the antigen is FRu, such as FRa which is not bound to a cell FRu or a portion thereof.
         As used herein, the term "epitope" refers to the molecular surface features of an
antigen, e.g., FRu, capable of being bound by an antibody. Antigenic molecules,
normally being "large" biological polymers, usually present several surface features that
can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies. Any such distinct molecular
feature constitutes an epitope. Most antigens therefore have the potential to be bound by
several distinct antibodies, each of which is typically specific to a particular epitope. In
one embodiment of the present invention, a binding agent, e.g., antibody, binds to an
epitope on FRu which is available in the form of the receptor which is not bound to a
cell but not in the membrane bound form of the receptor. For example, the antibody
may bind to the same epitope on FRu to which MORAB-003 binds.
         As used herein, the phrase "progression of an FRa-expressing cancer in a subject
afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer" includes the progression of such a cancer from
a less severe to a more severe state. This could include an increase in the number or
severity of tumors, the degree of metastasis, the speed with which the cancer is growing
and spreading, and the like. For example, "the progression of ovarian cancer" includes
the progression of such a cancer from a less severe to a more severe state, such as the
progression from Stage I to Stage II, from Stage II to Stage III, etc. Alternatively, the
phrase "progression of an FRa-expressing cancer in a subject afflicted with an FRa
expressing cancer" may refer to the regression of an FRa-expressing cancer from a more
severe state to a less severe state. For example, in one embodiment, "the progression of
ovarian cancer" refers to the regression from Stage IV to Stage III, from Stage III to
Stage II, etc. In other embodiments, the "progression of an FRa-expressing cancer in a
subject afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer" may refer to the survival rate
determined from the beginning of symptoms of the FRa-expressing cancer, or to the
survival rate from the time of diagnosis of the FRa-expressing cancer.
         As used herein, the term "stratifying" refers to characterizing an FRa expressing
cancer, for example, ovarian or lung cancer, into an appropriate stage based, for
example, on the degree of the spread of the cancer, as well accepted stratifications in the
                                            55

art. For example, stratifying includes characterizing the FRa expressing cancer into
Stage I, Stage II, Stage III or Stage IV. In certain embodiments, Stage I refers to cancers
that are localized to one part of the body. In certain embodiments, Stages II and III refer
to cancers that are locally advanced, wherein a distinction between the stages are often
specific to the particular cancer. Finally, Stage IV refers to cancers that have often
metastasized, or spread to other organs or throughout the body.
         As used herein, the term "survival" refers to the continuation of life of a subject
which has been treated for cancer. In one embodiment, survival refers to the failure of a
tumor to recur. As used herein, the term "recur" refers to the re-growth of tumor or
cancerous cells in a subject in whom primary treatment for the tumor has been
administered. The tumor may recur in the original site or in another part of the body. In
one embodiment, a tumor that recurs is of the same type as the original tumor for which
the subject was treated. For example, if a subject had an ovarian cancer tumor, was
treated and subsequently developed another ovarian cancer tumor, the tumor has
recurred. In addition, a cancer can recur in a different organ or tissue than the one where
it originally occurred.
II.      Methods and Kits of the Invention
         The present invention is based, at least in part, on the unexpected discovery that
folate receptor alpha (FRa), not bound to a cell, is found at elevated levels in the body
fluids, for example, urine or serum, of a subject having an FRa-expressing cancer as
compared to a control sample. Moreover, the present invention is based, at least in part,
on the identification of an immunological assay that exhibits the necessary sensitivity for
assessing levels of FRa not bound to a cells in samples, where prior attempts to do so
had repeatedly failed. Indeed, the present invention overcomes the challenges observed
during prior attempts to develop an FRa-based diagnostic assay for FRa-expressing
cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer by providing an immunological assay capable of
accurately assessing levels of FRa not bound to a cell in a sample, e.g., urine or serum.
         Accordingly, methods and kits for assessing whether a subject has or is at risk for
developing an FRa-expressing cancer and, further, for assessing the progression of an
FRa-expressing cancer are provided. In various embodiments, the methods involve the
comparison of levels of FRa not bound to a cell in samples, for example, urine and
                                            56

serum, as compared to control levels, in assessing the presence, degree or risk of
development of ovarian cancer in the subject.
         A.      Diagnostic Methods, Pro2nostic Methods, Risk Assessment Methods,
and Stratification Methods
         Specifically, the present invention provides diagnostic methods for assessing
whether a subject is afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer, such as lung or ovarian
cancer, prognostic methods for predicting the progression of an FRa-expressing cancer
such as lung or ovarian cancer, and risk assessment methods for assessing the level of
risk that a subject will develop the FRa-expressing cancer. Furthermore, the invention
provides stratification methods for stratifying an FRa-expressing cancer such as lung or
ovarian cancer subject into cancer therapy groups. The various aspects and
embodiments of the invention discussed here are intended to be non-limiting and to
encompass all possible combinations of the specific embodiments mentioned, which
may apply to any of the methods and kits discussed herein or claimed below.
         The methods of the present invention can be practiced in conjunction with any
other method used by the skilled practitioner to diagnose an FRa-expressing cancer,
predict the progression of an FRa-expressing cancer, or to assess the level of risk that a
subject will develop an FRa-expressing cancer.
         In one aspect, the invention provides a method of assessing whether a subject is
afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer, by determining the level of folate receptor
alpha (FRa) which is not bound to a cell, in a sample (such as urine or serum) derived
from the subject; and comparing the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) which is not
bound to a cell with the level of FRa in a control sample, wherein a difference between
the level of FRa in the sample derived from the subject and the level of FRa in the
control sample is an indication that the subject is afflicted with an FRa-expressing
cancer. In a particular embodiment, the level of FRa in the sample derived from the
subject is assessed by contacting the sample with an antibody that binds FRa not bound
to a cell and is selected from the group consisting of (a) an antibody that binds the same
epitope as the MORAb-003 antibody; and (b) an antibody comprising SEQ ID NO: 1
(GFTFSGYGLS) as CDRH1, SEQ ID NO:2 (MISSGGSYTYYADSVKG) as CDRH2,
SEQ ID NO:3 (HGDDPAWFAY) as CDRH3, SEQ ID NO:4 (SVSSSISSNNLH) as
CDRL1, SEQ ID NO:5 (GTSNLAS) as CDRL2 and SEQ ID NO:6 (QQWSSYPYMYT)
                                            57

as CDRL3. In one embodiment, the sample is selected from the group consisting of
urine and serum.
         In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of assessing whether a
subject is afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer such as lung cancer or ovarian cancer,
the method comprising determining the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) not bound to
a cell in a urine sample derived from the subject; and comparing the level of folate
receptor alpha (FRa) in the urine sample derived from the subject with the level of FRa
in a control sample, wherein a difference between the level of FRa in the urine sample
derived from the subject and the level of FRa in the control sample is an indication that
the subject is afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer.
         In another aspect, the invention provides a method of assessing whether a subject
is afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer, by determining the level of folate receptor
alpha (FRa) not bound to a cell in a serum sample derived from the subject; and
comparing the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) in the serum sample derived from the
subject with the level of FRa in a control sample, wherein a difference between the level
of FRa in the serum sample derived from the subject and the level of FRa in the control
sample is an indication that the subject is afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer. In
particular embodiments, the subject has not been treated with an agent, such as a steroid,
that enhances the levels of FRa in serum. In a specific embodiment, the FRa-expressing
cancer is ovarian cancer and the subject has not been treated with an agent, such as a
steroid, that enhances the levels of FRa in serum.
         In the methods and kits of the present invention, FRa-expressing cancers include
cancers characterized in that the cancer cells express FRa. In particular embodiments,
the FRa is released from the cancer cells, for example, from the surface of the cancer
cell, and into the biological fluids of the subject. FRa-expressing cancers include lung
cancer (e.g., bronchioalveolar carcinomas, carcinoid tumors, and non-small cell lung
cancers, such as adenocarcinomas); mesothelioma; ovarian cancer; renal cancer; brain
cancer (e.g., anaplastic ependymoma and cerebellar juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma);
cervical cancer; nasopharyngeal cancer; mesodermally derived tumor; squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck; endometrial cancer; endometrioid adenocarcinomas of
the ovary, serous cystadenocarcinomas, breast cancer; bladder cancer; pancreatic cancer;
bone cancer (e.g., high-grade osteosarcoma); and pituitary cancer (e.g., pituitary
adenoma). In a particular embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is ovarian cancer.
                                             58

         In certain embodiments of the methods and kits of the present invention, the
FRa-expressing cancer is lung cancer. In more specific embodiments, the lung cancer is
non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In one such embodiment, the NSCLC is
selected from the group consisting of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma,
large cell lung carcinoma, pleomorphic NSCLC, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland
carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma. In a preferred embodiment, the NSCLC is
adenocarcinoma. In alternative embodiments, the lung cancer is small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC). In another embodiment, the lung cancer is bronchioalveolar
carcinoma. In yet another embodiment, the lung cancer is a lung carcinoid tumor.
         The present invention also provides methods to assess whether a subject is
afflicted with ovarian cancer by determining the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) not
bound to a cell in a urine sample derived from the subject, wherein the presence of FRa
in the urine sample at a concentration of greater than about 3000 a.u./ml is an indication
that the subject is afflicted with ovarian cancer. In particular embodiments, the presence
of FRa in the urine sample at a concentration of greater than about 4000 a.u./ml, about
5000 a.u./ml, about 6000 a.u./ml, about 7000 a.u./ml, about 8000 a.u./ml, about 9000
a.u./ml, about 10,000 a.u./ml, about 11,000 a.u./ml, about 12,000 a.u./ml, about 13,000
a.u./ml, about 14,000 a.u./ml, about 15,000 a.u./ml, about 16,000 a.u./ml, about 17,000
a.u./ml, about 18,000 a.u./ml, about 19,000 a.u./ml, about 20,000 a.u./ml, about 21,000
a.u./ml, about 22,000 a.u./ml, about 23,000 a.u./ml, about 24,000 a.u./ml, about 25,000
a.u./ml, about 26,000 a.u./ml, about 27,000 a.u./ml, about 28,000 a.u./ml, about 29,000
a.u./ml or about 30,000 a.u./ml is an indication that the subject is afflicted with ovarian
cancer.
         In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of assessing
whether a subject is afflicted with ovarian cancer, by determining the level of folate
receptor alpha (FRa) in a urine sample derived from the subject, wherein the presence of
FRa in the urine sample at a concentration of greater than about 9100 pg/ml is an
indication that the subject is afflicted with ovarian cancer or wherein a concentration of
less than about 9100 pg/ml is an indication that the subject is not afflicted with ovarian
cancer. For example, the presence of FRa in the urine sample at a concentration of
greater than about 9500 pg/mL, about 10,000 pg/mL, about 11,000 pg/mL, about 12,000
pg/mL, about 13,000 pg/mL, about 14,000 pg/mL, about 15,000 pg/mL, about 16,000

         In certain embodiments of the foregoing aspects of the invention, the levels of
FRa not bound to a cell in a sample (e.g., a sample such as a urine sample or serum
sample) derived from a subject are compared with the levels of FRa in a control sample,
wherein a difference between the levels is an indication that the subject is afflicted with
an FRa-expressing cancer such as lung or ovarian cancer. In a particular embodiment,
the difference constitutes an increase in the level of FRa not bound to a cell in the
sample derived from the subject as compared with the level of FRa in the control
sample, wherein this increase is indicative of the presence or growth of FRa-expressing
cancer. Alternatively, the difference constitutes a decrease in the level of FRa, wherein
the decrease is indicative of the absence or regression of FRa-expressing cancer. As
used herein, "a difference" between the level of folate receptor alpha not bound to a cell
in a sample from a subject (i.e., a test sample) and the level of folate receptor alpha in a
control sample refers broadly to any clinically relevant change (including an increase or
a decrease) and/or statistically significant difference in the level of folate receptor alpha
in the two samples. In an exemplary embodiment, the difference is selected based on a
cutoff value determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, an
example of which is presented in Example 6. The optimal cutoff value may vary
depending on the assay methods and conditions employed. In other embodiments, the
difference must be greater than the limits of detection of the method for determining the
level of FRa not bound to a cell. It is preferred that the difference be at least greater
than the standard error of the assessment method, and preferably a difference of at least
about 2-, about 3-, about 4-, about 5-, about 6-, about 7-, about 8-, about 9-, about 10-,
about 15-, about 20-, about 25-, about 100-, about 500-, about 1000-fold or greater than
the standard error of the assessment method. The difference may be assessed by any
appropriate comparison, including any appropriate parametric or nonparametric
descriptive statistic or comparison. For example, "an increase" in the level of FRa may
refer to a level that exceeds a cutoff value determined using an ROC analysis. It may
                                            60

also refer to a level in a test sample that is two, and more preferably about 5%, about
 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about
60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, about 150%, about 200%, about
300%, about 400%, about 500%, about 600%, about 700%, about 800%, about 900% or
about 1000% more than the level of FRa in the control sample. An increase may also
refer to a level in a test sample that is preferably at least about 1.5, and more preferably
about two, about three, about four, about five or more standard deviations above the
average level of FRa in the control sample. Likewise, "a decrease" in the level of FRa
not bound to a cell may refer to a level in a test sample that does not exceed a cutoff
value determined using an ROC analysis. It may also refer to a level in a test sample
that is about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 40%,
about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, or about 90% less than the level of FRa
in the control sample. A decrease may also refer to a level in a test sample that is
preferably at least about 1.5, and more preferably about two, about three, about four,
about five or more standard deviations below the average level of FRa in the control
sample.
         Samples useful in the methods and kits of the invention include any tissue, cell,
biopsy, or bodily fluid that may contain detectable levels of FRa not bound to a cell. In
one embodiment, a sample may be a tissue, a cell, whole blood, plasma, buccal scrape,
saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, stool, or bronchoalveolar lavage. In some embodiments, the
sample is FRa-expressing tumor sample or a sample of tissues or cells where FRa
expressing cancer may be found. In preferred embodiments, the sample is a urine or
serum sample.
         Body samples may be obtained from a subject by a variety of techniques known
in the art including, for example, by the use of a biopsy or by scraping or swabbing an
area or by using a needle to aspirate bodily fluids. Methods for collecting various body
samples are well known in the art.
         Samples suitable for detecting and quantitating the FRa protein level may be
fresh, frozen, or fixed according to methods known to one of skill in the art. Suitable
tissue samples are preferably sectioned and placed on a microscope slide for further
analyses. Solid samples, i.e., tissue samples, may be solubilized and/or homogenized
and subsequently analyzed as soluble extracts. Liquid samples may also be subjected to
physical or chemical treatments. In some embodiments, urine samples are treated by
                                              61

centrifugation, vortexing, dilution and/or treatment with a solubilizing substance (such
as, for example, guanidine treatment).
         In one embodiment, a freshly obtained biopsy sample is frozen using, for
example, liquid nitrogen or difluorodichloromethane. The frozen sample is mounted for
sectioning using, for example, OCT, and serially sectioned in a cryostat. The serial
sections are collected on a glass microscope slide. For immunohistochemical staining
the slides may be coated with, for example, chrome-alum, gelatine or poly-L-lysine to
ensure that the sections stick to the slides. In another embodiment, samples are fixed
and embedded prior to sectioning. For example, a tissue sample may be fixed in, for
example, formalin, serially dehydrated and embedded in, for example, paraffin.
         Once the sample is obtained, any method known in the art to be suitable for
detecting and quantitating FRa not bound to a cell may be used (either at the nucleic
acid or, preferably, at the protein level), as described in section (B) below. Exemplary
methods are well known in the art and include but are not limited to western blots,
northern blots, southern blots, immunohistochemistry, solution phase assay, ELISA, e.g.,
amplified ELISA, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry,
immunocytochemistry, mass spectrometrometric analyses, e.g., MALDI-TOF and
SELDI-TOF, nucleic acid hybridization techniques, nucleic acid reverse transcription
methods, and nucleic acid amplification methods.
         In many embodiments, the level of FRa not bound to a cell in the sample (such
as, for example, urine or serum) is assessed by contacting the sample with an antibody
that binds FRa. Antibodies that bind FRa are known in the art and include (i) the
murine monoclonal LK26 antibody (the heavy and light chains thereof are presented
herein as SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23), as described in European Patent Application No.
86104170.5 (Rettig) (the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference);
(ii) the MORAB-003 antibody, as described in International Publication No.
W02004/113388 and U.S. Patent No. 5,646,253, the entire contents of each of which are
incorporated herein by reference. The monoclonal antibodies MOV18 and MOv19 also
bind different epitopes on the FRa molecule (previously known as gp38/FBP). Miotti,
S. et al. Int J Cancer, 38: 297-303 (1987). For example, the MOV18 antibody binds the
epitope set forth herein as SEQ ID NO:26
(TELLNVXMNAK*XKEKPXPX*KLXXQX) (note that at position 12, a tryptophan or
                                             62

histidine residue is possible, and at position 21, an aspartic acid or glutamic acid residue
is possible), as taught in Coney et al. CancerRes, 51: 6125-6132 (1991).
        As used herein, the term "MORAb-003" refers to an antibody that specifically
binds FRa and which comprises the mature heavy chain amino acid sequence as set
forth in SEQ ID NO:7 and the mature light chain sequence of SEQ ID NO:8. The
corresponding pre-protein amino acid sequences for MORAb-003 are set forth in SEQ
ID NOs: 9 (heavy chain) and 10 (light chain). The MORAb-003 antibody comprises the
following CDRs: SEQ ID NO:1 as CDRH1, SEQ ID NO:2 as CDRH2, SEQ ID NO:3 as
CDRH3, SEQ ID NO:4 as CDRL1, SEQ ID NO:5 as CDRL2, and SEQ ID NO:6 as

          In a preferred embodiment, the antibody that binds FRa comprises at least one of
the following CDRs, as derived from the murine LK26 heavy and light chains: SEQ ID
NO:1 (GFTFSGYGLS) as CDRH1, SEQ ID NO:2 (MISSGGSYTYYADSVKG) as
CDRH2, SEQ ID NO:3 (HGDDPAWFAY) as CDRH3, SEQ ID NO:4
(SVSSSISSNNLH) as CDRL1, SEQ ID NO:5 (GTSNLAS) as CDRL2 and SEQ ID
NO:6 (QQWSSYPYMYT) as CDRL3. See US Patent No. 5,646,253, the contents of
which, as they relate to the anti-FRa antibodies that may be used in the present
invention, are incorporated herein by reference. Further mutations may be made in the
framework regions as taught in US Patent No. 5,646,253, the contents of which are
hereby incorporated by reference.
          In another preferred embodiment, the antibody includes a variable region light
chain selected from the group consisting of LK26HuVK (SEQ ID NO: 13)
LK26HuVKY (SEQ ID NO: 14), LK26HuVKPW (SEQ ID NO: 15), and
LK26HuVKPW,Y (SEQ ID NO: 16); and a variable region heavy chain selected from
the group consisting of LK26HuVH (SEQ ID NO: 17); LK26HuVH FAIS,N (SEQ ID
NO: 18); LK26HuVH SLF (SEQ ID NO: 19); LK26HuVH II (SEQ ID NO: 20); and
LK26KOLHuVH (SEQ ID NO: 21). See US Patent No. 5,646,253 and US Patent No.
6,124,106. In another embodiment, the antibody comprises the heavy chain variable
region LK26KOLHuVH (SEQ ID NO: 21) and the light chain variable region
LK26HuVKPW,Y (SEQ ID NO: 16). In another embodiment, the antibody comprises
the heavy chain variable region LK26HuVH SLF (SEQ ID NO: 19) and the light chain
variable region LK26HuVKPW,Y (SEQ ID NO: 16). In a further embodiment, the
antibody comprises the heavy chain variable region LK26HuVH FAIS,N (SEQ ID NO:
 18) and the light chain variable region LK26HuVKPW,Y (SEQ ID NO: 16).
          In some embodiments, samples may need to be modified in order to make FRa
accessible to antibody binding. In a particular aspect of the immunocytochemistry or
immunohistochemistry methods, slides may be transferred to a pretreatment buffer and
optionally heated to increase antigen accessibility. Heating of the sample in the
pretreatment buffer rapidly disrupts the lipid bi-layer of the cells and makes the antigens
(may be the case in fresh specimens, but not typically what occurs in fixed specimens)
(i.e., the FRa protein) more accessible for antibody binding. The term "pretreatment
buffer" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a buffer that is used to prepare
cytology or histology samples for immunostaining, particularly by increasing FRa
                                           72

protein accessibility for antibody binding. The pretreatment buffer may comprise a pH
specific salt solution, a polymer, a detergent, or a nonionic or anionic surfactant such as,
for example, an ethyloxylated anionic or nonionic surfactant, an alkanoate or an
alkoxylate or even blends of these surfactants or even the use of a bile salt. The
pretreatment buffer may, for example, be a solution of 0.1% to 1% of deoxycholic acid,
sodium salt, or a solution of sodium laureth-13-carboxylate (e.g., Sandopan LS) or and
ethoxylated anionic complex. In some embodiments, the pretreatment buffer may also
be used as a slide storage buffer. In a particular embodiment, the sample, for example,
the urine sample, is centrifuged, vortexed, diluted and/or subjected to guanidine
treatment.
        Any method for making FRa protein more accessible for antibody binding may
be used in the practice of the invention, including the antigen retrieval methods known
in the art. See, for example, Bibbo, et al. (2002) Acta. Cytol. 46:25-29; Saqi, et al.
(2003) Diagn. Cytopathol. 27:365-370; Bibbo, et al. (2003) Anal. Quant. Cytol. Histol.
25:8-11, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
        Following pretreatment to increase FRa protein accessibility, samples may be
blocked using an appropriate blocking agent, e.g., a peroxidase blocking reagent such as
hydrogen peroxide. In some embodiments, the samples may be blocked using a protein
blocking reagent to prevent non-specific binding of the antibody. The protein blocking
reagent may comprise, for example, purified casein. An antibody, particularly a
monoclonal or polyclonal antibody, that specifically binds to FRa is then incubated with
the sample.
        Techniques for detecting antibody binding are well known in the art. Antibody
binding to FRa may be detected through the use of chemical reagents that generate a
detectable signal that corresponds to the level of antibody binding and, accordingly, to
the level of FRa protein expression. In one of the immunohistochemistry or
immunocytochemistry methods of the invention, antibody binding is detected through
the use of a secondary antibody that is conjugated to a labeled polymer. Examples of
labeled polymers include but are not limited to polymer-enzyme conjugates. The
enzymes in these complexes are typically used to catalyze the deposition of a chromagen
at the antigen-antibody binding site, thereby resulting in cell staining that corresponds to
expression level of the biomarker of interest. Enzymes include, but are not limited to,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP).
                                            73

         In one immunohistochemistry or immunocytochemistry method of the invention,
antibody binding to the FRa protein is detected through the use of an HRP-labeled
polymer that is conjugated to a secondary antibody. Antibody binding can also be
detected through the use of a species-specific probe reagent, which binds to monoclonal
or polyclonal antibodies, and a polymer conjugated to HRP, which binds to the species
specific probe reagent. Slides are stained for antibody binding using any chromagen,
e.g., the chromagen 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and then counterstained with
hematoxylin and, optionally, a bluing agent such as ammonium hydroxide or
TBS/Tween-20. Other suitable chromagens include, for example, 3-amino-9
ethylcarbazole (AEC). In some aspects of the invention, slides are reviewed
microscopically by a cytotechnologist and/or a pathologist to assess cell staining, e.g.,
fluorescent staining (i.e., FRa expression). Alternatively, samples may be reviewed via
automated microscopy or by personnel with the assistance of computer software that
facilitates the identification of positive staining cells.
         In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody is labeled. For example,
detection of antibody binding can be facilitated by coupling the anti-FRa antibody to a
detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes,
prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent
materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish
peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, P-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of
suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin;
examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein,
fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl
chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol;
examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and
examples of suitable radioactive material include 125,1      35,  C, or 3H.  In a particular
embodiment, the antibody is labeled with a radio-label, chromophore-label, fluorophore
label, or enzyme-label.
         In one embodiment of the invention frozen samples are prepared as described
above and subsequently stained with antibodies against FRa diluted to an appropriate
concentration using, for example, Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Primary antibodies can be
detected by incubating the slides in biotinylated anti-immunoglobulin. This signal can
optionally be amplified and visualized using diaminobenzidine precipitation of the
                                             74

antigen. Furthermore, slides can be optionally counterstained with, for example,
hematoxylin, to visualize the cells.
         In another embodiment, fixed and embedded samples are stained with antibodies
against FRa and counterstained as described above for frozen sections. In addition,
samples may be optionally treated with agents to amplify the signal in order to visualize
antibody staining. For example, a peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of biotinyl-tyramide,
which in turn is reacted with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Catalyzed Signal
Amplification (CSA) System, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) may be used.
         One of skill in the art will recognize that the concentration of a particular
antibody used to practice the methods of the invention will vary depending on such
factors as time for binding, level of specificity of the antibody for FRa, and method of
sample preparation. Moreover, when multiple antibodies are used, the required
concentration may be affected by the order in which the antibodies are applied to the
sample, e.g., simultaneously as a cocktail or sequentially as individual antibody
reagents. Furthermore, the detection chemistry used to visualize antibody binding to
FRa must be optimized to produce the desired signal to noise ratio.
In one embodiment of the invention, proteomic methods, e.g., mass spectrometry, are
used for detecting and quantitating the FRa protein. For example, matrix-associated
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) or
surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI
TOF MS) which involves the application of a sample, such as serum, to a protein
binding chip (Wright, G.L., Jr., et al. (2002) Expert Rev Mol Diagn 2:549; Li, J., et al.
(2002) Clin Chem 48:1296; Laronga, C., et al. (2003) Dis Markers 19:229; Petricoin,
E.F., et al. (2002) 359:572; Adam, B.L., et al. (2002) Cancer Res 62:3609; Tolson, J., et
al. (2004) Lab Invest 84:845; Xiao, Z., et al. (2001) CancerRes 61:6029) can be used to
detect and quantitate the FRa protein. Mass spectrometric methods are described in, for
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,622,824, 5,605,798 and 5,547,835, the entire contents of
each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
         The present invention is further predicated, at least in part, on the identification
of FRa as a prognostic biomarker, i.e., as a biomarker of the progression and/ or
severity, of an FRa-expressing cancer such as ovarian cancer or non-small cell lung
cancer. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of assessing the
progression of an FRa-expressing cancer in a subject afflicted with ovarian cancer by
                                             75

comparing the level of FRa in a sample derived from a subject with the level of FRa in
a control sample, wherein a difference in the level of FRa in the sample (such as a urine
or serum sample) derived from the subject compared with the control sample is an
indication that the cancer will progress rapidly. Similarly, methods of assessing the
level of risk that a subject will develop an FRa-expressing cancer involve comparing
the level of FRa in a sample derived from a subject with the level of FRa in a control
sample, wherein a difference in the level of FRa in the sample (such as urine or serum
sample) derived from the subject compared with the control sample is an indication that
the subject has a higher level of risk of developing an FRa-expressing cancer as
compared to normal risk in a healthy individual.
        In one embodiment, the difference is an increase. In another embodiment, the
difference is a decrease. In some types of cancers (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck, ovarian cancer), a higher level of FRa expression is associated with a
worse prognosis, whereas in other types of cancers (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancers), a
higher level of FRa expression is associated with a better prognosis. Thus, in one
specific embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is ovarian cancer or squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck and the difference is an increase. In another specific
embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is a non small-cell lung cancer, and the
difference is a decrease.
        In certain aspects, the invention provides methods of assessing the progression of
an FRa-expressing cancer in a subject afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer by
comparing the level of FRa in a sample derived from a subject with the level of FRa in
a control sample, wherein an increase in the level of FRa in the sample (such as a urine
or serum sample) derived from the subject compared with the control sample is an
indication that the cancer will progress rapidly, or a decrease in the level of FRa in the
sample derived from the subject as compared with the level of FRa in the control
sample is an indication that the cancer will progress slowly or will regress. Similarly,
methods of assessing the level of risk that a subject will develop an FRa-expressing
cancer involve comparing the level of FRa in a sample derived from a subject with the
level of FRa in a control sample, wherein an increase in the level of FRa in the sample
(such as urine or serum sample) derived from the subject compared with the control
sample is an indication that the subject has a higher level of risk of developing an FRa
expressing cancer as compared to normal risk in a healthy individual, or a decrease in
                                            76

the level of FRu in the sample derived from the subject as compared with the level of
FRu in the control sample is an indication that the subject has a lower level of risk of
developing an FRa-expressing cancer as compared to a normal risk in a healthy
individual.
         Any clinically relevant or statistically significant increase or decrease, using any
analytical method known in the art, may be utilized in the prognostic, risk assessment
and other methods of the invention. In one embodiment, an increase in the level of FRu
in the level of FRu refers to a level that exceeds a cutoff value determined using an
ROC analysis as exemplified in Example 6. In another embodiment, a decrease in the
level of FRu refers to a level in a test sample that does not exceed a cutoff value
determined using an ROC analysis.
         In other embodiments, the increase or decrease must be greater than the limits of
detection of the method for determining the level of FRu. In further embodiments, the
increase or decrease be at least greater than the standard error of the assessment method,
and preferably a difference of at least about 2-, about 3-, about 4-, about 5-, about 6-,
about 7-, about 8-, about 9-, about 10-, about 15-, about 20-, about 25-, about 100-,
about 500-, about 1000-fold or greater than the standard error of the assessment method.
In some embodiments, the increase or decrease is assessed using parametric or
nonparametric descriptive statistics, comparisons, regression analyses, and the like.
         In other embodiments, the increase or decrease is a level in the sample derived
from the subject that is about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about
30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about
100%, about 150%, about 200%, about 300%, about 400%, about 500%, about 600%,
about 700%, about 800%, about 900% or about 1000% more or less than the level of
FRu in the control sample. In alternative embodiments, the increase or decrease is a
level in the sample derived from the subject that is at least about 1.5, and more
preferably about two, about three, about four, about five or more standard deviations
above or below the average level of FRu in the control sample. As used herein, the
phrase "progression of an FRa-expressing cancer in a subject afflicted with an FRa
expressing cancer" may refer to the progression of an FRa-expressing cancer from a
less severe to a more severe cancer state. This could include an increase in the number or
severity of tumors, the degree of metastasis, the speed with which the cancer is growing
and spreading, and the like. In certain embodiments, the progression is a progression
                                             77

from a less severe stage to a more severe stage, wherein the stage is assessed according
to a staging scheme known in the art. In one embodiment, wherein the FRa-expressing
cancer is ovarian cancer, the progression refers to a progression from Stage I to Stage II,
from Stage II to Stage III, etc. In another embodiment, wherein the FRa-expressing
cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the progression refers to a progression
from Stage 0 to Stage IA, Stage IA to Stage IB, Stage IB to Stage IIA, Stage IIA to
Stage JIB, Stage JIB to Stage IIC, etc. In another embodiment, wherein the FRa
expressing cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the progression refers to a
progression from a less severe to a more severe stage as determined under the TNM
classification system. See Spira; Greene; Sobin.
         Alternatively, the phrase "progression of an FRa-expressing cancer in a subject
afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer" may refer to a regression of an FRa-expressing
cancer from a more severe state to a less severe state, such as a decrease in the number
or severity of tumors, the degree of metastasis, the speed with which the cancer is
growing and spreading, and the like. In certain embodiments, the progression is a
progression from a more severe stage to a less severe stage, wherein the stage is assessed
according to a staging scheme known in the art. In one embodiment, wherein the FRa
expressing cancer is ovarian cancer, the progression refers to a regression from Stage IV
to Stage III, from Stage III to Stage II, etc. In another embodiment, wherein the FRa
expressing cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the progression refers to a
progression from Stage IV to Stage IIIB, Stage IJIB to Stage IIIA, Stage IIIA to Stage
JIB, etc. In another embodiment, wherein the FRa-expressing cancer is non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), the progression refers to a progression from a more severe to a
less severe stage as determined under the TNM classification system. See Spira;
Greene; Sobin.
         In further embodiments, the level of FRa may be used to calculate the likelihood
that a subject is afflicted with an FRa-expressing cancer, the progression of an FRca
expressing cancer in a subject, the level of risk of developing an FRca-expressing cancer,
the risk of cancer recurrence in a subject being treated for an FRca-expres sing, the
survival of a subject being treated for an FRa-expressing cancer, the efficacy of a
treatment regimen for treating an FRca-expressing cancer, and the like, using the
methods of the invention, which may include methods of regression analysis known to
one of skill in the art. For example, suitable regression models include, but are not
                                             78

limited to CART (e.g., Hill, T, and Lewicki, P. (2006) "STATISTICS Methods and
Applications" StatSoft, Tulsa, OK), Cox (e.g., www.evidence-based-medicine.co.uk),
exponential, normal and log normal (e.g.,
www.obgyn.cam.ac.uk/mrg/statsbook/stsurvan.html), logistic (e.g.,
www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic-regression), parametric, non-parametric, semi
parametric (e.g., www.socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion), linear (e.g.,
www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-regression), or additive (e.g.,
www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizedadditivemodel).
         In one embodiment, a regression analysis includes the level of FRa. In further
embodiments, a regression analysis may include additional clinical and/or molecular co
variates. Such clinical co-variates include, but are not limited to, age of the subject,
tumor stage, tumor grade, tumor size, treatment regime, e.g., chemotherapy and/or
radiation therapy, clinical outcome (e.g., relapse, disease-specific survival, therapy
failure), and/or clinical outcome as a function of time after diagnosis, time after
initiation of therapy, and/or time after completion of treatment. Molecular co-variates
can include, but are not limited to additional molecular marker values. For example, in
embodiments wherein the FRa-expressing cancer is ovarian cancer, such markers may
include, e.g., serum CA125 levels, serum DF3 levels, and/or plasma LPA levels.
         In other aspects, the invention provides methods for monitoring the effectiveness
of a therapy or treatment regimen. For example, the present invention provides methods
for monitoring the efficacy of MORAb-003 treatment of ovarian cancer or lung cancer
in a subject suffering from ovarian cancer or lung cancer. Specifically, the methods
involve determining the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) which is not bound to a cell,
in a sample derived from said subject, wherein said subject has been previously
administered MORAb-003; and comparing the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa)
which is not bound to a cell with the level of FRa in a control sample, wherein an
increase or no change in the level of FRa in the sample derived from said subject as
compared with the level of FRa in the control sample is an indication that the MORAb
003 treatment is not efficacious; and wherein a decrease in the level of FRa in the
sample derived from said subject as compared with the level of FRa in the control
sample is an indication that the MORAb-003 treatment is efficacious.
                                            79

         For example, the control sample may be derived from a subject not subjected to
the treatment regimen and a test sample may be derived from a subject subjected to at
least a portion of the treatment regimen. Alternatively, the test sample and the control
sample may be derived from the same subject. For example, the test sample may be a
sample derived from a subject after administration of a therapeutic, such as MORAb
003. The control sample may be a sample derived from a subject prior to administration
of therapeutic or at an earlier stage of therapeutic regimen. Accordingly, a decrease in
the level of expression of FRa in the test sample, relative to the control sample, is an
indication that therapy has decreased the progression of the FRca-expressing cancer, for
example, ovarian cancer. For FRa-expressing cancers wherein a higher level of FRa is
associated with a worse prognosis, such as e.g., ovarian cancer or squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, a decrease in the level of expression of FRa in the test
sample, relative to the control sample, is an indication that therapy is effective in
slowing the progression of the FRa-expressing cancer, or in causing a regression of the
cancer, in the subject afflicted with the FRa-expressing cancer. In a preferred
embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is ovarian cancer.
         In various embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the sample may be urine,
serum, plasma or ascites. In particular embodiments, the sample is urine or serum.
Moreover, the FRa may be determined by contacting the sample with an antibody that
binds FRa, optionally, using antibodies as described herein and assay methods as
described herein.
         In various embodiments, the MORAb-003 treatment antibody is (a) an antibody
that comprises the heavy chain amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:7 and
the light chain amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:8; (b) an antibody that
binds the same epitope as the MORAb-003 antibody; or (c) an antibody comprising SEQ
ID NO:1 (GFTFSGYGLS) as CDRH1, SEQ ID NO:2 (MISSGGSYTYYADSVKG) as
CDRH2, SEQ ID NO:3 (HGDDPAWFAY) as CDRH3, SEQ ID NO:4
(SVSSSISSNNLH) as CDRL1, SEQ ID NO:5 (GTSNLAS) as CDRL2 and SEQ ID
NO:6 (QQWSSYPYMYT) as CDRL3..
         In a particular embodiment, the FRa-expressing cancer is ovarian cancer. In
other embodiments, the FRa-expressing cancer is lung cancer. In more specific
embodiments, the lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In one such
embodiment, the NSCLC is selected from the group consisting of adenocarcinoma,
                                            80

squamous cell lung carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma, pleomorphic NSCLC,
carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma. In a preferred
embodiment, the NSCLC is adenocarcinoma. In alternative embodiments, the lung
cancer is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). In another embodiment, the lung cancer is
bronchioalveolar carcinoma. In yet another embodiment, the lung cancer is a lung
carcinoid tumor.
         In another aspect, the invention provides methods of stratifying a subject with an
FRa-expressing cancer into cancer therapy groups based on the determined level of FRa
in a sample. In a preferred embodiment, the method involves stratifying a subject with
an FRa-expressing cancer into one of at least four cancer therapy groups. In other
embodiments, the method involves stratifying a subject with an FRca-expressing cancer
into one of at least about two, about three, about four, about five, about six, about seven,
about eight, about nine, or about ten cancer therapy groups.
         According to the present invention, the levels of FRa may be associated with the
severity, i.e., the stage, of the FRa expressing cancer. For example, ovarian cancer is
stratified into different stages based on the severity of the cancer, as set forth herein.
Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for stratifying ovarian cancer into
Stage I, for example, Stage IA, Stage lB or Stage IC; Stage II, for example, Stage IIA,
Stage JIB or Stage IIC; Stage III, for example, Stage IIIA, Stage IIIB or Stage IIIC; or
Stage IV ovarian cancer.
         SCLS or NSCLC may be stratified into different stages based on the severity of
the cancer, as set forth herein. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for
stratifying the lung cancer, for example, SCLS or NSCLC, into the occult (hidden)
stage; stage 0; Stage I, for example, stages IA and TB; Stage II, for example, stages IIA
and JIB; Stage III, for example, stages IIIA and IIIB; or Stage IV lung cancer.
         In yet another aspect, the present invention is predicated, at least in part, on the
finding that FRa can serve as a predictive biomarker for treatment of FRa expressing
cancers. Specifically, the methods of the present invention provide for assessing
whether a subject will respond to treatment, for example, with MORAb-003, and
whether and when to initiate treatment, for example, with MORAb-003, by assessing the
levels of FRa in a subject.
                                            81

         In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for predicting whether a
subject suffering from an FRa expressing cancer, for example, ovarian or lung cancer,
will respond to treatment with MORAb-003, by determining the level of folate receptor
alpha (FRa) which is not bound to a cell in a sample derived from said subject; and
comparing the level of folate receptor alpha (FRa) which is not bound to a cell in the
sample derived from said subject with the level of FRa in a control sample, wherein a
difference between the level of FRa in the sample derived from said subject and the
level of FRa in the control sample is an indication that the subject will respond to
treatment with MORAb-003.
         In certain embodiments, the degree of difference between the levels of FRa not
bound to a cancer cell in the test sample as compared to the control sample is indicative
that the subject will respond to treatment with MORAb-003. For example, a difference
of at least about 2-, about 3-, about 4-, about 5-, about 6-, about 7-, about 8-, about 9-,
about 10-, about 15-, about 20-, about 25-, about 100-, about 500-, about 1000-fold or
greater than the standard error of the assessment method is indicative that the subject
will respond to treatment with MORAb-003. Alternatively or in combination, a
difference of at least about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about
30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about
 100%, about 150%, about 200%, about 300%, about 400%, about 500%, about 600%,
about 700%, about 800%, about 900% or about 1000% is indicative that the subject will
respond to treatment with MORAb-003. Alternatively or in combination, a difference of
at least about 1.5, and more preferably about two, about three, about four, about five or
more standard deviations is indicative that the subject will respond to treatment with
MORAb-003.
         In various embodiments, the MORAb-003 treatment antibody is (a) an antibody
that binds the same epitope as the MORAb-003 antibody; or (b) an antibody comprising
SEQ ID NO:1 (GFTFSGYGLS) as CDRH1, SEQ ID NO:2
(MISSGGSYTYYADSVKG) as CDRH2, SEQ ID NO:3 (HGDDPAWFAY) as CDRH3,
SEQ ID NO:4 (SVSSSISSNNLH) as CDRL1, SEQ ID NO:5 (GTSNLAS) as CDRL2
and SEQ ID NO:6 (QQWSSYPYMYT) as CDRL3.
         In various embodiments, the sample is urine, plasma, serum or ascites. In
particular embodiments, the sample is urine or serum. In further embodiments, the
FRa-expressing cancer is selected from the group consisting of lung cancer,
                                            82

mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, brain cancer, cervical cancer,
nasopharyngeal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, endometrial
cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer, pituitary cancer,
colorectal cancer and medullary thyroid cancer. In a particular embodiment, the FRa
expressing cancer is ovarian cancer. In another embodiment, the FRa-expressing
cancer is non-small cell lung cancer, such as adenocarcinoma.
         B.     Anti-FRa Antibody Based Assays for Detectin2 FRa-Expressing
Cancers
         There are a variety of assay formats known to those of ordinary skill in the art for
using an antibody to detect a polypeptide in a sample, including but not limited to
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA),
immunofluorimetry, immunoprecipitation, solution phase assay, equilibrium dialysis,
immunodiffusion and other techniques. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988; Weir, D. M., Handbook of
Experimental Immunology, 1986, Blackwell Scientific, Boston. For example, the assay
may be performed in a Western blot format, wherein a protein preparation from the
biological sample is submitted to gel electrophoresis, transferred to a suitable membrane
and allowed to react with the antibody. The presence of the antibody on the membrane
may then be detected using a suitable detection reagent, as is well known in the art and
described below.
         In another embodiment, the assay involves the use of an antibody immobilized
on a solid support to bind to the target FRa polypeptide and remove it from the
remainder of the sample. The bound FRa polypeptide may then be detected using a
second antibody reactive with a distinct FRa polypeptide antigenic determinant, for
example, a reagent that contains a detectable reporter moiety. As a non-limiting
example, according to this embodiment the immobilized antibody and the second
antibody which recognize distinct antigenic determinants may be any two of the
monoclonal antibodies described herein selected from MORAb-003, MOV 18, 548908,
6D398 or variants thereof as described herein. Alternatively, a competitive assay may
be utilized, in which FRa is labeled with a detectable reporter moiety and allowed to
bind to the immobilized anti-FRa antibody after incubation of the immobilized antibody
with the sample. The extent to which components of the sample inhibit the binding of
                                           83

the labeled polypeptide to the antibody is indicative of the reactivity of the sample with
the immobilized antibody, and as a result, indicative of the level of FRa in the sample.
        The solid support may be any material known to those of ordinary skill in the art
to which the antibody may be attached, such as a test well in a microtiter plate, a
nitrocellulose filter or another suitable membrane. Alternatively, the support may be a
bead or disc, such as glass, fiberglass, latex or a plastic such as polystyrene or
polyvinylchloride. The antibody may be immobilized on the solid support using a
variety of techniques known to those in the art, which are amply described in the patent
and scientific literature.
        In certain preferred embodiments, the assay for detection of FRa in a sample is
a two-antibody sandwich assay. This assay may be performed by first contacting a FRa
specific antibody (e.g., MORAb-003, MOV18, 548908, 6D398 or variants thereof as
described herein) that has been immobilized on a solid support, commonly the well of a
microtiter plate, with the biological sample, such that a soluble molecule naturally
occurring in the sample and having an antigenic determinant that is reactive with the
antibody is allowed to bind to the immobilized antibody (e.g., a 30 minute incubation
time at room temperature is generally sufficient) to form an antigen-antibody complex or
an immune complex. Unbound constituents of the sample are then removed from the
immobilized immune complexes. Next, a second antibody specific for FRa is added,
wherein the antigen combining site of the second antibody does not competitively inhibit
binding of the antigen combining site of the immobilized first antibody to FRa (e.g.,
MORAb-003, MOV 18, 548908, 6D398 or variants thereof as described herein, that is
not the same as the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the solid support). The second
antibody may be detectably labeled as provided herein, such that it may be directly
detected. Alternatively, the second antibody may be indirectly detected through the use
of a detectably labeled secondary (or "second stage") anti-antibody, or by using a
specific detection reagent as provided herein. The subject invention method is not
limited to any particular detection procedure, as those having familiarity with
immunoassays will appreciate that there are numerous reagents and configurations for
immunologically detecting a particular antigen (e.g., FRa) in a two-antibody sandwich
immunoassay.
        In certain preferred embodiments of the invention using the two-antibody
sandwich assay described above, the first, immobilized antibody specific for FRa is a
                                            84

polyclonal antibody and the second antibody specific for FRa is a polyclonal antibody.
In certain other embodiments of the invention, the first, immobilized antibody specific
for FRa is a monoclonal antibody and the second antibody specific for FRa is a
polyclonal antibody. In certain other embodiments of the invention the first,
immobilized antibody specific for FRa is a polyclonal antibody and the second antibody
specific for FRa is a monoclonal antibody. In certain other embodiments of the
invention, the first, immobilized antibody specific for FRa is a monoclonal antibody and
the second antibody specific for FRa is a monoclonal antibody. For example, in these
embodiments it should be noted that monoclonal antibodies MORAb-003, MOV 18,
548908, 6D398 or variants thereof as described herein, as provided herein recognize
distinct and noncompetitive antigenic determinants (e.g., epitopes) on FRa polypeptides,
such that any pairwise combination of these monoclonal antibodies may be employed. In
other preferred embodiments of the invention, the first, immobilized antibody specific
for FRa and/or the second antibody specific for FRa may be any of the kinds of
antibodies known in the art and referred to herein, for example, by way of illustration
and not limitation, Fab fragments, F(ab') 2 fragments, immunoglobulin V-region fusion
proteins or single chain antibodies. Those familiar with the art will appreciate that the
present invention encompasses the use of other antibody forms, fragments, derivatives
and the like in the methods disclosed and claimed herein.
        In certain particularly preferred embodiments, the second antibody may contain a
detectable reporter moiety or label such as an enzyme, dye, radionuclide, luminescent
group, fluorescent group or biotin, or the like. The amount of the second antibody that
remains bound to the solid support is then determined using a method appropriate for the
specific detectable reporter moiety or label. For radioactive groups, scintillation
counting or autoradiographic methods are generally appropriate. Antibody-enzyme
conjugates may be prepared using a variety of coupling techniques (for review see, e.g.,
Scouten, W. H., Methods in Enzymology 135:30-65, 1987). Spectroscopic methods may
be used to detect dyes (including, for example, colorimetric products of enzyme
reactions), luminescent groups and fluorescent groups. Biotin may be detected using
avidin or streptavidin, coupled to a different reporter group (commonly a radioactive or
fluorescent group or an enzyme). Enzyme reporter groups may generally be detected by
the addition of substrate (generally for a specific period of time), followed by
spectroscopic, spectrophotometric or other analysis of the reaction products. Standards
                                           85

and standard additions may be used to determine the level of mesothelin polypeptide in a
sample, using well known techniques.
        A method of screening for the presence of an FRa expressing cancer according
to the present invention may be further enhanced by the detection of more than one
tumor associated marker in a biological sample from a subject. Accordingly, in certain
embodiments the present invention provides a method of screening that, in addition to
detecting reactivity of FRa not bound to a cell, also includes detection of at least one
additional soluble marker of a malignant condition using established methods as known
in the art and provided herein. As noted above, there are currently a number of soluble
tumor associated antigens that are detectable in samples of readily obtained biological
fluids.
        C.      Kits of the Invention
        The invention also provides kits for assessing whether a subject is afflicted with
an FRa-expressing cancer, for assessing the progression of an FRca-expressing cancer,
for assessing the level of risk that a subject will develop an FRca-expressing cancer, or
for monitoring the effectiveness of a therapy or treatment regimen for an FRa
expressing cancer. These kits include means for determining the level of expression of
FRa and instructions for use of the kit to assess the progression of an FRca-expressing
cancer, to assess the level of risk that a subject will develop an FRca-expressing cancer,
or to monitor the effectiveness of a therapy or treatment regimen for an FRca-expressing
cancer.
        The kits of the invention may optionally comprise additional components useful
for performing the methods of the invention. By way of example, the kits may comprise
means for obtaining a sample from a subject, a control sample, e.g., a sample from a
subject having slowly progressing cancer and/or a subject not having cancer, one or
more sample compartments, and instructional material which describes performance of a
method of the invention and tissue specific controls/standards.
        The means for determining the level of FRa include known methods in the art
for assessing protein levels, as discussed above, and specific preferred embodiments, for
example, utilizing the MORAb-003 antibody, as discussed herein. Thus, for example, in
one embodiment, the level of FRa is assessed by contacting a sample derived from a
subject (such as urine or serum) with a folate receptor alpha (FRa) binding agent. In a
                                             86

preferred embodiment, the binding agent is an antibody. Many of the types of
antibodies that bind FRa are discussed above in the methods of the invention and may
also be utilized in the kits of the invention.
        The means for determining the level of FRa can further include, for example,
buffers or other reagents for use in an assay for determining the level of FRa. The
instructions can be, for example, printed instructions for performing the assay and/or
instructions for evaluating the level of expression of FRa.
        The kits of the inventions may also include means for isolating a sample from a
subject. These means can comprise one or more items of equipment or reagents that can
be used to obtain a fluid or tissue from a subject. The means for obtaining a sample
from a subject may also comprise means for isolating blood components, such as serum,
from a blood sample. Preferably, the kit is designed for use with a human subject.
III. Screening Assays
        In further embodiments, the invention also provides methods (also referred to
herein as "screening assays") for identifying modulators, i.e., candidate or test
compounds or agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids, small
molecules or other drugs), which modulate the growth, progression and/or
aggressiveness of cancer, e.g., an FRca-expressing cancer, or a cancer cell, e.g., an
ovarian cancer cell, by monitoring and comparing the levels of FRa in a sample. Such
assays typically comprise a test compound, or a combination of test compounds, whose
activity against cancer or a cancer cell is to be evaluated. Compounds identified via
assays such as those described herein may be useful, for example, for modulating, e.g.,
inhibiting, ameliorating, treating, or preventing aggressiveness of an FRca-expressing
cancer or a cancer cell, e.g., an ovarian cancer cell. By monitoring the level of FRa in a
sample, one can determine whether the FRa-expressing cancer is progressing or
regressing and whether the test compound has the desired effect. For example, in
embodiments wherein the FRa-expressing cancer is a cancer for which higher levels of
FRa are associated with a worse prognosis, a decrease in the level of FRa after
administration of the test compound(s) would be indicative of the efficacy of the test
compound. By contrast, an increase in the level of FRa after administration of the test
compound(s) would indicate that the test compound is not effective in treating ovarian
                                             87

cancer. By contrast, in embodiments wherein the FRa-expressing cancer is a cancer for
which higher levels of FRa are associated with a better prognosis, an increase in the
level of FRa after administration of the test compound(s) would be indicative of the
efficacy of the test compound. By contrast, an decrease in the level of FRa after
administration of the test compound(s) would indicate that the test compound is not
effective in treating ovarian cancer.
         The test compounds used in the screening assays of the present invention may be
obtained from any available source, including systematic libraries of natural and/or
synthetic compounds. Test compounds may also be obtained by any of the numerous
approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including biological
libraries; peptoid libraries (libraries of molecules having the functionalities of peptides,
but with a novel, non-peptide backbone which are resistant to enzymatic degradation but
which nevertheless remain bioactive; see, e.g., Zuckermann et al., 1994, J. Med. Chem.
37:2678-85); spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries;
synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the 'one-bead one-compound' library
method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The
biological library and peptoid library approaches are limited to peptide libraries, while
the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small
molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, 1997, Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145).
         Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the
art, for example in: DeWitt et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6909; Erb et
al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11422; Zuckermann et al. (1994). J. Med.
Chem. 37:2678; Cho et al. (1993) Science 261:1303; Carrell et al. (1994) Angew. Chem.
Int. Ed. Engl. 33:2059; Carell et al. (1994) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33:2061; and in
Gallop et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:1233.
         Libraries of compounds may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten, 1992,
Biotechniques 13:412-421), or on beads (Lam, 1991, Nature 354:82-84), chips (Fodor,
1993, Nature 364:555-556), bacteria and/or spores, (Ladner, USP 5,223,409), plasmids
(Cull et al, 1992, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:1865-1869) or on phage (Scott and Smith,
1990, Science 249:386-390; Devlin, 1990, Science 249:404-406; Cwirla et al, 1990,

EXAMPLE     1. DETERMINATION OF FRa LEVELS IN URINE SAMPLES FROM HUMAN
SUBJECTS WITH AND WITHOUT OVARIAN CANCER AS MEASURED BY
ELECTROCHEMILUMINESCENCE IMMUNOASSAY              (ECLIA).
Materials and Methods
        Urine samples were obtained from human subjects, including subjects afflicted
with ovarian cancer and normal control subjects not afflicted with ovarian cancer. The
levels of FRa in urine samples were determined using an electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay (ECLIA) according to the following procedure (see Namba et al. (1999)
Analytical Science 15:1087-1093):
i. Antibody coating to micro beads
        The monoclonal anti-folate receptor alpha antibody was coated over the surface
of micro beads (Dynabeads M-450 Epoxy, Dynal). Thirty six milligrams of micro beads
were mixed with 1.2 mL of antibody MOV18 (0.36 mg/mL, Enzo Life Science) in 0.15
mol/L phosphate buffer saline pH 7.8 (PBS), followed by gentle mixing for 16 hours at
room temperature. The micro beads were then washed 5 times with 50 mM HEPES
buffer containing 0.1% normal rabbit serum (NRS), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20
pH 7.5 (wash buffer). Thereafter, the coated micro beads were suspended in 1.2 mL 50
mM HEPES buffer containing 20% NRS, 150 mmol/L NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20 pH
7.5 (reaction buffer) to block the unbound surface, followed by gentle mixing for 3.5
hours at room temperature. Finally, the micro beads were washed 5 times with wash
buffer and re-suspended with 1.2 mL 50 mM HEPES buffer containing 10% NRS, 150
mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L EDTA-2Na and 0.01% Tween 20 pH 7.5 (reaction buffer) so
that the concentration of micro beads was 30 mg/mL. The micro beads were stored at
4'C until use.
ii. Antibody labeling with Ruthenium-chelate-NHS (Ru)
        One milliliter of MORAB-003 (1 mg/mL) in PBS was mixed with 14 PL of Ru
(10 mg/mL), initial molar ratio of antibody to Ru was 1:20, followed by shaking for 30
minutes at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 pL
                                          90

of 2 mol/L glycine solution followed by incubation for 20 minutes. The labeled antibody
was purified by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 (GE Healthcare) eluted with PBS.
The first eluted yellow fraction was collected and the concentration of antibody and Ru
were determined by means of the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) and
absorption at 455 nm respectively. The final molar ratio was calculated by the formula:
Final molar ratio = [(absorption at 455)/13700]/[Ab(mg/mL/150000)]. The labeled
antibody was stored at 4'C until use.
iii. One Step Immunoassay
        The antibody coated micro beads were set on the reagent table of the Picolumi
8220 (Sanko, Tokyo, Japan) after adjusting the concentration of the beads to 1.5 mg/ml
(working solution) in reaction buffer. The Ru labeled antibody was set on the reagent
table of the Picolumi 8220 after adjusting the concentration of antibody to 2 Pg/ml
(working solution) in reaction buffer.
        Ten microliters of urine (diluted 1:51 in reaction buffer) or standard FRa
(prepared in reaction buffer) and 100 pL of reaction buffer were dispensed into a
reaction tube (Sanko, Tokyo, Japan) and set on Picolumi 8220.
        The following steps were automatically run by Picolumi 8220. Twenty five
microliters of beads (working solution) and 180 pL of Ru labeled antibody (working
solution) were dispensed. After 26 minutes of incubation at 30 +/-2'C, the beads were
washed and suspended with 300 pL of electrolyte solution (Sanko, Tokyo, Japan). The
washed beads were subsequently transferred to the electrode and
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission was measured.
        All ECL measurements were carried out in duplicate.

Discussion
         A high level of FRa was detected in the urine of subjects with ovarian cancer.
Moreover, the levels of FRa differed significantly between ovarian cancer and normal
female control groups (p=0.03, one-sided).
EXAMPLE     2. DILUTION LINEARITY - DETERMINATION OF FRax LEVELS IN SERIALLY
DILUTED URINE SAMPLES MEASURED BY ELECTROCHEMILUMINESCENCE
IMMUNOASSAY       (ECLIA)
         Dilution Linearity is a measure of accuracy of an assay. Two urine samples were
serially diluted by a factor of 10 and 100. The FRa levels of each sample were
measured as set forth in Example 1 and compared to assess the percent error. Percent
error was calculated as follows:
      [[(FRa in diluted sample)*(dilution factor)] - (FRax in undiluted sample)] *100
                                  (FRa in undiluted sample)
The results are set forth in Table 3:

The foregoing results demonstrate dilution linearity in assessing the levels of FRa in
human urine samples and that, within acceptable errors, urine can be diluted up to a
                                           93

factor of at least 100 while retaining accurate levels of FRu. Accordingly, dilution of the
urine samples may be considered prior to determining levels of FRc.
EXAMPLE     3: CENTRIFUGATION OF URINE SAMPLES - ADDRESSING REPRODUCIBILITY
        The reproducibility of the ECLIA assay for a particular urine sample was also
tested. For example, as reflected in Table 4, ECLIA assays of the same sample resulted
in varying results.
                 Table 4. Reproducibility without sample centrifugation

        The presence of insoluble material (precipitates) in urine samples was
hypothesized to be responsible for the variability seen in measuring the levels of FRu.
As a result, centrifugation of samples in order to remove urine sediment, prior to
measurement of FRu levels, was considered as an option to enhance the accuracy and
reproducibility of the assay.
        Table 5 depicts the results obtained when three samples were centrifuged prior to
performance of the ECLIA assay.

As set forth above, the results indicate that centrifugation provided more consistent
measurements of FRu concentration.
        Additionally, two samples were subjected to (i) centrifugation (at 2000 x g for 2
min) and the supernatant removed for measurement of FRu (depicted as sample "A"
below in Table 6) and (ii) centrifugation followed by vortexing (depicted as sample "B"
below in Table 6), prior to measurement of FRu levels by the ECLIA assay set forth in
Example 1. The results are reflected in Table 6 below.

        As shown in Table 6, the levels of FRu as determined by the ECLIA assay vary
depending on whether urine was clarified by centrifugation to remove precipitates or
whether urine was vortexed to suspend or disperse sediments. Accordingly, in certain
embodiments centrifuging or vortexing of urine samples may be performed prior to
determining levels of FRu.

        Based on the results of Example 3, the assay for assessing FRa levels in subjects
was modified to introduce a centrifugation step. FRa levels were determined on the
same samples utilized in Example 1, including the group of subjects with ovarian cancer
and the group of normal female control subjects.
Materials and Methods
        The methodology utilized was as described in Example 1, except that the urine
samples were centrifuged for 10000 x g for 1 minute and the resulting supernatant
subsequently diluted by 1:51 in reaction buffer.

        According to the results set forth in Table 7, centrifugation resulted in a decrease
in the measurement of FRa levels in some samples, as previously demonstrated in Table

EXAMPLE    5: DETECTION OF FRa IN URINE SEDIMENT BY IMMUNOBLOTTING
        Based on the results shown in Examples 3 and 4, the presence or absence of FRa
in urine sediment/precipitate was assessed using western blotting.
Materials and Methods
        Urine samples from 2 ovarian cancer patients for whom FRa concentrations
were measured at 18,747 pg/mL and 145,564 pg/mL, respectively (See Table 10 supra),
were subjected to the following procedures. Control samples consisted of HeLa cell
lysate 10 pg, liver tissue lysate 20 pg, and ovarian cancer tissue lysate 20 pg.
     e  900 pL urine was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 100OOg
     e  supernatant was removed
     e  the remaining pellet was dissolved in 15 pL of PAGE sample buffer (containing
        292 mM LDS) and subsequently boiled at 70'C for 10 min
     e  The entire sample (approx. 20 pL) was loaded onto the NuPAGE bis-tris gel
        (Invitrogen)

Results
        The resulting immunoblot is shown in Figure 3. In this figure, lanes 1-5
correspond to FRu detected from the following sources:
(1) urine from ovarian cancer patient with a measured FRu level of 18,747 pg/mL
(2) urine from ovarian cancer patient with a measured FRu level of 145,564 pg/mL
(3) HeLa cell lysate: 10 kg
(4) Liver tissue lysate: 20 kg
(5) ovarian cancer tissue lysate: 20 kg
        Lane 6 in the western blot represents molecular weight markers and demonstrates
that the observed band in lanes 1, 2, 3 and 5 runs at the expected molecular weight for
FRx.
        Lanes 3 and 5 are positive control samples and lane 4 is a negative control
sample. The faint band on lane 1 and the clear band on lane 2 demonstrate that FRu can
be detected in the urine sediment of ovarian cancer patients by western blotting.
EXAMPLE     6. DETERMINATION OF FRa LEVELS IN GUANIDINE-TREATED NORMAL
HUMAN URINE SAMPLES BY ELECTROCHEMILUMINESCENCE IMMUNOASSAY                     (ECLIA).
        Based on the results of Example 4 in which centrifugation resulted in decreased
FRu levels, and the results of Example 5 where the urine sediment obtained from
centrifugation was shown to contain immunoreactive FRu, methods were sought to
                                           98

solubilize the sediments of urine to obtain more quantitative and accurate measurements
of FRca.
        In this regard, treatment of normal female urine samples with guanidine prior to
assessing FRu levels was attempted.
        The methodology utilized was as described in Example 1, except that the urine
samples were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with either 6 M guanidine in buffer (PBS) or buffer
alone. Subsequently, the urine samples were diluted by 1:51 in reaction buffer.
        The results of this assay are shown in Table 8.

The results of this experiment indicate that guanidine does not interfere with FRu
measurements. As can be seen for the pure antigen control (Std Ag), this methodology
of guanidine treatment and subsequent dilution has no effect on the measurement of
FRu. Further, it will be noted that in all three (3) urine samples assessed, the levels of
FRu were higher in the samples treated (solubilized) with guanidine relative to the
samples not treated with guanidine.
        The reliability of guanidine pre-treatment of urine samples was further assessed
by exposing three samples to guanidine and measuring the FRu concentration of each
guanidine treated sample 3 times using the ECLIA assay. The results are reflected in
Table 9 below:

As set forth above, the results indicate that guanidine treatment of urine prior to FRa
assay provided consistent measurements of FRa concentration with very low CV's.

analysis was performed. Figure 5 shows an ROC curve of the sensitivity and specificity
of the ECLIA measurement of FRa levels in urine after the urine was treated with
guanidine. AUC is the area under the curve, which measures the accuracy of the test in
separating ovarian cancer from control subjects.
        Using an arbitrary cutoff value of 9100 pg FRc/mL, the AUC was 0.70 with a
positive predictive value of 70% and a negative predictive value of 80%, as shown in
Table 12. Using this cutoff value, 15/19 ovarian cancer patients had a concentration of
FRa above 9100 pg/mL and 8/10 normal subjects had a concentration of FRa less than
9100 pg/mL.

IMMUNOASSAY      (ECLIA)
        Concentrations of FRa were previously determined using ECLIA of guanidine
treated urine samples from ovarian cancer patients and normal female controls (See
Example 7, Table 10). Here, these FRa concentrations were corrected for urine
creatinine levels in order to normalize for the glomerular filtration rate. The resulting
values were subjected to an ROC analysis.
Methods
        The urine creatinine level was determined by the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare approved test kit, determiner L CRE (Kyowa Medex, Japan). The corrected
value for urine FRa concentration was calculated as follows:
                                          102

Urine FRa Creatinine correction (ng/g)

EXAMPLE      9: ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY (EIA) AND OPTIMIZATION THEREOF
1. Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)
Antibody coating to microtiter plates
         The monoclonal anti-folate receptor alpha antibody was coated on the surface of
microtiter plates (Nunc-immunoplate, Thermo Scientific) as follows. One hundred
microliter of antibody (absorbance 0.02 at 280 nm) in 50 mmol/L carbonate buffer pH
9.4 was dispensed into wells, followed by coating for 16 hours at 4'C. The microplates
were then washed 2 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 (PBS-T). Thereafter
0.15 mL of PBS containing 20% normal rabbit serum pH 7.8 was dispensed into wells to
block the unbounded surface, followed by blocking for 1 hour at room temperature.
Finally, the microplates were washed 2 times with PBS-T. The antibody coated plates
were dried and kept at 4'C in aluminum bags until use.
Biotin labeling
         Biotin labeling was conducted according to the manufacturers recommendations
for the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Product No. 21338, Thermo Scientific).
Briefly, 1 mg of antibody in 0.4 mL of PBS was mixed with 0.013 mL of 10 mM Sulfo
NHS-LC-LC-Biotin, with an initial molar ratio of antibody to biotin of 1:20, followed by
incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The biotin coupled antibody was purified by
gel filtration using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) eluted with PBS to remove non
reacted biotin. In order to determine the level of biotin incorporation, the EZ Biotin
quantitation kit (Product No. 28005, Thermo Scientific) was used. The biotin labeled
antibody was stored at -80'C until use.
Two step immunoassay
         For the first reaction, 40 pL of plasma or standard antigen and 60 PL of 50 mM
HEPES buffer containing 10% NRS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L EDTA-2Na, 0.01%
Tween 20 pH 7.5 (reaction buffer) was dispensed into antibody coated wells. The plate
                                            105

was incubated for 18 hours at 4'C, and subsequently washed 5 times with PBS-T. For
the second reaction, 100 p L of 10 p g/mL biotin labeled antibody in reaction buffer was
dispensed. The plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and subsequently
washed 5 times with PBS-T. 100 pL of horse radish peroxidase labeled streptavidin
(Pierce) was dispensed. After 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the plates
were washed 5 times with PBS-T. Finally, for the color development, 100 PL of TMB
solution (KPL) was dispensed and left for 15 minutes in dark. After stopping color
development by adding 100 pL of IN HCl, the absorption at 450 nm was read using a
plate reader. All washing steps were automatically done by auto-plate washer (AMW-8,
BioTec, Japan), and all EIA measurements were carried out in duplicate.
        Figure 8 depicts the EIA assay using MOV18 as the capture antibody and
biotinylated MORAb-003 as the detector antibody.
2. Optimization of EIA procedures
        The above EIA procedures were arrived at in part based on the following
experiments designed to optimize the procedure.
        First, avidin-HRP, biotin labeled antibody and HRP labeled antibody were
compared. Compared with HRP labeled antibody, biotin labeled antibody and avidin
HRP provided a higher signal; therefore, biotin labeled antibody and avidin-HRP were
employed.
        Second, one and two-step incubation procedures were compared. As depicted in
Figure 9, a two-step incubation procedure yielded a higher signal and was thus
employed.
        Third, to optimize the second incubation time, incubation times of one to four
hours were compared. The results indicated that one hour incubation times provided the
highest signal to noise ratio and therefore an incubation time of one hour was
subsequently employed.
        Fourth, in order to optimize the working concentration of biotin labeled antibody,
HRP labeled antibody and sample volume, various concentrations were employed as set
forth in the above description of the EIA assay. The optimal values concentrations are
described above.

cancer patients and healthy female controls using the electrochemiluminescence assay
(ECLIA) described in Example 1 and Figure 1 (using MORAb-003 as the capture
antibody and ruthenium (Ru)-labeled MOV-18 as the labeled detector antibody) and the
enzyme immunoassay (EIA) described in Example 9 and Figure 8. In both assays, 40 PL
of plasma was assayed.

        With only one exception, the results for all of the subjects indicated that the
concentrations of FRa detected in serum using EIA are lower than the levels detected
using ECLIA, demonstrating that the EIA assay, as formatted, is not as sensitive as the
ECLIA assay when this particular combination of capture (MOV-18) and detector
                                         107

antibodies (MORAb-003) is used. Therefore, further experiments with other types of
antibodies were conducted to develop a more sensitive EIA procedure.

        The levels of FRa in plasma from ovarian cancer patients and normal healthy
female controls were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA)
with different combinations of capture and biotin-labeled antibodies and compared with
the levels of FRa measured using the ECLIA assay.
Materialsand Methods
        The ECLIA method was as described in Example 1 and depicted in Figure 1
(using the MORAb-003 antibody as the capture antibody and the Mov-18 antibody as
                                         108

the labeled detector antibody). The EIA method was as described in Example 9, except
that three different combinations of capture/detector antibodies were employed, as
depicted in Figure 10: MOV18/MORAb-003, 548908/MORAb-003 and
6D398/MORAb-003. The antibodies 548908 and 6D398 are commercially available.
The 548908 antibody was obtained from R&D Systems (North Las Vegas, NV) and the
6D398 antibody was obtained from US Biological (Swampscott, MA 01907).

          The data in Table 18 indicate that the measurements of FRa levels with EIA
using the 54908-MORAb-003 combination yields results that are most similar to the
                                            109

results obtained using the ECLIA assay. Quantitive analyses were performed,
confirming this observation. Further, these data demonstrate that the detection of FRa is
highly dependent on the antibodies and antibody combination employed. Accordingly,
different antibody combinations can be employed for the determination of FRa in
biological fluids. In addition, since the data obtained from the EIA and the ECLIA assay
formats are similar, various assay formats can be used for the determination of FRa.
        For each of the three combinations of capture and detector antibodies used for
the EIA method, a regression analysis was performed, and the concentrations of FRa
(pg/mL) determined with EIA were correlated with the concentrations determined with
the ECLIA assay. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 19 and in Figure 12.

EXAMPLE     12: PLASMA LEVELS OF FRa DETERMINED BY EIA AND ECLIA IN
SAMPLES FROM OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS
        Measurements of serum FRa levels were determined in a group of ovarian
cancer patients (n=17) and normal controls (n=35) using ECLIA and EIA. For the EIA
measurements, the 548908 capture/ MORAb-003 detector antibody combination was
employed. The EIA procedure was otherwise as described in Example 9. The ECLIA
procedure was as described in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 20.

        Figure 15 shows correlations between ECLIA measures of FRa levels in
matched serum and urine samples taken from the same patient. The correlation for lung
cancer patients was r-0.24 (upper panel) and the correlation for ovarian cancer patients
was r--0.76 (lower panel).
        These data demonstrate the relative lack of correlation between FRa
concentrations measured in urine versus serum, especially as shown for lung cancer
patients. Further, these data demonstrate that FRa is basically non-detectable above

background levels in the serum of lung cancer patients versus normal controls whereas
FRa is detectable in the urine of these patients.
EXAMPLE     14. ASSESSMENT OF LEVELS OF FRa IN SERUM SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS
WITH OVARIAN CANCER, PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER, AND NORMAL CONTROLS
        FRa levels in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer, patients with lung
cancer, and normal controls were assessed. Serum FRa levels were assessed using
ECLIA with two different pairs of capture-detector antibodies: Pair 1, in which 9F3 was
the capture antibody and 24F12 was the detector antibody, and Pair 2, in which 26B3
was the capture antibody and 19D4 was the detector antibody.
        The FRa pairs were tested with full calibrator curves and 196 individual serums
diluted 1:4. In one experiment, 26B3 was used as the capture antibody after CR
processing on a plate lot (75 [tg/mL, +B, +T) and 19D4 was used as the detector
antibody at 1.0[tg/mL. In another experiment, 9F3 was used as the capture antibody and
24F12 was used as the detector antibody at 1.0[tg/mL. Each were CR processed (lot
10070) with an label to protein ratio (L/P) of 13.3. Diluent 100 (Meso Scale Discovery,
Gaithersburg, Maryland) + human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) +mIgG was used for
samples and calibrator. Diluent 3 (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Maryland) was
used for detections.
        The following protocol was employed for the ECLIA. Samples were added at
50ptL/well. The samples were shaken for 2 hours and subsequently washed with
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution with the detergent Tween 20 (PBST). The
detector antibody was added at 25[tL/well. The samples were shaken for 2 hours and
then were washed with PBST. Finally, the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission
of the samples was read with 2X MSD@ Buffer T.
        The results are shown in Table 25 below.

           Based on the foregoing data, it was apparent that the 9F3, 2412, 26B3 and
   19D4 antibodies were useful in detecting levels of FRa in biological samples, for
   example serum, derived from a subject. Moreover, the particular combinations of (i)
 5 9F3 as a capture antibody and 24F12 as a detector antibody and (ii) 26B3 as a capture
   antibody and 19D4 as a detector antibody were capable and particularly effective of
   assessing levels of FRa in biological samples.
   EXAMPLE    15. ASSESSMENT OF LEVELS OF FRa IN URINE USING THREE DIFFERENT
10 DETECTOR AND CAPTURE ANTIBODY PAIRS
           The ability of three anti-FRa antibody pairs in detecting the levels of FRa in
   urine samples was assessed. The antibody pairs utilized were as follows: (1) 26B3 as
   detector antibody and 9F3 as capture antibody, and (2) 24F12 as detector antibody
15 and 9F3 as capture antibody.
   Method
           Two antibody pairs were tested with full calibrator curves and urine pretreated
   with a 1:1 dilution for 2 minutes in either 6M guanidine, 3M guanidine or PBS
20 control. The following urine samples were tested: three human urine pools diluted
   1:80, and five human individual urines diluted 1:80 (one male, four female).
           Plates were Biodotted at 150ptg/mL, +B, +T, on 4spot STD ((Meso Scale
   Discovery, Gaithersburg, Maryland)), one capture per well. Detects were run at 1
   [tg/mL. Diluent 100 + HAMA + mlgG was used for samples and calibrator. Diluent
25 3 was used for detections. Diluents were commercially available diluents obtained
   from Meso Scale Discovery.
           The following protocol was employed for the ECLIA. Samples were added at
   50pL/well. The samples were shaken for 2 hours. The samples were washed with
   Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution with the detergent Tween 20 (PBST). The
30 detector antibody was added at 25[tL/well. The samples were shaken for 2 hours and
   subsequently washed with PBST. The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission of
   the samples was read with 2X MSD Buffer T.
           The results of these experiments are shown in Tables 26-27.

        Based on the foregoing data, it was apparent that the 9F3, 24F12, 26B3 and
19D4 antibodies were useful in detecting levels of FRa in biological samples derived
from a subject. Moreover, the combinations of (1) 26B3 as detector antibody and 9F3
as capture antibody and (2) 24F12 as detector antibody and 9F3 as capture antibody
were capable and particularly effective of assessing levels of FRa in biological
samples.
        A second set of experiments, following the protocol described above and using
the same two pairs of antibodies, were conducted utilizing four female human
individual urines diluted 1:80. The urine was pretreated with a 1:1 dilution for 2
minutes in either 3M guanidine or PBS control. The results are shown in Tables 28
29.

           The results of this second set of experiments further confirm the results of the
  first set of experiments and demonstrate that the level of FRa which is not bound to a
  cell can be reliably assessed, for example, in urine, using assays such as the ECLIA
5 assay and using the 26B3, 9F3, 24F12 antibodies. Further, the results demonstrate
  that such assays can effectively detect FRa using pairs of detector and capture
  antibodies that bind FRa (such as, e.g., 26B3 as detector antibody and 9F3 as capture
  antibody, and 24F12 as detector antibody and 9F3 as capture antibody).

EXAMPLE    16. ASSESSMENT OF LEVELS OF FRa IN SERUM AND PLASMA
        The levels of FRa were assessed in samples of serum and plasma on two
separate days. The subjects from whom the samples were derived were either normal
subjects or patients with ovarian or lung cancer.
        The protocol for assessing FRa levels was the same as set forth in Example 14
above. The pairs of antibodies used for assessing FRa levels were also the same as in
Example 14, i.e., Pair 1, in which 9F3 was the capture antibody and 24F12 was the
detector antibody, and Pair 2, in which 26B3 was the capture antibody and 19D4 was
the detector antibody.
        The results are provided in Table 30.

        Based on the foregoing data, it was apparent that the 9F3, 2412, 26B3 and
19D4 antibodies were useful in detecting levels of FRa in biological samples, for
example, serum or plasma, derived from a subject. Moreover, the particular
combinations of (i) 9F3 as a capture antibody and 24F12 as a detector antibody and
(ii) 26B3 as a capture antibody and 19D4 as a detector antibody were capable and
particularly effective in assessing levels of FRa in biological samples.
        For assays conducted using both Pair 1 and Pair 2, there was a high correlation
between serum and plasma FRa levels . Figure 16 shows the correlation in serum
versus plasma FRa levels for assays conducted using Pair 1 (see Example 16). The
R 2 value was 0.8604. Figure 17 shows the correlation in serum versus plasma FRa
levels for assays conducted using Pair 2 (see Example 16). The R 2 value was 0.9766.
        For both serum and plasma samples, there was a high correlation between FRa
levels measured using Pair 1 and Pair 2. Figure 18 shows the correlation in serum
FRa levels for assays conducted using Pair 1 versus Pair 2 (see Example 16). The R 2
value was 0.9028. Figure 19 shows the correlation in plasma FRa levels for assays
conducted using pair 1 versus pair 2 (see Example 16). The R 2 value was 0.8773.
        The results also showed that there was a high correlation between FRa levels
measured on different days. Figure 20 shows the interday correlation in serum FRa
levels for assays conducted using pair 2. The R 2 value was 0.9839.
