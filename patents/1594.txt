                                            ABSTRACT
The present invention provides, among other things, improved methods for purifying 12S protein
produced recombinantly for enzyme replacement therapy. The present invention is, in part, based on
the surprising discovery that recombinant 12S protein can be purified from unprocessed biological
materials, such as, 12S-containing cell culture medium, using a process involving as few as four
chromatography columns.

                                        BACKGROUND
 [0003]         Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome) is an X
chromosome-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in the
enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (12S). 12S cleaves the terminal 2-0-sulfate moieties from the
glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Due to the missing or
defective 12S enzyme in patients with Hunter syndrome, GAG progressively accumulate in
the lysosomes of a variety of cell types, leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly,
tissue destruction, and organ system dysfunction.
 [0004]         Generally, physical manifestations for people with Hunter syndrome include
both somatic and neuronal symptoms. For example, in some cases of Hunter syndrome,
central nervous system involvement leads to developmental delays and nervous system
problems. While the non-neuronal symptoms of Hunter Syndrome are generally absent at
birth, over time the progressive accumulation of GAG in the cells of the body can have a
dramatic impact on the peripheral tissues of the body. GAG accumulation in the peripheral
tissue leads to a distinctive coarseness in the facial features of a patient and is responsible for
the prominent forehead, flattened bridge and enlarged tongue, the defining hallmarks of a
Hunter patient. Similarly, the accumulation of GAG can adversely affect the organ systems

                                                2
of the body. Manifesting initially as a thickening of the wall of the heart, lungs and airways,
and abnormal enlargement of the liver, spleen and kidneys, these profound changes can
ultimately lead to widespread catastrophic organ failure. As a result, Hunter syndrome is
always severe, progressive, and life-limiting.
 [0005]          Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an approved therapy for treating Hunter
syndrome (MPS II), which involves administering exogenous replacement 12S enzyme to
patients with Hunter syndrome.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0006]          The present invention provides, among other things, improved methods for
purifying 12S protein produced recombinantly for enzyme replacement therapy. The present
invention is, in part, based on the surprising discovery that recombinant 12S protein can be
purified from unprocessed biological materials, such as, 12S-containing cell culture medium,
using a process involving as few as four chromatography columns. Approved existing
purification process of recombinant 12S for enzyme replacement therapy involves 6
chromatography columns. As described in the Examples section, recombinant 12S proteins
purified using a four-column process according to the invention conforms with the marketing
purity requirements in the US and many other countries. In addition, the recombinant 12S
enzyme purified according to the present invention retains high percentage of C
formylglycine (FGly) (e.g., higher than 70% and up to 100%), which is important for the
activity of 12S enzyme, and distinct characteristics such as sialic acid content and glycan map
that may facilitate bioavailability and/or lysosomal targeting of the recombinant 12S protein.
Therefore, the present invention provides an effective, cheaper, and faster process for
purifying recombinant 12S protein. The present invention is particularly useful for purifying
recombinant 12S protein produced in serum-free medium.
 [0007]          Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of purifying
recombinant 12S protein from an impure preparation using a process based on one or more of
anion-exchange chromatography, cation-exchange chromatography, mixed-mode
chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. In some embodiments, an
inventive method according to the present invention involves less than 6 (e.g., less than 5,
less than 4, or less than 3) chromatography steps. In some embodiments, an inventive

WO 2014/005014                                                                PCT/US2013/048561
                                                3
method according to the present invention involves 2, 3, 4 or 5 chromatography steps. In
some embodiments, an inventive method according to the present invention involves 4
chromatography steps. In some embodiments, the purified recombinant 12S protein
according to the present invention contains less than 100 ng/mg Host Cell Protein (HCP)
(e.g., less than 90 ng/mg HCP, less than 80 ng/mg HCP, less than 70 ng/mg HCP, less than
60 ng/mg HCP, less than 50 ng/mg HCP, less than 40 ng/mg HCP, less than 30 ng/mg HCP,
less than 20 ng/mg HCP, less than 10 ng/mg HCP).
[0008]           In some embodiments, a suitable anion-exchange chromatography is       Q
chromatography. In some embodiments, a suitable cation-exchange chromatography is SP
chromatography. In some embodiments, a suitable mixed-mode chromatography is
hydroxyapatite (HA) chromatography. In some embodiments, a suitable hydrophobic
interaction chromatography is phenyl chromatography.
[0009]           It is contemplated that anion-exchange chromatography (e.g., 0 column),
cation-exchange chromatography (e.g., SP column), mixed-mode chromatography (e.g., HA
column), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (e.g., phenyl column) can be carried
out in any order. In some embodiments, a method according to the present invention carries
out anion-exchange chromatography (e.g., 0 column), cation-exchange chromatography
(e.g., SP column), mixed-mode chromatography (e.g., HA column), and hydrophobic
interaction chromatography (e.g., phenyl column) in that order.
[0010]           In some embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or
flow-through is adjusted to pH of about 5.0-7.0 (e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 or 7.0) and the
conductivity of about 10-20 mS/cm (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 mS/cm)
prior to loading to the anion-exchange chromatography column (e.g.,     Q column).    In some
embodiments, the pH is adjusted using IM sodium acetate. In some embodiments, the
conductivity is adjusted using 5 M sodium chloride. In some embodiments, the anion
exchange chromatography column, once loaded, is washed using a wash buffer comprising
salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 140 mM to 200 mM (e.g., about 140 mM,
145 mM, 150 mM, 155 mM, 160 mM, 165 mM, 170 mM, 175 mM, 180 mM, 185 mM, 190
mM, 195 mM, or 200 mM) with pH of about 5.0-7.0 (e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 or 7.0). In
some embodiments, the anion-exchange chromatography column is eluted using a elution
buffer comprising a linear salt (e.g., NaCl) gradient. In some embodiments, a suitable linear
NaCl gradient contains a range from about 0-500 mM NaCl (e.g., about 0-400 mM, about 0-

350 mM, about 0-300 mM, about 50-500 mM, about 150-500 mM, about 150-450 mM, about
 150-400 mM).
 [0011]          In some embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or
flow-through is adjusted to conductivity ranging between about 1 mS/cm and 20 mS/cm (e.g.,
between about 1 mS/cm and 15 mS/cm, between about 1 mS/cm and 10 mS/cm, between
about 1 mS/cm and 8 mS/cm, between about 1 mS/cm and 6 mS/cm, between about 1 mS/cm
and 4 mS/cm, between about 2 mS/cm and 4 mS/cm) prior to loading to the cation-exchange
chromatography column (e.g., SP column). In some embodiments, an impure preparation or
an intermediate eluate or flow-through is adjusted to conductivity ranging between n about 2
mS/cm and 4 mS/cm (e.g., 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, or 4 mS/cm) prior to loading to the cation-exchange
chromatography column (e.g., SP column). In some embodiments, the conductivity is
adjusted by diluting the eluate from the anion-exchange chromatography column with H 2 0 at
about 1-2:1 (e.g.,. 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, or 2:1) ratio.
In some embodiments, the conductivity is adjusted by dialfiltration. In some embodiments,
the cation-exchange chromatography column is run at a pH of about 5.0-6.5 (e.g., about 5.0,
5.5, 6.0 or 6.5). In some embodiments, the cation-exchange chromatography column is run
with a buffer comprising phosphate (e.g., NaPO4) concentration ranging from about 0.01 M
to about 0.1 M (e.g., about 0.01 M, 0.02 M, 0.03 M, 0.04 M, 0.05 M, 0.06 M, 0.07 M, 0.08
M, 0.09 M, or 0.1 M). In some embodiments, a suitable pH is about 5.0-6.5 (e.g., about 5.0,
5.5, 6.0, or 6.5).
 [0012]          In some embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or
flow-through is adjusted to phosphate (e.g., NaPO4) concentration ranging from about 0.001
M to about 0.01 M (e.g., about 0.001 M, 0.002 M, 0.003 M, 0.004 M, 0.005 M, 0.006 M,
0.007 M, 0.008 M, 0.009 M, or 0.01 M) and pH of about 5.0-6.5 (e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, or
6.5) prior to loading the mixed-mode chromatography column (e.g., HA column). In some
embodiments, the mixed-mode chromatography column (e.g., HA column), once loaded, is
washed with a wash buffer containing phosphate (e.g., 1-10 mM sodium or potassium
phosphate) at or near neutral pH. In some embodiments, the loaded mixed-mode
chromatography column (e.g., HA column) is washed with a wash buffer having a phosphate
concentration ranging from about 10-20 mM (e.g., about 10-18 mM, 10-16 mM, 10-15 mM,
 12-20 mM, 14-18 mM, 14-16 mM). In some embodiments, the loaded mixed-mode
chromatography column (e.g., HA column) is washed with a wash buffer having a phosphate

concentration of or greater than 10 mM, 11 mM, 12 mM, 13 mM, 14 mM, 15 mM, 16 mM,
17 mM, 18 mM, 19 mM, 20 mM. In some embodiments, elution from a mixed-mode
chromatography column (e.g., HA column) is achieved with a gradient phosphate buffer. In
some embodiments, a suitable elution buffer may have a phosphate gradient of approximately
1-400 mM (e.g., 1-300 mM, 1-200 mM, 1-150 mM, 1-100 mM, 10-350 mM, 10-300 mM, 10
250 mM, 10-200 mM, 10-150 mM, 10-140 mM, 10-130 mM, 10-120 mM, 10-110 mM, 10
100 mM, 10-90 mM, 10-80 mM, 10-70 mM, 10-60 mM, 10-50 mM) sodium phosphate or
potassium phosphate. In some embodiments, elution from an HA column is achieved by
stepwise increasing the phosphate concentration in the elution buffer. In some embodiments,
stepwise elution buffers may have a phosphate (e.g., sodium phosphate) concentration
selected from 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM, 40 mM, 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM,

mM, 400 mM. In some embodiments, elution from a mixed-mode chromatography column
(e.g., HA column) is achieved by an elution buffer having a phosphate (e.g., sodium
phosphate) concentration ranging from about 50 mM to 150 mM (e.g., selected from the
phosphate (e.g., sodium phosphate) concentration of 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90
mM, 100 mM, 110 mM, 120 mM, 130 mM, 140 mM, 150 mM, and combination thereof).

flow-through is adjusted to salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 0.5 M to about
2.0 M (e.g., about 0.5 M, 1.0 M, 1.1 M, 1.2 M, 1.3 M, 1.4 M, 1.5 M, 1.6 M, 1.7 M, 1.8 M, 1.9
M, or 2.0 M NaCl) at pH of about 4.5-6.0 (e.g., about 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0) prior to loading
onto the hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (e.g., phenyl column). In some
embodiments, the hydrophobic interaction chromatography column, once loaded, is washed
using a wash buffer comprising salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 0.5 M to
2.0 M (e.g., about 0.5 M, 1.0 M, 1.1 M, 1.2 M, 1.3 M, 1.4 M, 1.5 M, 1.6 M, 1.7 M, 1.8 M, 1.9
M, or 2.0 M NaCl) at pH of about 4.5-6.0 (e.g., about 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0). In some
embodiments, the hydrophobic interaction chromatography column is eluted using a elution
buffer comprising salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 0.1 M to about 0.5 M
(e.g., about 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.3 M, 0.4 M, or 0.5 M NaCl) at pH of about 4.5-6.0 (e.g., about
4.5, 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0).

includes a step of viral inactivation before loading the impure preparation onto the first
chromatography column. In some embodiments, the step of viral inactivation includes
adding a detergent to the impure preparation. In some embodiments, an inventive method
according to the invention further includes a step of viral removal after the last
Chromatography column. In some embodiments, a method of the invention further includes
a step of ultrafiltration and/or dialfiltration. In some embodiments, the step of ultrafiltration
and/or dialfiltration includes exchanging the purified recombinant 12S protein into a drug
formulation buffer.

                                          DEFINITIONS
 [0039]          In order for the present invention to be more readily understood, certain terms
are first defined below. Additional definitions for the following terms and other terms are set
forth throughout the specification.
 [0040]          Approximately or about: As used herein, the term "approximately" or
"about," as applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar to a
stated reference value. In certain embodiments, the term "approximately" or "about" refers
to a range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%,             12
                                                                                                  %,
                            6                  2
 110%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, %, 5%, 4%, 3%,           %, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or
less than) of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the
context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value).
 [0041]          Biologically active: As used herein, the phrase "biologically active" refers to
a characteristic of any substance that has activity in a biological system (e.g., cell culture,
organism, etc.). For instance, a substance that, when administered to an organism, has a
biological effect on that organism, is considered to be biologically active. Biological activity

 WO 2014/005014                                                                PCT/US2013/048561
                                                  10
can also be determined by in vitro assays (for example, in vitro enzymatic assays such as
sulfate release assays). In particular embodiments, where a protein or polypeptide is
biologically active, a portion of that protein or polypeptide that shares at least one biological
activity of the protein or polypeptide is typically referred to as a "biologically active" portion.
In some embodiments, a protein is produced and/or purified from a cell culture system, which
displays biologically activity when administered to a subject. In some embodiments, a
protein requires further processing in order to become biologically active. In some
embodiments, a protein requires posttranslational modification such as, but is not limited to,
glycosylation (e.g., sialyation), farnysylation, cleavage, folding, formylglycine conversion
and combinations thereof, in order to become biologically active. In some embodiments, a
protein produced as a proform (i.e. immature form), may require additional modification to
become biologically active.
 [0042]          Cation-independentmannose-6-phosphatereceptor (CI-MPR): As used
herein, the term "cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)" refers to a
cellular receptor that binds mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tags on acid hydrolase precursors in
the Golgi apparatus that are destined for transport to the lysosome. In addition to mannose-6
phosphates, the CI-MPR also binds other proteins including IGF-II. The CI-MPR is also
known as "M6P/IGF-II receptor," "CI-MPR/IGF-II receptor," "IGF-II receptor" or "IGF2
Receptor." These terms and abbreviations thereof are used interchangeably herein.
 [0043]          Chromatography: As used herein, the term "chromatography" refers to a
technique for separation of mixtures. Typically, the mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the
"mobile phase," which carries it through a structure holding another material called the
"stationary phase." Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the
stationary bed is within a tube, i.e., column.
 [0044]          Diluent: As used herein, the term "diluent" refers to a pharmaceutically
acceptable (e.g., safe and non-toxic for administration to a human) diluting substance useful
for the preparation of a reconstituted formulation. Exemplary diluents include sterile water,
bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered
saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution.

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561
                                                11
 [00451          Elution: As used herein, the term "elution" refers to the process of extracting
one material from another by washing with a solvent. For example, in ion-exchange
chromatography, elution is a process to wash loaded resins to remove captured ions.
 [0046]          Eluate: As used herein, the term "eluate" refers to a combination of mobile
phase "carrier" and the analyte material that emerge from the chromatography, typically as a
result of eluting.
 [0047]          Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT): As used herein, the term "enzyme
replacement therapy (ERT)" refers to any therapeutic strategy that corrects an enzyme
deficiency by providing the missing enzyme. Once administered, enzyme is taken up by cells
and transported to the lysosome, where the enzyme acts to eliminate material that has
accumulated in the lysosomes due to the enzyme deficiency. Typically, for lysosomal
enzyme replacement therapy to be effective, the therapeutic enzyme is delivered to lysosomes
in the appropriate cells in target tissues where the storage defect is manifest.
 [0048]          Equilibrateor Equilibration: As used herein, the terms "equilibrate" or
"equilibration" in relation to chromatography refer to the process of bringing a first liquid
(e.g., buffer) into balance with another, generally to achieve a stable and equal distribution of
components of the liquid (e.g., buffer). For example, in some embodiments, a
chromatographic column may be equilibrated by passing one or more column volumes of a
desired liquid (e.g., buffer) through the column.
 [0049]          Improve, increase,or reduce: As used herein, the terms "improve,"
"increase" or "reduce," or grammatical equivalents, indicate values that are relative to a
baseline measurement, such as a measurement in the same individual prior to initiation of the
treatment described herein, or a measurement in a control individual (or multiple control
individuals) in the absence of the treatment described herein. A "control individual" is an
individual afflicted with the same form of lysosomal storage disease as the individual being
treated, who is about the same age as the individual being treated (to ensure that the stages of
the disease in the treated individual and the control individual(s) are comparable).
 [0050]          Impurities: As used herein, the term "impurities" refers to substances inside a
confined amount of liquid, gas, or solid, which differ from the chemical composition of the
target material or compound. Impurities are also referred to as contaminants.

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561
                                                12
 [0051]         Linker: As used herein, the term "linker" refers to, in a fusion protein, an
amino acid sequence other than that appearing at a particular position in the natural protein
and is generally designed to be flexible or to interpose a structure, such as an a-helix, between
two protein moieties. A linker is also referred to as a spacer.
 [0052]         Load: As used herein, the term "load" refers to, in chromatography, adding a
sample-containing liquid or solid to a column. In some embodiments, particular components
of the sample loaded onto the column are then captured as the loaded sample passes through
the column. In some embodiments, particular components of the sample loaded onto the
column are not captured by, or "flow through", the column as the loaded sample passes
through the column.
 [0053]         Polypeptide: As used herein, a "polypeptide", generally speaking, is a string
of at least two amino acids attached to one another by a peptide bond. In some embodiments,
a polypeptide may include at least 3-5 amino acids, each of which is attached to others by
way of at least one peptide bond. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
polypeptides sometimes include "non-natural" amino acids or other entities that nonetheless
are capable of integrating into a polypeptide chain, optionally.
 [0054]         Pool: As used herein, the term "pool" in relation to chromatography refers to
combining one or more fractions of fluid that has passed through a column together. For
example, in some embodiments, one or more fractions which contain a desired component of
a sample that has been separated by chromatography (e.g., "peak fractions") can be "pooled"
together generate a single "pooled" fraction.
 [0055]         Replacement enzyme: As used herein, the term "replacement enzyme" refers
to any enzyme that can act to replace at least in part the deficient or missing enzyme in a
disease to be treated. In some embodiments, the term "replacement enzyme" refers to any
enzyme that can act to replace at least in part the deficient or missing lysosomal enzyme in a
lysosomal storage disease to be treated. In some embodiments, a replacement enzyme is
capable of reducing accumulated materials in mammalian lysosomes or that can rescue or
ameliorate one or more lysosomal storage disease symptoms. Replacement enzymes suitable
for the invention include both wild-type or modified lysosomal enzymes and can be produced
using recombinant and synthetic methods or purified from nature sources. A replacement
enzyme can be a recombinant, synthetic, gene-activated or natural enzyme.

 WO 2014/005014                                                                 PCT/US2013/048561
                                                  13
 [0056]          Soluble: As used herein, the term "soluble" refers to the ability of a
therapeutic agent to form a homogenous solution. In some embodiments, the solubility of the
therapeutic agent in the solution into which it is administered and by which it is transported to
the target site of action is sufficient to permit the delivery of a therapeutically effective
amount of the therapeutic agent to the targeted site of action. Several factors can impact the
solubility of the therapeutic agents. For example, relevant factors which may impact protein
solubility include ionic strength, amino acid sequence and the presence of other co
solubilizing agents or salts (e.g., calcium salts). In some embodiments, therapeutic agents in
accordance with the present invention are soluble in its corresponding pharmaceutical
composition.
 [0057]          Stability: As used herein, the term "stable" refers to the ability of the
therapeutic agent (e.g., a recombinant enzyme) to maintain its therapeutic efficacy (e.g., all or
the majority of its intended biological activity and/or physiochemical integrity) over extended
periods of time. The stability of a therapeutic agent, and the capability of the pharmaceutical
composition to maintain stability of such therapeutic agent, may be assessed over extended
periods of time (e.g., for at least 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months or more). In the context of
a formulation a stable formulation is one in which the therapeutic agent therein essentially
retains its physical and/or chemical integrity and biological activity upon storage and during
processes (such as freeze/thaw, mechanical mixing and lyophilization). For protein stability,
it can be measure by formation of high molecular weight (HMW) aggregates, loss of enzyme
activity, generation of peptide fragments and shift of charge profiles.
 [0058]          Viral Processing: As used herein, the term "viral processing" refers to "viral
removal," in which viruses are simply removed from the sample, or "viral inactivation," in
which the viruses remain in a sample but in a non-infective form. In some embodiments,
viral removal may utilize nanofiltration and/or chromatographic techniques, among others.
In some embodiments, viral inactivation may utilize solvent inactivation, detergent
inactivation, pasteurization, acidic pH inactivation, and/or ultraviolet inactivation, among
others.

[0059]          The present invention provides, among other things, an improved method for
purifying recombinant 12S protein for enzyme replacement therapy based on a process
involving less than 6 chromatography steps. In some embodiments, the present invention
provides a method of purifying recombinant 12S protein from an impure preparation using a
process based on one or more of anion-exchange chromatography, cation-exchange
chromatography, mixed-mode chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction
chromatography. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of
purifying recombinant 12S protein from an impure preparation by conducting Q
chromatography, hydroxyapatite (HA) chromatography, SP chromatography, and phenyl
chromatography. The present invention further provides purified recombinant 12S protein
and method of use.
[0060]          Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following
subsections. The use of subsections is not meant to limit the invention. Each subsection may
apply to any aspect of the invention. In this application, the use of "or" means "and/or"
unless stated otherwise.
Recombinant I2S Protein
[0061]          As used herein, an 12S protein is any protein or a portion of a protein that can
substitute for at least partial activity of naturally-occurring Iduronate-2-sulfatase (12S) protein
or rescue one or more phenotypes or symptoms associated with 12S-deficiency. As used
herein, the terms "an 12S enzyme" and "an 12S protein", and grammatical equivalents, are
used inter-changeably.
[0062]          Typically, the human 12S protein is produced as a precursor form. The
precursor form of human 12S contains a signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-25 of the full
length precursor), a pro-peptide (amino acid residues 26-33 of the full length precursor), and
a chain (residues 34-550 of the full length precursor) that may be further processed into the
42 kDa chain (residues 34-455 of the full length precursor) and the 14 kDa chain (residues
446-550 of the full length precursor). Typically, the precursor form is also referred to as full
length precursor or full-length 12S protein, which contains 550 amino acids. The amino acid
sequences of the mature form (SEQ ID NO: 1) having the signal peptide removed and full
length precursor (SEQ ID NO:2) of a typical wild-type or naturally-occurring human 12S

sequences of human 12S protein isoform a and b precursor are also provided in Table 1, SEQ
ID NO:3 and 4, respectively.

[0063]           Thus, in some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is mature human 12S
protein (SEQ ID NO: 1). As disclosed herein, SEQ ID NO: 1 represents the canonical amino
acid sequence for the human 12S protein. In some embodiments, the 12S protein may be a
splice isoform and/or variant of SEQ ID NO: 1, resulting from transcription at an alternative
start site within the 5' UTR of the 12S gene. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561
                                                16
may be a homologue or an analogue of mature human 12S protein. For example, a
homologue or an analogue of mature human 12S protein may be a modified mature human
12S protein containing one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as
compared to a wild-type or naturally-occurring 12S protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1), while
retaining substantial 12S protein activity. Thus, in some embodiments, a recombinant 12S
protein is substantially homologous to mature human 12S protein (SEQ ID NO: 1). In some
embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein has an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%,
60%, 6 5%, 7 0 % , 75%, 8 0%, 8 5%, 9 0%, 9 1%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%,      9 6 %, 97%, 98 %, 99%
or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is
substantially identical to mature human 12S protein (SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, a
recombinant 12S protein has an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%,
75%, 8 0%, 8 5%, 9 0%, 9 1%, 9 2 %, 93%, 94%, 95%,     96 %, 97%, 9 8 %, 99%   or more identical
to SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein contains a fragment or a
portion of mature human 12S protein.
 [0064]         Alternatively, a recombinant 12S protein is full-length 12S protein. In some
embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein may be a homologue or an analogue of full-length
human 12S protein. For example, a homologue or an analogue of full-length human 12S
protein may be a modified full-length human 12S protein containing one or more amino acid
substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared to a wild-type or naturally-occurring
full-length 12S protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), while retaining substantial 12S protein activity.
Thus, In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is substantially homologous to full
length human 12S protein (SEQ ID NO:2). For example, a recombinant 12S protein may have

some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:2.
For example, a recombinant 12S protein may have an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%,
60%, 6 5%, 70%, 75%, 8 0%, 8 5%, 9 0%, 9 1%, 9 2 %, 93%, 94%, 95%,       9 6 %, 97%, 98 %, 99%

contains a fragment or a portion of full-length human 12S protein. As used herein, a full

human 12S isoform a protein may be a modified human 12S isoform a protein containing one
or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared to a wild-type or
naturally-occurring human 12S isoform a protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3), while retaining
substantial 12S protein activity. Thus, in some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is
substantially homologous to human 12S isoform a protein (SEQ ID NO:3). For example, a
recombinant 12S protein may have an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%,

embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein contains a fragment or a portion of human 12S
isoform a protein. As used herein, a human 12S isoform a protein typically contains a signal
peptide sequence.
[0066]          In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is human 12S isoform b
protein. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein may be a homologue or an
analogue of human 12S isoform b protein. For example, a homologue or an analogue of
human 12S isoform b protein may be a modified human 12S isoform b protein containing one
or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared to a wild-type or
naturally-occurring human 12S isoform b protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:4), while retaining
substantial 12S protein activity. Thus, in some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is
substantially homologous to human 12S isoform b protein (SEQ ID NO:4). For example, a
recombinant 12S protein may have an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%,

 [00671         Homologues or analogues of human 12S proteins can be prepared according to
methods for altering polypeptide sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as
are found in references that compile such methods. In some embodiments, conservative
substitutions of amino acids include substitutions made among amino acids within the
following groups: (a) M, I, L, V; (b) F, Y, W; (c) K, R, H; (d) A, G; (e) S, T; (f) Q, N; and (g)
E, D. In some embodiments, a "conservative amino acid substitution" refers to an amino acid
substitution that does not alter the relative charge or size characteristics of the protein in
which the amino acid substitution is made.
 [0068]         In some embodiments, recombinant I2S proteins may contain a moiety that
binds to a receptor on the surface of target cells to facilitate cellular uptake and/or lysosomal
targeting. For example, such a receptor may be the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate
receptor (CI-MPR) which binds the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues. In addition, the
CI-MPR also binds other proteins including IGF-II. In some embodiments, a recombinant
I2S protein contains M6P residues on the surface of the protein. In particular, a recombinant
I2S protein may contain bis-phosphorylated oligosaccharides which have higher binding
affinity to the CI-MPR. In some embodiments, a suitable enzyme contains up to about an
average of about at least 20% bis-phosphorylated oligosaccharides per enzyme. In other
embodiments, a suitable enzyme may contain about 10%, 15%, 18%, 2 0%, 2 5%, 3 0%, 35%,
40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60% bis-phosphorylated oligosaccharides per enzyme.
 [0069]         In some embodiments, recombinant 12S enzymes may be fused to a lysosomal
targeting moiety that is capable of binding to a receptor on the surface of target cells. A
suitable lysosomal targeting moiety can be IGF-I, IGF-II, RAP, p97, and variants,
homologues or fragments thereof (e.g., including those peptide having a sequence at least
70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identical to a wild-type mature human IGF-I, IGF-II,
RAP, p97 peptide sequence). The lysosomal targeting moiety may be conjugated or fused to
an 12S protein or enzyme at the N-terminus, C-terminus or internally.

 [0070]         The present invention may be used to purify a recombinant 12S protein
produced by various means. For example, an 12S protein may be recombinantly produced by
utilizing a host cell system engineered to express an 12S-encoding nucleic acid.
Alternatively, an 12S protein may be produced by activating an endogenous 12S gene.
 [0071]         It is contemplated that the present invention can be used to purify a
recombinant 12S protein produced using various expression system. Suitable expression
systems include, for example, egg, baculovirus, plant, yeast, or mammalian cells.
 [0072]         In some embodiments, 12S enzymes are produced in mammalian cells. Non
limiting examples of mammalian cells that may be used in accordance with the present
invention include BALB/c mouse myeloma line (NSO/l, ECACC No: 85110503); human
retinoblasts (PER.C6, CruCell, Leiden, The Netherlands); monkey kidney CV1 line
transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (HEK293
or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol.,
36:59,1977); human fibrosarcoma cell line (e.g., HT1080); baby hamster kidney cells
(BHK21, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells +/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub and Chasin,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216, 1980); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol.
Reprod., 23:243-251, 1980); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green
monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1 587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa,
ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL
3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep
G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL5 1); TRI cells (Mather et
al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci., 383:44-68, 1982); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human
hepatoma line (Hep G2).
 [0073]         In some embodiments, inventive methods according to the present invention
are used to purify recombinant 12S enzymes produced from human cells (e.g., HT1080). In
some embodiments, inventive methods according to the present invention are used to purify
recombinant 12S enzymes produced from CHO cells.
 [0074]         Typically, cells that are engineered to express recombinant 12S may comprise
a transgene that encodes a recombinant 12S protein described herein. It should be appreciated
that the nucleic acids encoding recombinant 12S may contain regulatory sequences, gene
control sequences, promoters, non-coding sequences and/or other appropriate sequences for

 WO 2014/005014                                                              PCT/US2013/048561
                                               20
expressing the recombinant 12S. Typically, the coding region is operably linked with one or
more of these nucleic acid components.
 [0075]          "Regulatory sequences" typically refer to nucleotide sequences located
upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a
coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or
translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences may include promoters,
translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences.
Sometimes, "regulatory sequences" are also referred to as "gene control sequences."
 [0076]          "Promoter" typically refers to a nucleotide sequence capable of controlling
the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is
located 3' to a promoter sequence. The promoter sequence consists of proximal and more
distal upstream elements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers. Accordingly, an
"enhancer" is a nucleotide sequence that can stimulate promoter activity and may be an
innate element of the promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance the level or
tissue-specificity of a promoter. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native
gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature,
or even comprise synthetic nucleotide segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art
that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types,
or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental conditions.
 [0077]          The "3' non-coding sequences" typically refer to nucleotide sequences located
downstream of a coding sequence and include polyadenylation recognition sequences and
other sequences encoding regulatory signals capable of affecting mRNA processing or gene
expression. The polyadenylation signal is usually characterized by affecting the addition of
polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of the mRNA precursor.
 [0078]          The "translation leader sequence" or "5' non-coding sequences" typically
refers to a nucleotide sequence located between the promoter sequence of a gene and the
coding sequence. The translation leader sequence is present in the fully processed mRNA
upstream of the translation start sequence. The translation leader sequence may affect
processing of the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
 [0079]          Typically, the term "operatively linked" or "operably linked" refers to the
association of two or more nucleic acid fragments on a single nucleic acid fragment so that

 WO 2014/005014                                                                PCT/US2013/048561
                                                21
the function of one is affected by the other. For example, a promoter is operatively linked
with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence
(i.e., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding
sequences can be operatively linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation.
 [0080]           The coding region of a transgene may include one or more silent mutations to
optimize codon usage for a particular cell type. For example, the codons of an 12S transgene
may be optimized for expression in a vertebrate cell. In some embodiments, the codons of an
12S transgene may be optimized for expression in a mammalian cell. In some embodiments,
the codons of an 12S transgene may be optimized for expression in a human cell.
 [0081]           Optionally, a construct may contain additional components such as one or
more of the following: a splice site, an enhancer sequence, a selectable marker gene under the
control of an appropriate promoter, an amplifiable marker gene under the control of an
appropriate promoter, and a matrix attachment region (MAR) or other element known in the
art that enhances expression of the region where it is inserted.
 [0082]           Once transfected or transduced into host cells, a suitable vector can express
extrachromosomally (episomally) or integrate into the host cell's genome.
         Activation of recombinant 12S proteins
 [0083]           Typically, a recombinant 12S enzyme is activated by the post-translational
modification of a conserved cysteine (corresponding to amino acid 59 of mature human 12S)
to formylglycine, also known as 2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid, or oxo-alanine. Such post
translational modification can be carried out by an enzyme known as Formylglycine
Generating Enzyme (FGE). Thus, in some embodiments, recombinant 12S enzymes are
produced in cells that also express FGE protein. In particular embodiments, recombinant 12S
enzymes are produced in cells that have increased or enhanced expression of FGE protein.
For example, cells may be engineered to over-express FGE in combination with recombinant
12S to facilitate the production of 12S preparations having high levels of active enzyme. In
some embodiments, over-expression of FGE is achieved by expression (e.g., over-expression)
of an exogenous FGE using standard recombinant technology. In some embodiments, over
expression of FGE is achieved by activated or enhanced expression of an endogenous FGE

 WO 2014/005014                                                             PCT/US2013/048561
                                               22
by, for example, activating or enhancing the promoter of the endogenous FGE gene. In some
cases, the nucleic acid encoding recombinant 12S and the nucleic acid encoding a
recombinant FGE protein are linked by a nucleic acid (e.g., a spacer sequence) having a
sequence corresponding to an internal ribosomal entry site.
 [0084]         Any FGE having ability to convert cysteine to formylglycine may be used in
the present invention. Exemplary nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for FGE proteins
are disclosed in US 2004-0229250, the entire contents relating to such sequences and the
sequences themselves are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. It should be
appreciated that the nucleic acids encoding recombinant FGE may comprise regulatory
sequences, gene control sequences, promoters, non-coding sequences and/or other
appropriate sequences for expressing the FGE. Typically, the coding region is operably
linked with one or more of these nucleic acid components.
        Cell Culture Medium and Condition
 [0085]         Various cell culture medium and conditions may be used to produce a
recombinant 12S protein. For example, a recombinant 12S protein may be produced in serum
containing or serum-free medium. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is
produced in serum-free medium. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is
produced in an animal free medium, i.e., a medium that lacks animal-derived components. In
some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is produced in a chemically defined medium.
As used herein, the term "chemically-defined nutrient medium" refers to a medium of which
substantially all of the chemical components are known. In some embodiments, a chemically
defined nutrient medium is free of animal-derived components such as serum, serum derived
proteins (e.g., albumin or fetuin), and other components. In some cases, a chemically-defined
medium comprises one or more proteins (e.g., protein growth factors or cytokines.) In some
cases, a chemically-defined nutrient medium comprises one or more protein hydrolysates. In
other cases, a chemically-defined nutrient medium is a protein-free media, i.e., a serum-free
media that contains no proteins, hydrolysates or components of unknown composition.
 [0086]         In some embodiments, a chemically defined medium may be supplemented by
one or more animal derived components. Such animal derived components include, but are
not limited to, fetal calf serum, horse serum, goat serum, donkey serum, human serum, and

WO 2014/005014                                                                  PCT/US2013/048561
                                                23
serum derived proteins such as albumins (e.g., bovine serum albumin or human serum
albumin).
[0087]           Various cell culture conditions may be used to produce recombinant 12S
proteins at large scale including, but not limited to, roller bottle cultures, bioreactor batch
cultures and bioreactor fed-batch cultures. In some embodiments, recombinant 12S protein is
produced by cells cultured in suspense. In some embodiments, recombinant 12S protein is
produced by adherent cells.
[0088]           Exemplary cell media and culture conditions are described in the Examples
sections. Additional exemplary methods and compositions for producing recombinant 12S
protein are described in the provisional application entitled "Methods and Compositions for
Producing Recombinant Iduronate-2-Sulfatase" filed herewith on even date, the entire
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

[0089]           In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of purifying
recombinant 12S protein from an impure preparation using a process based on one or more of
anion-exchange chromatography, cation-exchange chromatography, mixed-mode
chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. In some embodiments, an
inventive method according to the present invention involves less than 6 (e.g., less than 5,
less than 4, or less than 3) chromatography steps. In some embodiments, an inventive
method according to the present invention involves 2, 3, 4 or 5 chromatography steps. In
some embodiments, an inventive method according to the present invention involves 4
chromatography steps. In some embodiments, an inventive method according to the present
invention conducts anion-exchange chromatography, mixed-mode chromatography, cation
exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography in that order.

Impure preparation
 [0090]          As used herein, an impure preparation can be any biological material including
unprocessed biological material containing recombinant 12S protein. For example, an impure
preparation may be unprocessed cell culture medium containing recombinant 12S protein
secreted from the cells (e.g., mammalian cells) producing 12S protein or raw cell lysates
containing 12S protein. In some embodiments, an impure preparation may be partially
processed cell medium or cell lysates. For example, cell medium or cell lysates can be
concentrated, diluted, treated with viral inactivation, viral processing or viral removal. In
some embodiments, viral removal may utilize nanofiltration and/or chromatographic
techniques, among others. In some embodiments, viral inactivation may utilize solvent
inactivation, detergent inactivation, pasteurization, acidic pH inactivation, and/or ultraviolet
inactivation, among others. Cell medium or cell lysates may also be treated with protease,
DNases, and/or RNases to reduce the level of host cell protein and/or nucleic acids (e.g.,
DNA or RNA). In some embodiments, unprocessed or partially processed biological
materials (e.g., cell medium or cell lysate) may be frozen and stored at a desired temperature
(e.g., 2-8 'C, -4 'C, -25 'C, -75 C) for a period time and then thawed for purification. As
used herein, an impure preparation is also referred to as starting material or loading material.
Anion-exchange chromatography
 [0091]          In some embodiments, provided methods for purifying recombinant I2S
include anion-exchange chromatography. In brief, anion exchange chromatography is a
chromatographic technique which relies on charge-charge interactions between a negatively
charged compound and a positively charged resin. In some embodiments, the anion
exchange chromatography is strong anion-exchange chromatography. In some embodiments,
anion-exchange chromatography is employed as a first purification step for a therapeutic
protein (e.g., recombinant 12S).
 [0092]          Exemplary anion exchange resins include, but are not limited to, quaternary
amine resins or "Q-resins" (e.g., CaptoTM-Q, Q-Sepharose*, QAE Sephadex*);
diethylaminoethane (DEAE) resins (e.g., DEAE-Trisacryl*, DEAE Sepharose*, benzoylated
naphthoylated DEAE, diethylaminoethyl Sephacel*); Amberjet* resins; Amberlyst* resins;

basic), cholestyramine resin, ProPac* resins (e.g., ProPac* SAX-10, ProPac* WAX-10,
ProPac* WCX-10); TSK-GELe resins (e.g., TSKgel DEAE-NPR; TSKgel DEAE-5PW);
and Acclaim* resins. In certain embodiments, the anion exchange resin is a Q resin.
 [0093]         Typical mobile phases for anionic exchange chromatography include
relatively polar solutions, such as water, acetonitrile, organic alcohols such as methanol,
ethanol, and isopropanol, or solutions containing 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid
(MES). Thus, in certain embodiments, the mobile phase includes about 0%, 1%, 2%, 4%,

about 95%, about 10% to about 9 0%, about     2

about 4 0% to about 6 0% polar solution at any given time during the course of the separation.
 [0094]         Generally, a mobile phase includes a salt. For example, a salt (e.g., sodium
chloride) can elute a bound protein from an anion exchange column (e.g., the counter ion is
chloride and it is exchanged for the target protein, which is then released). In some
embodiments, the mobile phase includes a salt concentration between about 0 to about 1.OM,
e.g., between about 0 to about 0.8M, between about 0 to about 0.6M, between about 0 to
about 0.5M, between about 0 to about 0.4M, between about 0.05M to about 0.50M, between
about 0.1OM to about 0.45M, between about 0.1OM to about 0.40M, or between about 0.15M
to about 0.40M. In some embodiments, the mobile phase includes a salt concentration of
approximately 0.01M, 0.02M, 0.03M, 0.04M, 0.05M, 0.06M, 0.07M, 0.08M, 0.09M, 0.1M,
0.2M, 0.3M, 0.4M, 0.5M, 0.6M, 0.7M, 0.8M, 0.9M, or 1.OM. In some embodiments, salt
concentration in the mobile phase is a gradient (e.g., linear or non-linear gradient). In some
embodiments, salt concentration in the mobile phase is constant. In some embodiments, salt
concentration in the mobile phase may increase or decrease stepwise.
 [0095]         Typically, the mobile phase is buffered. In certain embodiments, the mobile
phase is not buffered. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is buffered to a pH between
about 5 to about 14. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is buffered to a pH between
about 5 to about 10. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is buffered to a pH between

7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, or 10.
[0096]           In some embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or
flow-through is adjusted to pH of about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 or 7.5 and the conductivity of
about 2 mS/cm, 4 mS/cm, 6 mS/cm, 8 mS/cm, 10 mS/cm, 12 mS/cm, 14 mS/cm, 16 mS/cm,
18 mS/cm, or 20 mS/cm prior to loading to the anion-exchange chromatography column
(e.g., Q column). The pH may be adjusted using sodium acetate (e.g., IM) and the
conductivity may be adjusted using sodium chloride (e.g., 5M). Once loaded, an anion
exchange chromatography column may be washed using a wash buffer comprising salt (e.g.,
NaCl) concentration ranging from about 140 mM to about 200 mM (e.g., about 140 mM, 145
mM, 150 mM, 155 mM, 160 mM, 165 mM, 170 mM, 175 mM, 180 mM, 185 mM, 190 mM,
195 mM, or 200 mM) with pH of about 5.0-7.5 (e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 or 7.5). An
anion-exchange chromatography column may be eluted using an elution buffer comprising a
linear NaCl gradient. A suitable exemplary linear NaCl gradient may contain a range from
about 0-500 mM NaCl (e.g., about 0-400 mM, about 0-350 mM, about 0-300 mM, about 50
500 mM, about 150-500 mM, about 150-450 mM, about 150-400 mM).
Cation Exchange Chromatography
[0097]           In some embodiments, provided methods for purifying recombinant 12S
include cation-exchange chromatography. In brief, cation exchange chromatography is a
chromatographic technique which relies on charge-charge interactions between a positively
charged compound and a negatively charged resin. In some embodiments, the cation
exchange chromatography is strong cation-exchange chromatography.
[0098]           Cation exchange chromatography is generally practiced with either a strong or
weak cation exchange column, containing a sulfonium ion, or with a weak cation exchanger,
having usually a carboxymethyl (CM) or carboxylate (CX) functional group. Many suitable
cation exchange resins are known in the art and are commercially available and include, but
are not limited to SP-Sepharose*, CM Sepharose*; Amberjet* resins; Amberlyst* resins;
Amberlite* resins (e.g., Amberlite* IRA120); ProPac* resins (e.g., ProPac* SCX-10,
ProPac* WCX-10, ProPac* WCX-10); TSK-GELe resins (e.g., TSKgel BioAssist S;

[0099]            Typical mobile phases for cationic exchange chromatography include
relatively polar solutions, such as water, acetonitrile, organic alcohols such as methanol,
ethanol, and isopropanol, or solutions containing 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid

about 0 to about 1.OM, e.g., between about 0 to about 0.8M, between about 0 to about 0.6M,
between about 0 to about 0.5M, between about 0 to about 0.4M, between about 0.05M to
about 0.50M, between about 0.1OM to about 0.45M, between about 0.1OM to about 0.40M, or
between about 0. 15M to about 0.40M. In some embodiments, the mobile phase includes a
salt concentration of approximately 0.01M, 0.02M, 0.03M, 0.04M, 0.05M, 0.06M, 0.07M,
0.08M, 0.09M, 0.1M, 0.2M, 0.3M, 0.4M, 0.5M, 0.6M, 0.7M, 0.8M, 0.9M, or 1.OM. In some
embodiments, salt concentration in the mobile phase is a gradient (e.g., linear or non-linear

 [0102]          In some embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or
flow-through is adjusted to conductivity ranging between about 1 mS/cm and 20 mS/cm (e.g.,
between about 1 mS/cm and 15 mS/cm, between about 1 mS/cm and 10 mS/cm, between
about 1 mS/cm and 8 mS/cm, between about 1 mS/cm and 6 mS/cm, between about 1 mS/cm
and 4 mS/cm, between about 2 mS/cm and 4 mS/cm) prior to loading to the cation-exchange
chromatography column (e.g., SP column). In particular embodiments, an impure
preparation or an intermediate eluate or flow-through is adjusted to conductivity ranging
between n about 2 mS/cm and 4 mS/cm (e.g., 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, or 4 mS/cm) prior to loading to
the cation-exchange chromatography column (e.g., SP column). The conductivity may be
adjusted by diluting an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or flow-through with
H2 0 at, e.g., 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 2.0:1, 2.5:1, 3.0:1, 4.0:1, 5.0:1, or 10:1 ratio.
The conductivity may also be adjusted by dialfiltration into a desired buffer. In some
embodiments, a cation-exchange chromatography column is run at a pH of about 5.0-6.5
(e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 or 6.5). In some embodiments, a cation-exchange chromatography
column is run with a buffer comprising phosphate (e.g., NaPO4) concentration ranging from
about 0.01 M to about 0.1 M (e.g., about 0.01 M, 0.02 M, 0.03 M, 0.04 M, 0.05 M, 0.06 M,
0.07 M, 0.08 M, 0.09 M, or 0.1 M). In some embodiments, a suitable pH is about 5.0-6.5
(e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5).
Mixed Mode Chromatography
 [0103]          Hydroxyapatite chromatography (HA) is considered to be a "pseudo-affinity"
chromatography or "mixed-mode" ion exchange and may be used in accordance with the
present invention. Hydroxyapatite is a unique form of calcium phosphate used in
fractionation and purification of biological molecules. In some cases, crystalline
hydroxyapatite may be used, although the fragility of the crystals may limit flow rates and/or
column longevity. Two types of chemically pure ceramic hydroxyapatite, CHT ceramic
hydroxyapatite Types I and II are macroporous, spherical and can be used at high flow rates
and pressures. Type I generally has a high protein binding capacity, while Type II generally
has a lower binding capacity for proteins. In general, the formula of hydroxyapatite is
Caio(PO 4 ) 6(OH) 2 (Kawasaki, et al 1985). The functional groups include positively charged
pairs of crystal calcium ions (C-sites) and clusters of six negatively charged oxygen atoms
associated with triplets of crystal phosphates (P-sites). C-sites, P-sites and hydroxyls are

distributed in a fixed pattern on the crystal surface, generally leading to complex interactions
with proteins and other molecules.
 [0104]         A sample may be loaded onto an HA column in low ionic strength phosphate
buffer (e.g., 1-10 mM sodium or potassium phosphate) at or near neutral pH. In some
embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or flow-through is adjusted to
phosphate (e.g., NaPO4) concentration ranging from about 0.001 M to about 0.01 M (e.g.,
about 0.001 M, 0.002 M, 0.003 M, 0.004 M, 0.005 M, 0.006 M, 0.007 M, 0.008 M, 0.009 M,
or 0.01 M) and pH of about 5.0-6.5 (e.g., about 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5) prior to loading the
mixed-mode chromatography column (e.g., HA column). The loaded HA column are
typically washed with a wash buffer having a phosphate concentration comparable to that of
the loading buffer. In some embodiments, the mixed-mode chromatography column (e.g.,
HA column), once loaded, is washed with a wash buffer containing phosphate (e.g., 1-10 mM
sodium or potassium phosphate) at or near neutral pH. For example, a suitable wash buffer
may have a phosphate concentration of about 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM, 6 mM, 7
mM, 8 mM, 9 mM, or 10 mM. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to increase the
amount of phosphate in the wash buffer to create a more stringent wash condition. It is
contemplated that the M6P levels, in particular di-M6P levels, on the surface of 12S proteins
are important for lysosomal targeting. Increased phosphate concentration in the wash buffer
may selectively retain 12S proteins with high levels of M6P, in particular, di-M6P on the HA
column. Thus, in some embodiments, a desired wash buffer may have a phosphate
concentration of or greater than 10 mM, 11 mM, 12 mM, 13 mM, 14 mM, 15 mM, 16 mM,
 17 mM, 18 mM, 19 mM, 20 mM. In some embodiments, the loaded mixed-mode
chromatography column (e.g., HA column) is washed with a wash buffer having a phosphate
concentration ranging from about 10-20 mM (e.g., about 10-18 mM, 10-16 mM, 10-15 mM,
 12-20 mM, 14-18 mM, 14-16 mM). In some embodiments, the loaded mixed-mode
chromatography column (e.g., HA column) is washed with a wash buffer having a phosphate
concentration of or greater than 10 mM, 11 mM, 12 mM, 13 mM, 14 mM, 15 mM, 16 mM,
 17 mM, 18 mM, 19 mM, 20 mM.
 [0105]         Elution from an HA column is typically achieved with a gradient phosphate
buffer. For example, a suitable elution buffer may have a phosphate gradient of
approximately 1-400 mM (e.g., 1-300 mM, 1-200 mM, 1-150 mM, 1-100 mM, 10-350 mM,
 10-300 mM, 10-250 mM, 10-200 mM, 10-150 mM, 10-140 mM, 10-130 mM, 10-120 mM,

phosphate. In some embodiments, elution from an HA column is achieved by stepwise
increasing the phosphate concentration in the elution buffer. In some embodiments, stepwise
elution buffers may have a phosphate concentration selected from 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM,
40 mM, 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, 100 mM, 110 mM, 120 mM, 130 mM,
 140 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 250 mM, 300 mM, 350 mM, 400 mM. In some embodiments,
elution from a mixed-mode chromatography column (e.g., HA column) is achieved by an
elution buffer having a phosphate (e.g., sodium phosphate) concentration ranging from about
50 mM to about 150 mM (e.g., selected from a phosphate (e.g., sodium phosphate)
concentration of about 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, 100 mM, 110 mM, 120
mM, 130 mM, 140 mM, 150 mM, and combination thereof).
 [0106]         It will be appreciated that many different combinations of conditions for HA
chromatography are known and may be used to adjust the parameters to be suitable for a
particular protein of interest (e.g., recombinant I2S).
HydrophobicInteraction Chromatography
 [0107]         Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is a separation technique that
uses the properties of hydrophobicity to separate proteins from one another. In this type of
chromatography, hydrophobic groups such as phenyl, octyl, or butyl, are attached to the
stationary column. Proteins that pass through the column that have hydrophobic amino acid
side chains on their surfaces are able to interact with and bind to the hydrophobic groups on
the column. HIC columns are known, and include for example, Phenyl Sepharose
 [0108]         HIC separations are often designed using the opposite conditions of those used
in ion exchange chromatography. In general, a buffer with a high ionic strength, usually
ammonium sulfate, is initially applied to the column. The salt in the buffer reduces the
solvation of sample solutes thus as solvation decreases, hydrophobic regions that become
exposed are adsorbed by the medium. The stationary phase is generally designed to form
hydrophobic interactions with other molecules. These interactions are generally too weak in
water, however, addition of salts (e.g., Na 2 SO 4 , K 2 S0 4 , (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , NaCl, NH 4Cl, NaBr, and
NaSCN) to the buffer results in hydrophobic interactions. In some embodiments, the mobile
phase includes a salt concentration between about 0. 1M to about 3.0M, e.g., between about

embodiments, the mobile phase is not buffered. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is
buffered to a pH between about 5 to about 14. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is
buffered to a pH between about 5 to about 10. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is
buffered to a pH between about 5 to about 7. In certain embodiments, the mobile phase is
buffered to a pH of about 5.0.
[0110]          In some embodiments, an impure preparation or an intermediate eluate or
flow-through is adjusted to salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 0.5 M to about
2.0 M (e.g., about 0.5 M, 1.0 M, 1.1 M, 1.2 M, 1.3 M, 1.4 M, 1.5 M, 1.6 M, 1.7 M, 1.8 M, 1.9
M, or 2.0 M) at pH of about 4.5-6.0 (e.g., about 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0) prior to loading onto the
hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (e.g., phenyl column). Once loaded, a
hydrophobic interaction chromatography column may be washed using a wash buffer
comprising salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 0.5 M to about 2.0 M (e.g.,
about 0.5 M, 1.0 M, 1.1 M, 1.2 M, 1.3 M, 1.4 M, 1.5 M, 1.6 M, 1.7 M, 1.8 M, 1.9 M, or 2.0
M) at pH of about 4.5-6.0 (e.g., about 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0). In some embodiments, the
hydrophobic interaction chromatography column is eluted using a elution buffer comprising
salt (e.g., NaCl) concentration ranging from about 0.1 M to about 0.5 M (e.g,. about 0.1 M,
0.2 M, 0.3 M, 0.4 M, or 0.5 M) at pH of about 4.5-6.0 (e.g., about 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0).
Characterization of Purified I2S Proteins
[0111]          Purified recombinant 12S protein may be characterized using various methods.
         Purity
[0112]          The purity of purified recombinant 12S protein is typically measure by the
level of various impurities (e.g., host cell protein or host cell DNA) present in the final
product. For example, the level of host cell protein (HCP) may be measured by ELISA or
SDS-PAGE. In some embodiments, the purified recombinant 12S protein contains less than
150 ng HCP/mg 12S protein (e.g., less than 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40,

regulatory agencies such as FDA.
         Specific Activity

functional and/or biological activity. The enzyme activity of a recombinant 12S composition
may be determined using methods known in the art. Typically the methods involve detecting
the removal of sulfate from a synthetic substrate, which is known as sulphate release assay.
One example of an enzyme activity assay involves the use of ion chromatography. This
method quantifies the amount of sulfate ions that are enzymatically released by recombinant
12S from a substrate. The substrate may be a natural substrate or a synthetic substrate. In
some cases, the substrate is heparin sulfate (e.g., heparin disaccharide), dermatan sulfate, or a
functional equivalent thereof. Typically, the released sulfate ion is analyzed by ion
chromatography with a conductivity detector. In this example, the results may be expressed
as U/mg of protein where 1 Unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme required to release 1
pmole sulfate ion per hour from the substrate. In some embodiments, purified recombinant
12S protein has a specific activity, as measured by in vitro sulfate release activity assay using
heparin disaccharide as substrate, ranging from about 0-100 U/mg, about 10-100 U/mg, about
 10-80 U/mg, about 20-80 U/mg, about 20-70 U/mg, about 20-60 U/mg, about 20-50 U/mg,
about 30-100 U/mg, about 30-90 U/mg, about 30-80 U/mg, about 30-70 U/mg, about 30-60
U/mg, about 40-100 U/mg, about 40-90 U/mg, about 40-80 U/mg, about 40-70 U/mg, about
40-60 U/mg. In some embodiments, purified recombinant 12S protein has a specific activity,
as measured by in vitro sulfate release activity assay using heparin disaccharide as substrate,
of at least about 5 U/mg, about 10 U/mg, about 15 U/mg, about 20 U/mg, about 25 U/mg,
about 30 U/mg, about 35 U/mg, about 40 U/mg, about 45 U/mg, about 50 U/mg, about 55
U/mg, about 60 U/mg, about 65 U/mg, about 70 U/mg, about 75 U/mg, about 80 U/mg, about
85 U/mg, about 90 U/mg, about 95 U/mg, or about 100 U/mg. Exemplary conditions for
performing in vitro sulfate release activity assay using heparin disaccharide as substrate are
provided below. Typically, this assay measures the ability of 12S to release sulfate ions from
a naturally derived substrate, heparin disaccharide. The released sulfate may be quantified by

 WO 2014/005014                                                              PCT/US2013/048561
                                                33
ion chromatography. In some cases, ion chromatography is equipped with a conductivity
detector. As a non-limiting example, samples are first buffer exchanged to 10 mM Na
acetate, pH 6 to remove inhibition by phosphate ions in the formulation buffer. Samples are
then diluted to 0.075 mg/ml with reaction buffer (10 mM Na acetate, pH 4.4) and incubated
for 2 hrs at 37'C with heparin disaccharide at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 0.3 pg 12S/100
pg substrate in a 30 pL reaction volume. The reaction is then stopped by heating the samples
at 100 0 C for 3 min. The analysis is carried out using a Dionex lonPac AS18 analytical
column with an lonPac AG18 guard column. An isocratic method is used with 30 mM
potassium hydroxide at 1.0 mL/min for 15 minutes. The amount of sulfate released by the
12S sample is calculated from the linear regression analysis of sulfate standards in the range
of 1.7 to 16.0 nmoles. The reportable value is expressed as Units per mg protein, where 1
unit is defined as 1 moles of sulfate released per hour and the protein concentration is
determined by A280 measurements.
 [0114]          In some embodiments, the enzymatic activity of recombinant 12S protein may
also be determined using various other methods known in the art such as, for example, 4
MUF assay which measures hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate to sulfate and
naturally fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MUF). In some embodiments, a desired
enzymatic activity, as measured by in vitro 4-MUF assay, of the produced recombinant 12S
protein is at least about 0.5 U/mg, 1.0 U/mg, 1.5 U/mg, 2 U/mg, 2.5 U/mg, 3 U/mg, 4 U/mg,
5 U/mg, 6 U/mg, 7 U/mg, 8 U/mg, 9 U/mg, 10 U/mg, 12 U/mg, 14 U/mg, 16 U/mg, 18 U/mg,
or 20 U/mg. In some embodiments, a desired enzymatic activity, as measured by in vitro 4
MUF assay, of the produced recombinant 12S protein ranges from about 0-50 U/mg (e.g.,
about 0-40 U/mg, about 0-30 U/mg, about 0-20 U/mg, about 0-10 U/mg, about 2-50 U/mg,
about 2-40 U/mg, about 2-30 U/mg, about 2-20 U/mg, about 2-10 U/mg, about 4-50 U/mg,
about 4-40 U/mg, about 4-30 U/mg, about 4-20 U/mg, about 4-10 U/mg, about 6-50 U/mg,
about 6-40 U/mg, about 6-30 U/mg, about 6-20 U/mg, about 6-10 U/mg. Exemplary
conditions for performing in vitro 4-MUF assay are provided below. Typically, a 4-MUF
assay measures the ability of an 12S protein to hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate (4
MUF-S0 4 ) to sulfate and naturally fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MUF). One
milliunit of activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme required to convert one nanomole of
4-MUF-SO 4 to 4-MUF in one minute at 370 C. Typically, the mean fluorescence units (MFU)
generated by 12S test samples with known activity can be used to generate a standard curve,

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561
                                                34
which can be used to calculate the enzymatic activity of a sample of interest.     Specific
activity may then calculated by dividing the enzyme activity by the protein concentration.
 [0115]         In either example, the protein concentration of a recombinant 12S composition
may be determined by any suitable method known in the art for determining protein
concentrations. In some cases, the protein concentration is determined by an ultraviolet light
absorbance assay. Such absorbance assays are typically conducted at about a 280 nm
wavelength (A 2 8 0 ).
         Charge Profile
 [0116]         Purified recombinant I2S may be characterized by the charge profile
associated with the protein. Typically, protein charge profile reflects the pattern of residue
side chain charges, typically present on the surface of the protein. Charge profile may be
determined by performing an ion exchange (IEX) chromatography (e.g., HPLC) assay on the
protein. In some embodiments, a "charge profile" refers to a set of values representing the
amount of protein that elutes from an ion exchange column at a point in time after addition to
the column of a mobile phase containing an exchange ion.
 [0117]         Typically, a suitable ion exchange column is an anion exchange column. For
example, a charge profile may be determined by strong anion exchange (SAX)
chromatography using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. In
general, recombinant I2S adsorbs onto the fixed positive charge of a strong anion exchange
column and a gradient of increasing ionic strength using a mobile phase at a predetermined
flow rate elutes recombinant I2S species from the column in proportion to the strength of
their ionic interaction with the positively charged column. More negatively charged (more
acidic) I2S species elute later than less negatively charged (less acid) I2S species. The
concentration of proteins in the eluate are detected by ultraviolet light absorbance (at 280
nm).
 [0118]         In some embodiments, recombinant 12S adsorbs at about pH 8.0 in 20 mM
TRIS-HCl onto the fixed positive charge of a Mini     Q PE column    and a gradient of increasing
ionic strength using a mobile phase consisting of 20 mM TRIS-HCL, 1 M sodium chloride,
pH 8.0 at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min elutes recombinant 12S species from the column in
proportion to the strength of their ionic interaction with the positively charged column.

 WO 2014/005014                                                              PCT/US2013/048561
                                               35
 [0119]         In some embodiments, a charge profile may be depicted by a chromatogram of
absorbance units versus time after elution from the HPLC column. The chromatogram may
comprise a set of one or more peaks, with each peak in the set identifying a subpopulation of
recombinant I2Ss of the composition that have similar surface charges.
 [0120]         In some embodiments, a purified I2S protein composition exhibits at least six
peaks in its charge profile. An exemplary charge profile of I2S is depicted in the Examples
section and in Figure 11. As shown in Figure 11, six peaks are labeled (A to F) in the order
of increasing negative charge and decreasing contribution to total peak area of the
chromatogram. In some embodiments, the charge profile for a purified recombinant I2S
composition contains a different number, size, shape or time interval of peaks depending on
the amount of negative or positive charges on the surface of the protein. In some
embodiments, a recombinant I2S composition has a charge profile that has fewer than 6 (e.g.,
fewer than 5, 4, 3, or 2) peaks. In some embodiments, a charge profile of recombinant I2S
may have 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 peak(s). For example, any one, two, three, four, or five of peaks A,
B, C, D, E, and F may be absent or reduced in a purified recombinant I2S protein
composition. Typically, a charge profile is considered more homogenous if there are fewer
peaks.
         Glycan Mapping
 [0121]         In some embodiments, a purified recombinant 12S protein may be
characterized by their proteoglycan composition, typically referred to as glycan mapping.
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is thought that glycan linkage along with the
shape and complexity of the branch structure may impact in vivo clearance, lysosomal
targeting, bioavailability, and/or efficacy.
[0122]          Typically, a glycan map may be determined by enzymatic digestion and
subsequent chromatographic analysis. Various enzymes may be used for enzymatic digestion
including, but not limited to, suitable glycosylases, peptidases (e.g., Endopeptidases,
Exopeptidases), proteases, and phosphatases. In some embodiments, a suitable enzyme is
alkaline phosphatase. In some embodiments, a suitable enzyme is neuraminidase. Glycans
(e.g., phosphoglycans) may be detected by chromatographic analysis. For example,
phosphoglycans may be detected by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561

with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAE-PAD) or size exclusion High Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The quantity of glycan (e.g., phosphoglycan) represented
by each peak on a glycan map may be calculated using a standard curve of glycan (e.g.,
phosphoglycan), according to methods known in the art and disclosed herein.
 [0123]          In some embodiments, a purified 12S according to the present invention
exhibits a glycan map comprising seven peak groups indicative of neutral (peak group 1),
mono-sialylated (peak group 2), di-sialylated (peak group 3), monophosphorylated (peak
group 4), tri-sialylated (peak group 5), tetra-sialylated (peak group 6), and diphosphorylated
(peak group 7) 12S protein, respectively. Exemplary glycan maps of 12S are depicted in
Figure 10. In some embodiments, a purified recombinant 12S has a glycan map that has
fewer than 7 peak groups (e.g., a glycan map with 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 peaks groups). In some
embodiments, a purified recombinant I2S has a glycan map that has more than 7 peak groups
(e.g., 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or more).
 [0124]          The relative amount of glycan corresponding to each peak group may be
determined based on the peak group area relative to the corresponding peak group area in a
predetermined reference standard. In some embodiments, peak group 1 (neutral) may have
the peak group area ranging from about 40-120% (e.g., about 40-115%, about 40-110%,
about 40-100%, about 45-120%, about 45-115%, about 45-110%, about 45-105%, about 45
 100%, about 50-120%, about 50-110%) relative to the corresponding peak group area in a
reference standard. In some embodiments, peak group 2 (monosialylated) may have the peak
group area ranging from about 80-140% (e.g., about 80-135%, about 80-130%, about 80
 125%, about 90-140%, about 90-135%, about 90-130%, about 90-120%, about 100-140%)
relative to the corresponding peak group area in the reference standard. In some
embodiments, peak group 3 (disialylated) may have the peak group area ranging from about
80-110% (e.g., about 80-105%, about 80-100%, about 85-105%, about 85-100%) relative to
the corresponding peak group area in the reference standard. In some embodiments, peak
group 4 (monophosphorylated) may have the peak group area ranging from about 100-550%
(e.g., about 100-525%, about 100-500%, about 100-450%, about 150-550%, about 150
500%, about 150-450%, about 200-550%, about 200-500%, about 200-450%, about 250
550%, about 250-500%, about 250-450%, or about 250-400%) relative to the corresponding
peak group area in the reference standard. In some embodiments, peak group 5 (tri
sialylated) may have the peak group area ranging from about 70-110% (e.g., about 7 0-10 5 %,

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561

about 70-100%, about 70-95%, about 70-90%, about 80-110%, about 80-105%, about 80
 100%, or about 80-95%) relative to the corresponding peak group area in the reference
standard. In some embodiments, peak group 6 (tetra-sialylated) may have the peak group
area ranging from about 90-130% (e.g., about 90-125%, about 90-120%, about 90-115%,
about 90-110%, about 100-130%, about 100-125%, or about 100-120%) relative to the
corresponding peak group area in the reference standard. In some embodiments, peak group
7 (diphosphorylated) may have with the peak group area ranging from about 70-130% (e.g.,
about 70-125%, about 70-120%, about 70-115%, about 70-110%, about 80-130%, about 80
 125%, about 80-120%, about 80-115%, about 80-110%, about 90-130%, about 90-125%,
about 90-120%, about 90-115%, about 90-110%) relative to the corresponding peak group
area in the reference standard. Various reference standards for glycan mapping are known in
the art and can be used to practice the present invention. Typically, peak group 7
(diphosphorylated) corresponds to the level of di-M6P on the surface of the purified
recombinant I2S protein.
 [0125]         It is contemplated that the glycosylation pattern of a purified I2S impacts the
lysosomal targeting. Various in vitro cellular uptake assays are known in the art and can be
used to practice the present invention. For example, to evaluate the uptake of I2S by M6P
receptors, cellular uptake assays are performed using human fibroblasts expressing M6P
receptors on their surface. The internalized amount of I2S can be measured by a ELISA
method. In some embodiments, a purified recombinant 12S protein according to the present
invention is characterized with cellular uptake of greater than 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
95%, as determined by an in vitro uptake assay.
         Peptide Mapping
 [0126]         In some embodiments, peptide mapping may be used to characterize amino
acid composition, post-translational modifications, and/or cellular processing; such as
cleavage of a signal peptide, formylglycine conversion and/or glycosylation. Typically, a
recombinant protein may be broken into discrete peptide fragments, either through controlled
or random breakage, to produce a pattern or peptide map. In some cases, a purified 12S
protein may be first subjected to enzymatic digest prior to analytic analysis. Digestion may
be performed using a peptidase, glycoside hydrolase, phosphatase, lipase or protease and/or
combinations thereof, prior to analytic analysis. The structural composition of peptides may

                                                38
be determined using methods well known in the art. Exemplary methods include, but are not
limited to, Mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or HPLC.
        Percent Formylglycine Conversion
[0127]          Peptide mapping can be used to determine Percent FGly conversion. As
discussed above, 12S activation requires Cysteine (corresponding to position 59 of the mature
human 12S) to formylglycine conversion by formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) as
shown below:
                                                                         (H   H
         X),xXxxCys'Xx. <PrcXxK.ArqX,$x.~- ---------------------- XY.X>XY                    q X, Yx
                                                                            FGIyX xA':roXx, t4
Therefore, the percentage of formylglycine conversion (%FG) can be calculated using the
following formula:
                                  Number of active 12S molecules
  %FG (of DS)                                                                              x1 00
                          Number of total (active+inactive) 12S molecules
[0128]          To calculate %FG, a recombinant 12S protein may be digested into short
peptides using a protease (e.g., trypsin or chymotrypsin). Short peptides may be separated
and characterized using, e.g., size exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography
(HPLC). The peptide containing the position corresponding to position 59 of the mature
human 12S may be characterized to determine if the Cys at position 59 was converted to a
FGly as compared to a control (e.g., an 12S protein without FGly conversion or an 12S protein
with 100% FGly conversion). The amount of peptides containing FGly (corresponding to
number of active 12S molecules) and the total amount of peptides with both FGly and Cys
(corresponding to number of total 12S molecules) may be determined based on the
corresponding peak areas and the ratio reflecting %FG can be calculated.
[0129]          In some embodiments, a purified recombinant 12S protein according to the
present invention has at least about 70% (e.g., at least about 77%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%,
96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) conversion of the cysteine residue corresponding to Cys59 of human

recombinant 12S protein according to the present invention has substantially 100%
conversion of the cysteine residue corresponding to Cys59 of human 12S (SEQ ID NO: 1) to
C-formylglycine (FGly).
        Sialic Acid Content
 [0130]         In some embodiments, a purified recombinant 12S protein may be
characterized by their sialic acid composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is
contemplated that sialic acid residues on proteins may prevent, reduce or inhibit their rapid in
vivo clearance via the asialoglycoprotein receptors that are present on hepatocytes. Thus, it is
thought that recombinant proteins that have relatively high sialic acid content typically have a
relatively long circulation time in vivo.
 [0131]         In some embodiments, the sialic acid content of a purified recombinant 12S
protein may be determined using methods well known in the art. For example, the sialic acid
content of a recombinant 12S protein may be determined by enzymatic digestion and
subsequent chromatographic analysis. Enzymatic digestion may be accomplished using any
suitable sialidase. In some cases, the digestion is performed by a glycoside hydrolase
enzyme, such as neuraminidase. Sialic acid may be detected by chromatographic analysis
such as, for example, High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed
Amperometric Detection (HPAE-PAD). The quantity of sialic acid in a recombinant 12S
composition may be calculated using a standard curve of sialic acid, according to methods
known in the art and disclosed herein.
 [0132]         In some embodiments, the sialic acid content of a purified recombinant 12S
protein may be greater than 16 mol/mol. The units "mol/mol" in the context of sialic acid
content refers to moles of sialic acid residue per mole of enzyme. In some cases, the sialic
acid content of a recombinant 12S protein is or greater than about 16.5 mol/mol, about 17
mol/mol, about 18 mol/mol, about 19 mol/mol, about 20 mol/mol, about 21 mol/mol, about
22 mol/mol or more. In some embodiments, the sialic acid content of a purified recombinant
12S protein may be in a range between about 16-20 mol/mol, 16-21 mol/mol, about 16-22
mol/mol, 16-23 mol/mol, 16-24 mol/mol, about 16-25 mol/mol, about 17-20 mol/mol, 17-21
mol/mol, about 17-22 mol/mol, 17-23 mol/mol, 17-24 mol/mol, or about 17-25 mol/mol.

Pharmaceutical Composition and Administration
[01331           Purified recombinant 12S protein may be administered to a Hunter Syndrome
patient in accordance with known methods. For example, purified recombinant 12S protein
may be delivered intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, parenterally, transdermally,
or transmucosally (e.g., orally or nasally)).
[0134]           In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same is administered to a subject by intravenous administration.
[0135]           In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same is administered to a subject by intrathecal administration. As used
herein, the term "intrathecal administration" or "intrathecal injection" refers to an injection
into the spinal canal (intrathecal space surrounding the spinal cord). Various techniques may
be used including, without limitation, lateral cerebroventricular injection through a burrhole
or cisternal or lumbar puncture or the like. In some embodiments, "intrathecal
administration" or "intrathecal delivery" according to the present invention refers to IT
administration or delivery via the lumbar area or region, i.e., lumbar IT administration or
delivery. As used herein, the term "lumbar region" or "lumbar area" refers to the area
between the third and fourth lumbar (lower back) vertebrae and, more inclusively, the L2-S 1
region of the spine.
[01361           In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same is administered to the subject by subcutaneous (i.e., beneath the skin)
administration. For such purposes, the formulation may be injected using a syringe.
However, other devices for administration of the formulation are available such as injection
                                              TM
devices (e.g., the Inject-ease    and Genject     devices); injector pens (such as the
GenPen T M ); needleless devices (e.g., MediJectorTM and BioJector T M ); and subcutaneous patch
delivery systems.
[0137]           In some embodiments, intrathecal administration may be used in conjunction
with other routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,
parenterally, transdermally, or transmucosally (e.g., orally or nasally)).

[01381           The present invention contemplates single as well as multiple administrations
of a therapeutically effective amount of a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same described herein. A recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same can be administered at regular intervals, depending on the nature,
severity and extent of the subject's condition (e.g., a lysosomal storage disease). In some
embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical
composition containing the same may be administered periodically at regular intervals (e.g.,
once every year, once every six months, once every five months, once every three months,
bimonthly (once every two months), monthly (once every month), biweekly (once every two
weeks), weekly, daily or continuously).
[0139]           A recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition containing the same can
be formulated with a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient to prepare a
pharmaceutical composition. The carrier and therapeutic agent can be sterile. The
formulation should suit the mode of administration.
[0140]            Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to
water, salt solutions (e.g., NaCl), saline, buffered saline, alcohols, glycerol, ethanol, gum
arabic, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, carbohydrates such as
lactose, amylose or starch, sugars such as mannitol, sucrose, or others, dextrose, magnesium
stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid esters,
hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrolidone, etc., as well as combinations thereof. The
pharmaceutical preparations can, if desired, be mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., lubricants,
preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure,
buffers, coloring, flavoring and/or aromatic substances and the like) which do not
deleteriously react with the active compounds or interference with their activity. In some
embodiments, a water-soluble carrier suitable for intravenous administration is used.
[0141]           The composition or medicament, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of
wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid
solution, suspension, emulsion, tablet, pill, capsule, sustained release formulation, or powder.
The composition can also be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers
such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical
grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl pyrollidone, sodium
saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc.

 WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561
                                                 42
 [0142]          The composition or medicament can be formulated in accordance with the
routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration to human
beings. For example, in some embodiments, a composition for intravenous administration
typically is a solution in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition
may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic to ease pain at the site of the
injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit
dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a
hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active
agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an
infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water, saline or dextrose/water.
Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection
or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.
 [0143]          As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" is largely
determined base on the total amount of the therapeutic agent contained in the pharmaceutical
compositions of the present invention. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount is
sufficient to achieve a meaningful benefit to the subject (e.g., treating, modulating, curing,
preventing and/or ameliorating the underlying disease or condition). For example, a
therapeutically effective amount may be an amount sufficient to achieve a desired therapeutic
and/or prophylactic effect, such as an amount sufficient to modulate lysosomal enzyme
receptors or their activity to thereby treat such lysosomal storage disease or the symptoms
thereof (e.g., a reduction in or elimination of the presence or incidence of "zebra bodies" or
cellular vacuolization following the administration of the compositions of the present
invention to a subject). Generally, the amount of a therapeutic agent (e.g., a recombinant
lysosomal enzyme) administered to a subject in need thereof will depend upon the
characteristics of the subject. Such characteristics include the condition, disease severity,
general health, age, sex and body weight of the subject. One of ordinary skill in the art will be
readily able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other related factors.
In addition, both objective and subjective assays may optionally be employed to identify
optimal dosage ranges.
 [0144]          A therapeutically effective amount is commonly administered in a dosing
regimen that may comprise multiple unit doses. For any particular therapeutic protein, a
therapeutically effective amount (and/or an appropriate unit dose within an effective dosing

 WO 2014/005014                                                                   PCT/US2013/048561
                                                  43
 regimen) may vary, for example, depending on route of administration, on combination with
 other pharmaceutical agents. Also, the specific therapeutically effective amount (and/or unit
 dose) for any particular patient may depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder
being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific pharmaceutical agent
 employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and
 diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and/or rate of excretion
 or metabolism of the specific fusion protein employed; the duration of the treatment; and like
 factors as is well known in the medical arts.

 methods are described in PCT Publication W02011/163649 entitled "Methods and

 [0151]          Individual harvest material was reduced in volume and buffer exchanged
through an ultrafiltration/dialfiltration process. The material, termed unpurified bulk (UPB),
was frozen at -50'C per individual harvest. The downstream purification process began with
the thaw and pool of unpurified bulk and included successive viral inactivation, anion
exchange (Capto     Q), mixed mode (ceramic    hydroxyapatite), cation exchange (SP Sepharose)
and hydrophobic interaction (Phenyl Sepharose) chromatography steps followed by viral
filtration, and final concentration and diafiltration step. In particular, this purification process
utilized  Q, hydroxyapatite,  SP and Phenyl chromatographic modalities. Protein G
Chromatography and Size Exclusion Chromatography traditionally used in 12S purification
process were removed. Exemplary steps are shown in Table 3.

reference is shown in Figure 2. Exemplary SDS-PAGE (Silver) analysis results are shown in
Figure 3. Typically, using a process described herein, the HCP concentration of drug
substance (DS) was <100 ppm, meeting the <100 ppm specification required in many markets
including the US. The SEC of DS was >99.5%, also meeting the current >99.3% marketing
specification requirement in many markets. Exemplary charge profile is shown in Figure 4.
Exemplary glycan map is shown in Figure 5. In particular, the glycan map of purified 12S
includes seven peak groups, eluting according to an increasing amount of negative charges
derived from sialic acid and mannose-6-phosphate residues, representing in the order of
elution, neutrals, mono-, disialylated, monophosphorylated, trisialylated and hybrid
(monosialylated and capped M6P), tetrasialylated and hybrid (disialylated and capped M6P)
and diphosphorylated glycans.
 [0154]         Taken together, this example demonstrates that a simplified four-column
purification process can be used to successfully purify recombinant 12S produced in animal
free medium at large scale.
Example 2: Harvest and Viral Inactivation Stability Studies of Recombinant 12S AF
 [0155]         The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of temperature hold
time and freeze-thaw cycles on the stability of recombinant 12S clarified harvest.
 [0156]         Clarified harvest samples were stored at ambient and 2-8'C for up to seven
days and the viral inactivated UPB samples were held at ambient for up to 24 hours. Freeze
thaw samples on clarified harvests were frozen at -20'C, -50'C, and -80'C and experienced
freeze-thaw for up to three cycles. Stability was gauged using Western blot, SEC HPLC, and
activity assay.

 [0158]            The viral inactivation step occurred at the unpurified bulk step prior to loading
the first column. UPB was produced by concentrating and buffer exchange of clarified
harvest. UF/DF was performed using a Pall 1 sq. ft. Centramate system and buffer
exchanged into 10 mM MES, 155 mM NaCl, pH=6.5. The viral inactivation step added 1%
Tween 80 and 0.3% TnBP, filtered using Durapore syringe filters for each time point.
Samples were taken at each time point listed in Table 6 and frozen at -800 C. Samples from
the clarified harvest hold point and freeze-thaw studies were tested by Western blot and
activity (4-MU assay). UPB samples from the viral inactivation were tested for purity by
SEC HPLC. The hold point activity results from Harvest 12 and 18 on Table 5 showed no
significant changes up to 7 days of storage at ambient and 2-8 0 C for both harvests. There
were no significant changes seen in Harvest 12 activity for up to 3 freeze-thaw cycles stored
at -20 0 C, -50 0 C, and -80 0 C.

 [01601          Activity and SEC-HPLC for the stability of the viral inactivation UPB step are
described in Figures 6 and 7. This shows that there were no issues in viral inactivation
stability based on activity and purity for up to 24 hours.
 [01611          In summary, based on the stability analysis described herein, clarified harvest
can be stored at 2-8'C (for example, for up to 7 days) without significant changes in harvest
quality. Clarified harvests can experience multiple freeze-thaw cycles and stored at -20'C,
50'C, and -80'C temperatures with no significant changes in stability. Based on SEC HPLC
purity results, viral inactivation at the UPB step can occur at ambient temperature (e.g., for up
to 24 hours) with no changes in activity and purity.
Example 3: Purification and Analysis of Animal-Free IL CD Media Confirmation Run
 [0162]          The objective of this study was to perform purification from pooled harvest of
12S-AF produced in an animal-free perfusion using chemically defined media and to
characterize the drug substance.
 [0163]          This study evaluated 12S-AF purification process performance and drug
substance (DS) produced from a chemically defined medium bioreactor.
Cell Culture
 [0164]          The 12S-AF material was produced from cell line 2D expressing 12S and
formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE)) as described in Example 1. The material was
produced in CCPD in a IL Das Gip spin filter bioreactor using a chemically defined serum
free media. Individual bags from each clarified harvest (HI-21) were received frozen at
20'C and thawed at 2-8'C overnight. Equal volumes of each clarified harvest was pooled to
represent an entire harvest pool, then 0.2pm filtered and concentrated using 30 kD Pall
Omega Centramate cassette with a total membrane area of 1 ft2 . The unpurified bulk (UPB)
was 0.2 um filtered and frozen prior to use.
Purification
 [0165]          Exemplary column specifications and loading are described in Table 7. The     Q
Sepharose was loaded at a target of 3 g/L by titer. Subsequent columns were loaded at 100%
from the previous column elution and no material removed.

 [0166]          One purification run was performed using UPB from pooling harvests 1
through 21 from the bioreactor. UPB was thawed at 2-8'C overnight and pooled by equal
volume from each harvest.
 [0167]          Individual column process steps and buffer formulations can be found in
Tables 8-11. The pooled UPB was filtered using a 0.2 um bottle filter system, adjusted to pH
6.5 using 1 M sodium acetate, and conductivity adjusted to 16 mS/cm with 5 M sodium
chloride prior to loading onto the    Q Sepharose  FF column. The  Q Sepharose   elution was
adjusted to 0.00 1 M NaPO4 using 0.25M NaPO4 , pH 5.5 and filtered with a 0.22 um PES
bottle top filter prior to loading onto the HA column. The HA elution conductivity was
adjusted to 1.55 M NaCl with 5 M NaCl and pH adjusted to pH 5.5 with 1 M sodium acetate.
The adjustment time was approximately 1 hour. The adjusted pool was filtered using a 0.22
um PES bottle top filter prior to loading onto the Phenyl Sepharose column. The Phenyl
elution was concentrated 4X and diafiltered 6X into 0.02 M NaPO4, 0.137 M NaCl, pH 6.0.
The diafiltered product was adjusted to 2.0 g/L and formulated with 0.2% Polysorbate 20 to
generate mock drug substance. A mock pool of H1-20 of the DS was created for additional
characterization.

Example 4. Physiochemical and Biological Characterization of Purified Recombinant
12S Enzyme
[0170]          The purpose of the example was to perform a detailed characterization of the
recombinant 12S protein purified using methods described above.
SDS-PAGE

WO 2014/005014                                                             PCT/US2013/048561
                                                 53
[0171]          For the experiment, recombinant 12S protein was generated using the 2D and
4D human cell lines, in two separate serum-free cell culture reactions. Samples were
collected and purified using methods described above. Purified 12S enzyme was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE, and treated with silver stain for visualization. Exemplary results are shown in
Figure 8. As can be seen from Figure 8, purified recombinant 12S protein using methods
described herein present comparable banding patterns as compared to the 12S reference
sample purified using standard method.
Peptide Map
[0172]          Recombinant 12S protein produced by the 12S-AF 2D cell line was purified
using methods as described above. Purified recombinant 12S and a sample of reference
human 12S were each subjected to proteolytic digest and examined by HPLC analysis. An
exemplary peptide map as compared to that of a reference 12S is shown in Figure 9.
PercentFormylglycine Conversion
[0173]          Peptide mapping can be used to determine Percent FGly conversion. 12S
activation requires Cysteine (corresponding to position 59 of the mature human 12S) to
formylglycine conversion by formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) as shown below:
                            (HO)H
                                               Formylglcine

Therefore, the percentage of formylglycine conversion (%FG) can be calculated using the
following formula:
                                  Number of active 12S molecules
 %FG (of DS) =                                                                      x 00
                         Number of total (active+inactive) 12S molecules
[0174]          For example 50% FG means half of the purified recombinant 12S is
enzymatically inactive without any therapeutic effect.

 WO 2014/005014                                                              PCT/US2013/048561
                                              54
 [01751         Peptide mapping was used to calculate %FG. Briefly, a purified recombinant
12S protein was digested into short peptides using a protease (e.g., trypsin or chymotrypsin).
Short peptides were separated and characterized using HPLC. The peptide containing the
position corresponding to position 59 of the mature human 12S was characterized to
determine if the Cys at position 59 was converted to a FGly as compared to a control (e.g., an
12S protein without FGly conversion or an 12S protein with 100% FGly conversion). The
amount of peptides containing FGly (corresponding to number of active 12S molecules) and
the total amount of peptides with both FGly and Cys (corresponding to number of total 12S
molecules) may be determined based on the corresponding peak areas and the ratio reflecting
%FG was calculated. Exemplary results are shown in Table 14.
Glycan Map - Mannose-6-Phosphateand Sialic Acid Content
 [0176]         The glycan and sialic acid composition of purified recombinant 12S protein
was determined. Quantification of the glycan composition was performed, using anion
exchange chromatography to produce a glycan map. As described below, the glycan map of
recombinant 12S purified under conditions described herein consists of seven peak groups,
eluting according to an increasing amount of negative charges, at least partly derived from
sialic acid and mannose-6-phosphate glycoforms resulting from enzymatic digest. Briefly,
purified recombinant 12S from the serum-free cell culture (12S-AF 2D Serum-free and 12S
AF 4D Serum-free) and reference recombinant 12S, were treated with either (1) purified
neuraminidase enzyme (isolated from Arthrobacter Ureafaciens (10 mU/pL), Roche
Biochemical (Indianapolis, IN), Cat. # 269 611 (1U/100 pL)) for ther removal of sialic acid
residues, (2) alkaline phosphatase for 2 hours at 371'C for complete release of mannose-6
phosphate residues, (3) alkaline phosphatase + neuraminidase, or (4) no treatment. Each
enzymatic digest was analyzed by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with
Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAE-PAD) using a CarboPac PAl Analytical Column
equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PAl Guard Column. A series of sialic acid and mannose
6-phosphate standards in the range of 0.4 to 2.0 nmoles were run for each assay. An isocratic
method using 48 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM sodium hydroxide was run for a minimum
of 15 minutes at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at ambient column temperature to elute each peak.
The data generated from each individual run, for both the 12S-AF and reference 12S samples,
were each combined into a single chromatograph to represent the glycan map for each

recombinant 12S sample was calculated from linear regression analysis of sialic acid
standards. Each chromatogram run was visualized using the PeakNet 6 Software. Sialic acid
standards and sialic acid released from recombinant 12S assay control and test samples appear
as a single peak. The amount of sialic acid (nmoles) for 12S was calculated as a raw value
using the following equation:

Where C is the protein concentration (in mg/ml) of sample or recombinant 12S assay control.
The corrected value of sialic acid as moles of sialic acid per mole of protein for each test

Specific Activity
 [0179]           Specific activity of the recombinant 12S enzyme purified using methods
described herein was analyzed using in vitro sulfate release assay or 4-MUF assay.
                  In vitro sulfate release assay
 [0180]           In vitro sulfate release activity assay was conducted using heparin
disaccharide as substrate. In particular, this assay measures the ability of 12S to release
sulfate ions from a naturally derived substrate, heparin diasaccharide. The released sulfate
may be quantified by ion chromatography equipped with a conductivity detector. Briefly,
samples were first buffer exchanged to 10 mM Na acetate, pH 6 to remove inhibition by
phosphate ions in the formulation buffer. Samples were then diluted to 0.075 mg/ml with
reaction buffer (10 mM Na acetate, pH 4.4) and incubated for 2 hrs at 37'C with heparin
disaccharide at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 0.3 pg 12S/100 pg substrate in a 30 PL
reaction volume. The reaction was then stopped by heating the samples at 100 0 C for 3 min.
The analysis was carried out using a Dionex lonPac AS 18 analytical column with an lonPac
AG18 guard column. An isocratic method was used with 30 mM potassium hydroxide at 1.0
mL/min for 15 minutes. The amount of sulfate released by the 12S sample was calculated
from the linear regression analysis of sulfate standards in the range of 1.7 to 16.0 nmoles.
The reportable value was expressed as Units per mg protein, where 1 unit is defined as 1
moles of sulfate released per hour and the protein concentration is determined by A280
measurements. Exemplary results are shown in Table 14.

WO 2014/005014                                                               PCT/US2013/048561

                4-MUF assay
[0181]          Specific activity of the purified recombinant 12S enzyme may also be analyzed
using the fluorescence based 4-MUF assay. Briefly, the assay measures the hydrolysis of 12S
substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate (4-MUF-SO 4). Upon cleavage of the 4-MUF-SO4
substrate by 12S, the molecule is converted to sulfate and naturally fluorescent 4
methylumbelliferone (4-MUF). As a result, 12S enzyme activity can be determined by
evaluating the overall change in fluorescent signal over time. For this experiment, purified
12S enzyme were incubated with a solution of 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate (4-MUF-SO 4),
Potassium Salt, Sigma Cat. # M-7133). Calibration of the assay was performed using a series
of control reference samples, using commercially available 12S enzyme diluted at 1:100,
1:200 and 1:20,000 of the stock solution. The enzymatic assay was run at 37'C and assayed
using a calibrated fluorometer. Using the fluorescence values obtained for each reference
standard, the percent coefficient of variation was determined using the following equation:
            %CV = S tan dard Deviationof Raw FluorescencValues(N = 3) X 100%
                                   Averagel FluorescenceValue
[0182]          The percent CV values were then used to calculate the Corrected Average
Fluorescence for each sample, in order to determine the reportable enzyme activity, expressed
in mU/mL using the following formula:
                               IFU
                               Inmole/L         1L    2.llmL     hour      1mU (DF)

[0183]          One milliunit of activity is the quantity of enzyme required to convert 1
nanomole of 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate to 4-methylumbelliferone in 1 minute at 37'C.
Charge Profile
[0184]          For this experiment, the charge distribution of each purified recombinant 12S
was determined by Strong Anion Exchange (SAX) Chromatography, with a High

 WO 2014/005014                                                              PCT/US2013/048561
                                               58
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. The method separates recombinant
12S variants within the sample, based on surface charge differences. At pH 8.00, negatively
charged species adsorb onto the fixed positive charge of the SAX column. A gradient of
increasing ionic strength is used to elute each protein species in proportion to the strength of
their ionic interaction with the column. One hundred micrograms of purified 12S, isolated
from the 2D cell line under serum-free growth conditions or reference recombinant 12S
enzyme, was loaded onto an Amersham Biosciences Mini         Q PE (4.6 x 50 mm) column held
at ambient temperature and equilibrated to 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.00. Gradient elution was
made at a flow rate of 0.80 mL/min, using a mobile phase of 20 mM Tris-HC1, 1.0 M sodium
chloride, pH 8.00. Protein concentration was continuously determined during the run, by
measuring light absorbance of the sample elution at the 280 nm wavelength. Exemplary
results showing charge profiles observed for recombinant 12S purified from 2D and 4D cell
lines are shown in Figure 11.
