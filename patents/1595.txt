   1. Field of the Utility Model
            The present utility model relates to a roller blind, and more particularly
   to a roller blind that may be controlled easily and may be rolled upwards and
 5 unrolled downwards quickly.
   2. Description of Related Art
            A conventional roller blind is used to block the light and decorate the
   household environment, and is commonly used with great popularity.
   Furthermore, users demand that the conventional roller blind should be easy to
10 control, but in fact the structure of the conventional roller blind is heavy, and
   the assembly and the disassembly of the conventional roller blind are
   inconvenient. A pulling force for driving a ball chain of the conventional roller
   blind is constant and cannot be adjusted. A pulling force applied to the ball
   chain of the conventional roller blind by users is large and may easily break the
15 ball chain. Additionally, one of the hands of the user pulling the ball chain may
   be hurt by the ball chain. The use performance of the conventional roller blind
   is not ideal.
            The objective of the present utility model is to provide a roller blind
   that may be controlled easily and may be rolled and unrolled quickly.
20          The roller blind has a first mounting frame, a second mounting frame, a
   roller blind module, a winding module, and a ball chain. The first mounting
   bracket has a first connecting bracket, a first engaging mount, and a first
   linking base. The first linking base has a first inserting rod. The second
   mounting bracket has a second connecting bracket, a second engaging mount, a

                                              2
   second linking base, and a rotating module. The second linking base has a
   second inserting rod. The rotating module has an outer shell, a sprocket, and a
   rotating head. The roller blind module is mounted between the first mounting
   frame and the second mounting frame and has a roller tube and a blind. The
 5 winding module is inserted into the roller tube, is connected to the first
   mounting frame, and is connected to the rotating module. The ball chain is
   mounted in the outer shell, engages with the sprocket, and extends out of the
   outer shell to drive the roller tube of the roller blind module to rotate with the
   rotating head relative to the two mounting frames.

   134 of the first linking base 13 is inserted into the engaging hole 413, and the
15 first base panel 131 and the first engaging protrusions 132 are mounted in the
   first engaging recess 121 of the first engaging mount 12 via the first opening
   122 to connect the first linking base 13 with the first engaging mount 12.
            With reference to Fig. 5, the rotating module 24 is inserted into the
   roller tube 31 via the second end 312 of the roller tube 31, and the at least one
20 holding recess 244 of the rotating head 243 of the rotating module 24 engages
   with the retaining protrusion 313 of the roller tube 31, and the second linking
   base 23 is connected to the second engaging mount 22 via the second opening
   222 to connect the second linking base 23 and the rotating module 24 with the
   second engaging mount 22. Then, the roller blind module 30 can be held on the

                                            12
   ceiling between the first mounting frame 10 and the second mounting frame 20
   easily and conveniently.
            Furthermore, the blind 32 of the roller blind module 30 can be rolled
   upwards or unrolled downwards by pulling the ball chain 50 to rotate the roller
 5 tube 31 via the sprocket 242 and the rotating head 243, and during the pulling
   process of the ball chain 50, the rotation of the roller tube 31 is supported by
   the torsion of the spring 44 of the winding module 40, and this may reduce the
   pulling force of the user for driving the ball chain 50, and this may enable the
   user to control the blind 32 easily and may prevent the user from getting hurt
10 by over-pulling the ball chain 50.
            With reference to Figs. 3 and 6, when a user wants to adjust the torsion
   of the spring 44 to change the winding speed of the blind 32, the first mounting
   frame 10 is separated from the winding module 40, and the engaging head 612
   of the adjusting lever 61 is inserted into the engaging hole 413. Then, with
15 reference to Fig. 7, the user may hold and rotate the rotating stem 613 in a
   clockwise direction or a counterclockwise direction to enable the connecting
   rod 41 to co-rotate relative to the roller tube 3 1 via the body 611, the engaging
   head 612, and the engaging hole 413 of the engaging end 411 of the connecting
   rod 41. Therefore, the torsion of the spring 44 between the inner mount 42 and
20 the outer jacket 43 can be adjusted easily by the adjusting lever 61, and this
   may change the winding speed of the blind 32 of the roller blind module 30.
            With reference to Figs. 8 and 9, when the adjusting lever 61 is rotated
   to adjust the torsion of the spring according to the user's need, the positioning
   board 62 is inserted between the engaging end 411 and the covering panel 432

                                            13
   by the camping arms 622 mounted in the limiting recess 433 and abutting
   against the flat edges 414 of the connecting rod 41 and the limiting edges 434
   of the outer jacket 43 and by the positioning space 623 disposed around the
   engaging end 411 to hold the engaging end 411 securely with the covering
 5 panel 432 without rotating relative to the roller tube 31. Then, the adjusting
   lever 61 is moved away from the connecting rod 41 to separate the engaging
   head 612 from the engaging hole 413 of the engaging end 411.
            With reference to Figs. 10 and 11, since the engaging end 411 is held
   by the positioning board 62 without rotating relative to the roller tube 31, and
10 the adjusted torsion of the spring 44 can be fixed before the winding module 40
   connects to the first mounting frame 10 again. After the winding module 40 is
   connected to the first mounting frame 10, the positioning board 62 between the
   engaging end 411 and the covering panel 432 can be removed to finish the
   torsion-adjusting process of the spring 44 of the winding module 40. In
15 addition, the user may release the positioning board 62 from the engaging end
   411 and the covering panel 432 before the first mounting frame 10 is connected
   to the winding module 40. Then, the engaging end 411 can be rotated relative
   to the roller tube 31 by the adjusted torsion of the spring 44 until the torsion of
   the spring 44 is zeroed. Therefore, the roller blind of the present utility model
20 can be used without torsion that is provided by the spring 44.
            Consequently, when the user uses the roller blind of the present utility
   model, the adjusted torsion of the spring 44 may provide an auxiliary effect to
   the user to reduce the pulling force of the user, and this is labor-saving in use
   and in control. In addition, since the roller blind is rolled up or down by the

                                           14
   user pulling the ball chain 50, the spring 44 that is adjusted with torsion may
   improve the winding speed of the roller blind, and then the roller blind can be
   rolled upwards and unrolled downwards quickly.
            Furthermore, when the roller blind in accordance with the utility model
 5 is used for a long time and the winding module 40 is elastically fatigued to
   reduce the winding speed of the winding module 40 or when the user is not
   satisfied with the winding speed of the blind 32, the torsion of the spring 44 of
   the winding module 40 can be adjusted easily and conveniently according to
   the above-mentioned operation as shown in Figs. 6 to 11.
