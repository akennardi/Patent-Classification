Technical Field
[001]    The invention relates to a joist arrangement for supporting a building structure
or the like, and in particular, a stepped joist arrangement.
Background
[002]    It is often desirable to extend the length of a structural member such as a joist.
Accordingly,      methods have been developed to couple two separate structural
members end to end using a splice plate or other support member. A problem with
this method is that the splice plate is subject to high stress and may sag.
[003]    Steps are often required in buildings such as providing a step down between a
floor level and lower floor level for a wet area like a balcony or a bathroom.
Accordingly, the two separate structural members may be offset relative to one
another and then coupled with a splice plate or other support member. The junction
between the vertically offset separate structural members creates high stress at the join
and splice plate that may result in sagging. Moreover, such joined offset separate
structural members are not suitable to span long lengths or require increased
reinforcement to do so.
[004]    The invention disclosed herein seeks to overcome one or more of the above
identified problems or at least provide a useful alternative.
Summary
[005]    In accordance with a first broad aspect there is provided, a stepped joist
arrangement including: a first upper horizontal member and a second upper horizontal
member that are vertically offset relative to one another with the second upper
horizontal member being elevated relative to the first upper horizontal member so as

                                            -2
to define a step therebetween; a lower substantially continuous horizontal member
extending substantially below the first and second upper horizontal members so as to
span the step; a support member arrangement extending between the lower
substantially continuous horizontal member and the first and second upper horizontal
members; and a first side plate adapted to be coupled to a side of the stepped joist
arrangement substantially spanning between the first and second upper horizontal
members and the lower substantially continuous horizontal member thereby spanning
the step.
[006] In an aspect, the stepped joist arrangement includes a second side plate
adapted to be coupled to an opposing side of the stepped joist arrangement between
the first and second upper horizontal members and the lower substantially continuous
horizontal member thereby spanning the step.
[007] In another aspect, the support member arrangement includes: a first
substantially vertical member extending between the lower substantially continuous
horizontal member and a first end of the a first upper horizontal member, and a
second substantially vertical member extending between the lower substantially
continuous horizontal member and a second end of the second upper horizontal
member, the second substantially vertical member being relatively longer than the
first substantially vertical member so as to define a height of the step.
[008] In yet another aspect, the stepped joist arrangement according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein the first side plate includes a vertical side portion and a top
portion angled relative to the vertical side portion, the top portion being arranged to
couple atop and span the step between the first and second upper horizontal members.
[009] In yet another aspect, the top portion includes a first surface arranged to
couple atop the first upper horizontal member and a second surface arranged to couple
atop the second upper horizontal member and a first side plate step between the first
surface and the second surface.

Detailed Description
[0017] Referring to Figures 1 to 6, there is shown a stepped joist arrangement 10 for
supporting a building structure (not shown) such as, but not limited to, a building. The
stepped joist arrangement 10 includes a first upper horizontal member 12, a second
upper horizontal member 14, a lower substantially continuous horizontal member 16,
a support member arrangement 18 and one or more side plates 20.
[0018] The first upper horizontal member 12 and a second upper horizontal member
 14 are discontinuous and are vertically offset relative to one another with the second
upper horizontal member 14 being elevated relative to the first upper horizontal

                                             -4
member 12 so as to define a step 22 therebetween. The first and second upper
horizontal members 12, 14 may be steel open C-sections joists or similar.
 [0019]   As best shown in Figures 1 and 2, the lower substantially horizontal member
 16 extends substantially below the first and second upper horizontal members 12, 14
 so as to span below the step 22. Importantly, the lower substantially horizontal
member 16 is continuous at least in the immediate vicinity of the step 22. In this
 example, the lower substantially horizontal member 16 is a single continuous member
 for the entire joist arrangement 10. The lower substantially horizontal member 16 may
be a steel open C-sections joist or similar.
 [0020] The support member arrangement 18 extends between the lower substantially
horizontal member 16 and the first and second upper horizontal members, 12, 14. In
this example, the support member arrangement 18 includes a plurality of members 24.
 [0021] As shown best in Figure 3, the one or more side plates 20 include a first side
plate 26 adapted to be coupled to a first side 30 of the stepped joist arrangement 10
 and a second side plate 28 adapted to be coupled to a second side 32 of the stepped
joist arrangement 10. The first and second side plates 26, 28 substantially span
between the first and second upper horizontal members 12, 14 and the lower
 substantially horizontal member 16 thereby spanning the step 22.
 [0022] As best shown in Figures 4 and 5, the one or more side plates 20 include a
vertical side portion 34 and top portion 36 arranged to couple atop and span the step
22 between the first and second upper horizontal members 12, 14. The top portion 36
 includes a lip arrangement 38 that provides a first surface 40 arranged to couple to the
top surface 42 of the first upper horizontal member 12 and a second surface 44
 arranged to couple to the second top surface 46 of the second upper horizontal
member 14 and a side plate step 48 between the first and second surfaces 40, 44.
 [0023] The height of the side plate step 48 is substantially the same as the height of
the step 22. The side plates 26, 28 may be each formed from a single sheet of metal
with a step cut therefrom, the lip arrangement 38 may then be folded perpendicular to
the vertical side portion 34, as shown in Figure 4. The plate thickness in this example

                                           -5
may be about 1.2mm, the lip arrangement 38 may be about 30mm and the step height
may be up to about 70 to 100mm, although other suitable thicknesses and
arrangements may be use.
[0024] A distance D1 between the first upper horizontal member 12 and the lower
substantially horizontal member 16 may be about 200mm to 400mm. A distance D2
between the second upper horizontal member 14 and the lower substantially
horizontal member 16 may about 70mm to 100mm greater than D1. The step heights
are therefore defined by D2-D1. The length of the plates 26, 28 - WI and W2 on
opposing sides of the step 22 are about 200mm or greater. Accordingly, the length of
the plate P1 (WI + W2) is therefore greater than the distances D1 and D2, and may
preferably be about twice of the heights, with P1 being, for example, greater than
about 400mm.
[0025] As best shown in Figures 5 and 6, the lip arrangement 38 of the top portion 36
and the vertical side portion 34 may be secured with a fastener (not shown), such as a
nail or otherwise secured, to the respective top surfaces 42, 46 and to the respective
sides 13, 15 and 17 of the first upper horizontal member 12, second upper horizontal
member 14 and lower substantially horizontal member 16. The plates 26, 28 may
include apertures 60, and the upper horizontal member 12, the second upper
horizontal member 14 and the lower substantially horizontal member 16 may include
apertures 62 to correspond to the aperture 60 to allow the passage of the fastener to
secure the plates 26, 28 thereto
[0026] As best shown in Figure 6, the first upper horizontal member 12 includes a
first top surface 42 and a first bottom surface 43, and the second upper horizontal
member 14 includes a second top surface 46 and second bottom surface 47. In this
example, the first top surface 42 is about at the same height as the second bottom
surface 47 defining the height of the step 22 therebetween. However, other geometries
may be used. The first upper horizontal member 12 and the second upper horizontal
member 14 include adjacently arranged and vertically offset ends 50, 52. The first
upper horizontal member 12, the second upper horizontal member 14 and lower
substantially horizontal member 16 include respective sides 13, 15 and 17.

                                            -6
[0027] The support member arrangement 18 includes a first substantially vertical
member 54 extending between the lower substantially continuous horizontal member
 16 and first end 50 of the a first upper horizontal member 12, and a second
substantially   vertical member     56 extending     between  the lower substantially
continuous horizontal member 16 and the second end 52 of the second upper
horizontal member 14.
[0028] The first and second substantially vertical members 54, 56 are generally
parallel and abut one another. The second substantially vertical member 56 being
relatively longer than the first substantially vertical member 54 so as to define the
height of the step 22. The support member arrangement 18 may include further cross
support members 58 that extend at about 45 degrees between the first and second
upper horizontal member 12, 14 and the lower substantially horizontal member 16.
The support member arrangement 18 members may also be steel C-section members.
[0029] The stepped joist arrangement 10 may be formed by welding or otherwise
interconnecting the support member arrangement 18 between the lower substantially
continuous horizontal member 16, and the first upper horizontal member 12 and the
second upper horizontal member 14. The first and second side plates 26, 28 are then
formed and affixed to opposing sides of the stepped joist arrangement 10 so as to
bridge the step 22 and interconnect the first upper horizontal member 12 and the
second upper horizontal member 14. The stepped joist arrangement 10 may then be
utilised within a building structure or the like.
[0030] Advantageously, there has been described a stepped joist arrangement that
includes a lower continuous member and two upper separate stepped members that
are interconnected by side plates. Accordingly, the arrangement includes a lower
continuous member and upper discontinuous stepped members within the one joist.
Moreover, the side plates are arranged to cover at least part of tops of the two upper
separate stepped members and at least partially cover the step.
[0031] The subject stepped joist arrangement removes the need for a packing member
above joists when a step-in height occurs; alleviates difficulties and inefficiencies in
the construction of flooring systems that include step down in the top of the chord;

                                             -7
 assist the transfer of stresses at step down locations and improves ability to span long
lengths with step downs.
 [0032] Further advantageously, the subject stepped joist arrangement allows use of
 one joist rather than the joining of multiple joists allows for more efficient
 construction, allows use of an upper discontinuous member to allow for the maximum
joist depth and therefore the maximum stiffness; and the folded plate and continuous
 lower member allows for the transfer of stresses through the step; and increased
 stiffness, decreases the deflection in a member and allows for longer joist lengths to
meet serviceability requirements.
