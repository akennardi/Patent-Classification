STABLE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION AND METHODS OF USING SAME
                                       PRIORITY CLAIM
10001]    This application is a divisional of Australian patent application 2014203034, itself a
divisional of Australian patent application 2010241571, which is the national phase entry of
PCT international application PCT/US2010/032952 (published as WO 2010/127103), filed
April 29, 2010, and claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application 61/173,763, filed
April 29, 2009, the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
                                         BACKGROUND
10002]      Mixed omega-3 fatty acid esters are typically encapsulated in type 2a gelatin
capsules containing gelatin (~43.4%), glycerol (-20%) and water (~36.6%) and do not
experience stability problems throughout their shelf life. While chemically modified gelatins
such as succinated/succinylated       gelatin have been used to encapsulate reactive fill
ingredients, such gelatin is not approved for use in the U.S. and other markets.
                                           SUMMARY
10003]    We have unexpectedly found that high purity eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is more
susceptible to oxidative degradation than mixed omega-3-acid ethyl esters.              In various
embodiments, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a fatty acid or
a derivative thereof in a capsule shell that resists, hinders, attenuates, or prevents oxidation of
the fatty acid or fatty acid derivative, for example to a greater extent than is provided by a
standard type Ila capsule shell.        In a related embodiment, the fatty acid comprises
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or a derivative of EPA, for example ethyl eicosapentaenoate
(ethyl-EPA or E-EPA). In another embodiment, the fatty acid comprises ultra-pure EPA.
10004]        In one embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition
comprising ultra-pure EPA encapsulated in a capsule shell, where the ultra-pure EPA has a
baseline peroxide value not greater than about 5 Meq/kg and upon storage of the composition
at 23 'C and 50% RH for a period of time, that ultra-pure EPA has a second peroxide value
not greater than about 20 Meq/kg.
10005]       In other embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition
comprising EPA (e.g. E-EPA or ultra pure E-EPA) encapsulated in a capsule shell
comprising a film forming material and a hygroscopic plasticizer, wherein the weight ratio of
                                                  1

film-forming material to hygroscopic plasticizer is not less than about 2.5:1.        Further, the
capsule shell can optionally comprise a non-hygroscopic plasticizer. In one embodiment, the
capsule contains no chemically modified gelatin, for example succinated or succinylated
gelatin.
10006]      In still other embodiments, the present invention provides methods of treating or
preventing a cardiovascular-related disease using compositions as described herein.
10007]      These and other embodiments of the present invention will be disclosed in further
detail herein below.

[0030]    The "baseline peroxide value" and "second peroxide values" can be measured in any
suitable manner, for example by using a U.S. or PhEur or JP compendial method. Typically,
a plurality of encapsulated EPA compositions are provided, each composition containing
EPA having been encapsulated at substantially the same time. A first sampling of I or more
capsules from the plurality is provided, the capsules are opened and peroxide value of the
EPA is measured substantially immediately thereafter, providing an average baseline
peroxide value. At substantially the same time, a second sampling of 1 or more capsules
from the plurality are provided and are placed under desired storage conditions for a desired
time period. At the end of the desired time period, the capsules are opened and peroxide
value of the EPA is measured substantially immediately thereafter, providing an average
second peroxide value. The baseline and second peroxide values can then be compared. In
one embodiment, the "baseline peroxide value" and "second peroxide value" are determined
using a plurality of encapsulated EPA dosage units wherein each dosage unit was
encapsulated (i.e. the EPA filled and sealed into capsules) within a same 60 day period, same
30 day period, a same 20 day period, a same 10 day period, a same 5 day period or a same I
day period.

outcomes (a) - (y) described immediately above.
10086]     Parameters (a) - (y) can be measured in accordance with any clinically acceptable
methodology. For example, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C and fasting blood sugar
can be sample from serum and analyzed using standard photometry techniques. VLDL-TG,
LDL-C and VLDL-C can be calculated or determined using serum lipoprotein fractionation
by preparative ultracentrifugation and subsequent quantitative analysis by refractometry or by
analytic ultracentrifugal methodology. Apo Al, Apo B and hsCRP can be determined from
serum using standard nephelometry techniques.        Lipoprotein (a) can be determined from
serum using standard turbidimetric immunoassay techniques.          LDL particle number and
particle size can be determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry.
Remnants lipoproteins and LDL-phospholipase A2 can be determined from EDTA plasma or
serum and serum, respectively, using enzymatic immunoseparation techniques. Oxidized
LDL, intercellular adhesion molecule-I and interleukin-2 levels can be determined from
serum using standard enzyme immunoassay techniques. These techniques are described in
detail in standard textbooks, for example Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry,     6 th Ed.

embodiment, the methods of the invention include a step of identifying a subject as a Western
diet consumer or prudent diet consumer and then treating the subject if the subject is deemed
a Western diet consumer. The term "Western diet" herein refers generally to a typical diet
consisting of, by percentage of total calories, about 45% to about 50% carbohydrate, about
35% to about 40% fat, and about 10% to about 15% protein. A Western diet may alternately
or additionally be characterized by relatively high intakes of red and processed meats, sweets,
refined grains, and desserts, for example more than 50%, more than 60% or more or 70% of
total calories come from these sources.
