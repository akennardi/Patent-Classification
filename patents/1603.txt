15 Backgroundof the Invention
   Lymphocyte development and activation
   The two major types of lymphocytes in humans are T (thymus-derived) and B (bone
20 marrow derived. These cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone
   marrow and fetal liver that have committed to the lymphoid development pathway.
   The progeny of these stem cells follow divergent pathways to mature into either B or
   T lymphocytes. Human B-lymphocyte development takes place entirely within the
   bone marrow. T cells, on the other hand, develop from immature precursors that
25 leave the marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the thymus, where they
   proliferate and differentiate into mature T lymphocytes.
   Mature lymphocytes that emerge from the thymus or bone marrow are in a
   quiescent, or "resting" state, i.e., they are mitotically inactive. When dispersed into
   the bloodstream, these "naive" or "virgin" lymphocytes, travel into various secondary
30 or peripheral lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils. Most
   virgin lymphocytes have an inherently short life span and die without a few days after
   leaving the marrow or thymus. However, if such a cell receives signals that indicate
   the presence of an antigen, they may activate and undergo successive rounds of cell
   division. Some of the resulting progeny cells then revert to the resting state to
35 become memory lymphocytes - B and T cells that are essentially primed for the next
   encounter with the stimulating allergen. The other progeny of activated virgin
   lymphocytes are effector cells, which survive for only a few days, but carry out
   specific defensive activities.

   Lymphocyte activation refers to an ordered series of events through which a resting
   lymphocyte passes as it is stimulated to divide and produce progeny, some of which
   become effector cells. A full response includes both the induction of cell proliferation
   (mitogenesis) and the expression of immunologic functions. Lymphocytes become
5  activated when specific ligands bind to receptors on their surfaces. The ligands are
   different for T cells and B cells, but the resulting intracellular physiological
   mechanisms are similar.
   Some foreign antigens themselves can induce lymphocyte activation, especially
   large polymeric antigens that cross-link surface immunoglobulins on B-cells, or other
0  glycoproteins on T-cells. However, most antigens are not polymeric and even direct
    binding to B-cells in large numbers fail to result in activation. These more common
    antigens activate B cells when they are co-stimulated with nearby activated helper T
    lymphocytes. Such stimulation may occur from lymphokines secreted by the T-cell,
    but is transmitted most efficiently by direct contact of the B cell with T-cell surface
15  proteins that interact with certain B-cell surface receptors to generate a secondary
    signal.
    T-cells
20  T lymphocytes do not express immunoglobulins, but, instead detect the presence of
    foreign substances by way of surface proteins called T-cell receptors (TCR). These
     receptors recognize antigens by either direct contact or through influencing the
     activity of other immune cells. Together with macrophages, T cells are the primary
     cell type involved in the cell-mediated immunity.
25   Unlike B-cells, T-cells can detect foreign substances only in specific contexts. In
     particular, T-lymphocytes will recognize a foreign protein only if it first cleaved into
     small peptides, which are then displayed on the surface of a second host cell, called
     an antigen- presenting cell (APC). Many types of host cells can present antigens
     under some conditions but certain types are more specifically adapted for this
30   purpose and are particularly important in controlling T-cell activity, including
      macrophages and other B-cells. Antigen presentation depends in part on specific
      proteins, called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, on the surface of
     the presenting cells. Thus, to stimulate cell-mediated immunity, foreign peptides must
                                                  2

        WO 2013/079174                                                           PCT/EP2012/004822
   be presented to T-cells in combination with MHC peptides, and this combination
   must be recognized by a T-cell receptor.
   There are two significant T-cell subsets: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (To cells or CTLs)
   and helper T cells      (TH) cells, which can roughly be identified on the basis of cell
5  surface expression of the marker CD8 and CD4. To cells are important in viral
   defense, and can kill viruses directly by recognizing certain cell surface expressed
   viral peptides. TH cells promote proliferation, maturation and immunologic function of
   other cell types, e.g. , lymphokine secretion to control activities of B cells,
   macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. Both virgin and memory T-lymphocytes ordinarily
10 remain in the resting state, and in this state they do not exhibit significant helper or
   cytotoxic activity. When activated, these cells undergo several rounds of mitotic
   division to produce daughter cells. Some of these daughter cells return to the resting
   state as memory cells, but others become effector cells that actively express helper
    or cytotoxic activity. These daughter cells resemble their parents: CD4+ cells can
15  only product CD4+ progeny, while CD8+ cells yield only CD8+ progeny. Effector T
    cells express cell surface markers that are not expressed on resting T-cells, such as
    CD25, CD28, CD29, CD40L, transferrin receptors and class i MHC proteins. When
    the activating stimuli is withdrawn, cytotoxic or helper activity gradually subsides over
    a period of several days as the effector cells either die or revert to the resting state.
20  Similar to B-cell activation, T-lymphocyte responses to most antigens also require
    two types of simultaneous stimuli. The first is the antigen, which if appropriately
    displayed by MHC proteins on an antigen-presenting cell, can be recognized and
     bound by T-cell receptors. While this antigen-MHC complex does send a signal to
     the cell interior, it is usually insufficient to result in T-cell activation. Full activation,
25   such as occurs with helper T-cells, requires costimulation with other specific ligands
     called costimulators that are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell.
     Activation of a cytotoxic T cell, on the other hand, generally requires IL -2, a cytokine
     secreted by activated helper T cells.
30    PD-1 Pathway
     An important negative co-stimulatory signal regulating T cell activation is provided by
      programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)(CD279), and its ligand binding partners PD-Li
      (B7-H1, CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273). The negative regulatory role of PD-1
                                                       3

        WO 2013/079174                                                       PCT/EP2012/004822
   was revealed by PD-1 knock outs (Pdcdl -), which are prone to autoimmunity.
   Nishimura et al, Immunity JJ.: 141-51 (1999); Nishimura et al, Science 291: 319-22
   (2001). PD-1 is related to CD28 and CTLA-4, but lacks the membrane proximal
   cysteine that allows homodimerization. The cytoplasmic domain of PD-1 contains an
5  immunoreceptor tyorine-based inhibition motif ([TIM, V/lxYxxLN). PD-1 only binds to
   PD-L1 and PD-L2. Freeman et al, J. Exp. Med. 192: 1-9 (2000); Dong et al, Nature
   Med. 5: 1365-1369 (1999); Latchman et al, Nature Immunol 2: 261-268 (2001);
   Tseng et al, J. Exp. Med. 193: 839-846 (2001).
    PD-1 can be expressed on T cells, B cells, natural killer T cells, activated monocytes
10  and dendritic cells (DCs). PD-i is expressed by activated, but not by unstimulated
    human CD4' and CD8' T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. This stands in contrast to
    the more restricted expression of CD28 and CTLA-4. Nishimura et al, Int. Immunol.
    8: 773-80 (1996); Boettler et al, J. Virol. 80: 3532-40 (2006). There are at least 4
    variants of PD-i that have been cloned from activated human T cells, including
15  transcripts lacking (i) exon 2, (ii) exon 3, (iii) exons 2 and 3 or (iv) exons 2 through 4.
     Nielsen et al, Cell. Immunol. 235: 109-16 (2005). With the exception of PD-lAex3, all
    variants are expressed at similar levels as full length PD-i in resting peripheral blood
     mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Expression of all variants is significantly induced upon
     activation of human T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. The PD-1Aex3 variants
20   lacks a transmembrane domain, and resembles soluble CTLA-4, which plays an
     important role in autoimmunity. Ueda et al, Nature 423: 506-11 (2003). This variant is
     enriched in the synovial fluid and sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Wan et al,
     J. Immunol. 177: 8844-50 (2006). The two PD-I ligands differ in their expression
     patterns. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed on mouse T and B cells, CDs,
25   macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells.
     Yamazaki et al, J. Immunol. 169: 5538-45 (2002). PD-L1 is expressed on a wide
     range of nonhematopoietic cells (e.g., comea, lung, vascular epithelium, liver nonpar
     enchymal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, pancreatic islets, placental
     synctiotrophoblasts, keratinocytes, etc.) [Keir et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 26: 677-704
30    (2008)], and is upregulated on a number of cell types after activation. Both type I and
      type II interferons IFN's) upregulate PD-L1. Eppihimer et al, Microcirculation 9: 133
      45 (2002); Schreiner et al, J. Neuroimmunol 155: 172-82 (2004). PD-L1 expression
      in cell lines is decreased when MyD88, TRAF6 and MEK are inhibited. Liu et al,
      Blood HO: 296-304 (2007). JAK2 has also been implicated in PD-L1 induction. Lee
                                                    4

        WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   et al, FEBS Left. 580: 755-62 (2006); Liu et al, Blood HO: 296-304 (2007). Loss or
   inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a cellular phosphatase that
   modified phosphatidylinosital 3-kinase (P13K) and Akt signaling, increased post
   transcriptional PD-L1 expression in cancers. Parsa et al, Nat. Med. 13: 84-88 (2007).
5  PD-L2 expression is more restricted than PD-Li. PD-L2 is inducibly expressed on
   DCs, macrophages, and bone marrow-derived mast cells. PD-L2 is also expressed
   on about half to two-thirds of resting peritoneal BI cells, but not on conventional B2 B
    cells. Zhong et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 37: 2405-10 (2007). PD-L2+ BI cells bind
    phosphatidylcholine and may be important for innate immune responses against
10  bacterial antigens. Induction of PD-L2 by IFN-y is partially dependent upon NF -KB.
    Liang et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 33_: 2706-16 (2003). PD-L2 can also be induced on
    monocytes and macrophages by GM-CF, IL-4 and and IFN-y. Yamazaki et al., J.
    Immunol. 169: 5538-45 (2002); Loke et al, PNAS 100:5336-41 (2003).
    PD-1 signaling typically has a greater effect on cytokine production than on cellular
15  proliferation, with significant effects on IFN-y, TNF-a and IL-2 production. PD-1
    mediated inhibitory signaling also depends on the strength of the TCR signaling, with
    greater inhibition delivered at low levels of TCR stimulation. This reduction can be
    overcome by costimulation through CD28 [Freeman et al, J. Exp. Med. 192: 1027-34
     (2000)] or the presence of IL-2 [Carter et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 32: 634-43 (2002)].
20   Evidence is mounting that signaling through PD-L1 and PD-L2 may be bidirectional.
     That is, in addition to modifying TCR or BCR signaling, signaling may also be
     delivered back to the cells expressing PD-L1 and PD-L2. While treatment of
     dendritric cells with a naturally human anti-PD-L2 antibody isolated from a patient
     with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was not found to upregulate MHC II or B7
25   costimulatory molecules, such cells did produce greater amount of proinflammatory
     cytokines, particularly TNF-a and IL-6, and stimulated T cell proliferation. Nguyen et
     al, J. Exp. Med. 196: 1393-98 (2002). Treatment of mice with this antibody also (1)
     enhanced resistance to transplated b16 melanoma and rapidly induced tumor
      specific CTL. Radhakrishnan et al, J. Immunol. 170: 1830-38 (2003); Radhakrishnan
30    et al, Cancer Res. 64: 4965-72 (2004); Heckman et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 37: 1827-35
      (2007); (2) blocked development of airway inflammatory disease in a mouse model of
      allergic asthma. Radhakrishnan et al, J. Immunol. 173: 1360-65 (2004);

   Further evidence of reverse signaling into dendritic cells ("DCs") results from studies
   of bone marrow derived DCs cultured with soluble PD-1 (PD-1 EC domain fused to Ig
   constant region - "s-PD-1"). Kuipers et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 36: 2472-82 (2006). This
   sPD-1 inhibited DC activation and increased IL-10 production, in a manner reversible
5  through administration of anti-PD-1. Additionally, several studies show a receptor for
   PD-L1 or PD-L2 that is independent of PD-1. B7.1 has already been identified as a
   binding partner for PD-LI. Butte et al, Immunity 27: 111-22 (2007). Chemical
   crosslinking studies suggest that PD-L1 and B7.1 can interact through their IgV-like
   domains. B7.1 :PD-L1 interactions can induce an inhibitory signal into T cells.
 0  Ligation of PD-L1 on CD4+ T cells by B7.1 or ligation of B7.1 on CD4+ T cells by PD
    L1 delivers an inhibitory signal. T cells lacking CD28 and CTLA-4 show decreased
    proliferation and cytokine production when stimulated by anti-CD3 plus B7.1 coated
    beads. In T cells lacking all the receptors for B7.1 (i.e., CD28, CTLA-4 and PD-L1),
    T-cell proliferation and cytokine production were no longer inhibited by anti-CD3 plus
15  B7.1 coated beads. This indicates that B7.1 acts specifically through PD-L1 on the T
    cell in the absence of CD28 and CTLA-4. Similarly, T cells lacking PD-I showed
    decreased proliferation and cytokine production when stimulated in the presence of
    anti-CD3 plus PD-L1 coated beads, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of PD-L1
    ligation on B7.1 on T cells. When T cells lacking all known receptors for PD-L1 (i.e.,
20   no PD-i and B7.1), T cell proliferation was no longer impaired by anti-CD3 plus PD
     Li coated beads. Thus, PD-L1 can exert an inhibitory effect on T cells either through
     B7.1 or PD-1.
     The direct interaction between B7.1 and PD-L1 suggests that the current
     understanding of costimulation is incomplete, and underscores the significance to the
25   expression of these molecules on T cells. Studies of PD-L1 --T cells indicate that
     PD-L1 on T cells can downregulate T cell cytokine production. Latchman et al, Proc.
     NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 10691-96 (2004). Because both PD-L1 and B7.1 are
     expressed on T cells, B cells, DCs and macrophages, there is the potential for
     directional interactions between B7.1 and PD-L1 on these cells types. Additionally,
30   PD-L1 on non-hematopoietic cells may interact with B7.1 as well as PD-1 on T cells,
     raising the question of whether PD-L1 is involved in their regulation. One possible
     explanation for the inhibitory effect of B7.1 : PD-L1 interaction is that T cell PD-L1
     may trap or segregate away APC B7.1 from interaction with CD28.
                                                  6

   As a result, the antagonism of signaling through PD-L 1, including blocking PD-L1
   from interacting with either PD-1, B7.1 or both, thereby preventing PD-L1 from
   sending a negative co- stimulatory signal to T-cells and other antigen presenting
   cells is likely to enhance immunity in response to infection (e.g., acute and chronic)
 5 and tumor immunity. In addition, the anti-PD-L 1 antibodies of the present invention,
   may be combined with antagonists of other components of PD-1 : PD-L1 signaling,
   for example, antagonist anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L2 antibodies.
    In particular, the inhibition of PD-L1 signaling has been proposed as a means to
   enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g., tumor immunity) and
10 infection, including both acute and chronic (e.g., persistent) infection.
   Inhibitors blocking the PD-L1 : PD-1 interaction are known from, i.a.,
   WO2001014557, W02002086083, W02007005874, WO2010036959,
   WO2010077634 and WO2011066389. However, as an optimal therapeutic directed
   to a target in this pathway has yet to be commercialized, a significant unmet medical
15 need exists.

20 Description of the invention
   It is an objective of the present invention to provide for anti-PD-Li antibodies,
   including nucleic acids encoding and compositions containing such antibodies, and
   for their use to enhance T-cell function to upregulate cell-mediated immune
25 responses and for the treatment of T cell dysfunctional disorders, such as tumor
   immunity. Surprisingly, it was found that the anti-PD-Li antibodies according to the
   present invention, which have antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
   activity, directly act on PD-L1 bearing tumor cells by inducing their lysis without
   showing any significant toxicity. Moreover, the antibodies do not only block the
30 interaction between human PD-L1 and human PD-1, but also the interactions
   between the respective mouse and cynomolgus monkey proteins.

10 function, or treatment of a T-cell dysfunctional disorder or cancer.
   In yet a further embodiment, the invention is directed to engineered antibodies, or
   engineered antibody fragments, which are fused directly or via a linker molecule to
   therapeutic agents, such as cytokines (e.g. IL-2, IL-12, TNFa, IFNa, IFNb), or growth
15 factors; which engineered antibodies or engineered antibody fragments may also be
   used in tumor therapy and immune system related diseases. Antibody fusion
   proteins, especially immunocytokines, are well known in the art. The fusion partner
   can be bound to the N-terminus of the antibody or antibody fragment or, preferably,
   to its C-terminus.

   Definitions
   In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
   context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the
25 word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an
   inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude
   the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
   "Dysfunction" in the context of immune dysfunction, refers to a state of immune
30 reduced responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. The term includes the common
   elements of both exhaustion and/or anergy in which antigen recognition may occur,
   but the ensuing immune response is ineffective to control infection or tumor growth.
   "Enhancing T-cell function" means to induce, cause or stimulate a T-cell to have a
35 sustained or amplified biological function, or renew or reactivate exhausted or
   inactive T-cells. Examples of enhancing T-cell function include: increased secretion
   of y-interferon from CD8' T- cells, increased proliferation, increased antigen
   responsiveness (e.g., viral or pathogen clearance) relative to such levels before the
   intervention. In one embodiment, the level of enhancement is as least 50%,
                                               18

        WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
    alternatively 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 120%, 150%, 200%. The manner of
    measuring this enhancement is known to one of ordinary skill in the art.
    A "T cell dysfunctional disorder" is a disorder or condition of T-cells characterized by
 5  decreased responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. In a particular embodiment, a T
    cell dysfunctional disorder is a disorder that is specifically associated with
    inappropriate increased signaling through PD-1. In another embodiment, T -cell
    dysfunctional disorder is one in which T-cells are anergic or have decreased ability to
    secrete cytokines, proliferate, or execute cytolytic activity. In a specific aspect, the
10  decreased responsiveness results in ineffective control of a pathogen or tumor
    expressing an immunogen. Examples of T cell dysfunctional disorders characterized
    by T-cell dysfunction include unresolved acute infection, chronic infection and tumor
    immunity.
15   'Tumor immunity " refers to the process in which tumors evade immune recognition
     and clearance. Thus, as a therapeutic concept, tumor immunity is "treated" when
     such evasion is attenuated, and the tumors are recognized and attacked by the
     immune system. Examples of tumor recognition include tumor binding, tumor
     shrinkage and tumor clearance.
20
     The term "vaccine" as used herein includes any nonpathogenic immunogen that,
     when inoculated into a host, induces protective immunity against a specific pathogen.
     Vaccines can take many forms. Vaccines can be whole organisms that share
     important antigens with the pathogem, but are not pathogenic themselves (e.g.,
25   cowpox). Vaccines can also be prepared from killed (e.g., Salk polio vaccine) or
      attenuated (lost ability to produce disease - e.g., Sabin polio vaccine). Vaccines can
      also be prepared from purified macromolecules isolated from the pathogenic
      organism. For example, toxoid vaccines (e.g. , tetanus and diphtheria) containing the
      inactive form of soluble bacterial toxin - resulting in the production of anti-toxin
 30   antibodies, but not immunity to the intact bacteria. Subunit vaccines (e.g., Hepatitis
      B) contain only a single immunogenic protein isolated from the pathogen of interest.
      Hapten conjugate vaccines attaches certain carbohydrate or polypeptide epitopes
      isolated from the pathogen of interest to immunogenic carriers, such as tetanus
      toxoid. These strategies essentially use the epitopes as haptens to induce antibody
                                                   19

        WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
   production, which then recognize the same epitope in the native pathogen. However,
   to be maximally effective, such vaccines must incorporate both B- and T- cell cell
   epitopes, and the T-cell epitopes must be chosen to ensure that they can be
   recognized, presented and responded to by the immune systems of the host
5  individuals. DNA vaccines exploit the ability of host cells to take up and express DNA
   encoding pathogenic proteins that is injected intramuscularly. Host responses to
    immunogens can be enhanced if administered as a mixture with adjuvants. Immune
    adjuvants function in one or more of the following ways: (1) prolonging retention of
    the immunogen, (2) increased effective size of the immunogen (and hence promoting
10  phagocytosis and presentation to macrophages), (3) stimulating the influx of
    macrophage or other immune cells to the injection site, or (4) promoting local
    cytokine production and other immunologic activities. Example adjuvants include:
    complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), aluminum salts, and mycobacterial derived
     proteins such as muramyl di- or tri-peptides.
15
     The term "antibody " includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies
     which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with polyepitopic
     specificity, multispecific antibodies {e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single
     chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab') 2, and Fv). The term
20   "immunoglobulin" (Ig) is used interchangeably with "antibody" herein. The basic 4
     chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light
     (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the
     basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and
     contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic
25   4-chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination
     with the J chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000
     daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while
     the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending
     on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain
30   disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VH)
     followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the a and y chains and four CH
      domains for p and E isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain
      (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL is aligned with the VH and
      the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1). Particular
                                                   20

   amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and
   heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single
   antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of
   antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties,
5  Abba 1. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994,
   page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to
   one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid
   sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the
   constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to
[0 different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD,
   IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated a, 6, E, y and p, respectively. The
   y and a classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor
   differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following
   subclasses: IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgK1.
15
   An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered
   from a component of its production environment (E.g., natural or recombinant).
    Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free of association with all other components
   from its production environment. Contaminant components of its production
20  environment, such as that resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials
   that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the
    antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non
    proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1)
    to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry
25  method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (1) to a degree
    sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence
    by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under
     non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver
    stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at
30   least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present.
     Ordinarily, however, an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least
     one purification step.

       WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
   The "variable region" or "variable domain" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal
   domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the
   heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as "VH" and 'VL", respectively. These
   domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other
5  antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.
   The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains
   differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen
   binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen.
10 However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the
   variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable
    regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The
    more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions
    (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR
15  regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs,
    which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet
    structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR
    regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the
    antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al, Sequences of Immunological
20  Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The
    constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen,
     but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in
     antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
25   The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a
     population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies
     comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring
     mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that
     may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being
30   directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody
     preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different
     determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single
     determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies
     are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture,
                                                   22

   uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the
   character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous
   population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the
   antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be
5  used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of
   techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein.,

    An "antibody fragment" comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the
     antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of
     antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear
30   antibodies (see U.S. Patent 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al, Protein Eng. 8HO):
     1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies
     formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produced two
     identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, and a residual "Fc"
     fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment
                                                 23

        WO 2013/079174                                                     PCT/EP2012/004822
   consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain
   (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CH1). Each Fab fragment is
   monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site.
   Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab') 2 fragment which roughly
5  corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding
   activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab
   fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CHI
   domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab '-SH is
   the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant
10 domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab') 2 antibody fragments originally were produced
   as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other
   chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
   The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held
    together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by
15  sequences in the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors
    (FcR) found on certain types of cells.
    "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen
    recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and
20  one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the
    folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the
     H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer
     antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain
     (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to
25   recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
     "Single-chain Fv " also abbreviated as "sFv " or "scFv " are antibody fragments that
     comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain.
     Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the
     VH and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen
30   binding. For a review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal
     Antibodies , vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer- Verlag, New York, pp.
     269-315 (1994). "Functional fragments" of the antibodies of the invention comprise a
      portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable
      region of the intact antibody or the
                                                  24

       WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   Fc region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability.
   Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody
   molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
 5 The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing
   sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10) residues)
   between the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of
   the V domains is achieved, thereby resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment
   having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two
10 "crossover' sFv fragments in which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are
   present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described in greater detail in,
   for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; Hollinger et al, Proc. Nati. Acad. ScL USA
    90: 6444-6448 (1993).
15  The term "nanobodies" refers to single-domain antibodies which are antibody
    fragments consisting of a single monomeric variable antibody domain. Like a whole
    antibody, they are able to bind selectively to a specific antigen. With a molecular
    weight of only 12-15 kDa, single-domain antibodies are much smaller than common
    antibodies (150-160 kDa). The first single-domain antibodies were engineered from
20   heavy-chain antibodies found in camelids. Gibbs, W. Wayt (August 2005).

     The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies
     (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with
25   or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular
     species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder
     of the chain(s) is(are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in
     antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or
     subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired
30   biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL
      USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). As used herein, "humanized antibody" is used a subset
     of "chimeric antibodies."

   "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies
   that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one
   embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody)
   in which residues from an HVR (hereinafter defined) of the recipient are replaced by
 5 residues from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat,
   rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity.
    In some instances, framework ("FR") residues of the human immunoglobulin are
    replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies
    may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor
10  antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance,
    such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially
    all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all
    of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin
    sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human
15   immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more
     individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as
     binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid
     substitutions in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain,
     no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a
20   portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human
     immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al, Nature 321 :522-525

     A "human antibody" is an antibody that possesses an amino-acid sequence
      corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made
30    using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This
      definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody
      comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced

   van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol, 5: 368-74 (2001). Human

   has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge,
   but whose endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see,
   e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSETM
   technology). See also, for example, Li et al, Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557

   The term "hypervariable region," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the
    regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or
15  form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the
    VH (H1,   H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1,   L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3
    display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a
    unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al, Immunity
    13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo,
20  ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies
    consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light
    chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448 (1993); Sheriff et al,
     Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).
    A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat
25   Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability
     and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of
     Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.
     Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). Chothia
     refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol.
30   196:901-917 (1987)). The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat
     HVRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM
     antibody modeling software.

    HVRs may comprise "extended HVRs" as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50
    56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and
    93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are
    numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.
20
    The expression "variable-domain residue -numbering as in Kabat" or "amino-acid
    position numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering
    system used for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the
    compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the
25  actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids
    corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable
    domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable domain may include a single amino
    acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted
    residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy-chain
30  FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given
    antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a
    "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.

    "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable-domain residues other than the
    HVR residues as herein defined. A "human consensus framework" or "acceptor
    human framework" is a framework that represents the most commonly occurring
    amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework
 5  sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences
    is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of
    sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
     Interest, 5 th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD
     (1991). Examples include for the VL, the subgroup may be subgroup kappa I, kappa
10   1I,kappa IlIl or kappa IV as in Kabat et al, supra. Additionally, for the VH, the
     subgroup may be subgroup I, subgroup lI, or subgroup IlIl as in Kabat et al., supra.
    Alternatively, a human consensus framework can be derived from the above in which
     particular residues, such as when a human framework residue is selected based on
     its homology to the donor framework by aligning the donor framework sequence with
15   a collection of various human framework sequences. An acceptor human framework
     "derived from" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus
     framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain
     preexisting amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of
     pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or
20    less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less.
     An "amino-acid modification" at a specified position, e.g. of the Fc region, refers to
      the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one
      amino acid residue adjacent the specified residue. Insertion "adjacent" to a specified
25    residue means insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N
      terminal or C-terminal to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification
      herein is a substitution.
      An "affinity-matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
 30    HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen,
       compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one
       embodiment, an affinity-matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities
       for the target antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are produced by procedures known
       in the art. For example, Marks et al, BiolTechnology 10:779-783 (1992) describes
                                                     29

   affinity maturation by VH- and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR
   and/or framework residues is described by, for example: Barbas et al. Proc Nat.
   Acad. ScL USA 91 :3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995);

 5 154(7):3310- 9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).
   As use herein, the term "specifically binds to" or is " specific for" refers to measurable
   and reproducible interactions such as binding between a target and an antibody,
   which is determinative of the presence of the target in the presence of a
10 heterogeneous population of molecules including biological molecules. For example,
   an antibody that specifically binds to a target (which can be an epitope) is an
   antibody that binds this target with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with
   greater duration than it binds to other targets. In one embodiment, the extent of
   binding of an antibody to an unrelated target is less than about 10% of the binding of
15 the antibody to the target as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In
   certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically binds to a target has a
   dissociation constant (KD) Of < 1X10-6M, < 1X10~7M, < 1x10-8M, < 1x10 9M, or < 1x10~
    10M.  In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to an epitope on a protein
   that is conserved among the protein from different species. In another embodiment,
20  specific binding can include, but does not require exclusive binding.
    "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" or ADCC refers to a form of
    cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain
    cytotoxic cells (e.g., natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and macrophages) enable
25  these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and
    subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies "arm" the cytotoxic
    cells and are required for killing of the target cell by this mechanism. The primary
    cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcyRlll only, whereas monocytes
    express FcyRI, FcyRIl and FcyRIll. Fc expression on hematopoietic cells is
30   summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:
     457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC
     assay, such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be
     performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood
     mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally,
                                                   30

   ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal
   model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al, PNAS USA 95:652-656 (1998). Unless
   indicated otherwise herein, the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin
   heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al, supra. The "EU index as in
5  Kabat" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. In many
   cancers the tumor cells express high levels of PD-L1 on their surface. Upon binding
   to PD-L1 on tumor cells and binding with their fragment crystalline (Fc) part to Fc
   gamma receptors (FCGR) on leukocytes, anti-PD-LI antibodies with ADCC potential
    can trigger ADCC which may lead to the death of these tumor cells.
10
    The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an
    immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc
    regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain
    might vary, the human IgG heavy- chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from
15  an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus
    thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system)
    of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of
    the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy
    chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise
20  antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no
     K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies
    with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in
    the antibodies of the invention include human IgG1, IgG2 (IgG2A, IgG2B), IgG3 and
     IgG4. "Fc receptor" or "FcR" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an
25   antibody.The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred
     FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors
     of the FcyRl, FcyRIl, and FcyRll subclasses, including allelic variants and
     alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, FcyRIl receptors include FcyRIIA (an
     "activating receptor") and FcyRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino
30   acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating
     receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif
     (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcyRIlB contains an
     immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain,
     (see M. Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997). FcRs are reviewed in

   (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed
   by the term "FcR" herein.

   The term "Fc receptor" or "FcR" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is
   responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus. Guyer et al, J. Immunol.
    117: 587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24: 249 (1994). Methods of measuring
    binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie and Ward, Immunol. Today 18: (12):
10  592-8 (1997); Ghetie et al, Nature Biotechnology 15 (7): 637-40 (1997); Hinton et al,
    J. Biol. Chem. TJI (8): 6213-6 (2004); WO 2004/92219 (Hinton et al). Binding to FcRn
    in vivo and serum half-life of human FcRn high- affinity binding polypeptides can be
    assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human
    FcRn, or in primates to which the polypeptides having a variant Fc region are
15  administered. WO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants which improved
    or diminished binding to FcRs. See also, e.g., Shields et al, J. Biol. Chem. 9(2):
    6591-6604 (2001).
    "Effector cells" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector
20  functions. In one aspect, the effector cells express at least FcyRll and perform
    ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC
     include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells,
     monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from
     a native source, e.g., blood. Effector cells generally are lymphocytes associated with
25   the effector phase, and function to produce cytokines (helper T cells), killing cells in
     infected with pathogens (cytotoxic T cells) or secreting antibodies (differentiated B
     cells).
     "Binding affinity" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent
30   interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., of an antibody) and its
     binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein,
     "binding affinity", "bind to", "binds to" or "binding to" refers to intrinsic binding affinity
     that reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g. , antibody
      Fab fragment and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can
                                                    32

   generally be represented by the dissociation constant (KD). Affinity can be measured
   by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity
   antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high
   affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A
 5 variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which
   can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary
   embodiments for measuring binding affinity, i.e. binding strength are described in the
   following.
10 The "KD" or "KD value" according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by
   a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the
    antibody and antigen molecule as described by the following assay that measures
    solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal
    concentration of (125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of
15  unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti- Fab antibody-coated
    plate (Chen, et al, (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the
    assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti
    Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently
    blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room
20  temperature (approximately 23 0 C). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100
    pM or 26 pM [12 5 l]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest
    (consistent with assessement of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab- 12, in Presta et al,
    (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight;
    however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to ensure
25  that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture
     plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed
     and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have
     dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (Micro Scint- 20; Packard) is added, and the plates are
     counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of
30   each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use
     in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment, the KD is measured
     by using surface-plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE*-2000 or a
     BIACORE*-3000 instrument (BlAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 250 C with
     immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly,

   carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BlAcore Inc.) are activated with N
   ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N
   hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted
   with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 pg/ml (-0.2 pM) before injection at a flow
 5 rate of 5 pL/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled
   protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block
   unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78
   nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20Tm surfactant (PBST) at
   25 0C at a flow rate of approximately 25 pL/min. Association rates (kon) and
10 dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding
   model (BIAcore* Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the
   association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD)
    is calculated as the ratio ko/ko,. See, e.g., Chen et al, J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881
    (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 106M    -1 s by the surface-plasmon resonance assay
15  above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching
    technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence-emission intensity
    (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25 C of a 20 nM anti
    antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing
    concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow
20  equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO7"
    spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.
    An "on-rate " "rate of association " "association rate " or "kon" according to this
     invention can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE*-2000 or a
     BIACORE*- 3000 system (BlAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 250 C with immobilized
25   antigen CM5 chips at about 10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated
     dextran biosensor ships (CM5, BlAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3
     dimethylamino propyl )-carbodiimide hydrochloride (ECD) and N-hydroxysuccinimide
     (NHS) according to the suppliers instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium
     acetate, ph 4.8, into 5 mg/mI (- 0.2 mM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. to

     injection of antigen, IM ethanolamine is added to block unreacted groups. For
     kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are
      injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 250C at a flow rate of approximately
     25ul/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a

   equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated as the ratio kor/ko. See, e.g.,
   Chen, Y., et al, (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881. However, if the on-rate exceeds 106
5  M- s- by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably
   determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase
   or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340
   nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25 C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS,
   pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a a
10 spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a
   8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (Thermo Sp ectronic) with a stirred
   cuvette.
    The term "functional epitope" as used herein refers to amino acid residues of an
15  antigen that contribute energetically to the binding of an antibody, i.e. forming an
    "energetic epitope". Mutation of any one of the energetically contributing residues of
    the antigen to alanine will disrupt the binding of the antibody such that the relative KD
    ratio (KD mutant PD-L1 / KD wild type PD-L1) of the antibody will be greater than 4
    (see Example 3.x(b)).
20
    The term "conformational epitope" as used herein refers to amino acid residues of
    the PD-L1 antigen that come together on the surface when the polypeptide chain
     folds to form the native protein, and show a significantly reduced rate of HD
     exchange due to Fab binding, as described in the experimental section. The
25   conformation epitope contains, but is not limited to, the functional epitope.
     The phrase "substantially reduced," or "substantially different," as used herein,
     denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values
     (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a
30    reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the
     difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context
      of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., KD values). The
      difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater
                                                 35

    than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater
    than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.
    The term "substantially similar" or "substantially the same," as used herein, denotes
 5   a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one
     associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a
     reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the
     difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical
     significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said
10   values {e.g., KD values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less
     than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%,
     and/or less than about 10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.
      "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" and "homology" with respect to a
15    peptide, polypeptide or antibody sequence are defined as the percentage of amino
      acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues
      in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and
      introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity,
      and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.
20    Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be
      achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly
      available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2 or ALIGN software. Those
      skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment,
      including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of
25    the sequences being compared.
      A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist" antibody is one that inhibits or reduces a
       biological activity of the antigen it binds to. In some embodiments, blocking
       antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological
 30    activity of the antigen. The anti-PD-L1 antibodies of the invention block the
       interaction between PD-LI and its receptor PD-1, and thus the signaling through PD
       1 so as to restore a functional response by T-cells from a dysfunctional state to
       antigen stimulation. An "agonist" or activating antibody is one that enhances or
                                                     36

       WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
   initiates signaling by the antigen to which it binds. In some embodiments, agonist
   antibodies cause or activate signaling without the presence of the natural ligand.
   The terms "cross-compete", "cross-competition", "cross-block", "cross-blocked" and
5  "cross-blocking" are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an antibody
   or fragment thereof to interfere with the binding directly or indirectly through allosteric
   modulation of the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the invention to the target human PD-L1.
   The extent to which an an antibody or fragment thereof is able to interfere with the
    binding of another to the target, and therefore whether it can be said to cross-block
10  or cross-compete according to the invention, can be determined using competition
    binding assays. One particularly suitable quantitative cross-competition assay uses a
    FACS- or an AlphaScreen-based approach to measure competition between the
    labelled (e.g. His tagged, biotinylated or radioactive labelled) an antibody or fragment
    thereof and the other an antibody or fragment thereof in terms of their binding to the
15  target. In the Experimental Section a suitable assay is described for determining
    whether a binding molecule cross-competes or is capable of cross-competing with an
    antibody or fragment thereof. In general, a cross-competing antibody or fragment
    thereof is for example one which will bind to the target in the cross-competition assay
    such that, during the assay and in the presence of a second antibody or fragment
20  thereof, the recorded displacement of the immunoglobulin single variable domain or
     polypeptide according to the invention is up to 100% (e.g. in FACS based
     competition assay) of the maximum theoretical displacement (e.g. displacement by
     cold (e.g. unlabeled) antibody or fragment thereof that needs to be cross-blocked)
     by the to be tested potentially cross-blocking antibody or fragment thereof that is
25   present in a given amount. Preferably, cross-competing antibodies or fragments
     thereof have a recorded displacement that is between 10% and 100%, more
     preferred between 50% to 100%.
     An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule encoding the antibodies herein is a nucleic acid
30    molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid
      molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was
      produced. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all
      components associated with the production environment. The isolated nucleic acid
      molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein is in a form other than in
                                                  37

       WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
   the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules
   therefore are distinguished from nucleic acid encoding the polypeptides and
   antibodies herein existing naturally in cells.
 5 The term "control sequences" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression
   of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control
   sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter,
    optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are
    known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. Nucleic acid is
10  "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic
    acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably
    linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in
    the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a
    coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding
15  site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate
    translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked
    are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading
    phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished
    by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic
20  oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional
    A "stable" formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its
     physical and chemical stability and integrity upon storage. Various analytical
     techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are reviewed in
     Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
25   New York, New York, Pubs. (1991) and Jones, A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 10: 29-90
     (1993). Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time
     period. For rapid screening, the formulation may be kept at 400C for 2 weeks to 1
     month, at which time stability is measured. Where the formulation is to be stored at
     2-8 0C, generally the formulation should be stable at 30(C or 400C for at least 1 month
30   and/or stable at 2-8*C for at least 2 years. Where the formulation is to be stored at
     300C, generally the formulation should be stable for at least 2 years at 300C and/or
     stable at 40 0C for at least 6 months. For example, the extent of aggregation during
      storage can be used as an indicator of protein stability. Thus, a "stable" formulation
      may be one wherein less than about 10% and preferably less than about 5% of the
                                                  38

        WO 2013/079174                                                     PCT/EP2012/004822
   protein are present as an aggregate in the formulation. In other embodiments, any
   increase in aggregate formation during storage of the formulation can be determined.
   A "reconstituted" formulation is one which has been prepared by dissolving a
 5  lyophilized protein or antibody formulation in a diluent such that the protein is
   dispersed throughout. The reconstituted formulation is suitable for administration
    (e.g. subscutaneous administration) to a patient to be treated with the protein of
    interest and, in certain embodiments of the invention, may be one which is suitable
   for parenteral or intravenous administration.

    An "isotonic" formulation is one which has essentially the same osmotic pressure as
    human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from
    about 250 to 350 mOsm. The term "hypotonic" describes a formulation with an
    osmotic pressure below that of human blood. Correspondingly, the term "hypertonic"
15   is used to describe a formulation with an osmotic pressure above that of human
     blood. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type
     osmometer, for example. The formulations of the present invention are hypertonic as
     a result of the addition of salt and/or buffer. "Carriers" as used herein include
     pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers that are nontoxic to
20   the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations
     employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered
     solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as
     phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low
     molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum
25   albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as
      polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or
      lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose,
      mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as
      mannitol or sorbitol; salt- forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic

   "Pharmaceutically-acceptable bases" include inorganic and organic bases which are
    non-toxic at the concentration and manner in which they are formulated. For
    example, suitable bases include those formed from inorganic base forming metals
    such as lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, iron, zinc,
20  copper, manganese, aluminum, N- methylglucamine, morpholine, piperidine and
    organic nontoxic bases including, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted
    amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, [e.g., N(R')4 + (where R' is

     polyamine resins and the like. Particularly preferred organic non-toxic bases are
     isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethamine, dicyclohexylamine,
30   choline, and caffeine. Additional pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases
     useable with the present invention include those which are derived from the amino
     acids, for example, histidine, glycine, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid,
     lysine and asparagine.

   "Pharmaceutically acceptable" buffers and salts include those derived from both acid
   and base addition salts of the above indicated acids and bases. Specific buffers and/
   or salts include histidine, succinate and acetate.
 5 A "pharmaceutically acceptable sugar" is a molecule which, when combined with a
   protein of interest, significantly prevents or reduces chemical and/or physical
   instability of the protein upon storage. When the formulation is intended to be
   lyophilized and then reconstituted, "pharmaceutically acceptable sugars" may also be
   known as a "lyoprotectant". Exemplary sugars and their corresponding sugar
10 alcohols include: an amino acid such as monosodium glutamate or histidine; a
    methylamine such as betaine; a lyotropic salt such as magnesium sulfate; a polyol
   such as trihydric or higher molecular weight sugar alcohols, e.g. glycerin, dextran,
    erythritol, glycerol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol; propylene glycol;
    polyethylene glycol; PLURONICS*; and combinations thereof. Additional exemplary
15  lyoprotectants include glycerin and gelatin, and the sugars mellibiose, melezitose,
    raffmose, mannotriose and stachyose. Examples of reducing sugars include glucose,
    maltose, lactose, maltulose, iso-maltulose and lactulose. Examples of non-reducing
    sugars include non-reducing glycosides of polyhydroxy compounds selected from
    sugar alcohols and other straight chain polyalcohols. Preferred sugar alcohols are
20  monoglycosides, especially those compounds obtained by reduction of disaccharides
    such as lactose, maltose, lactulose and maltulose. The glycosidic side group can be
    either glucosidic or galactosidic. Additional examples of sugar alcohols are glucitol,
    maltitol, lactitol and iso-maltulose. The preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable sugars
    are the non-reducing sugars trehalose or sucrose. Pharmaceutically acceptable
25  sugars are added to the formulation in a "protecting amount" (e.g. pre-lyophilization)
    which means that the protein essentially retains its physical and chemical stability
    and integrity during storage (e.g., after reconstitution and storage).
    The "diluent" of interest herein is one which is pharmaceutically acceptable (safe and
30   non-toxic for administration to a human) and is useful for the preparation of a liquid
     formulation, such as a formulation reconstituted after lyophilization. Exemplary
     diluents include sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered
     solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or
                                                     41

   dextrose solution. In an alternative embodiment, diluents can include aqueous
   solutions of salts and/or buffers.
   A "preservative" is a compound which can be added to the formulations herein to
5  reduce bacterial activity. The addition of a preservative may, for example, facilitate
   the production of a multi-use (multiple-dose) formulation. Examples of potential
   preservatives include octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium
   chloride, benzalkonium chloride (a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium
   chlorides in which the alkyl groups are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium
10 chloride. Other types of preservatives include aromatic alcohols such as phenol,
    butyl and benzyl alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, catechol,
    resorcinol, cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and w-cresol. The most preferred preservative
    herein is benzyl alcohol.
15  "Treatment' refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the
    individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during
    the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing
    occurrence or recurrence of disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of
    disease progression, ameliorating or palliating the disease state, and remission or
20   improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to
     delay development of a disease or disorder. A subject is successfully "treated", for
     example, using the apoptotic anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention if one or more
     symptoms associated with a T-cell dysfunctional disorder is mitigated.
     An "effective amount' refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for
25   periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired or indicated effect, including a
     therapeutic or prophylactic result. For example, an effective amount of the anti-PD-L1
     antibodies of the present invention is at least the minimum concentration that results
      in inhibition of signaling from PD-L1, either through PD-1 on T-cells or B7.1 on other
     APCs or both.
30
     A "therapeutically effective amount' is at least the minimum concentration required to
      effect a measurable improvement or prevention of a particular disorder. A
      therapeutically effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the
      disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the antibody to
                                                  42

   elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also
   one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody are outweighed by the
   therapeutically beneficial effects. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of
   the anti-PD-L1 antibodies of the present invention is at least the minimum
5  concentration that results in inhibition of at least one symptom of a T cell
   dysfunctional disorder.
   A "prophylactically effective amount' refers to an amount effective, at the dosages
    and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. For
10  example, a prophylactically effective amount of the anti-PD-Li antibodies of the
    present invention is at least the minimum concentration that prevents or attenuates
    the development of at least one symptom of a T cell dysfunctional disorder.
    "Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal,
15  including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such
    as dogs, horses, rabbits, cattle, pigs, hamsters, gerbils, mice, ferrets, rats, cats, etc.
     Preferably, the mammal is human.
     The term "'pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation that is in such form as
20   to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective, and that
     contains no additional components that are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which
     the formulation would be administered. Such formulations are sterile.
     A "sterile" formulation is aseptic or free from all living microorganisms and their
25   spores.
      The term "about' as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective
      value readily known to the skilled person in this technical field.
30    An "autoimmune disorder' is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against
      an individual's own tissues or organs or a co-segregation or manifestation thereof or
      resulting condition therefrom. Autoimmune diseases can be an organ-specific
      disease (i.e., the immune response is specifically directed against an organ system
      such as the endocrine system, the hematopoietic system, the skin, the
                                                   43

   Experimental Section
15  The working examples presented below are intended to illustrate particular
    embodiments of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the
    specification or the claims in any way.
    1. Selection and Improvement of Antibodies
20
    Antibodies were selected from phage Fab display libraries. The selection included
    two different arms one utilizing biotinylated human PD-L1 on the different selection
    rounds and other alternating human and mouse PD-Li as target on different rounds.
    3840 clones were screened by ELISA to identify 170 individual PD-L1 binders. Based
25  on the inhibition of PD-1 ligand binding, 48 hits were selected and were expressed in
     medium scale for further characterization.
     The selected hits were reformatted and expressed as IgGs. Hit optimization
     candidates were selected based on the potency to block binding of PD-i to PD-L1
     and the ability of binding to both human and mouse versions of PD-L1. Binding to
30   PD-Li was originally determined by ELISA and later quantified by Biacore and
     binding to PD-L1 expressing cells by FACS. Four candidates fitted the predefined
     profile, including A09-188-1 which contained a lambda light chain.
     A09-188-1 was chosen for affinity maturation and sequence optimization. The goals
     of the affinity maturation were increased affinity to the human target, cross-reactivity
                                                48

   to the murine target, and improvement of manufacturability. Heavy chain mutations in
   the HVR's were introduced by codon based randomization. This heavy chain
   diversity was combined with light chain diversity introduced by light chain shuffling to
   generate the affinity maturation library. Further heavy and light chain FR and HVR
 5 residues were mutated to increase stability of the antibody and introduce amino acids
   found in the germline, such as the heavy chain FR mutation 193V.
   This yielded the HVR sequences given below. It could be shown that at least the
    residues X1-X   17 are variable in terms of target binding and have preferred meanings
    as herein disclosed.

     2. Manufacturing, Purification and Formulation
     2.1 Bioproduction and Clarification
     Antibody A09-246-2 corresponding to SEQ ID NO:32 (heavy chain) and SEQ ID
25    NO:33 (light chain), was expressed from CHO-S cells transfected with the KOL
      isotype DNA sequence and sequence-optimized EU version, respectively. Cell
      cultures were conducted in batch mode in a 250L Single-use-Bioreactor (SUB)
      (Table 2-2). Cells were grown in ProCHO5 growth media supplemented with 4 mM L
      Glutamine + 25 pg/mL puromycin at 37 *C. The cultures were fed with 15% Efficient
30    Feed B and 1.0 mM valproic acid 3 days after inoculation.
      Crude conditioned media from the bioreactor runs were clarified using 1.1 m2
      Millistak+ Pod DOHC (Millipore MDOHC1OFS1) and 0.11 m2 Millistak+ Pod A1HC
      (Millipore MA1HC01FS1) filters, followed by terminal filtration with a Sartopore 2 filter
      (Sartorius 5445307H8-SS).

   2.2 Purification
   The purification process consisted of two chromatography steps; (a) MabSelect
   Protein A to capture the antibody from the clarified harvest, and (b) Hydroxyapatite
   Type I polish step to remove remaining aggregated product, host cell proteins and
5  DNA, and product related impurities. An intermediate Q-filtration step was inserted
   between the 2 chromatography steps to further reduce DNA. SDS-PAGE and size
   exclusion chromatography SE-HPLC were used to analyze in-process samples
   during purification. Protein content of the Mabselect in-process samples was
   performed using the Protein A HPLC method while UVNis spectroscopy was used
10 for all other process steps.
   Post Mabselect eluates were subjected to 30 min of low pH viral inactivation (pH 3.7)
   and subsequently neutralized to pH 7.0 prior to the next purification step.
   The final polishing step was the hydroxyapatite Type Il chromatography. The
    conductivity of the Sartobind Q filtrate was adjusted to < 3 mS/cm with water, and pH
15  reduced to 6.5 with acetic acid before sample loading.
    Bound anti-PD-L1 product was eluted with a NaCl step gradient. Aggregated
    product-related impurities was eluted with the Strip Buffer.
    2.3 Formulation, Ultrafiltration and Diafiltration
20   Purified anti-PDL1 from the hydroxyapatite polishing step were concentrated and
    then diafiltered into their respective buffers according to the Table below. The bulk
     products were then sterile-filtered through 0.2 t filter units and further diluted with
     formulation buffer to their final concentrations. Formulated bulk substance were
     further tested for endotoxin and checked by SE-HPLC.

 5 3.2 Selectivity
   Selectivity was determined by evaluating the binding to members of the B7 family
   including hu-PD- L1-huFc, hu-PDL-2-huFc, hu-B7.1-huFc, hu-B7.2-huFc, huB7-H2
   huFc and huB7-H3-huFc by Biacore.
   All the anti-huPD-L1 MAb tested including A09-246-2 reacted specifically with only
10  huPD-L1 protein and not with any other B7 Family proteins.
    3.3 PD-L1 : PD-1 Interaction Blocking
    The ability of A09-246-2 and a control antibody to compete with the binding of radio
    labelled PD-L1 to immobilized PD-1 was determined by radioactive competitive
15  displacement assay. Figure 1 shows representative competition curves for the test
    antibodies. The results demonstrated that A09-246-2 efficiently blocks the interaction
    of PD-1 and PD-L1 with an IC50 of 0.071  0.008 nM (0.01  0.001 pg/ml).
    The follow assay protocol was used:
20
     1. Add 60 ml/well of PBS, containing 1 mg/ml of human PD-1Fc (R&D Systems,
     1086-PD; lyophilized PD-i dissolved with PBS at 200 mg/ml) to white Costar plates
     (Corning 3922). Incubate overnight at 4 *C.
     2. Rinse wells 1 time with PBS.
25   3. Block wells with 120 ml of 0.5% BSA (Sigma A-3059) dissolved in binding buffer,
    for 1 h at room temperature (RT).
     4. Rinse wells Ix with binding buffer.
     5. Add 50 ml of test sample to wells (antibody, supernatant). Dilute antibodies to 20
     nM in assay buffer and serial dilute 9x at a 1:4 dilution. Samples are diluted to 2x
30   final concentration, prior to adding to the wells (usually starting at 10 nM - 1x
     concentration).

   6. Nonspecific binding: add 50 ml of PD-LI/Fc (R&D Systems, 156-B7) at a final
   concentration of 250 nM in place of the test sample at a 500 fold excess to the
   labeled PD-Li. Total wells receive the same volume of assay buffer.
                              1251-PD-L1 (custom labeled at Perkin Elmer, lot number
   7. Add 50 ml of 0.5 nM
5  CIS32211, 250 nM, 2400 Ci/mmol) to each well. Dilute to 2x the final concentration in
   assay buffer - final concentration = 0.25 nM.
   8. Shake the plate for 2-2.5 h at 37 *C.
   9. Wash the wells 5 times with cold binding buffer.
    10. Add 100 ml of Microscint 20 (Packard 6013641) to each well. Incubate for at least
10 one h at RT.
    11. Count luminescence on Topcount (125 1-Microscint protocol).
    Binding Buffer: 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 130 mM NaCl, 5.1 mM KCI, 1.3 mM MgSO 4
    Assay buffer: binding buffer + 0.5% BSA

    3.4 PD-L1 : B7.1 Interaction Blocking
    The ability of A09-246-2 to block soluble B7.1 binding to PD-L1 on cell surface was
    measured by FACS. Results indicated A09-246-2 efficiently blocks the interaction of
    B7.1 and PD-L1 with an IC50 of 0.2  0.004nM (0.03  0.0006 pig/ml).
20
    3.5 Epitope Mapping
     a) Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange
    The extracellular domain of PD-L1 antigen (SEQ ID NO:29) was incubated in heavy
    water (D20) solution to allow amide protons on the protein backbone to exchange
25   with deuterons from the solvent, in either the presence or absence of excess anti
     PD-L1 Fab or a non-specific Fab. The samples were digested with protease and
     analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to determine the
     level of deuteration in each peptide.
30   The Fab corresponding to A09-246-2 was used instead of the full IgG in order to
     simplify the mass spectrometry analysis by decreasing the number of peptides
     generated by protease digestion. Despite this, some regions remained that could not
     be identified and analyzed (underlined, italicized sequence portions in Figure 2),
                                                 55

       WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   however these regions represent a small fraction of the sequence, and mostly reside
   in the second immunoglobulin domain, distant from the epitope containing region.
   Residues 32-39 in domain I of the extracellular domain were also resistant to
   identification by mass spectrometry and encompass the site of an N-linked
 5 glycosylation; as A09-246-2 is known to bind an aglycosylated version of PD-L1
   produced in E coli, the inability to analyze this peptide for HD exchange rates was
   not of concern.
   Several peptides from antigen were observed to have a significantly reduced rate of
   exchange of protons for deuterons in the presence of Fab than in its absence,
10 suggesting that at least some residues from these peptides are in direct contact with
   the Fab and constitute a conformational epitope (Figure 2). Although the two
    peptides showing protection from solvent are far apart in the primary sequence
    (underlined, bold print in Figure 2, they are proximal in the three-dimensional
    structure of PD-L1 and constitute each a single binding patch on the surface of the
15  antigen (see Figure 3).
    In summary, HD exchange identified two peptides
         (i) residues 36-48 in Figure 2 (extracellular domain plus His tag, SEQ ID NO:29),
                 corresponding to residues 54-66 of the full length sequence (SEQ ID
                 NO:28)
20       (ii) residues 94-104 in Figure 2 (SEQ ID NO:29), corresponding to residues 112
                  122 SEQ ID NO:28
    that form a conformational epitope on PD-L1 and that contains the functional epitope
    of A09-246-2.
25  b) Mutagenesis
    To obtain a finer, residue-level mapping of the epitope and to complement the HD
     exchange data, molecular modelling and manual inspection of the crystal structure of
     PD-L1 (Lin, D.Y.-W. et al. PNAS 105, 3011-6 (2008; PDB record 3BIK) was used to
     select solvent exposed residues within and around the epitope identified by HD
30   exchange. The selected residues were mutated either to alanine (large to small) or to
     another, potentially more disruptive amino acid (small to large).
     In total, 48 point mutants were designed, expressed and purified from HEK cells, and
     tested for binding to A09-246-2 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding
     hotspots, or residues that contribute most to the binding energy (Wells. J.A., PNAS
                                                56

        WO 2013/079174                                                     PCT/EP2012/004822
   93, 1-6, 1996), were identified as those that did not meet a threshold binding signal
   at 100 nM antigen. Furthermore, the affinity of the antibody for wild-type and each
   mutant was determined and used to calculate the contribution of each epitope
   residue to the binding energy.
5
   The results are summarized in the table below, where 48 point mutants of PD-L1
   were compared to wild-type PD-LI antigen for antibody binding. SPR (Biacore) was
   used to perform a kinetic study allowing determination of kinetic rate constants (ka
   and kd). Briefly, goat polyclonal anti-human Fc antibody was chemically coupled to a
O  CM5 chip. Al 1-128 was injected next and captured by the polyclonal. Buffer was
    used to wash out unbound antibody until the baseline RU stabilized. Antigen (wild
    type or mutant PD-L1) was next injected at a fixed concentration for 3 minutes and
    the association was recorded. Buffer was injected for a further 3 minutes and
    dissociation was observed. The antigens were injected at concentrations of 100 nM,
15  50 nM, 25 nM, 12.5 nM and 6.25 nM (except for Y56 and D61 mutants, which were
    injected at 1 uM, 500 nM, 250 nM, 125 nM and 62.5 nM). Between each cycle, the
    chip was regenerated with low pH buffer and fresh A09-246-2 was captured prior to
     injecting the next concentration of antigen.The rate constants were determined by
     iterative fitting of the data to a 1:1 binding model by an algorithm that minimizes Chi
20   squared. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated as the ratio of the
     kinetic constants and the change in the Gibbs free energy of binding of mutant
     relative to wild-type PD-LI (AAGmut) was derived from the ratio of the wild-type and
     mutant KDS. The free energy changes are highlighted according to destabilization of
     antibody-antigen binding; "**": >3 kcal/mol destabilization (binding hotspots); "*":>
25   0.7 kcal/mol. Mutants at Y56 had such a low affinity that the KD could be accurately
      measured and the minimum KD is given instead. For D61A no binding could be
     found. According to this analysis, amino acids marked with "*" or"* are part of the
      functional epitope. The temperature midpoint of fluorescently monitored thermal
      denaturation is given for the wild type and mutant proteins. ND: Not Determined; BP:
30    Biphasic. The qualitative appearance of the wild type and mutant proteins on size
      exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also given. M: monodisperse and the same
      elution volume as wild type; MIT: peak at the same elution volume as wild type but
      with an additional tail. For KD and T 12, the mean and standard deviation is given
      where n > 1.

   It was important to confirm that the lack of binding to A09-246-2 of the Y56A, Y56K
   and D61A point mutants was indeed due to loss of hotspot residues and not to global
   unfolding of the antigen. The structural integrity of the mutated proteins was
 5 confirmed using a fluorescence monitored thermal unfolding assay in which the
   protein is incubated with a dye that is quenched in aqueous solution but fluoresces
   when bound by exposed hydrophobic residues. As the temperature increases,
   thermal denaturation of the protein exposes the hydrophobic core residues and this
   can be monitored by an increase in fluorescence of the dye. Mutants of Y56 or D61
10 all display a two state transition similar to wild-type PD-L1, indicating a folded
   structure at room temperature. The data were fit to equation 1 (adapted from Bullock,
   A. N. et al. Thermodynamic stability of wild-type and mutant p53 core domain. PNAS
    94, 14338-14342 (1997)) to determine the temperature at the inflection point of the
    curve (T1,2).
15  Equation 1:
         tFi + #i * T + ((Fmax +         max * T) * e=***rTIZ))
    F =                       1 + eE"*(T-rzP l
    Mutants of Y56 and D61 displayed minimal destabilization of the antigen indicated by
    a small decrease in the T1;2 of fluorescence monitored unfolding (table above). This
20  confirms that Y56 and D61 are true binding hotspots for A09-246-2. The structural
    integrity of most of the other mutant proteins was also confirmed by this method
    (table above). The observation that most mutant proteins behaved similarly to wild
    type on analytical size exclusion chromatography (last column in the above table)
    provides further support for native structure of mutant antigen proteins.

   3.6 Binding to Tumor Cells and Primary Cells
   The binding of A09-246-2 to PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells as well as on
   primary human and experimental animal cells was confirmed by a FACS assay. A09
   246-2 demonstrated reactivity to human PD-L1 on all seven tested human tumor
5  lines (A431, epithelial carcinoma cell line; A549, lung adenocarcinoma epithelial
   cells; BxPC3, pancreatic cancer cells; HCT1 16, colorectal carcinoma; M24,
   melanoma cell lines; PC3mm2, prostate cancer cell line; U-87 MG, glioblastoma
   astrocytoma) of which PD-L1 was up-regulated by interferon treatment to enable
   detection. Because primary PBMC have low levels of PD-L1 expression which is
0  difficult to be detected, human PBMC or PBMC from dog, rabbit and rat were all
   subjected to PHA stimulation for 2 days. A09-246-2 demonstrated reactivity to PD-L1
    on human and animal primary cells.
    3.7 EC50 Measured by Direct FACS Binding Assay
15  The dose dependent binding ability of A09-246-2 to the target on the cell surface was
    confirmed by FACS. A09-246-2 efficiently binds to human PD-L1 expressed on the
    HEK cell surface with an EC50 of 0.3  0.02nM (0.04  0.003 pig/ml); to cynomolgus
    monkey expressed on the HEK cell surface with an EC50 of 0.94  0.015nM (0.14 
     0.002 pg/ml); to mouse PD-L1 expressed on the HEK293 cell surface with an EC50
20   of 0.34  0.08 nM (0.05  0.012 pg/ml) and mouse PD-L1 expressed on the EL4 cell
     surface with an EC50 of 0.91  0.21 nM (0.13  0.03 jg/ml). The assays qualitatively
     described the dose dependent binding characteristics of anti-PD-LI.
     3.8 Activity in cellular assays
25   Currently there is no scientific evidence that the engagement of PD-L1 with it ligands
     transduces stimulatory signalling through PD-L1 into the PD-LI expressing cells,
     therefore the developed assays employed T cell activation in the procedures. The
     ability of anti-PD-LI antibody to enhance T cell immuno-responses was measured in
     vitro in cellular assays using murine T cells or human PBMC.
30
     a)       OT-1 Assay
     Antigen-specific CD8 T cells were generated by stimulating splenocytes from OT-1
     transgenic mice with Ova peptide SIINFEKL and cyropreserved. mPD-L1 over
                                                 60

        WO 2013/079174                                                     PCT/EP2012/004822
   expressing EL4 cells were used as antigen presenting cells. Serial dilutions of tested
   compounds were incubated with thawed OT-1 T cells and SIINFEKL-loaded APC for
   48 hours. IFN-y in the supernatant was measured using mIFN-y ELISA. Anti-PD-L1
   (A09-246-2) efficiently enhanced T cell activities represented by IFN-y production
5  with an EC50 of 0.28  0.1 nM (0.04  0.015 ptg/ml)
   b)       SEA Assay
   During the human PBMC assay development, it could be demonstrated that only
   anti-PD-Li treatment did not trigger IL-2 or IFN-y production in the absence of T cell
10 activation and did not enhance IL-2 production in the presence of optimal activation
   either. The ability of anti-PD-L1 to enhance IL-2 production by T cells responding to
    super antigen activation was assessed. Super antigen such as Staphylococcal
    enterotoxin A (SEA) is able to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC class II to
    activate CD4 T cells. The dose dependent activity of A09-246-2 to enhance T cell
15  functions was assessed upon such activation. Serial dilutions of A09-246-2 were
    incubated with human PBMC in the presence of SEA for 96 hours. Human IL-2 in the
    supernatant was measured using human IL-2 ELISA. Results indicated anti-PD-Li
    efficiently enhanced T cell activities represented by IL-2 production with an EC50 of
     0.08 0.03 nM (0.012  0.005 pg/ml)
20
     3.9 Antibody dependent cell-mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
    ADCC was measured utilizing two different human tumor lines A431 and A549 as
     target cells and human PBMC as effector cells. In some cases, tests were performed
     using target cells following stimulation with Interferon-gamma to increase the
25   expression of PD-L1. The anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab, was used as an ADCC
     positive control. Given the fact that the FcylIla receptor 158V allotype displays a
     higher affinity for human IgG1 and increases ADCC, the observed results were
     correlated with the donors allotype.
     ADCC activity of A09-246-2 was comparable to that mediated with the anti-EGFR
30   antibody cetuximab, inducing approximately 50% of maximum lysis in both cell lines.
      INF-y treatment did not alter the response of A431 cells for all the different allotypes
     tested (VN, V/F and F/F). A significant difference (almost twice) between stimulated
      and not stimulated cells was observed when A549 cells were employed for PBMC
                                                 61

        WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   from V/V and V/F donors. No ADCC was observed when PBMC from F/F donors
   were analyzed with A549 cells.
   4. In vivo Activity
5
    In the studies presented here, the efficacy of PD-L1 antibody (Ab) blockade against
   various murine tumor models was investigated. Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1
    interaction is proposed to exert a therapeutic effect by restoring anti-tumor CD8* T
    cell responses, thus all of the preclinical efficacy studies were conducted in
O   syngeneic murine tumor models in which the immune system of the host is fully
    intact. To circumvent the need for a surrogate antibody, the the antibody used in the
    studies was specifically selected for cross-reactivity to murine PD-L1. However,
    because the antibody is fully human, neutralizing immunogenicity is elicited in mice,
    which limits the effective dosing window to a seven day period. Despite this
15  significant dosing limitation, the selected antibody has demonstrated significant
     activity as a monotherapy and in various combination therapy settings. The anti
    tumor activity of the anti-PD-Li antibody demonstrated a dose-dependent trend
     when given as a monotherapy against MC38 tumors.
     Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression within responsive and non
20   responsive tumor models revealed a strong link between the level of PD-L1
     expression and the level of anti-tumor efficacy. To confirm the proposed mechanism
     of action (MOA), a study was conducted in MC38 tumor bearing mice that were
     systemically depleted of CD8* T cells. In animals depleted of CD8' T cells, the
     efficacy of anti-PD-Li therapy was completely abrogated, confirming that cytotoxic T
25   lymphocyte (CTL) effector function is responsible for the inhibition of tumor growth.
     To evaluate the combination potential of anti-PD-Li therapy, combination partners
     were selected known to elicit anti-tumor T cell responses or otherwise enhance the
     effects of immunotherapy. In combination with fractionated radiotherapy against
      MC38 tumors, the anti-PD-Li antibody showed strong synergistic activity, with
30    curative potential. Combination with a single low-dose of cyclophosphamide resulted
      in enhanced anti-tumor effects in the MC-38 model that were associated with an
      increased frequency of tumor-antigen specific CD8* T cells. Anti-PD-Li therapy
      significantly extended survival time when combined with Gemcitabine in the PANCO2
      orthotopic tumor model of pancreatic cancer. When anti-PD-L1 was combined with
                                                 62

        WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
   cyclophosphamide pre-treatment followed by vaccination with Stimuvax, a significant
   increase in tumor growth inhibition was achieved in both the MC38/MUC1 and
   PANC02/MUC1 tumor models. Significantly enhanced efficacy was also observed
   when the anti-PD-LI antibody was combined with the core components of the
5  FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen. Thus, several promising combination approaches
   for anti-PD-LI therapy were successfully identified, including three "standard of care"
   treatment regimens (radiation therapy; FOLFOX; Gemcitabine).
   Mechanistic data derived from these studies demonstrated that anti-PD-Li therapy is
   consistently associated with increased percentages of CD8' T cells, CD8' T effector
10  memory cells, and PD-1*CD8* T cells in the spleens and tumors of treated mice.
    4.1 Dose-response in MC38 tumor model and combination with CPA
                                                                                        6
    In this study, mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 1x10 MC38
                                                                                  3
    colon carcinoma cells. When tumors reached a mean volume of -50 mm , mice were
15  sorted into treatment groups (N=14) (defined as study day 0). Groups were
    administered A09-246-2 intravenously at dose levels of 100, 200, 400, or 800 pg on
    days 0, 3, and 6. A control group was treated with 200 pg of an inactive isotype
    antibody. Tumors were measured twice weekly for the study duration. All treatment
    groups demonstrated significant efficacy (P <0.050) when compared to the isotype
20  control group. Although the 800 pg dose group did not show enhanced efficacy over
    the 400 pg group, a significant trend toward a dose-dependent effect was observed.
     In a second dose-response study that followed the same design, a general trend
    toward dose-dependent activity was again observed. However, the 800 pg dose
     group in that particular study showed significantly lower anti-tumor activity than did
25   the 400 pg dose group. The lack of increased efficacy at doses above 400 pg may
     indicate an efficacy plateau as a result of target saturation, or a stronger
     immunogenic effect may occur at higher doses, resulting in lower drug exposure.
     Additionally, these studies explored the efficacy of anti-PD-LI in combination with.
     pre-treatment with a low, immunomodulatory dose of cyclophosphamide (CPA). The
30   CPA combination was observed to significantly improve the efficacy of low doses of
     anti-PD-LI (100 pg), and this effect was associated with increased frequencies of
      p15E tumor antigen-specific CD8' T cells as determined by ELISPOT.
      Immunophenotyping data from these studies revealed that anti-PD-Li therapy is
      associated with significantly increased percentages of various CD8' T cell subsets in
                                                  63

        WO 2013/079174                                                      PCT/EP2012/004822
   spleens: total CD8' T cells, p15E tumor antigen-specific CD8' T cells, PD-1*CD8* T
   cells, and CD8* T effector memory (TEM) and CD8+ T central memory (TcM) cells.
   Increased intratumoral accumulation of CD8' T cells and CD8* TEM cells was also
   observed. These observations support htat anti-PD-L1 therapy as an effective
5  strategy for driving anti-tumor CD8' T cell responses.
   4.2 Efficacy in C1498/GFP disseminated leukemia model
   To create the disseminated leukemia model, C4198-GFP leukemia cells (2x1 04) were
   injected i.v. into C57BL/6 mice on day 0. Mice were then randomized into treatment
10 groups (N=5) that received either a 400 pg dose of anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) or an
   equivalent dose of an inactive isotype antibody on days 1, 4, and 7 by i.p. injection.
   The primary endpoint of this study was survival based on the onset of clinical signs,
    indicative of metastatic dissemination, which warranted euthanasia. At the end of the
    study (day 76), 20% of mice (1/5) were still alive in the isotype antibody treated
15  group, and 80% (4/5) survivors remained in the A09-246-2 treated group.
    4.3 Combination with Gemcitabine in the PANCO2 orthotopic model
    Three separate studies were conducted to investigate the combination of the anti
     PD-L1 MAb (A09-246-2) and Gemcitabine (GEM). The studies were designed to
20  explore the positioning of anti-PD-L1 therapy within the chemotherapy "holiday"
     period of a 21 day or 28 day cycle of GEM. Orthotopic models involve the inoculation
     of tumor cells into the organ of origin, resulting in a close recapitulation of disease
     progression as it occurs in the human setting. To create a model of pancreatic
     adenocarcinoma, PANCO2 cells (1x10 6) were injected into the pancreas of C57BL/6
25   female mice. Five days later, mice were randomized into treatment groups. GEM was
     dosed at 150 mg/kg in all studies and A09-246-2 was dosed at 400 pg per mouse. In
     two studies, a 28 day cycle of GEM was modeled (administration on days 5, 19, 26),
     with a 14 day holiday period during which A09-246-2 was given on days 8, 11, 14. In
     a third study, a 21 day cycle of GEM was modeled (administration on days 5, 12, 26,
30    33), with a 14 day holiday period during which A09-246-2 was given on days 13, 16,
      19. Monotherapy with GEM or anti-PD-L1 failed to extend survival time in this model.
      However, in all three studies, the combination of GEM and A09-246-2 significantly
      extended mean survival time (P <0.02). Immunophenotyping revealed several effects
      in groups receiving A09-246-2, both as a monotherapy and in combination with GEM,
                                                  64

        WO 2013/079174                                                     PCT/EP2012/004822
   that were consistent with the proposed MOA of anti-PD-Li including increased
   percentages of CD8'      TEM  in spleens, an increased ratio of splenic CD8*  TEM to Treg
   cells, and increased percentages of splenic PD-1*CD8* T cells. Furthermore,
   immunophenotyping of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) showed significantly
5   increased percentages of CD8' TIL in the combination group.
    4.4 Combination with low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA)
    Low-dose CPA is known to enhance anti-tumor immune responses through the
    inhibition of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. The potential for low-dose CPA
10  pre-treatment was investigated to enhance the efficacy of the anti-PD-Li Ab (A09
    246-2) in the MC38 subcutaneous tumor model. Mice were inoculated
    subcutaneously in the right flank with 1x106 MC38 colon carcinoma cells. When
    tumors reached a mean volume of -50 mm 3 , mice were sorted into treatment groups
     (N=14) on day 0. The combination group received 100 pg of A09-246-2 by i.v.
15   injection on days 0, 3, and 6, with or without pre-treatment with a 100 mg/kg dose of
     CPA delivered i.v. on day -1. A control treatment group received 100 pg of an
     inactive isotype antibody in combination with CPA pretreatment. The combination
     treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant enhancement (p <0.050) of
     anti-tumor activity when compared against the isotype and monotherapy control
20   groups. Using an ELISPOT assay, the effects of treatment on the magnitude of CD8'
     T cell responses directed against the well-characterized p1l5E tumor antigen were
      measured. Both CPA and A09-246-2 showed substantially increased levels of p15E
      reactive CD8' T cells (-100 spots in both groups) when compared to the isotype
      control (-25 spots), with the combination group showing a further enhancement
25    (-250 spots). Thus, the anti-tumor efficacy of the CPA plus A09-246-2 combination
      was associated with increased frequencies of tumor-antigen reactive CTL.
      4.5 Combination with Cyclophosphamide/Stimuvax
      The ability of PD-L1 blockade to restore anti-tumor T cell responses provides a
30    strong rationale for combination with cancer vaccines. Stimuvax is a vaccine against
      the human MUCI antigen, which is commonly overexpressed by solid tumors. Mice
      transgenic for the human MUCI protein (MUC1.tg mice) are immunologically tolerant
      of the antigen, and, when inoculated with murine tumors that also express human
       MUCI, provide a relevant model of the clinical vaccination setting. In the clinic,
                                                  65

       WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   cyclophosphamide (CPA) pre-treatment is used in combination with Stimuvax as a
   strategy for transiently depleting immunosuppressive Treg cells that can inhibit the
   vaccine response.
   In this study, MUC1.tg mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right rear flank
5  with 1x10 6 MC38/MUC1 colon carcinoma cells. Five days after tumor cell inoculation,
   mice were randomized into treatment groups (N=10) on day -3. On day -3, a 100
   mg/kg dose of CPA was administered by i.v. administration. Vaccination was initiated
   on day 0 and was repeated weekly. Anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2) was dosed by i.p.
   injection on days 0, 3, and 6. Tumors were measured twice weekly. The combination
10 of CPA/Stimuvax and A09-246-2 demonstrated significantly enhanced (p <0.050)
   tumor growth inhibition when compared against treatment with CPA/Stimuvax.
    In a second study, 1x106 PANC02/MUC1 cells were inoculated into the pancreas of
    MUC1.tg mice. Four days later, mice were randomized into groups (N=8) and
    treatment was initiated. The same treatment schedule was applied as for the first
15  study. The combination of CPA/Stimuvax and anti-PD-Li (A09-246-2) significantly
    increased mean survival time (MST) when compared against treatment with
    CPA/Stimuvax (MST of 43.5 days vs. 70 days, P = 0.0001). Immunophenotyping by
    FACS showed a significant trend towards increased percentages of CD8' TEM and
    CD8' TcM in the combination group.

     4.6 Combination with fractionated radiotherapy
     Radiotherapy (RT) has been demonstrated to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor
     cells, through increased expression of MHC class I and diversification of the
     intracellular peptide pool. To test anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment in combination with
25   radiotherapy, MC38 colon carcinoma cells (1x 105) were inoculated intramuscularly
     into the right quadriceps of C57BL/6 female mice. When tumors reached a mean
     volume of 150 mm 3 , mice were sorted into treatment groups (N=8) on day 0. The
     tumor-bearing legs were isolated and treated with 360 cGy of gamma irradiation from
     a cesium-137 source on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total dose of 1800 cGy). Anti-PD-Li
30   Ab (A09-246-2) was dosed i.v. at 400 pg on days 3, 6, and 9. The A09-246-2 and
     radiotherapy combination resulted in a high rate of tumor regressions, ultimately
     leading to 6/10 complete responses (CR). Mice with CR were re-challenged by
     inoculation of MC38 tumor cells, and 3/6 mice remained tumor-free seventy-four
     days after the re-challenge, indicating that effective immune memory was generated
                                                  66

        WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   by the combination therapy. Conversely, a control group treated with an isotype
   control antibody in combination with radiation showed significant tumor growth
   inhibition, but did not induce regressions.
   A repeat of the RT and anti-PD-L1 (A09-246-2) combination study was performed,
5  with the inclusion of a second combination therapy group in which the mice were
   systemically depleted of CD8' T cells. Additional immunological readouts measured
   in this study included FACS-based immunophenotyping of splenocytes, in vivo
   proliferation analysis, and ELISPOT assay. Again, the combination demonstrated
   synergistic efficacy that induced an initial phase of regression or stasis in all of the
10 tumors. However, complete regression was only observed in 1/8 mice, with one other
    mouse experiencing a prolonged period of tumor stasis. Depletion of CD8' T cells
    completely abrogated the synergy of the combination, confirming that the mechanism
    involves the stimulation of anti-tumor CD8* T cell responses. This observation was
    further supported by increased frequencies of CD8' T cells reactive to the p1 5E
15  tumor antigen. Immunophenotyping by FACS revealed increased percentages of
    CD8* T cell proliferation in spleens, and increased splenic percentages of CD8*       TEM
    and CD8+ Tcm.
     4.7 Combination with core components of the FOLFOX regimen
20   FOLFOX is a combination chemotherapy regimen, consisting of folinic acid, 5
     fluorouracil (5-FU), and oxaliplatin (OX), used in the treatment of stage Ill colorectal
     cancer. The potential for combining anti-PD-L1 with the core components of
     FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) in the subcutaneous MC38 colon carcinoma
     model were studied. Mice were inoculated in the right subcutaneous flank with 1x106
25   MC38 colon carcinoma cells. When tumors reached a mean volume of -50 mm 3 ,
     mice were sorted into treatment groups (N=10) on day 0. 5-FU (60 mg/kg i.v.) and
     OX (5 mg/kg i.p.) were administered on days 0 and 14. Anti-PD-L1 Ab (A09-246-2)
      (400 pg i.v.) was given on days 3, 6, and 9. The combination treatment was observed
     to have significantly greater efficacy (p <0.050) when compared to A09-246-2 given
30    alone, or 5-FU and OX given in combination with an isotype antibody. A repeat of the
      anti-PD-L1 Ab and FOLFOX combination study was performed and, again, the
      combination demonstrated significantly greater (p <0.050) anti-tumor activity than
      either of the monotherapy regimens.
                                                 67

       WO 2013/079174                                                    PCT/EP2012/004822
   FACS-based immunophenotyping conducted in these studies revealed increases in
   several immunological markers consistent with a CD8* T cell driven MOA, including
   increased splenic levels of p15E tumor antigen specific CD8' T cells, an increase in
   the splenic ratio of TEM to regulatory T cells (Treg), and increased splenic percentages
5  of CD8*PD-1* T cells. Furthermore, the percentage of tumor infiltrating natural killer
   (NK) cells and CD8' T cells was observed to increase significantly in the combination
   group.
    4.8 4-week repeat dose pilot toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey
10  Four groups of 2 male and 2 female cynomolgus monkeys were treated with anti
    human PD-L1 (A09-246-2) at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 20, 60 and 140 mg/kg by
    weekly intravenous infusion for total of 5 administrations.
    The TK evaluation indicates that all animals were exposed to the test material
    throughout the study. The exposure levels increased roughly proportionally to dose
15  increasing at both 1 st and 4 dose, without any relevant accumulation or gender
    dependency at any dose. Anti drug antibody were detected in 2/4 and 1/4 monkeys
    at 20 and 140 mg/kg levels respectively. There was no premature animal death in the
    study. No treatment related changes were noted in the 20 and 60 mg/kg dosing
    groups for all parameters evaluated in the study.
20  At the high dose level of 140 mg/kg, treatment related findings include slight
     decrease of lymphocytes in haematology testing, slight decrease in lymphocyte
     count together with a decrease in NK cell count on study day 30. There were no
     significant histological changes in major organs/tissues except moderate perivascular
     hemorrhage and inflammation/vessel necrosis observed at local injection site at the
25   140 mg/kg. There was no clear trend or change observed in multicytokine analysis at
     this dose level. Based on the results from this study the No Observable Adverse
      Effect Level (NOAEL) was identified as 140 mg/kg.
     Conclusion: A09-246-2 was tolerated in cynomolgus monkey at dose levels up to 140
      mg/kg after receiving a total of 5 consecutive weekly doses. Injection site reactions
30   with moderate severity of subcutaneous/perivascular and vascular inflammatory and
      degenerative changes were observed at 140 mg/kg.
