    The present invention relates to controlled release, delayed release, prolonged release,
    extended release and/or taste masking compositions containing budesonide as active
    ingredient incorporated in a three-component matrix structure, i.e. a structure formed by
    successive amphiphilic, lipophilic or inert matrices and finally incorporated or dispersed
15  in hydrophilic matrices. The use of a plurality of systems mechanism for the control of
    the dissolution of the active ingredient modulates the dissolution rate of the active
    ingredient in aqueous and/or biological fluids, thereby controlling the release kinetics in
    the gastrointestinal tract, and it also allows the oral administration of active principles
    having unfavourable taste characteristics or irritating action on the mucosae of the
20  administration site, particularly in the buccal or gastric area.
    The compositions of the invention are suitable to the oral administration or the
    efficaciously deliver the active ingredient acting topically at some areas of the
    gastrointestinal tract.
25  TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
    The preparation of a sustained, controlled, delayed, extended or anyhow modified
    release form can be carried out according to different techniques:
         1.     The use of inert matrices, in which the main component of the matrix
                structure opposes some resistance to the penetration of the solvent due to the
30              poor affinity towards aqueous fluids; such property being known as
                                                            10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

                                          -2
           lipophilia.
   2.      The use of hydrophilic matrices, in which the main component of the matrix
           structure opposes high resistance to the progress of the solvent, in that the
           presence of strongly hydrophilic groups in its chains, mainly branched,
 5         remarkably increases viscosity inside the hydrated layer.
   3.      The use of bioerodible matrices, which are capable of being degraded by the
           enzymes of some biological compartment.
   All the procedures listed above suffer, however, from drawbacks and imperfections.
   Inert matrices, for example, generally entail non-linear, but exponential, release of
10 the active ingredient.
   Hydrophilic matrices: have a linear behaviour until a certain fraction of active
   ingredient has been released, then significantly deviate from linear release.
   Bioerodible matrices are ideal to carry out the so-called "sire-release", but they
   involve the problem of finding the suitable enzyme or reactive to degradation.
15 Furthermore, they frequently release in situ metabolites that are not wholly
   toxicologically inert.
   A number of formulations based on inert lipophilic matrices have been described:
   Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 13 (6), 1001-1022, (1987) discloses a process making use of
   varying amounts of colloidal silica as a porization element for a lipophilic inert
20 matrix in which the active ingredient is incorporated.
   The same notion of canalization of an inert matrix is described in US 4,608,248 in
   which a small amount of a hydrophilic polymer is mixed with the substances
   forming an inert matrix, in a non sequential compenetration of different matrix
   materials. EP 375,063 discloses a technique for the preparation of multiparticulate
25 granules for the controlled-release of the active ingredient which comprises co
   dissolution of polymers or suitable substances to form an inert matrix with the active
   ingredient and the subsequent deposition of said solution on an inert carrier which
   acts as the core of the device. Alternatively, the inert carrier is kneaded with the
   solution containing the inert polymer and the active ingredient, then the organic
30 solvent used for the dissolution is evaporated off to obtain a solid residue. The
                                                      10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

                                            -   3
   resulting structure is a "reservoir", i.e. is not macroscopically homogeneous along
   all the symmetry axis of the final form. The same "reservoir" structure is also
   described in Chem. Pharm.Bull. 46 (3),531-533, (1998) which improves the
   application through an annealing technique of the inert polymer layer which is
 5 deposited on the surface of the pellets.
   To the "reservoir" structure also belong the products obtained according to the
   technique described in WO 93/00889 which discloses a process for the preparation
   of pellets in hydrophilic matrix which comprises: -dissolution of the active
   ingredient with gastro resistant hydrophilic polymers in organic solvents; -drying of
10 said suspension; -subsequent kneading and formulation of the pellets in a
   hydrophilic or lipophilic matrix without distinction of effectiveness between the two
   types of application. EP 0 453 001 discloses a multiparticulate with "reservoir"
   structure inserted in a hydrophilic matrix. The basic multiparticulate utilizes two
   coating membranes to decrease the release rate of the active ingredient, a pH
15 dependent membrane with the purpose of gastric protection and a pH-independent
   methacrylic membrane with the purpose of slowing down the penetration of the
   aqueous fluid. WO 95/16451 discloses a composition only formed by a hydrophilic
   matrix coated with a gastro-resistant film for controlling the dissolution rate of the
   active ingredient. When preparing sustained-, controlled-release dosage forms of a
20 medicament topically active in the gastrointestinal tract, it is important to ensure a
   controlled release from the first phases following administration, i.e. when the inert
   matrices have the maximum release rate inside the logarithmic phase, namely the
   higher deviation from linear release. Said object has been attained according to the
   present invention, through the combination of an amphiphilic matrix inside an inert
25 matrix, the latter formulated with a lipophilic polymer in a superficial hydrophilic
   matrix. The compositions of the invention are characterized by the absence of a first
   phase in which the medicament superficially present on the matrix is quickly
   solubilized, and by the fact the amphiphilic layer compensate the lack of affinity of
   the aqueous solvent with the lipophilic compounds forming the inner inert matrix.

   DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
10 The compositions of the invention can be prepared by a method comprising the
   following steps:
   a) the active ingredient, represented by budesonide, is first inglobated by simple
       kneading or mixing in a matrix or coating consisting of compounds having
       amphiphilic properties, which will be further specified below. The active
15     ingredient can be mixed with the amphiphilic compounds without the aid of
       solvents or with small amounts of water-alcoholic solvents.
   b) the matrix obtained as specified under a) is incorporated in a low melting
       lipophilic excipient or mixture of excipients, if necessary while heating to soften
       and/or melt the excipient itself, which thereby incorporates the active ingredient
20     by simple dispersion. forming an inert matrix which can be reduced in size to
       obtain inert matrix granules containing the active ingredient particles.
   c) the inert matrix granules are subsequently mixed together with one or more
       hydrophilic water-swellable excipients. The mixture is then subjected to
       compression or tabletting. This way, when the tablet is contacted with biological
25     fluids, a high viscosity swollen layer is formed, which coordinates the solvent
       molecules and acts as a barrier to penetration of the aqueous fluid itself inside
       the new structure. Said barrier antagonizes the starting "burst effect" caused by
       the dissolution of the medicament inglobated inside the inert matrix, which is in
       its turn inside the hydrophilic matrix. The amphiphilic compounds which can be
30     used according to the invention comprise polar lipids of type I or 11 (lecithin,
                                                       10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

   phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine), ceramides, glycol alkyl ethers
   such as diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (TranscutoIR). The lipophilic matrix
   consists of substances selected from unsaturated or hydrogenated alcohols or
   fatty acids, salts, esters or amides thereof. fatty acids mono-, di-or triglycerides,
 5 the polyethoxylated derivatives thereof, waxes, ceramides, cholesterol
   derivatives or mixtures thereof having melting point within the range of 40 to90
   C, preferably from 60 to70 C. If desired, a fatty acid calcium salt may be
   incorporated in the lipophilic matrix which is subsequently dispersed in a
   hydrophilic matrix prepared with alginic acid, thus remarkably increasing the
10 hydrophilic matrix viscosity following penetration of the solvent front until
   contact with the lipophilic matrix granules dispersed inside. An amphiphilic
   matrix with high content in active ingredient, typically from 5 to 95% w/w, in
   particular from 20 to 70%, or from 1.5 to 15% w/w, is first prepared by
   dispersing the active ingredient in a mixture of amphiphilic compounds, such as
15 lecithin, other type II polar lipids, surfactants, or in diethylene glycol monoethyl
   ether; the resulting amphiphilic matrix is then mixed or kneaded, usually while
   hot, with lipophilic compounds suitable to form an inert matrix, such as
   saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitic, stearic, myristic, lauric,
   laurylic, or oleic acids or mixtures thereof with other fatty acids with shorter
20 chain, or salts or alcohols or derivatives of the cited fatty acids, such as mono-,
   di-, or triglycerides or esters with polyethylene glycols, alone or in combination
   with waxes, ceramides, cholesterol derivatives or other apolar lipids in various
   ratios so that the melting or softening points of the lipophilic compounds
   mixtures is within the range of 40 to90' C, preferably from 60 to7 0 'C.
25 Alternatively, the order of formation of the inert and amphiphilic matrices can
   be reversed, incorporating the inert matrix inside the amphiphilic compounds.
   The resulting inert lipophilic matrix is reduced into granules by an extrusion
   and/or granulation process, or any other known processes which retain the
   homogeneous dispersion and matrix structure of the starting mixture. The
30 hydrophilic matrix consists of excipients known as hydrogels, i.e. substances
                                                    10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

   which when passing from the dry state to the hydrated one, undergo the so
   called "molecular relaxation", namely a remarkable increase in mass and weight
   following the coordination of a large number of water molecules by the polar
   groups present in the polymeric chains of the excipients themselves. Examples
 5 of hydrogels which can be used according to the invention are compounds
   selected from acrylic or methacrylic acid polymers or copolymers, alkylvinyl
   polymers, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, carboxyalkyl celluloses, polysaccharides,
   dextrins, pectins, starches and derivatives, natural or synthetic gums, alginic
   acid. In case of taste-masking formulations, the use of polyalcohols such as
10 xylitol, maltitol and mannitol as hydrophilic compounds can also be
   advantageous. The lipophilic matrix granules containing the active ingredient are
   mixed with the hydrophilic compounds cited above in a weight ratio typically
   ranging from 100: 0.5 to 100: 50 (lipophilic matrix: hydrophilic matrix). Part of
   the active ingredient can optionally be mixed with hydrophilic substances to
15 provide compositions in which the active ingredient is dispersed both in the
   lipophilic and the hydrophilic matrix, said compositions being preferably in the
   form of tablets, capsules and/or minitablets. The compression of the mixture of
   lipophilic and/or amphiphilic matrix, hydrogel-forming compound and,
   optionally, active ingredient not inglobated in the lipophilic matrix, yields a
20 macroscopically homogeneous structure in all its volume, namely a matrix
   containing a dispersion of the lipophilic granules in a hydrophilic matrix. A
   similar result can also be obtained by coating the lipophilic matrix granules with
   a hydrophilic polymer coating. The tablets obtainable according to the invention
   can optionally be subjected to known coating processes with a gastro-resistant
25 film/gastro-resistant coating. consisting of, for example, acrylic and/or
   methaciylic acids polymers (Eudragit (R)) or copolymers (Eudragit S/L) or
   cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose acetophthalate/s.
   According to a preferred embodiment of invention the gastro-protective coating
   can be represented by a mixture of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid copolymers
30 type A and/or type B (as, for example, Eudragit S100 and/or Eudragit L100).
                                                  10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

                                       -  8
   According to a further embodiment of the invention, the mixture of acrylic
   and/or methactylic acid copolymers type A and/or type B is preferably in a range
   ratio from 1:5 to 5:1.
   According to another further embodiment, the gastro-protective coating also
 5 optionally comprises plasticizers, dyes, at least one water-solvent, at least one
   organic solvent or a mixture thereof.
   The composition of the invention can further contain conventional excipients,
   for example bioadhesive excipients such as chitosans, polyacrylamides, natural
   or synthetic gums, acrylic acid polymers.
10 The compositions of the invention are preferably in the form of tablets, capsules
   or minitablets. In terms of dissolution characteristics, contact with water or
   aqueous fluids causes the immediate penetration of water inside the more
   superficial layer of the matrix which, thanks to the presence of the aqueous
   solvent, swells due to the distension of the polymeric chains of the hydrogels,
15 giving rise to a high viscosity hydrated front which prevents the further
   penetration of the solvent itself linearly slowing down the dissolution process to
   a well determined point which can be located at about half the thickness, until
   the further penetration of water would cause the disintegration of the hydrophilic
   layer and therefore the release of the content which, consisting of inert matrix
20 granules, however induces the diffusion mechanism typical of these structures
   and therefore further slows down the dissolution profile of the active ingredient.
   The presence of the amphiphilic matrix inside the lipophilic matrix inert allows
   to prevent any unevenness of the release profile of the active ingredient. The
   surfactants present in the amphiphilic portion promote wettability of the porous
25 canaliculuses which cross the inert matrix preventing or reducing resistance to
   penetration of the solvent inside the inert matrix. To obtain taste masking tablets,
   the components of the hydrophilic matrix are carefully selected to minimize the
   active substance release time through penetration accelerated by the canalization
   induced by the hydrophilic compound.
30 The compositions of the present invention are preferably intended for use in the
                                                  10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

   EXPERIMENTAL PART
   To test the effective ability of the formulations of the invention to modify the
   release rate and extent of the active ingredient from the dosage form suitable for
30 the drug administration, before any pharmacokinetic study on patients or
                                                  10051682_1 (GHMatters) P88749.AU.2 13/03/18

   volunteers, the dissolution test is taken as monitoring and discriminating tool
   (according to USP type II apparatus complying with USP <711>).
   Also, the bioavailability profile of the formulations of the invention is carried
   out, in comparison with the marked formulation Entocort@ EC 3 x 3 mg
 5 capsules. As preferred embodiment, the bioavailability study showed a Tmax
   average value higher than 8 hours and a MRT average value higher than 14
   hours.
   According to the invention, Tmnax corresponds to "time to peak concentration",
   i.e. time to reach the peak plasma concentration of a drug after oral
10 administration (Cmax) and MRT corresponds to "mean residence time", i.e. the
   average total time molecules of a given dose spend in the body. This can only be
   measured after instantaneous administration.
   Other pharmacokinetics parameters useful according to the invention are
   represented by:
15 AUC, which corresponds to "area under the curve", i.e. the integral of the
   concentration-time curve (after a single dose or in steady state). In particular,
   AUCo, is the area under the curve up to the last point and AUC 0 . is the area
   under the curve up to infinite.
   Cm 1 ax, which corresponds to "peak concentration", i.e. the peak plasma
20 concentration of a drug after oral administration.
   to,2 which corresponds to "biological half-time", i.e. the time required for the
   concentration of the drug to reach half of its original value.
   XuO-36h   (ng), which corresponds to "urinary excretion", i.e. the active ingredient
   metabolite urinary excretion for 36 hours' time.
25 Tia_, which corresponds to lag time, i.e. the time from administration of a drug to
   first quantifiable concentration.
   CI, which corresponds to "confidence intervals", i.e. a particular kind of interval
   estimate of a population parameter used to indicate the reliability of an estimate.
   CV, which corresponds to "coefficient of variation" provides a relative measure
30 of data dispersion with reference to the mean.

   Dissolution Test Method
   Tablets according to the present invention undergo to dissolution test to verify
   the formulation capacity in modulating and controlling the rate by which the
   active ingredient is leaked by the device or dosage form in the environmental
 5 medium, generally a buffered solution simulating gastric or intestinal juices.
   The dissolution test is performed by introducing individual tablets in a glace
   vessel containing from 500 to 1000 ml of a buffered solution set to different pH
   conditions (pH 1, 6.4 and 7.2 are the pH condition generally used in this test
   applications), so that the whole digestive tract pH conditions, from stomach to
10 large intestine, should be reproduced. To simulate the human body conditions,
   the test is carried out at a temperature of 37'C ± 2'C and at predetermined time
   periods samples of the dissolution medium are withdrawn to detect the
   percentage of active ingredient dissolved over time.
   The tablets according to the present invention, when designed to be used to treat
15 inflammatory bowel disease, in principle have to show a good resistance, thanks
   to the polymeric film resistant to the low pH conditions (intended as < 5 to
   simulate the gastric environment) applied to cover the tablet surface, resistance
   which last at least for two hours; to target the large intestinal sectors, also the pH
   condition of 6.4 shown unsuitability to determine a drug leakage from the
20 administration device for a short exposition time and only mediums at pH 7.2
   have been able to determine an active ingredient dissolution at a progressive and
   quite constant rate during a timeframe from 6 to 12 hours; the dissolution
   percentage obtained with this tablet formulation were below 15% at first hour
   sampling, below 25% at second hour sampling, then values were in the range

   Bioavailability study
   Bioavailability profile of budesonide extended release compositions (6 mg and 9
   mg tablets) vs controlled release formulation (Entocort® 3x3 mg capsules) in
   healthy volunteers is carried out.
 5 The objectives of the study are to compare the bioavailability and PK profile of a
   9 mg budesonide extended release tablet formulation of the invention (herein
   after referred to as TI) versus the market reference formulation, Entocort@ EC 3
   x 3 mg capsules (Astra-Zeneca) (herein after referred to as R) and versus a 6 mg
   budesonide formulation of the invention (herein after referred to as T2).
10 The primary end-point is comparing bioavailability rate through the PK
   parameters of plasma budesonide Cma and Tmnax after TI formulation versus
   reference formulation.
   The secondary end-point is comparing bioavailability extent through plasma
   budesonide AUCo- after TI formulation versus reference formulation;
15 comparing bioavailability extent through the PK parameters of plasma
   budesonide AUC0 4 after TI formulation versus T2 formulation; descriptive
   pharmacokinetics of budesonide; evaluation of main budesonide metabolite
   excretion in urine and safety of the test and reference formulations.
   Budesonide MMX~rm extended release tablets 9mgs (TI) and 6 mgs (T2) were
20 orally administered in a single dose under fasting conditions in different study
   periods with a wash-out interval of at least 5 days. One tablet of TI (batch
   MV084) or T2 (batch TV158) was administered together with 240 mL of
   mineral water; the subjects were instructed to swallow the whole tablet without
   chewing.
25 The reference therapy was Entocort® EC 3x3 mg capsules (MP0077; Astra
   Zeneca, Sweden), orally administered in a single dose under fasting conditions
   together with 240 mL of mineral water; the subjects were instructed to swallow
   the whole tablet without chewing.

  After administration under fasting conditions in 3 consecutive study periods of a
  single dose of budesonide MMX ' extended release tablets 9 mg (TI), 6 mg
  (T2) of the invention and Entocort EC 3x3 rmg capsules (R) the PK of
  budesonide was found significantly different. Mean ±SD (CV%) of plasma
5 budesonide and urine budesonide metabolite PK parameters are summarised in

   Pharmacokinetic results:
   After administration under fasting conditions in 3 consecutive study periods of a
   single dose of Budesonide MMXTM extended release tablets 9 mg (T1), 6 mg
   (T2) and Entocort@ EC 3 x 3 mg capsules (R) the PK of budesonide was found
 5 significantly different. Mean ± SD (CV%) of plasma budesonide and urine
   budesonide-metabolite PK parameters are summarised in the table below for the
   PP population (N = 12).
   Results obtained in the present study on the PP population (see table above)
   were confirmed by the results of the PK analysis on the PP-control population
10 (i.e. after excluding subject randomisation Nr. 02, who showed pre-dose
   detectable levels) and therefore were regarded as the primary results of the
   study, as per protocol.
   Inter-subject variability was higher for the MMXTM tablet formulation than for
   Entocort@ EC, a finding that can be explained by the broader intestinal tract
15 involved in the drug release from the test products (whole colon and sigmoid) as
   compared to the reference (terminal ileum, ascending colon) and from the
   absence of dose fractionation in the MMXTM formulations.
   Although budesonide elimination is constant and no differences among
   formulations were found for    ti/2 values, the different release/absorption
20 behaviour of MMXTM tablets and Entocort@ EC capsules was apparent from
   MRT values which were higher for the MMXTM formulations.
   Analysis on TI and R Cmax and Tmax, showed a different rate of absorption for
   MMXTM      tablets 9 mg (TI) with respect to Entocort@ EC 3 x 3 mg capsules (R).
   TI had a lower budesonide concentration peak than R as confirmed by a PE% of
25 79% and 90% CI limits of 63-100%, and a significantly higher Tmax (13.3 h for
   TI vs. 4.8 h for R). Extent of absorption calculated from the AUCo-t of
   budesonide after administration of TI and R was also significantly different. TI
   bioavailability over the 36 h period was lower than R bioavailability (PE                  =     91 %;
   90% CI limits: 77-108%). Therefore, TI and R were found to be non
30 bioequivalent.
   Analysis on Tmax, and dose-normalized Cmax /dose and AUCo-t /dose showed
   differences in rate and extent of absorption also for TI vs. T2, As expected, TI
                                                                                       2 2   0 3    8

    had a higher concentration peak and bioavailability than T2, although a linear
    relationship with dose was not observed (PE for Cmax /dose          = 75%; 90% CI
    limits: 59 - 95%, PE for AUCo-t /dose   =  80%; 90% CI limits: 67 - 94%).
    Therefore, TI and T2 were found non-bioequivalent.
  5 Tmax differences between TI and T2 were not statistically significant (p value
    from t test  = 0.2244). Analysis on budesonide metabolite urinary excretion (Xuo.
    36h), showed a different excretion among formulations, with a bioequivalence
    not satisfied for TI vs. R (PE  = 66%; 90% CI limits: 54 - 81%) and almost
    achieved for TI vs. T2 (PE= 96%, 90% CI limits: 79 - 117%).
10  Safety results:
    The safety profile of the 3 formulations was similar. Only 3 AEs occurred
    during the study, 1 with T2 formulation and 2 with R formulation. Of these 3
    AEs, only 1 with R formulation (i.e. headache) was judged possibly related to
    treatment. No meaningful effect of treatment on vital signs, ECGs or laboratory
15  parameters was observed.
    Conclusions:
    The formulation Budesonide      MMXTM    extended release tablets 9 mg was found
    not bioequivalent to the reference Entocort@ EC 3 x 3 mg capsules in terms of
    rate and extent of bioavailability since the 90% CI for Cmax and AUCo-t did not
20  fall within the 80 - 125% limits required by current guidelines, and Tmax, was
    statistically different between MMXTM     9 mg and Entocort@ EC 3 x 3 mg. This
    finding is explained by the different release behaviour of the test and reference
    formulations which determines different profiles of budesonide absorption.
    When MMXTM 9 mg and 6 mg tablet formulations were compared to evaluate
25  dose proportionality, whereas no significant difference was found for Tmax, the
    analysis of dose normalised Cmax, AUCot indicated lack of equivalence since the
    90% CI for these parameters did not fall within the 80 -125% limits required by
    current guidelines. but overlapped them.
    The safety profile of the 3 formulations was similar and very good.

   Pharmaco-scintigraphic and kinetic study
   A single dose, pharmaco-scintigraphic and kinetic study of the gastrointestinal
   transit and release of a 1s2 Sm-labelled controlled release formulation of
   budesonide in 12 fasting male healthy volunteers is carried out.
 5 The objective of the study is to demonstrate and quantify, by pharmaco
   scintigraphy and PK analysis, the release and absorption of budesonide in the
   target region.
   Each subject received 1 tablet of budesonide MMXTM 9 mg and an average
   radioactivity dose of 1.118 + 0.428 MBq as     153
                                                     Sm203
10 To define the GI transit behaviour of the study formulation, images were
   recorded at approximately 20 min intervals up to 3 h post-dose and 30 min
   intervals up to 10 h. Further acquisitions were taken at 12 and 24 h post-dose.
   The following Regions of Interest (ROIs) were defined: stomach, small
   intestine, terminal ileum, ileo-caecal junction and caecum, ascending,
15 transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. Quantification of the distribution
   were achieved by measuring the count rates recorded from the ROIs.
   Budesonide plasma levels were detected between the 1" and the             1 2 th h post
   administration. On the average the appearance of drug plasma levels occurred in
   6.79 ± 3.24 h (Tiag). Peak time (Tmax) averaged 14.00 ± 7.73 h, with mean
20 concentration (Cmax) of 1768.7 ± 1499.8 pg/mL. Measured average plasma
   AUCt in 24 h was 15607 ± 14549 pgxh/mL. The difference Tmax - Tiag accounted
   for 7.21 + 5.49 h, a time period which may be representative of the release time
   of the active from the tablet.
