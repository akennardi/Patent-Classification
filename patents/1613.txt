                                          BACKGROUND
          Sweeteners are well known as ingredients used most commonly in the food, beverage,
or confectionary industries. The sweetener can either be incorporated into a final food
product during production or for stand-alone use, when appropriately diluted, as a tabletop
sweetener or an at-home replacement for sugars in baking. Sweeteners include natural
sweeteners such as sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, molasses, maple syrup, and honey and
artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharine and sucralose. Stevia extract is a natural
sweetener that can be isolated and extracted from a perennial shrub, Stevia rebaudiana. Stevia
is commonly grown in South America and Asia for commercial production of stevia extract.
Stevia extract, purified to various degrees, is used commercially as a high intensity sweetener
in foods and in blends or alone as a tabletop sweetener.

                                                 la
         Extracts of the Stevia plant contain rebaudiosides and other steviol glycosides that
contribute to the sweet flavor, although the amount of each glycoside often varies among
different production batches. Existing commercial products are predominantly rebaudioside
A with lesser amounts of other glycosides such as rebaudioside C, D, and F. Stevia extracts
may also contain contaminants such as plant-derived
(14166224 1):GGG

   compounds that contribute to off-flavors. These off-flavors can be more or less
   problematic depending on the food system or application of choice. Potential
   contaminants include pigments, lipids, proteins, phenolics, saccharides, spathulenol
   and other sesquiterpenes, labdane diterpenes, monoterpenes, decanoic acid, 8,11,14
 5 eicosatrienoic acid, 2-methyloctadecane, pentacosane, octacosane, tetracosane,
   octadecanol, stigmasterol, P-sitosterol, a- and P-amyrin, lupeol, j-amryin acetate,
   pentacyclic triterpene, centauredin, quercitin, epi-alpha-cadinol, carophyllenes and
   derivatives, beta-pinene, beta-sitosterol, and gibberellin.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Two glycosides, stevioside and rebaudioside A, are the primary compounds in
25 commercially-produced stevia extracts. Stevioside is reported to have a more bitter
   and less sweet taste than rebaudioside A and, therefore, a higher proportion of
   rebaudioside A in an extract preparation is preferred. However, the composition of
   stevia extract can vary from lot to lot depending on the soil and climate in which the
   plants are grown. Depending upon the sourced plant, the climate conditions, and the
30 extraction process, the amount of rebaudioside A in commercial preparations is
   reported to vary from 20 to 97% of the total steviol glycoside content, typically >50
                                               15

   80% and sometimes as high as >95-97% of the total steviol glycosides. Moreover,
   other steviol glycosides are present in varying amounts in stevia extracts, which
   further complicates the ability to produce a sweetener with a consistent taste profile
   by extraction and purification from Stevia plants. For example, Rebaudioside B is
 5 typically present at less than 1-2%, whereas Rebaudioside C can be present at levels
   as high as 7-15%. Rebaudioside D is typically present in levels of 2% or less, and
   Rebaudioside F is typically present in compositions at 3.5% or less of the total steviol
   glycosides. Even trace amounts of the minor steviol glycosides are reported to affect
   the flavor profile of a Stevia extract. Additionally, it is thought that some of the
10 contaminants from the Stevia plant, even at very low concentrations, may also provide
   off-flavors to some of the commercially available plant extracts.
            This document is based on the discovery that recombinant hosts such as plant
   cells, plants, or microorganisms can be developed that express polypeptides useful for
   the biosynthesis of steviol. Further, such hosts can express Uridine 5'-diphospho
15 (UDP) glycosyl transferases suitable for producing steviol glycosides such as
   rubusoside and rebaudioside A. Recombinant microorganisms are particularly useful
   hosts. Expression of these biosynthetic polypeptides in various microbial chassis
   allows steviol and its glycosides to be produced in a consistent, reproducible manner
   from energy and carbon sources such as sugars, glycerol, C0 2 , H2, and sunlight. The
20 proportion of each steviol glycoside produced by a recombinant host can be tailored
   by incorporating preselected biosynthetic enzymes into the hosts and expressing them
   at appropriate levels, to produce a sweetener composition with a consistent taste
   profile. Furthermore, the concentrations of steviol glycosides produced by
   recombinant hosts are expected to be higher than the levels of steviol glycosides
25 produced in the Stevia plant, which improves the efficiency of the downstream
   purification. Such sweetener compositions contain little or no plant based
   contaminants, relative to the amount of contaminants present in Stevia extracts.
            At least one of the genes is a recombinant gene, the particular recombinant
   gene(s) depending on the species or strain selected for use. Additional genes or
30 biosynthetic modules can be included in order to increase steviol and glycoside yield,
   improve efficiency with which energy and carbon sources are converted to steviol and
   its glycosides, and/or to enhance productivity from the cell culture or plant. Such
                                                16

   additional biosynthetic modules include genes involved in the synthesis of the
   terpenoid precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate.
   Additional biosynthetic modules include terpene synthase and terpene cyclase genes,
   such as genes encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and copalyl diphosphate
 5 synthase; these genes may be endogenous genes or recombinant genes.

           It has been discovered that expression of certain genes in a host such as a
   microorganism confers the ability to synthesize steviol upon that host. As discussed
   in more detail below, one or more of such genes may be present naturally in a host.
   Typically, however, one or more of such genes are recombinant genes that have been
20 transformed into a host that does not naturally possess them.
           The biochemical pathway to produce steviol involves formation of
   geranylgeranyl diphosphate, cyclization to (-) copalyl diphosphate, followed by
   oxidation and hydroxylation to form steviol. See FIG. 1. Thus, conversion of
   geranylgeranyl diphosphate to steviol in a recombinant microorganism involves the
                                              17

   expression of a gene encoding a kaurene synthase (KS), a gene encoding a kaurene
   oxidase (KO), and a gene encoding a steviol synthetase (KAH). Steviol synthetase
   also is known as kaurenoic acid 13-hydroxylase.
            Suitable KS polypeptides are known. For example, suitable KS enzymes
 5 include those made by Stevia rebaudiana,Zea mays and Populus trichocarpa. See,
   SEQ ID NOs: 132-135. Nucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are
   described in more detail below. See, for example, Table 3 and SEQ ID NOs: 40-47.
            Suitable KO polypeptides are known. For example, suitable KO enzymes
   include those made by Stevia rebaudiana,Arabidopsis thaliana,Gibberellafujikoroi
10 and Trametes versicolor. See, SEQ ID NOs: 138-141. Nucleotide sequences
   encoding these polypeptides are described in more detail below. See, for example,
   Table 5 and SEQ ID NOs: 52-59.
            Suitable KAH polypeptides are known. For example, suitable KAH enzymes
   include those made by Stevia rebaudiana,Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera and
15 Medicago trunculata. See, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 142-146; U.S. Patent Publication No.
   2008-0271205; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008-0064063 and Genbank Accession
   No. gi 189098312. The steviol synthetase from Arabidopsis thaliana is classified as a
   CYP714A2. Nucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are described in more
   detail below. See, for example, Table 6 and SEQ ID NOs: 60-69.
20          In some embodiments, a recombinant microorganism contains a recombinant
   gene encoding a KO and/or a KAH polypeptide. Such microorganisms also typically
   contain a recombinant gene encoding a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)
   polypeptide, since certain combinations of KO and/or KAH polypeptides require
   expression of an exogenous CPR polypeptide. In particular, the activity of a KO
25 and/or a KAH polypeptide of plant origin can be significantly increased by the
   inclusion of a recombinant gene encoding an exogenous CPR polypeptide. Suitable
   CPR polypeptides are known. For example, suitable CPR enzymes include those
   made by Stevia rebaudiana,Arabidopsis thaliana,and Giberellafujikuroi. See, e.g.,
   SEQ ID NOs: 147-149. Nucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are
30 described in more detail below. See, for example, Table 7 and SEQ ID NOs: 70-75.
            Expression in a recombinant microorganism of these genes results in the
   conversion of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to steviol.
                                             18

            B.     Steviol Glycoside Biosynthesis Polypeptides
            In some embodiments, a recombinant host described herein can convert steviol
   to a steviol glycoside. Such a host (e.g., microorganism) contains genes encoding one
 5 or more UDP Glycosyl Transferases, also known as UGTs. UGTs transfer a
   monosaccharide unit from an activated nucleotide sugar to an acceptor moiety, in this
   case, an -OH or -COOH moiety on steviol or steviol derivative. UGTs have been
   classified into families and subfamilies based on sequence homology. Li et al. J. Biol.
   Chem. 276:4338-4343 (2001).
10
   B. 1     Rubusoside Biosynthesis Polypeptides
            The biosynthesis of rubusoside involves glycosylation of the 13-OH and the
    19-COOH of steviol. See FIG. 2A. It has been discovered that conversion of steviol
   to rubusoside in a recombinant host such as a microorganism can be accomplished by
15 the expression of gene(s) encoding UGTs 85C2 and 74G1, which transfer a glucose
   unit to the 13-OH or the 19-COOH, respectively, of steviol.
            Thus, a suitable UGT85C2 functions as a uridine 5'-diphospho glucosyl:
   steviol 13-OH transferase, and a uridine 5'-diphospho glucosyl: steviol-19-0
   glucoside 13-OH transferase. Functional UGT85C2 polypeptides also may catalyze
20 glucosyl transferase reactions that utilize steviol glycoside substrates other than
   steviol and steviol-19-0-glucoside.
            A suitable UGT74G1 polypeptide functions as a uridine 5'-diphospho
   glucosyl: steviol 19-COOH transferase and a uridine 5'-diphospho glucosyl: steviol
    13-0-glucoside 19-COOH transferase. Functional UGT74G1 polypeptides also may
25 catalyze glycosyl transferase reactions that utilize steviol glycoside substrates other
   than steviol and steviol-13-0-glucoside, or that transfer sugar moieties from donors
   other than uridine diphosphate glucose.
            A recombinant microorganism expressing a functional UGT74G1 and a
   functional UGT85C2 can make rubusoside and both steviol monosides (i.e., Steviol
30  13-0-monoglucoside and Steviol 19-0-monoglucoside) when fed steviol in the
   medium. One or more of such genes may be present naturally in the host. Typically,
                                                19

   however, such genes are recombinant genes that have been transformed into a host
   (e.g., microorganism) that does not naturally possess them.
            As used herein, the term recombinant host is intended to refer to a host, the
   genome of which has been augmented by at least one incorporated DNA sequence.
 5 Such DNA sequences include but are not limited to genes that are not naturally
   present, DNA sequences that are not normally transcribed into RNA or translated into
   a protein ("expressed"), and other genes or DNA sequences which one desires to
   introduce into the non-recombinant host. It will be appreciated that typically the
   genome of a recombinant host described herein is augmented through the stable
10 introduction of one or more recombinant genes. Generally, the introduced DNA is
   not originally resident in the host that is the recipient of the DNA, but it is within the
   scope of the invention to isolate a DNA segment from a given host, and to
   subsequently introduce one or more additional copies of that DNA into the same host,
   e.g., to enhance production of the product of a gene or alter the expression pattern of a
15 gene. In some instances, the introduced DNA will modify or even replace an
   endogenous gene or DNA sequence by, e.g., homologous recombination or site
   directed mutagenesis. Suitable recombinant hosts include microorganisms, plant cells,
   and plants.
            The term "recombinant gene" refers to a gene or DNA sequence that is
20 introduced into a recipient host, regardless of whether the same or a similar gene or
   DNA sequence may already be present in such a host. "Introduced," or "augmented"
   in this context, is known in the art to mean introduced or augmented by the hand of
   man. Thus, a recombinant gene may be a DNA sequence from another species, or
   may be a DNA sequence that originated from or is present in the same species, but
25 has been incorporated into a host by genetic engineering methods to form a
   recombinant host. It will be appreciated that a recombinant gene that is introduced
   into a host can be identical to a DNA sequence that is normally present in the host
   being transformed, and is introduced to provide one or more additional copies of the
   DNA to thereby permit overexpression or modified expression of the gene product of
30 that DNA.
            Suitable UGT74G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides include those made by Stevia
   rebaudiana. Genes encoding functional UGT74G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides from
                                                 20

   Stevia are reported in Richman, et al. Plant J. 41: 56-67 (2005). Amino acid
   sequences of S. rebaudianaUGT74G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides are set forth in
   SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3, respectively. Nucleotide sequences encoding UGT74G1 and
   UGT85C2 that have been optimized for expression in yeast are set forth in SEQ ID
 5 NOs: 2 and 4, respectively. See also the UGT85C2 and UGT74G1 variants described
   in Examples 17 and 18, respectively.
           In some embodiments, the recombinant host is a microorganism. The
   recombinant microorganism can be grown on media containing steviol in order to
   produce rubusoside. In other embodiments, however, the recombinant microorganism
10 expresses one or more recombinant genes involved in steviol biosynthesis, e.g., a
   CDPS gene, a KS gene, a KO gene and/or a KAH gene. Thus, a microorganism
   containing a CDPS gene, a KS gene, a KO gene and a KAH gene in addition to a
   UGT74G1 and a UGT85C2 gene is capable of producing both steviol monosides and
   rubusoside without the necessity for including steviol in the culture media.
15         In some embodiments, the recombinant microorganism further expresses a
   recombinant gene encoding a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS).
   Suitable GGPPS polypeptides are known. For example, suitable GGPPS enzymes
   include those made by Stevia rebaudiana,Gibberellafujikuroi,Mus musculus,
   Thalassiosirapseudonana, Streptomyces clavuligerus,Sulfulobus acidocaldarius,
20 Synechococcus sp. and Arabidopsis thaliana. See, SEQ ID NOs: 121-128.
   Nucleotide sequences encoding these polypeptides are described in more detail below.
   See Table 1 and SEQ ID NOs:18-33. In some embodiments, the recombinant
   microorganism further expresses recombinant genes involved in diterpene
   biosynthesis or production of terpenoid precursors, e.g., genes in the methylerythritol
25 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway or genes in the mevalonate (MEV) pathway discussed
   below.
   B. 2    Rebaudioside A Biosynthesis Polypeptides
           The biosynthesis of rebaudioside A involves glucosylation of the aglycone
30 steviol. Specifically, rebaudioside A can be formed by glucosylation of the 13-OH of
   steviol which forms the 13-0-steviolmonoside, glucosylation of the C-2' of the 13-0
   glucose of steviolmonoside which forms steviol-1,2-bioside, glucosylation of the C
                                              21

    19 carboxyl of steviol-1,2-bioside which forms stevioside, and glucosylation of the C
   3' of the C-13-0-glucose of stevioside. The order in which each glucosylation
   reaction occurs can vary. See FIG. 2A.
           It has been discovered that conversion of steviol to rebaudioside A in a
 5 recombinant host can be accomplished by the expression of gene(s) encoding the
   following functional UGTs: 74G1, 85C2, 76G1 and 91D2. Thus, a recombinant
   microorganism expressing these four UGTs can make rebaudioside A when fed steviol
   in the medium. Typically, one or more of these genes are recombinant genes that have
   been transformed into a microorganism that does not naturally possess them. It has
10 also been discovered that UGTs designated herein as SM12UGT can be substituted
   for UGT91D2.
            Suitable UGT74G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides include those discussed
   above. A suitable UGT76G1 adds a glucose moiety to the C-3'of the C-13-0-glucose
   of the acceptor molecule, a steviol 1,2 glycoside. Thus, UGT76G1 functions, for
15 example, as a uridine 5'-diphospho glucosyl: steviol 13-0-1,2 glucoside C-3' glucosyl
   transferase and a uridine 5'-diphospho glucosyl: steviol-19-0-glucose, 13-0-1,2
   bioside C-3' glucosyl transferase. Functional UGT76G1 polypeptides may also
   catalyze glucosyl transferase reactions that utilize steviol glycoside substrates that
   contain sugars other than glucose, e.g., steviol rhamnosides and steviol xylosides.
20 See, FIGS 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D. Suitable UGT76G1 polypeptides include those made
   by S. rebaudianaand reported in Richman, et al. Plant J. 41: 56-67 (2005). The
   amino acid sequence of a S. rebaudianaUGT76G1 polypeptide is set forth in SEQ ID
   NO:7. The nucleotide sequence encoding the UGT76G1 polypeptide of SEQ ID
   NO:7 has been optimized for expression in yeast and is set forth in SEQ ID NO:8.
25 See also the UGT76G1 variants set forth in Example 18.
           A suitable UGT91D2 polypeptide functions as a uridine 5'-diphospho
   glucosyl: steviol-13-0-glucoside transferase (also referred to as a steviol-13
   monoglucoside 1,2-glucosylase), transferring a glucose moiety to the C-2' of the 13
   0-glucose of the acceptor molecule, steviol-13-0-glucoside. Typically, a suitable
30 UGT91D2 polypeptide also functions as a uridine 5'-diphospho glucosyl: rubusoside
   transferase transferring a glucose moiety to the C-2' of the 13-0-glucose of the
   acceptor molecule, rubusoside.
                                               22

            Functional UGT91D2 polypeptides may also catalyze reactions that utilize
   steviol glycoside substrates other than steviol-13-0-glucoside and rubusoside, e.g.,
   functional UGT9 1D2 polypeptides may utilize stevioside as a substrate, transferring a
   glucose moiety to the C-2' of the 19-0-glucose residue to produce Rebaudioside E.
 5 Functional UGT9 1D2 polypeptides may also utilize Rebaudioside A as a substrate,
   transferring a glucose moiety to the C-2' of the 19-0-glucose residue to produce
   Rebaudioside D. However, a functional UGT91D2 polypeptide typically does not
   transfer a glucose moiety to steviol compounds having a 1,3-bound glucose at the C
    13 position, i.e., transfer of a glucose moiety to steviol 1,3-bioside and 1,3-stevioside
10 does not occur.
            Functional UGT9 1D2 polypeptides can transfer sugar moieties from donors
   other than uridine diphosphate glucose. For example, a functional UGT91D2
   polypeptide can act as a uridine 5'-diphospho D-xylosyl: steviol-13-0-glucoside
   transferase, transferring a xylose moiety to the C-2' of the 13-0-glucose of the
15 acceptor molecule, steviol-13-0-glucoside. As another example, a functional
   UGT91D2 polypeptide can act as a uridine 5'-diphospho L-rhamnosyl: steviol-13-0
   glucoside transferase, transferring a rhamnose moiety to the C-2' of the 13-0-glucose
   of the acceptor molecule, steviol-13-0-glucoside
            Suitable functional UGT91D2 polypeptides include those disclosed herein,
20 e.g., the polypeptides designated UGT91D2e and UGT91D2m. The amino acid
   sequence of an exemplary UGT91D2e polypeptide from Stevia rebaudianais set forth
   in SEQ ID NO: 5. SEQ ID NO:6 is a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide
   of SEQ ID NO:5 that has been codon optimized for expression in yeast. The S.
   rebaudiananucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:5 is set
25 forth in SEQ ID NO:9. The amino acid sequences of exemplary UGT91D2m
   polypeptides from S. rebaudianaare set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 10 and 12, and are
   encoded by the nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 11 and 13,
   respectively. See also the UGT91D2 variants of Example 16, e.g., a variant
   containing a substitution at amino acid residues 206, 207, and 343.
30          As indicated above, UGTs designated herein as SM12UGT can be substituted
   for UGT91D2. Suitable functional SM12UGT polypeptides include those made by
   Ipomoeapurpurea(Japanese morning glory) and described in Morita et al. Plant J. 42,
                                                23

   353-3 63 (2005). The amino acid sequence encoding the I. purpureaIP3GGT
   polypeptide is set forth in SEQ ID NO:76. SEQ ID NO:77 is a nucleotide sequence
   encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:76 that has been codon optimized for
   expression in yeast. Another suitable SM12UGT polypeptide is a Bp94B1 polypeptide
 5 having an R25S mutation. See Osmani et al. Plant Phys. 148: 1295-1308 (2008) and
   Sawada et al. J. Biol. Chem. 280:899-906 (2005). The amino acid sequence encoding
   the Bellisperennis(red daisy) UGT94B1 polypeptide is set forth in SEQ ID NO:78.
   SEQ ID NO:79 is the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID
   NO:78 that has been codon optimized for expression in yeast.
10         In some embodiments, the recombinant microorganism is grown on media
   containing steviol-13-0-glucoside or steviol-19-0-glucoside in order to produce
   rebaudioside A. In such embodiments, the microorganism contains and expresses
   genes encoding a functional UGT91D2, a functional UGT74G1 and a functional
   UGT76G1, and is capable of producing rebaudioside A when it is fed steviol, one or
15 both of the steviolmonosides, or rubusoside in the culture media.
           In other embodiments, the recombinant microorganism is grown on media
   containing rubusoside in order to produce rebaudioside A. In such embodiments, the
   microorganism contains and expresses genes encoding a functional UGT9 1D2 and a
   functional UGT76G1, and is capable of producing rebaudioside A when it is fed
20 rubusoside in the culture media.
           In other embodiments the recombinant microorganism expresses one or more
   genes involved in steviol biosynthesis, e.g., a CDPS gene, a KS gene, a KO gene
   and/or a KAH gene. Thus, for example, a microorganism containing a CDPS gene, a
   KS gene, a KO gene and a KAH gene, in addition to a UGT74G1, a UGT85C2, a
25 UGT9 1D2 gene and a UGT76G 1 gene, is capable of producing rebaudioside A
   without the necessity for including steviol in the culture media.
           In some embodiments, the recombinant microorganism further contains and
   expresses a recombinant GGPPS gene in order to provide increased levels of the
   diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate, for increased flux through the
30 rebaudioside A biosynthetic pathway. In some embodiments, the recombinant
   microorganism further contains and expresses recombinant genes involved in
                                              24

   diterpene biosynthesis or production of terpenoid precursors, e.g., genes in the MEP
   or MEV pathway discussed below.
   B. 3    Dulcoside A and Rebaudioside C Biosynthesis Polypeptides
 5         The biosynthesis of rebaudioside C and/or dulcoside A involves glucosylation
   and rhamnosylation of the aglycone steviol. Specifically, dulcoside A can be formed
   by glucosylation of the 13-OH of steviol which forms steviol-13-0-glucoside,
   rhamnosylation of the C-2' of the 13-0-glucose of steviol-13-0-glucoside which
   forms the 1,2 rhamnobioside, and glucosylation of the C-19 carboxyl of the 1,2
10 rhamnobioside. Rebaudioside C can be formed by glucosylation of the C-3' of the C
    13-0-glucose of dulcoside A. The order in which each glycosylation reaction occurs
   can vary. See FIG. 2B.
           It has been discovered that conversion of steviol to dulcoside A in a
   recombinant host can be accomplished by the expression of gene(s) encoding the
15 following functional UGTs: 85C2, 91D2, and 74G1. Thus, a recombinant
   microorganism expressing these three UGTs and a rhamnose synthetase can make
   dulcoside A when fed steviol in the medium. Alternatively, a recombinant
   microorganism expressing two UGTs, 91D2 and 74G1, and rhamnose synthetase can
   make dulcoside A when fed the monoside, steviol-13-0-glucoside or steviol-19-0
20 glucoside, in the medium. Similarly, conversion of steviol to rebaudioside C in a
   recombinant microorganism can be accomplished by the expression of gene(s)
   encoding UGTs 85C2, 91D2, 74G1, and 76G1 and rhamnose synthetase when fed
   steviol, by the expression of genes encoding UGTs 91D2, 74G1 and 76G1, and
   rhamnose synthetase when fed steviol-13-0-glucoside, by the expression of genes
25 encoding UGTs 85C2, 91D2 and 76G1, and rhamnose synthetase when fed steviol
    19-0-glucoside, or by the expression of genes encoding UGTs 91D2 and 76G1 and
   rhamonse synthetase when fed rubusoside. Typically, one or more of these genes are
   recombinant genes that have been transformed into a microorganism that does not
   naturally possess them.
30          Suitable UGT91D2, UGT74G1, UGT76G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides
   include the functional UGT polypeptides discussed herein. Rhamnose synthetase
   provides increased amounts of the UDP-rhamnose donor for rhamnosylation of the
                                              25

   steviol compound acceptor. Suitable rhamnose synthetases include those made by
   Arabidopsis thaliana,such as the product of the A. thaliana RHM2 gene.
           In some embodiments, a UGT79B3 polypeptide is substituted for a UGT91D2
   polypeptide. Suitable UGT79B3 polypeptides include those made by Arabidopsis
 5 thaliana,which are capable of rhamnosylation of steviol 13-0-monoside in vitro. A.
   thalianaUGT79B3 can rhamnosylate glucosylated compounds to form 1,2
   rhamnosides. The amino acid sequence of an Arabidopsis thaliana UGT79B3 is set
   forth in SEQ ID NO: 150. The nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence
   of SEQ ID NO:150 is set forth in SEQ ID NO:151.
10         In some embodiments rebaudioside C can be produced using in vitro methods
   while supplying the appropriate UDP-sugar or a cell-free system for regeneration of
   UDP-sugars. See, for example, "An integrated cell-free metabolic platform for
   protein production and synthetic biology" by Jewett MC, Calhoun KA, Voloshin A,
   Wuu JJ and Swartz JR in Molecular Systems Biology, 4, article 220 (2008).
15 Reactions may be carried out together, or stepwise. For instance, rebaudioside C may
   be produced from rubusoside with the addition of stoichiometric amounts of UDP
   rhamnose and UGT91d2e, followed by addition of UGT76G1 and an excess or
   stoichiometric supply of UDP-glucose. In some embodiments phosphatases are used
   to remove secondary products and improve the reaction yields.
20         In other embodiments, the recombinant host expresses one or more genes
   involved in steviol biosynthesis, e.g., a CDPS gene, a KS gene, a KO gene and/or a
   KAH gene. Thus, for example, a microorganism containing a CDPS gene, a KS gene,
   a KO gene and a KAH gene, in addition to a UGT85C2, a UGT74G1, a UGT91D2
   gene and a UGT76G1 gene, is capable of producing rebaudioside C without the
25 necessity for including steviol in the culture media. In addition, the recombinant host
   typically expresses an endogenous or a recombinant gene encoding a rhamnose
   synthetase. Such a gene is useful in order to provide increased amounts of the UDP
   rhamnose donor for rhamnosylation of the steviol compound acceptor. Suitable
   rhamnose synthetases include those made by Arabidopsis thaliana,such as the
30 product of the A. thaliana RHM2 gene.
           One with skill in the art will recognize that by modulating relative expression
   levels of different UGT genes as well as modulating the availability of UDP
                                               26

   rhamnose, a recombinant host can be tailored to specifically produce steviol and
   steviol glycoside products in a desired proportion. Transcriptional regulation of
   steviol biosynthesis genes, and steviol glycoside biosynthesis genes can be achieved
   by a combination of transcriptional activation and repression using techniques known
 5 to those in the art. For in vitro reactions, one with skill in the art will recognize that
   addition of different levels of UGT enzymes in combination or under conditions
   which impact the relative activities of the different UGTS in combination will direct
   synthesis towards a desired proportion of each steviol glycoside.
           In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains and expresses a
10 recombinant GGPPS gene in order to provide increased levels of the diterpene
   precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate, for increased flux through the rebaudioside A
   biosynthetic pathway. In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains a
   genetic construct to silence or reduce the expression of non-steviol pathways
   consuming geranylgeranyl diphosphate, ent-Kaurenoic acid or farnesyl
15 pyrophosphate, thereby providing increased flux through the steviol and steviol
   glycosides biosynthetic pathways. For example, flux to sterol production pathways
   such as ergosterol may be reduced by downregulation of the ERG9 gene. In cells that
   produce gibberellins, gibberellin synthesis may be downregulated to increase flux of
   ent-kaurenoic acid to steviol. In carotenoid-producing organisms, flux to steviol may
20 be increased by downregulation of one or more carotenoid biosynthetic genes.
           In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains and expresses
   recombinant genes involved in diterpene biosynthesis or production of terpenoid
   precursors, e.g., genes in the MEP or MEV pathway discussed below.
           In some embodiments, a recombinant host such as a microorganism produces
25 steviol glycoside compositions that have greater than at least 15% rebaudioside C of
   the total steviol glycosides, e.g., at least 20% rebaudioside C, 30-40% rebaudioside C,
   40-50% rebaudioside C, 50-60% rebaudioside C, 60-70% rebaudioside C, 70-80%
   rebaudioside C, 80-90% rebaudioside C. In some embodiments, a recombinant host
   such as a microorganism produces steviol glycoside compositions that have at least
30 90% rebaudioside C, e.g., 90-99% rebaudioside C. Other steviol glycosides present
   may include those depicted in Figures 2 A and B such as steviol monosides, steviol
   glucobiosides, steviol rhamnobiosides, rebaudioside A, and Dulcoside A. In some
                                                 27

   embodiments, the rebaudioside C-enriched composition produced by the host can be
   further purified and the rebaudioside C or Dulcoside A so purified may then be mixed
   with other steviol glycosides, flavors, or sweeteners to obtain a desired flavor system
   or sweetening composition. For instance, a rebaudioside C-enriched composition
 5 produced by a recombinant microorganism can be combined with a rebaudioside A, F,
   or D-enriched composition produced by a different recombinant microorganism, with
   rebaudioside A, F, or D purified from a Stevia extract, or with rebaudioside A, F, or D
   produced in vitro.
10 B. 4     Rebaudioside E and Rebaudioside D Biosynthesis Polypeptides
            The biosynthesis of rebaudioside E and/or rebaudioside D involves
   glucosylation of the aglycone steviol. Specifically, rebaudioside E can be formed by
   glucosylation of the 13-OH of steviol which forms steviol-13-0-glucoside,
   glucosylation of the C-2' of the 13-0-glucose of steviol-13-0-glucoside which forms
15 the steviol-1,2-bioside, glucosylation of the C-19 carboxyl of the 1,2-bioside to form
    1,2-stevioside, and glucosylation of the C-2' of the 19-0-glucose of the 1,2-stevioside
   to form rebaudioside E. Rebaudioside D can be formed by glucosylation of the C-3'
   of the C-13-0-glucose of rebaudioside E. The order in which each glycosylation
   reaction occurs can vary. For example, the glucosylation of the C-2' of the 19-0
20 glucose may be the last step in the pathway, wherein Rebaudioside A is an
   intermediate in the pathway. See FIG. 2C.
            It has been discovered that conversion of steviol to rebaudioside D in a
   recombinant host can be accomplished by the expression of gene(s) encoding the
   following functional UGTs: 85C2, 91D2, 74G1 and 76G1. Thus, a recombinant
25 microorganism expressing these four UGTs can make rebaudioside D when fed
   steviol in the medium. Alternatively, a recombinant microorganism expressing two
   functional UGTs, 91D2 and 76G1, can make rebaudioside D when fed rubusoside or
    1,2-stevioside in the medium. As another alternative, a recombinant microorganism
   expressing three functional UGTs, 74G1, 91D2 and 76G1, can make rebaudioside D
30 when fed the monoside, steviol-13-0-glucoside, in the medium. Similarly, conversion
   of steviol-19-0-glucoside to rebaudioside D in a recombinant microorganism can be
   accomplished by the expression of genes encoding UGTs 85C2, 91D2 and 76G1
                                               28

   when fed steviol-19-0-glucoside. Typically, one or more of these genes are
   recombinant genes that have been transformed into a host that does not naturally
   possess them.
            Suitable UGT91D2, UGT74G1, UGT76G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides
 5 include the functional UGT polypeptides discussed herein. In some embodiments, a
   UGT79B3 polypeptide is substituted for a UGT91, as discussed above.
            In some embodiments, rebaudioside D or rebaudioside E can be produced
   using in vitro methods while supplying the appropriate UDP-sugar or a cell-free
   system for regeneration of UDP-sugars. See, for example, Jewett MC, et al.
10 Molecular Systems Biology, Vol. 4, article 220 (2008). Conversions requiring
   multiple reactions may be carried out together, or stepwise. Rebaudioside D may be
   produced from Rebaudioside A that is commercially available enriched extract or
   produced via biosynthesis, with the addition of stoichiometric or excess amounts of
   UDP-glucose and UGT91D2e. In some embodiments phosphatases are used to
15 remove secondary products and improve the reaction yields.
            One with skill in the art will recognize that by modulating relative expression
   levels of different UGT genes, a recombinant host can be tailored to specifically
   produce steviol and steviol glycoside products in a desired proportion.
   Transcriptional regulation of steviol biosynthesis genes and steviol glycoside
20 biosynthesis genes can be achieved by a combination of transcriptional activation and
   repression using techniques known to those in the art. For in vitro reactions, one with
   skill in the art will recognize that addition of different levels of UGT enzymes in
   combination or under conditions which impact the relative activities of the different
   UGTS in combination will direct synthesis towards a desired proportion of each
25 steviol glycoside. One with skill in the art will recognize that a higher proportion of
   rebaudioside D or E or more efficient conversion to rebaudioside D or E can be
   obtained with a diglycosylation enzyme that has a higher activity for the 19-0
   glucoside reaction as compared to the 13-0-glucoside reaction (substrates
   rebaudioside A and stevioside).
30          In other embodiments, the recombinant host expresses one or more genes
   involved in steviol biosynthesis, e.g., a CDPS gene, a KS gene, a KO gene and/or a
   KAH gene. Thus, for example, a microorganism containing a CDPS gene, a KS gene,
                                                29

   a KO gene and a KAH gene, in addition to a UGT85C2, a UGT74G1, a UGT91D2
   gene and a UGT76G1 gene, is capable of producing rebaudiosides E and D without
   the necessity for including steviol in the culture media.
            In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains and expresses a
 5 recombinant GGPPS gene in order to provide increased levels of the diterpene
   precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate, for increased flux through the steviol
   biosynthetic pathway. In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains a
   genetic construct to silence the expression of non-steviol pathways consuming
   geranylgeranyl diphosphate, ent-Kaurenoic acid or farnesyl pyrophosphate, thereby
10 providing increased flux through the steviol and steviol glycosides biosynthetic
   pathways. For example, flux to sterol production pathways such as ergosterol may be
   reduced by downregulation of the ERG9 gene. In cells that produce gibberellins,
   gibberellin synthesis may be downregulated to increase flux of ent-kaurenoic acid to
   steviol. In carotenoid-producing organisms, flux to steviol may be increased by
15 downregulation of one or more carotenoid biosynthetic genes. In some embodiments,
   the recombinant host further contains and expresses recombinant genes involved in
   diterpene biosynthesis or production of terpenoid precursors, e.g., genes in the MEP
   or MEV pathways discussed below.
            In some embodiments, a recombinant host such as a microorganism produces
20 rebaudioside D-enriched steviol glycoside compositions that have greater than at least
   3% rebaudioside D by weight total steviol glycosides, e.g., at least 4% rebaudioside D
   at least 5% rebaudioside D, 10-20% rebaudioside D, 20-30% rebaudioside D, 30-40%
   rebaudioside D, 40-50% rebaudioside D, 50-60% rebaudioside D, 60-70%
   rebaudioside D, 70-80% rebaudioside D . In some embodiments, a recombinant host
25 such as a microorganism produces steviol glycoside compositions that have at least
   90% rebaudioside D, e.g., 90-99% rebaudioside D. Other steviol glycosides present
   may include those depicted in Figure 2 C such as steviol monosides, steviol
   glucobiosides, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside E, and stevioside. In some embodiments,
   the rebaudioside D-enriched composition produced by the host (e.g., microorganism)
30 can be further purified and the rebaudioside D or rebaudioside E so purified can then
   be mixed with other steviol glycosides, flavors, or sweeteners to obtain a desired
   flavor system or sweetening composition. For instance, a rebaudioside D-enriched
                                               30

   composition produced by a recombinant host can be combined with a rebaudioside A,
   C, or F-enriched composition produced by a different recombinant host, with
   rebaudioside A, F, or C purified from a Stevia extract, or with rebaudioside A, F, or C
   produced in vitro.
 5
   B. 5    Rebaudioside F Biosynthesis Polypeptides
           The biosynthesis of rebaudioside F involves glucosylation and xylosylation of
   the aglycone steviol. Specifically, rebaudioside F can be formed by glucosylation of
   the 13-OH of steviol which forms steviol-13-0-glucoside, xylosylation of the C-2' of
10 the 13-0-glucose of steviol-13-0-glucoside which forms steviol-1,2-xylobioside,
   glucosylation of the C-19 carboxyl of the 1,2-xylobioside to form 1,2-stevioxyloside,
   and glucosylation of the C-3' of the C-13-0-glucose of 1,2-stevioxyloside to form
   rebaudioside F. The order in which each glycosylation reaction occurs can vary. See
   FIG. 2D.
15         It has been discovered that conversion of steviol to rebaudioside F in a
   recombinant host can be accomplished by the expression of genes encoding the
   following functional UGTs: 85C2, 91D2, 74G1 and 76G1, along with endogenous or
   recombinantly expressed UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronic acid
   decarboxylase. Thus, a recombinant microorganism expressing these four UGTs
20 along with endogenous or recombinant UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and UDP
   glucuronic acid decarboxylase can make rebaudioside F when fed steviol in the
   medium. Alternatively, a recombinant microorganism expressing two functional
   UGTs, 91D2 and 76G1, can make rebaudioside F when fed rubusoside in the medium.
   As another alternative, a recombinant microorganism expressing a functional UGT
25 76G1 can make rebaudioside F when fed 1,2 steviorhamnoside. As another
   alternative, a recombinant microorganism expressing three functional UGTs, 74G1,
   91D2 and 76G1, can make rebaudioside F when fed the monoside, steviol-13-0
   glucoside, in the medium. Similarly, conversion of steviol-19-0-glucoside to
   rebaudioside F in a recombinant microorganism can be accomplished by the
30 expression of genes encoding UGTs 85C2, 91D2 and 76G1 when fed steviol-19-0
   glucoside. Typically, one or more of these genes are recombinant genes that have been
   transformed into a host that does not naturally possess them.
                                              31

            Suitable UGT91D2, UGT74G1, UGT76G1 and UGT85C2 polypeptides
   include the functional UGT polypeptides discussed herein. In some embodiments, a
   UGT79B3 polypeptide is substituted for a UGT91, as discussed above. UDP-glucose
   dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase provide increased amounts of
 5 the UDP-xylose donor for xylosylation of the steviol compound acceptor. Suitable
   UDP-glucose dehydrogenases and UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylases include those
   made by Arabidopsis thaliana or Cryptococcus neoformans. For example, suitable
   UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylases polypeptides
   can be encoded by the A. thalianaUGD 1 gene and UXS3 gene, respectively. See,
10 Oka and Jigami, FEBS J. 273:2645-2657 (2006).
           In some embodiments rebaudioside F can be produced using in vitro methods
   while supplying the appropriate UDP-sugar or a cell-free system for regeneration of
   UDP-sugars. See, for example, Jewett MC, et al. Molecular Systems Biology, Vol. 4,
   article 220 (2008). Reactions may be carried out together, or stepwise. For instance,
15 rebaudioside F may be produced from rubusoside with the addition of stoichiometric
   amounts of UDP-xylose and UGT91D2e, followed by addition of UGT76G1 and an
   excess or stoichiometric supply of UDP-glucose. In some embodiments phosphatases
   are used to remove secondary products and improve the reaction yields.
           In other embodiments, the recombinant host expresses one or more genes
20 involved in steviol biosynthesis, e.g., a CDPS gene, a KS gene, a KO gene and/or a
   KAH gene. Thus, for example, a microorganism containing a CDPS gene, a KS gene,
   a KO gene and a KAH gene, in addition to a UGT85C2, a UGT74G1, a UGT91D2
   gene and a UGT76G1 gene, is capable of producing rebaudioside F without the
   necessity for including steviol in the culture media. In addition, the recombinant host
25 typically expresses an endogenous or a recombinant gene encoding a UDP-glucose
   dehydrogenase and a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase. Such genes are useful in
   order to provide increased amounts of the UDP-xylose donor for xylosylation of the
   steviol compound acceptor. Suitable UDP-glucose dehydrogenases and UDP
   glucuronic acid decarboxylases include those made by Arabidopsis thalianaor
30 Cryptococcus neoformans. For example, suitable UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and
   UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylases polypeptides can be encoded by the A. thaliana
                                               32

   UGD1 gene and UXS3 gene, respectively. See, Oka and Jigami, FEBS J. 273:2645
   2657 (2006).
            One with skill in the art will recognize that by modulating relative expression
   levels of different UGT genes as well as modulating the availability of UDP-xylose, a
 5 recombinant microorganism can be tailored to specifically produce steviol and steviol
   glycoside products in a desired proportion. Transcriptional regulation of steviol
   biosynthesis genes can be achieved by a combination of transcriptional activation and
   repression using techniques known to those in the art. For in vitro reactions, one with
   skill in the art will recognize that addition of different levels of UGT enzymes in
10 combination or under conditions which impact the relative activities of the different
   UGTS in combination will direct synthesis towards a desired proportion of each
   steviol glycosides.
            In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains and expresses a
   recombinant GGPPS gene in order to provide increased levels of the diterpene
15 precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate, for increased flux through the steviol
   biosynthetic pathway. In some embodiments, the recombinant host further contains a
   genetic construct to silence the expression of non-steviol pathways consuming
   geranylgeranyl diphosphate, ent-Kaurenoic acid or farnesyl pyrophosphate, thereby
   providing increased flux through the steviol and steviol glycosides biosynthetic
20 pathways. For example, flux to sterol production pathways such as ergosterol may be
   reduced by downregulation of the ERG9 gene. In cells that produce gibberellins,
   gibberellin synthesis may be downregulated to increase flux of ent-kaurenoic acid to
   steviol. In carotenoid-producing organisms, flux to steviol may be increased by
   downregulation of one or more carotenoid biosynthetic genes. In some embodiments,
25 the recombinant host further contains and expresses recombinant genes involved in
   diterpene biosynthesis, e.g., genes in the MEP pathway discussed below.
            In some embodiments, a recombinant host such as a microorganism produces
   rebaudioside F-enriched steviol glycoside compositions that have greater than at least
   4% rebaudioside F by weight total steviol glycosides, e.g., at least 5% rebaudioside F,
30 at least 6% of rebaudioside F, 10-20% rebaudioside F, 20-30% rebaudioside F, 30
   40% rebaudioside F, 40-50% rebaudioside F, 50-60% rebaudioside F, 60-70%
   rebaudioside F, 70-80% rebaudioside F. In some embodiments, a recombinant host
                                                33

   such as a microorganism produces steviol glycoside compositions that have at least
   90% rebaudioside F, e.g., 90-99% rebaudioside F. Other steviol glycosides present
   may include those depicted in Figure 2 A and D such as steviol monosides, steviol
   glucobiosides, steviol xylobiosides, rebaudioside A, stevioxyloside, rubusoside and
 5 stevioside. In some embodiments, the rebaudioside F-enriched composition produced
   by the host can be mixed with other steviol glycosides, flavors, or sweeteners to
   obtain a desired flavor system or sweetening composition. For instance, a
   rebaudioside F-enriched composition produced by a recombinant microorganism can
   be combined with a rebaudioside A, C, or D-enriched composition produced by a
10 different recombinant microorganism, with rebaudioside A, C, or D purified from a
   Stevia extract, or with rebaudioside A, C, or D produced in vitro.
            C.      Other Polypeptides
            Genes for additional polypeptides whose expression facilitates more efficient
   or larger scale production of steviol or a steviol glycoside can also be introduced into
15 a recombinant host. For example, a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell
   can also contain one or more genes encoding a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase
   (GGPPS, also referred to as GGDPS). As another example, the recombinant host can
   contain one or more genes encoding a rhamnose synthetase, or one or more genes
   encoding a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and/or a UDP-glucuronic acid
20 decarboxylase. As another example, a recombinant host can also contain one or more
   genes encoding a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Expression of a recombinant
   CPR facilitates the cycling of NADP+ to regenerate NADPH, which is utilized as a
   cofactor for terpenoid biosynthesis. Other methods can be used to regenerate NADHP
   levels as well. In circumstances where NADPH becomes limiting; strains can be
25 further modified to include exogenous transhydrogenase genes. See, e.g., Sauer et al.,
   J. Biol. Chem. 279: 6613-6619 (2004). Other methods are known to those with skill
   in the art to reduce or otherwise modify the ratio of NADH/NADPH such that the
   desired cofactor level is increased.
           As another example, the recombinant host can contain one or more genes
30 encoding one or more enzymes in the MEP pathway or the mevalonate pathway.
   Such genes are useful because they can increase the flux of carbon into the diterpene
                                                34

   biosynthesis pathway, producing geranylgeranyl diphosphate from isopentenyl
   diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate generated by the pathway. The
   geranylgeranyl diphosphate so produced can be directed towards steviol and steviol
   glycoside biosynthesis due to expression of steviol biosynthesis polypeptides and
 5 steviol glycoside biosynthesis polypeptides.
   C. 1    MEP Biosynthesis Polypeptides
           In some embodiments, a recombinant host contains one or more genes
   encoding enzymes involved in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for
10 isoprenoid biosynthesis. Enzymes in the MEP pathway include deoxyxylulose 5
   phosphate synthase (DXS), D-1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR),
   4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (CMS), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2
   C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
   2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MCS), 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2(E)-butenyl 4
15 diphosphate synthase (HDS) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate
   reductase (HDR). One or more DXS genes, DXR genes, CMS genes, CMK genes,
   MCS genes, HDS genes and/or HDR genes can be incorporated into a recombinant
   microorganism. See, Rodriguez-Concepci6n and Boronat, Plant Phys. 130: 1079
    1089 (2002).
20         Suitable genes encoding DXS, DXR, CMS, CMK, MCS, HDS and/or HDR
   polypeptides include those made by E. coli, Arabidopsis thalianaand Synechococcus
   leopoliensis. Nucleotide sequences encoding DXR polypeptides are described, for
   example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,335,815.
25 C. 2    Mevalonate Biosynthesis Polypeptides
           In some embodiments, a recombinant host contains one or more genes
   encoding enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis.
   Genes suitable for transformation into a host encode enzymes in the mevalonate
   pathway such as a truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase
30 (tHMG), and/or a gene encoding a mevalonate kinase (MK), and/or a gene encoding a
   phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and/or a gene encoding a mevalonate
   pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MPPD). Thus, one or more HMG-CoA reductase
                                             35

   genes, MK genes, PMK genes, and/or MPPD genes can be incorporated into a
   recombinant host such as a microorganism.
            Suitable genes encoding mevalonate pathway polypeptides are known. For
   example, suitable polypeptides include those made by E. coli, Paracoccus
 5 denitrificans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Arabidopsis thaliana,Kitasatospora
   griseola,Homo sapiens, Drosophilamelanogaster,Gallus gallus, Streptomyces sp.
   KO-3988, Nicotiana attenuata,Kitasatosporagriseola,Hevea brasiliensis,
   Enterococcusfaecium and Haematococcuspluvialis. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.
   7,183,089, 5,460,949, and 5,306,862.
10
   D.      Functional Homologs
           Functional homologs of the polypeptides described above are also suitable for
   use in producing steviol or steviol glycosides in a recombinant host. A functional
   homolog is a polypeptide that has sequence similarity to a reference polypeptide, and
15 that carries out one or more of the biochemical or physiological function(s) of the
   reference polypeptide. A functional homolog and the reference polypeptide may be
   natural occurring polypeptides, and the sequence similarity may be due to convergent
   or divergent evolutionary events. As such, functional homologs are sometimes
   designated in the literature as homologs, or orthologs, or paralogs. Variants of a
20 naturally occurring functional homolog, such as polypeptides encoded by mutants of a
   wild type coding sequence, may themselves be functional homologs. Functional
   homologs can also be created via site-directed mutagenesis of the coding sequence for
   a polypeptide, or by combining domains from the coding sequences for different
   naturally-occurring polypeptides ("domain swapping"). Techniques for modifying
25 genes encoding functional UGT polypeptides described herein are known and include,
   inter alia, directed evolution techniques, site-directed mutagenesis techniques and
   random mutagenesis techniques, and can be useful to increase specific activity of a
   polypeptide, alter substrate specificity, alter expression levels, alter subcellular
   location, or modify polypeptide:polypeptide interactions in a desired manner. Such
30 modified polypeptides are considered functional homologs. The term "functional
   homolog" is sometimes applied to the nucleic acid that encodes a functionally
   homologous polypeptide.
                                                36

           Functional homologs can be identified by analysis of nucleotide and
   polypeptide sequence alignments. For example, performing a query on a database of
   nucleotide or polypeptide sequences can identify homologs of steviol or steviol
   glycoside biosynthesis polypeptides. Sequence analysis can involve BLAST,
 5 Reciprocal BLAST, or PSI-BLAST analysis of nonredundant databases using a
   GGPPS, a CDPS, a KS, a KO or a KAH amino acid sequence as the reference
   sequence. Amino acid sequence is, in some instances, deduced from the nucleotide
   sequence. Those polypeptides in the database that have greater than 40% sequence
   identity are candidates for further evaluation for suitability as a steviol or steviol
10 glycoside biosynthesis polypeptide. Amino acid sequence similarity allows for
   conservative amino acid substitutions, such as substitution of one hydrophobic residue
   for another or substitution of one polar residue for another. If desired, manual
   inspection of such candidates can be carried out in order to narrow the number of
   candidates to be further evaluated. Manual inspection can be performed by selecting
15 those candidates that appear to have domains present in steviol biosynthesis
   polypeptides, e.g., conserved functional domains.
            Conserved regions can be identified by locating a region within the primary
   amino acid sequence of a steviol or a steviol glycoside biosynthesis polypeptide that
   is a repeated sequence, forms some secondary structure (e.g., helices and beta sheets),
20 establishes positively or negatively charged domains, or represents a protein motif or
   domain. See, e.g., the Pfam web site describing consensus sequences for a variety of
   protein motifs and domains on the World Wide Web at sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/
   and pfam.janelia.org/. The information included at the Pfam database is described in
   Sonnhammer et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 26:320-322 (1998); Sonnhammer et al.,
25 Proteins, 28:405-420 (1997); and Bateman et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 27:260-262
   (1999). Conserved regions also can be determined by aligning sequences of the same
   or related polypeptides from closely related species. Closely related species
   preferably are from the same family. In some embodiments, alignment of sequences
   from two different species is adequate.
30         Typically, polypeptides that exhibit at least about 40% amino acid sequence
   identity are useful to identify conserved regions. Conserved regions of related
   polypeptides exhibit at least 45% amino acid sequence identity (e.g., at least 50%, at
                                               37

   least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% amino acid sequence identity).
   In some embodiments, a conserved region exhibits at least 92%, 94%, 96%, 98%, or
   99% amino acid sequence identity.
            For example, polypeptides suitable for producing steviol glycosides in a
 5 recombinant host include functional homologs of UGT91D2e, UGT91D2m,
   UGT85C, and UGT76G. Such homologs have greater than 90% (e.g., at least 95% or
   99%) sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of UGT91D2e (SEQ ID NO:5),
   UGT91D2m (SEQ ID NO:10), UGT85C (SEQ ID NO:3), or UGT76G (SEQ ID
   NO:7). Variants of UGT91D2, UGT85C, and UGT76G polypeptides typically have
10  10 or fewer amino acid substitutions within the primary amino acid sequence, e.g., 7
   or fewer amino acid substitutions, 5 or conservative amino acid substitutions, or
   between 1 and 5 substitutions. However, in some embodiments, variants of
   UGT91D2, UGT85C, and UGT76G polypeptides can have 10 or more amino acid
   substitutions (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 10-20, 10-35, 20-30, or 25-35 amino acid
15 substitutions). The substitutions may be conservative, or in some embodiments, non
   conservative. Non-limiting examples of non-conservative changes in UGT91D2e
   polypeptides include glycine to arginine and tryptophan to arginine. Non-limiting
   examples of non-conservative substitutions in UGT76G polypeptides include valine
   to glutamic acid, glycine to glutamic acid, glutamine to alanine, and serine to proline.
20 Non-limiting examples of changes to UGT85C polypeptides include histidine to
   aspartic acid, proline to serine, lysine to threonine, and threonine to arginine.
            In some embodiments, a useful UGT91D2 homolog can have amino acid
   substitutions (e.g., conservative amino acid substitutions) in regions of the
   polypeptide that are outside of predicted loops, e.g., residues 20-26, 39-43, 88-95,
25  121-124, 142-158, 185-198, and 203-214 are predicted loops in the N-terminal
   domain and residues 381-386 are predicted loops in the C-terminal domain of SEQ ID
   NO:5. For example, a useful UGT91D2 homolog can include at least one amino acid
   substitution at residues 1-19, 27-38, 44-87, 96-120, 125-141, 159-184, 199-202, 215
   380, or 387-473 of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, a UGT91D2 homolog can
30 have an amino acid substitution at one or more residues selected from the group
   consisting of residues 30, 93, 99, 122, 140, 142, 148, 153, 156, 195, 196, 199, 206,
   207, 211, 221, 286, 343, 427, and 438 of SEQ ID NO:5. For example, a UGT91D2
                                                 38

   functional homolog can have an amino acid substitution at one or more of residues
   206, 207, and 343, such as an arginine at residue 206, a cysteine at residue 207, and
   an arginine at residue 343 of SEQ ID NO:5. See, SEQ ID NO:95. Other functional
   homologs of UGT91D2 can have one or more of the following: a tyrosine or
 5 phenylalanine at residue 30, a proline or glutamine at residue 93, a serine or valine at
   residue 99, a tyrosine or a phenylalanine at residue 122, a histidine or tyrosine at
   residue 140, a serine or cysteine at residue 142, an alanine or threonine at residue 148,
   a methionine at residue 152, an alanine at residue 153, an alanine or serine at residue
    156, a glycine at residue 162, a leucine or methionine at residue 195, a glutamic acid
10 at residue 196, a lysine or glutamic acid at residue 199, a leucine or methionine at
   residue 211, a leucine at residue 213, a serine or phenylalanine at residue 221, a valine
   or isoleucine at residue 253, a valine or alanine at residue 286, a lysine or asparagine
   at residue 427, an alanine at residue 438, and either an alanine or threonine at residue
   462 of SEQ ID NO:5. See, Examples 11 and 16, and Tables 12 and 14. A useful
15 variant UGT91D2 polypeptide also can be constructed based on the alignment set
   forth in Figure 8.
            In some embodiments, a useful UGT85C homolog can have one or more
   amino acid substitutions at residues 9, 10, 13, 15, 21, 27, 60, 65, 71, 87, 91, 220, 243,
   270, 289, 298, 334, 336, 350, 368, 389, 394, 397, 418, 420, 440, 441, 444, and 471 of
20 SEQ ID NO:3. Non-limiting examples of useful UGT85C homologs include
   polypeptides having substitutions (with respect to SEQ ID NO:3) at residue 65; at
   residue 65 in combination with residue 15, 270, 418, 440, or 441; residues 13, 15, 60,
   270, 289, and 418; substitutions at residues 13, 60, and 270; substitutions at residues
   60 and 87; substitutions at residues 65, 71, 220, 243, and 270; substitutions at residues
25 65, 71, 220, 243, 270, and 441; substitutions at residues 65, 71, 220, 389, and 394;
   substitutions at residues 65, 71, 270, and 289; substitutions at residues 220, 243, 270,
   and 334; or substitutions at residues 270 and 289. See, Example 17 and Table 15.
            In some embodiments, a useful UGT76G homolog can have one or more
   amino acid substitutions at residues 29, 74, 87, 91, 116, 123, 125, 126, 130, 145, 192,
30  193,194,196,198, 199,200,203,204,205,206,207,208,266,273,274,284,285,
   291, 330, 331, and 346 of SEQ ID NO:7. Non-limiting examples of useful UGT76G
   homologs include polypeptides having substitutions (with respect to SEQ ID NO:7) at
                                                39

   residues 74 , 87, 91, 116, 123, 125, 126, 130, 145, 192, 193, 194, 196, 198, 199, 200,
   203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, and 291; residues 74 , 87, 91, 116, 123, 125, 126, 130,
    145, 192, 193, 194, 196, 198, 199,200,203,204,205,206,207,208,266,273,274,
   284, 285, and 291; or residues 74 , 87, 91, 116, 123, 125, 126, 130, 145, 192, 193,
 5  194, 196, 198, 199,200,203,204,205,206,207,208,266,273,274,284,285,291,
   330, 331, and 346. See, Example 18 and Table 16.
           Methods to modify the substrate specificity of, for example UGT9 1D2e, are
   known to those skilled in the art, and include without limitation site-directed/rational
   mutagenesis approaches, random directed evolution approaches and combinations in
10 which random mutagenesis/saturation techniques are performed near the active site of
   the enzyme. For example see Sarah A. Osmani, et al. Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 325
   347.
           A candidate sequence typically has a length that is from 80 percent to 200
   percent of the length of the reference sequence, e.g., 82, 85, 87, 89, 90, 93, 95, 97, 99,
15  100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 percent of the
   length of the reference sequence. A percent identity for any candidate nucleic acid or
   polypeptide relative to a reference nucleic acid or polypeptide can be determined as
   follows. A reference sequence (e.g., a nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid
   sequence) is aligned to one or more candidate sequences using the computer program
20 ClustalW (version 1.83, default parameters), which allows alignments of nucleic acid
   or polypeptide sequences to be carried out across their entire length (global
   alignment). Chenna et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 31(13):3497-500 (2003).
           ClustalW calculates the best match between a reference and one or more
   candidate sequences, and aligns them so that identities, similarities and differences
25 can be determined. Gaps of one or more residues can be inserted into a reference
   sequence, a candidate sequence, or both, to maximize sequence alignments. For fast
   pairwise alignment of nucleic acid sequences, the following default parameters are
   used: word size: 2; window size: 4; scoring method: percentage; number of top
   diagonals: 4; and gap penalty: 5. For multiple alignment of nucleic acid sequences,
30 the following parameters are used: gap opening penalty: 10.0; gap extension penalty:
   5.0; and weight transitions: yes. For fast pairwise alignment of protein sequences, the
   following parameters are used: word size: 1; window size: 5; scoring method:
                                               40

   percentage; number of top diagonals: 5; gap penalty: 3. For multiple alignment of
   protein sequences, the following parameters are used: weight matrix: blosum; gap
   opening penalty: 10.0; gap extension penalty: 0.05; hydrophilic gaps: on; hydrophilic
   residues: Gly, Pro, Ser, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, Arg, and Lys; residue-specific gap
 5 penalties: on. The ClustalW output is a sequence alignment that reflects the
   relationship between sequences. ClustalW can be run, for example, at the Baylor
   College of Medicine Search Launcher site on the World Wide Web
   (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/multi-align/multi-align.html) and at the European
   Bioinformatics Institute site on the World Wide Web (ebi.ac.uk/clustalw).
10          To determine percent identity of a candidate nucleic acid or amino acid
   sequence to a reference sequence, the sequences are aligned using ClustalW, the
   number of identical matches in the alignment is divided by the length of the reference
   sequence, and the result is multiplied by 100. It is noted that the percent identity
   value can be rounded to the nearest tenth. For example, 78.11, 78.12, 78.13, and
15 78.14 are rounded down to 78.1, while 78.15, 78.16, 78.17, 78.18, and 78.19 are
   rounded up to 78.2.
            It will be appreciated that a functional UGT9 1D2 polypeptide can include
   additional amino acids that are not involved in glucosylation or other enzymatic
   activities carried out by UGT9 1D2, and thus such a polypeptide can be longer than
20 would otherwise be the case. For example, a UGT91D2 polypeptide can include a
   purification tag, a chloroplast transit peptide, a mitochondrial transit peptide, an
   amyloplast peptide, signal peptide, or a secretion tag added to the amino or carboxy
   terminus. In some embodiments, a UGT9 1D2 polypeptide includes an amino acid
   sequence that functions as a reporter, e.g., a green fluorescent protein or yellow
25 fluorescent protein.
   II.    Steviol and Steviol Glycoside Biosynthesis Nucleic Acids
            A recombinant gene encoding a polypeptide described herein comprises the
   coding sequence for that polypeptide, operably linked in sense orientation to one or
30 more regulatory regions suitable for expressing the polypeptide. Because many
   microorganisms are capable of expressing multiple gene products from a polycistronic
   mRNA, multiple polypeptides can be expressed under the control of a single
                                                 41

   regulatory region for those microorganisms, if desired. A coding sequence and a
   regulatory region are considered to be operably linked when the regulatory region and
   coding sequence are positioned so that the regulatory region is effective for regulating
   transcription or translation of the sequence. Typically, the translation initiation site of
 5 the translational reading frame of the coding sequence is positioned between one and
   about fifty nucleotides downstream of the regulatory region for a monocistronic gene.
            In many cases, the coding sequence for a polypeptide described herein is
   identified in a species other than the recombinant host, i.e., is a heterologous nucleic
   acid. Thus, if the recombinant host is a microorganism, the coding sequence can be
10 from other prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganisms, from plants or from animals.
   In some case, however, the coding sequence is a sequence that is native to the host
   and is being reintroduced into that organism. A native sequence can often be
   distinguished from the naturally occurring sequence by the presence of non-natural
   sequences linked to the exogenous nucleic acid, e.g., non-native regulatory sequences
15 flanking a native sequence in a recombinant nucleic acid construct. In addition, stably
   transformed exogenous nucleic acids typically are integrated at positions other than
   the position where the native sequence is found.
            "Regulatory region" refers to a nucleic acid having nucleotide sequences that
   influence transcription or translation initiation and rate, and stability and/or mobility
20 of a transcription or translation product. Regulatory regions include, without
   limitation, promoter sequences, enhancer sequences, response elements, protein
   recognition sites, inducible elements, protein binding sequences, 5' and 3'
   untranslated regions (UTRs), transcriptional start sites, termination sequences,
   polyadenylation sequences, introns, and combinations thereof. A regulatory region
25 typically comprises at least a core (basal) promoter. A regulatory region also may
   include at least one control element, such as an enhancer sequence, an upstream
   element or an upstream activation region (UAR). A regulatory region is operably
   linked to a coding sequence by positioning the regulatory region and the coding
   sequence so that the regulatory region is effective for regulating transcription or
30 translation of the sequence. For example, to operably link a coding sequence and a
   promoter sequence, the translation initiation site of the translational reading frame of
   the coding sequence is typically positioned between one and about fifty nucleotides
                                                42

   downstream of the promoter. A regulatory region can, however, be positioned as
   much as about 5,000 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site, or about
   2,000 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site.
            The choice of regulatory regions to be included depends upon several factors,
 5 including, but not limited to, efficiency, selectability, inducibility, desired expression
   level, and preferential expression during certain culture stages. It is a routine matter
   for one of skill in the art to modulate the expression of a coding sequence by
   appropriately selecting and positioning regulatory regions relative to the coding
   sequence. It will be understood that more than one regulatory region may be present,
10 e.g., introns, enhancers, upstream activation regions, transcription terminators, and
   inducible elements.
            One or more genes can be combined in a recombinant nucleic acid construct in
   "modules" useful for a discrete aspect of steviol and/or steviol glycoside production.
   Combining a plurality of genes in a module, particularly a polycistronic module,
15 facilitates the use of the module in a variety of species. For example, a steviol
   biosynthesis gene cluster, or a UGT gene cluster, can be combined in a polycistronic
   module such that, after insertion of a suitable regulatory region, the module can be
   introduced into a wide variety of species. As another example, a UGT gene cluster
   can be combined such that each UGT coding sequence is operably linked to a separate
20 regulatory region, to form a UGT module. Such a module can be used in those
   species for which monocistronic expression is necessary or desirable. In addition to
   genes useful for steviol or steviol glycoside production, a recombinant construct
   typically also contains an origin of replication, and one or more selectable markers for
   maintenance of the construct in appropriate species.
25          It will be appreciated that because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a
   number of nucleic acids can encode a particular polypeptide; i.e., for many amino
   acids, there is more than one nucleotide triplet that serves as the codon for the amino
   acid. Thus, codons in the coding sequence for a given polypeptide can be modified
   such that optimal expression in a particular host is obtained, using appropriate codon
30 bias tables for that host (e.g., microorganism). SEQ IDNOs:18-25, 34-36, 40-43, 48
   49, 52-55, 60-64, and 70-72 set forth nucleotide sequences encoding certain enzymes
   for steviol and steviol glycoside biosynthesis, modified for increased expression in
                                                43

   yeast. As isolated nucleic acids, these modified sequences can exist as purified
   molecules and can be incorporated into a vector or a virus for use in constructing
   modules for recombinant nucleic acid constructs.
           In some cases, it is desirable to inhibit one or more functions of an
 5 endogenous polypeptide in order to divert metabolic intermediates towards steviol or
   steviol glycoside biosynthesis. For example, it may be desirable to downregulate
   synthesis of sterols in a yeast strain in order to further increase steviol or steviol
   glycoside production, e.g., by downregulating squalene epoxidase. As another
   example, it may be desirable to inhibit degradative functions of certain endogenous
10 gene products, e.g., glycohydrolases that remove glucose moieties from secondary
   metabolites. As another example, expression of membrane transporters involved in
   transport of steviol glycosides can be inhibited, such that secretion of glycosylated
   steviosides is inhibited. Such regulation can be beneficial in that secretion of steviol
   glycosides can be inhibited for a desired period of time during culture of the
15 microorganism, thereby increasing the yield of glycoside product(s) at harvest. In
   such cases, a nucleic acid that inhibits expression of the polypeptide or gene product
   may be included in a recombinant construct that is transformed into the strain.
   Alternatively, mutagenesis can be used to generate mutants in genes for which it is
   desired to inhibit function.
20 III.    Hosts
   A.      Microorganisms
           A number of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are suitable for use in constructing
   the recombinant microorganisms described herein, e.g., gram-negative bacteria, yeast
   and fungi. A species and strain selected for use as a steviol or steviol glycoside
25 production strain is first analyzed to determine which production genes are
   endogenous to the strain and which genes are not present. Genes for which an
   endogenous counterpart is not present in the strain are assembled in one or more
   recombinant constructs, which are then transformed into the strain in order to supply
   the missing function(s).
30         Exemplary prokaryotic and eukaryotic species are described in more detail
   below. However, it will be appreciated that other species may be suitable. For
                                                44

    example, suitable species may be in a genus selected from the group consisting of
    Agaricus, Aspergillus, Bacillus, Candida, Corynebacterium,Escherichia,
    Fusarium/Gibberella,Kluyveromyces, Laetiporus, Lentinus, Phaffia,Phanerochaete,
    Pichia,Physcomitrella,Rhodoturula, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces,
 5  Sphaceloma, Xanthophyllomyces and Yarrowia. Exemplary species from such genera
    include Lentinus tigrinus, Laetiporus sulphureus, Phanerochaetechrysosporium,
    Pichiapastoris,Physcomitrellapatens, Rhodoturulaglutinis 32, Rhodoturula
    mucilaginosa,Phaffia rhodozyma UBV-AX, Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous,
    Fusariumfujikuroi/Gibberellafujikuroi,Candida utilis and Yarrowia lipolytica. In
10  some embodiments, a microorganism can be an Ascomycete such as Gibberella
   fujikuroi, Kluyveromyces lactis, Schizosaccharomycespombe, Aspergillus niger, or
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In some embodiments, a microorganism can be a
    prokaryote such as Escherichiacoli, Rhodobactersphaeroides, or Rhodobacter
    capsulatus. It will be appreciated that certain microorganisms can be used to screen
15  and test genes of interest in a high throughput manner, while other microorganisms
    with desired productivity or growth characteristics can be used for large-scale
    production of steviol glycosides.
            Saccharomyces cerevisiae
            Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis a widely used chassis organism in synthetic
20  biology, and can be used as the recombinant microorganism platform. There are
    libraries of mutants, plasmids, detailed computer models of metabolism and other
    information available for S. cerevisiae, allowing for rational design of various
    modules to enhance product yield. Methods are known for making recombinant
    microorganisms.
25          A steviol biosynthesis gene cluster can be expressed in yeast using any of a
    number of known promoters. Strains that overproduce terpenes are known and can be
    used to increase the amount of geranylgeranyl diphosphate available for steviol and
    steviol glycoside production.
            Aspergillus spp.
30          Aspergillus species such as A. oryzae, A. niger and A. sojae are widely used
    microorganisms in food production, and can also be used as the recombinant
    microorganism platform. Nucleotide sequences are available for genomes of A.
                                                45

   nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. oryzae, A. clavatus, A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus,
   allowing rational design and modification of endogenous pathways to enhance flux
   and increase product yield. Metabolic models have been developed for Aspergillus,
   as well as transcriptomic studies and proteomics studies. A. niger is cultured for the
 5 industrial production of a number of food ingredients such as citric acid and gluconic
   acid, and thus species such as A. niger are generally suitable for the production of
   food ingredients such as steviol and steviol glycosides. Example 23 describes cloning
   methodology for production of steviol glycosides in Aspergillus nidulans.
           Escherichiacoli
10         Escherichiacoli, another widely used platform organism in synthetic biology,
   can also be used as the recombinant microorganism platform. Similar to
   Saccharomyces, there are libraries of mutants, plasmids, detailed computer models of
   metabolism and other information available for E. coli, allowing for rational design of
   various modules to enhance product yield. Methods similar to those described above
15 for Saccharomyces can be used to make recombinant E. coli microorganisms.
           Agaricus, Gibberella, and Phanerochaetespp.
           Agaricus, Gibberella, and Phanerochaetespp. can be useful because they are
   known to produce large amounts of gibberellin in culture. Thus, the terpene
   precursors for producing large amounts of steviol and steviol glycosides are already
20 produced by endogenous genes. Thus, modules containing recombinant genes for
   steviol or steviol glycoside biosynthesis polypeptides can be introduced into species
   from such genera without the necessity of introducing mevalonate or MEP pathway
   genes.
           Rhodobacter spp.
25         Rhodobacter can be use as the recombinant microorganism platform. Similar
   to E. coli, there are libraries of mutants available as well as suitable plasmid vectors,
   allowing for rational design of various modules to enhance product yield. Isoprenoid
   pathways have been engineered in membraneous bacterial species of Rhodobacter for
   increased production of carotenoid and CoQ10. See, U.S. Patent Publication Nos.
30 20050003474 and 20040078846. Methods similar to those described above for E. coli
   can be used to make recombinant Rhodobactermicroorganisms.
           Physcomitrellaspp.
                                                46

            Physcomitrella mosses, when grown in suspension culture, have
   characteristics similar to yeast or other fungal cultures. This genera is becoming an
   important type of cell for production of plant secondary metabolites, which can be
   difficult to produce in other types of cells. Example 22 describes production of active
 5 UGT enzymes in the steviol glycoside pathway in P. patens.
   B.       Plant Cells or Plants
            In some embodiments, the nucleic acids and polypeptides described herein are
   introduced into plants or plant cells to increase overall steviol glycoside production or
10 enrich for the production of specific steviol glycosides in proportion to others. Thus,
   a host can be a plant or a plant cell that includes at least one recombinant gene
   described herein. A plant or plant cell can be transformed by having a recombinant
   gene integrated into its genome, i.e., can be stably transformed. Stably transformed
   cells typically retain the introduced nucleic acid with each cell division. A plant or
15 plant cell can also be transiently transformed such that the recombinant gene is not
   integrated into its genome. Transiently transformed cells typically lose all or some
   portion of the introduced nucleic acid with each cell division such that the introduced
   nucleic acid cannot be detected in daughter cells after a sufficient number of cell
   divisions. Both transiently transformed and stably transformed transgenic plants and
20 plant cells can be useful in the methods described herein.
            Transgenic plant cells used in methods described herein can constitute part or
   all of a whole plant. Such plants can be grown in a manner suitable for the species
   under consideration, either in a growth chamber, a greenhouse, or in a field.
   Transgenic plants can be bred as desired for a particular purpose, e.g., to introduce a
25 recombinant nucleic acid into other lines, to transfer a recombinant nucleic acid to
   other species, or for further selection of other desirable traits. Alternatively,
   transgenic plants can be propagated vegetatively for those species amenable to such
   techniques. As used herein, a transgenic plant also refers to progeny of an initial
   transgenic plant provided the progeny inherits the transgene. Seeds produced by a
30 transgenic plant can be grown and then selfed (or outcrossed and selfed) to obtain
   seeds homozygous for the nucleic acid construct.
                                                47

           Transgenic plants can be grown in suspension culture, or tissue or organ
   culture. For the purposes of this invention, solid and/or liquid tissue culture
   techniques can be used. When using solid medium, transgenic plant cells can be
   placed directly onto the medium or can be placed onto a filter that is then placed in
 5 contact with the medium. When using liquid medium, transgenic plant cells can be
   placed onto a flotation device, e.g., a porous membrane that contacts the liquid
   medium.
           When transiently transformed plant cells are used, a reporter sequence
   encoding a reporter polypeptide having a reporter activity can be included in the
10 transformation procedure and an assay for reporter activity or expression can be
   performed at a suitable time after transformation. A suitable time for conducting the
   assay typically is about 1-21 days after transformation, e.g., about 1-14 days, about 1
   7 days, or about 1-3 days. The use of transient assays is particularly convenient for
   rapid analysis in different species, or to confirm expression of a heterologous
15 polypeptide whose expression has not previously been confirmed in particular
   recipient cells.
           Techniques for introducing nucleic acids into monocotyledonous and
   dicotyledonous plants are known in the art, and include, without limitation,
   Agrobacterium-mediatedtransformation, viral vector-mediated transformation,
20 electroporation and particle gun transformation, U.S. Patent Nos 5,538,880;
   5,204,253; 6,329,571; and 6,013,863. If a cell or cultured tissue is used as the
   recipient tissue for transformation, plants can be regenerated from transformed
   cultures if desired, by techniques known to those skilled in the art.
           A population of transgenic plants can be screened and/or selected for those
25 members of the population that have a trait or phenotype conferred by expression of
   the transgene. For example, a population of progeny of a single transformation event
   can be screened for those plants having a desired level of expression of a steviol or
   steviol glycoside biosynthesis polypeptide or nucleic acid. Physical and biochemical
   methods can be used to identify expression levels. These include Southern analysis or
30 PCR amplification for detection of a polynucleotide; Northern blots, S1 RNase
   protection, primer-extension, or RT-PCR amplification for detecting RNA transcripts;
   enzymatic assays for detecting enzyme or ribozyme activity of polypeptides and
                                                48

   polynucleotides; and protein gel electrophoresis, Western blots, immunoprecipitation,
   and enzyme-linked immunoassays to detect polypeptides. Other techniques such as in
   situ hybridization, enzyme staining, and immunostaining also can be used to detect
   the presence or expression of polypeptides and/or nucleic acids. Methods for
 5 performing all of the referenced techniques are known. As an alternative, a
   population of plants comprising independent transformation events can be screened
   for those plants having a desired trait, such as production of a steviol glycoside or
   modulated biosynthesis of a steviol glycoside. Selection and/or screening can be
   carried out over one or more generations, and/or in more than one geographic
10 location. In some cases, transgenic plants can be grown and selected under conditions
   which induce a desired phenotype or are otherwise necessary to produce a desired
   phenotype in a transgenic plant. In addition, selection and/or screening can be applied
   during a particular developmental stage in which the phenotype is expected to be
   exhibited by the plant. Selection and/or screening can be carried out to choose those
15 transgenic plants having a statistically significant difference in a steviol glycoside
   level relative to a control plant that lacks the transgene.
            The nucleic acids, recombinant genes, and constructs described herein can be
   used to transform a number of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and plant
   cell systems. Non-limiting examples of suitable monocots include, for example,
20 cereal crops such as rice, rye, sorghum, millet, wheat, maize, and barley. The plant
   may be a non-cereal monocot such as asparagus, banana, or onion. The plant also
   may be a dicot such as stevia (Stevia rebaudiana),soybean, cotton, sunflower, pea,
   geranium, spinach, or tobacco. In some cases, the plant may contain the precursor
   pathways for phenyl phosphate production such as the mevalonate pathway, typically
25 found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The non-mevalonate pathway is more
   often found in plant plastids [Dubey, et al., 2003 J. Biosci. 28 637-646]. One with
   skill in the art may target expression of steviol glycoside biosynthesis polypeptides to
   the appropriate organelle through the use of leader sequences, such that steviol
   glycoside biosynthesis occurs in the desired location of the plant cell. One with skill
30 in the art will use appropriate promoters to direct synthesis, e.g., to the leaf of a plant,
   if so desired. Expression may also occur in tissue cultures such as callus culture or
   hairy root culture, if so desired.
                                                 49

           In one embodiment, one or more nucleic acid or polypeptides described herein
   are introduced into Stevia (e.g., Stevia rebaudiana)such that overall steviol glycoside
   biosynthesis is increased or that the the overall steviol glycoside composition is
   selectively enriched for one or more specific steviol glycosides. For example, one or
 5 more recombinant genes can be introduced into Stevia such that one or more of the
   following are expressed: a UGT91D enzyme such as UGT91D2e (e.g., SEQ ID NO:5
   or a functional homolog thereof), UGT91D2m (e.g., SEQ ID NO:10); a UGT85C
   enzyme such as a variant set forth in Table 15, or a UGT76G1 enzyme such as a
   variant set forth in Example 18. Nucleic acid constructs typically include a suitable
10 promoter (e.g., 35S, e35S, or ssRUBISCO promoters) operably linked to a nucleic
   acid encoding the UGT polypeptide. Nucleic acids can be introduced into Stevia by
   Agrobacterium-mediatedtransformation; electroporation-mediated gene transfer to
   protoplasts; or by particle bombardment. See, e.g., Singh, et al., Compendium of
   Transgenic Crop Plants: Transgenic Sugar, Tuber and Fiber, Edited by Chittaranjan
15 Kole and Timothy C. Hall, Blackwell Publishing Ltd. (2008), pp. 97-115. For particle
   bombardment of stevia leaf derived callus, the parameters can be as follows: 6 cm
   distance, 1100 psi He pressure, gold particles, and one bombardment.
            Stevia plants can be regenerated by somatic embryogenesis as described by
   Singh et al., 2008, supra. In particular, leaf segments (approximately 1-2cm long) can
20 be removed from 5 to 6-week-old in vitro raised plants and incubated (adaxial side
   down) on MS medium supplemented with B5 vitamins, 30 g sucrose and 3 g Gelrite.
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) can be used in combination with 6-benzyl
   adenine (BA), kinetin (KN), or zeatin. Proembryogenic masses appear after 8 weeks
   of subculture. Within 2-3 weeks of subcultures, somatic embryos will appear on the
25 surface of cultures. Embryos can be matured in medium containing BA in
   combination with 2,4-D, a-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), or indolbutyric acid (IBA).
   Mature somatic embryos that germinate and form plantlets can be excised from calli.
   After plantlets reach 3-4 weeks, the plantlets can be transferred to pots with
   vermiculite and grown for 6-8 weeks in growth chambers for acclimatization and
30 transferred to greenhouses.
           In one embodiment, steviol glycosides are produced in rice. Rice and maize
   are readily transformable using techniques such as Agrobacterium-mediated
                                               50

   transformation. Binary vector systems are commonly utilized for Agrobacterium
   exogenous gene introduction to monocots. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
   6,215,051 and 6,329,571. In a binary vector system, one vector contains the T-DNA
   region, which includes a gene of interest (e.g., a UGT described herein) and the other
 5 vector is a disarmed Ti plasmid containing the vir region. Co-integrated vectors and
   mobilizable vectors also can be used. The types and pretreatment of tissues to be
   transformed, the strain of Agrobacterium used, the duration of the inoculation, the
   prevention of overgrowth and necrosis by the Agrobacterium,can be readily adjusted
   by one of skill in the art. Immature embryo cells of rice can be prepared for
10 transformation with Agrobacterium using binary vectors. The culture medium used is
   supplemented with phenolic compounds. Alternatively, the transformation can be
   done inplanta using vacuum infiltration. See, for example, WO 2000037663, WO
   2000063400, and WO 2001012828.
   IV.     Methods of Producing Steviol and Steviol Glycosides
15         Recombinant hosts described herein can be used in methods to produce steviol
   or steviol glycosides. For example, if the recombinant host is a microorganism, the
   method can include growing the recombinant microorganism in a culture medium
   under conditions in which steviol and/or steviol glycoside biosynthesis genes are
   expressed. The recombinant microorganism may be grown in a fed batch or
20 continuous process. Typically, the recombinant microorganism is grown in a
   fermentor at a defined temperature(s) for a desired period of time. Depending on the
   particular microorganism used in the method, other recombinant genes such as
   isopentenyl biosynthesis genes and terpene synthase and cyclase genes may also be
   present and expressed.     Levels of substrates and intermediates, e.g., isopentenyl
25 diphosphate, dimethylallyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, kaurene and
   kaurenoic acid, can be determined by extracting samples from culture media for
   analysis according to published methods.
           After the recombinant microorganism has been grown in culture for the
   desired period of time, steviol and/or one or more steviol glycosides can then be
30 recovered from the culture using various techniques known in the art. If the
   recombinant host is a plant or plant cells, steviol or steviol glycosides can be extracted
                                                51

   from the plant tissue using various techniques known in the art. For example, a crude
   lysate of the cultured microorganism or plant tissue can be centrifuged to obtain a
   supernatant. The resulting supernatant can then be applied to a chromatography
   column, e.g., a C-18 column, and washed with water to remove hydrophilic
 5 compounds, followed by elution of the compound(s) of interest with a solvent such as
   methanol. The compound(s) can then be further purified by preparative HPLC. See
   also WO 2009/140394.
           The amount of steviol or steviol glycoside produced can be from about 1 mg/l
   to about 1,500 mg/l, e.g., about 1 to about 10 mg/l, about 3 to about 10 mg/l, about 5
10 to about 20 mg/l, about 10 to about 50 mg/l, about 10 to about 100 mg/l, about 25 to
   about 500 mg/l, about 100 to about 1,500 mg/l, or about 200 to about 1,000 mg/l. In
   general, longer culture times will lead to greater amounts of product. Thus, the
   recombinant microorganism can be cultured for from 1 day to 7 days, from 1 day to 5
   days, from 3 days to 5 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, or about 5 days.
15         It will be appreciated that the various genes and modules discussed herein can
   be present in two or more recombinant microorganisms rather than a single
   microorganism. When a plurality of recombinant microorganisms is used, they can be
   grown in a mixed culture to produce steviol and/or steviol glycosides. For example, a
   first microorganism can comprise one or more biosynthesis genes for producing
20 steviol while a second microorganism comprises steviol glycoside biosynthesis genes.
   Alternatively, the two or more microorganisms each can be grown in a separate
   culture medium and the product of the first culture medium, e.g., steviol, can be
   introduced into second culture medium to be converted into a subsequent
   intermediate, or into an end product such as rebaudioside A. The product produced
25 by the second, or final microorganism is then recovered. It will also be appreciated
   that in some embodiments, a recombinant microorganism is grown using nutrient
   sources other than a culture medium and utilizing a system other than a fermentor.
            Steviol glycosides do not necessarily have equivalent performance in different
   food systems. It is therefore desirable to have the ability to direct the synthesis to
30 steviol glycoside compositions of choice. Recombinant hosts described herein can
   produce compositions that are selectively enriched for specific steviol glycosides and
   have a consistent taste profile. Thus, the recombinant microorganisms, plants, and
                                                52

   plant cells described herein can facilitate the production of compositions that are
   tailored to meet the sweetening profile desired for a given food product and that have
   a proportion of each steviol glycoside that is consistent from batch to batch.
   Microorganisms described herein do not produce the undesired plant byproducts
 5 found in Stevia extracts. Thus, steviol glycoside compositions produced by the
   recombinant microorganisms described herein are distinguishable from compositions
   derived from Stevia plants.
   V.      Food Products
10         The steviol and steviol glycosides obtained by the methods disclosed herein
   can be used to make food products, dietary supplements and sweetener compositions.
   For example, substantially pure steviol or steviol glycoside such as rebaudioside A
   can be included in food products such as ice cream, carbonated beverages, fruit juices,
   yogurts, baked goods, chewing gums, hard and soft candies, and sauces. Substantially
15 pure steviol or steviol glycoside can also be included in non-food products such as
   pharmaceutical products, medicinal products, dietary supplements and nutritional
   supplements. Substantially pure steviol or steviol glycosides may also be included in
   animal feed products for both the agriculture industry and the companion animal
   industry. Alternatively, a mixture of steviol and/or steviol glycosides can be made by
20 culturing recombinant microorganisms separately or growing different plants/plant
   cells, each producing a specific steviol or steviol glycoside, recovering the steviol or
   steviol glycoside in substantially pure form from each microorganism or plant/plant
   cells and then combining the compounds to obtain a mixture containing each
   compound in the desired proportion. The recombinant microorganisms, plants, and
25 plant cells described herein permit more precise and consistent mixtures to be
   obtained compared to current Stevia products. In another alternative, a substantially
   pure steviol or steviol glycoside can be incorporated into a food product along with
   other sweeteners, e.g. saccharin, dextrose, sucrose, fructose, erythritol, aspartame,
   sucralose, monatin, or acesulfame potassium. The weight ratio of steviol or steviol
30 glycoside relative to other sweeteners can be varied as desired to achieve a
   satisfactory taste in the final food product. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No.
   2007/0128311. In some embodiments, the steviol or steviol glycoside may be
                                                53

   provided with a flavor (e.g., citrus) as a flavor modulator. For example, Rebaudioside
    C can be used as a sweetness enhancer or sweetness modulator, in particular for
   carbohydrate based sweeteners, such that the amount of sugar can be reduced in the
    food product.
 5           Compositions produced by a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell
    described herein can be incorporated into food products. For example, a steviol
    glycoside composition produced by a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell
   can be incorporated into a food product in an amount ranging from about 20 mg
    steviol glycoside/kg food product to about 1800 mg steviol glycoside/kg food product
10  on a dry weight basis, depending on the type of steviol glycoside and food product.
   For example, a steviol glycoside composition produced by a recombinant
   microorganism, plant, or plant cell can be incorporated into a dessert, cold
   confectionary (e.g., ice cream), dairy product (e.g., yogurt), or beverage (e.g., a
   carbonated beverage) such that the food product has a maximum of 500 mg steviol
15  glycoside/kg food on a dry weight basis. A steviol glycoside composition produced
   by a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell can be incorporated into a baked
    good (e.g., a biscuit) such that the food product has a maximum of 300 mg steviol
    glycoside/kg food on a dry weight basis. A steviol glycoside composition produced by
    a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell can be incorporated into a sauce
20  (e.g., chocolate syrup) or vegetable product (e.g., pickles) such that the food product
   has a maximum of 1000 mg steviol glycoside/kg food on a dry weight basis. A
    steviol glycoside composition produced by a recombinant microorganism, plant, or
   plant cell can be incorporated into a bread such that the food product has a maximum
    of 160 mg steviol glycoside/kg food on a dry weight basis. A steviol glycoside
25 composition produced by a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell can be
    incorporated into a hard or soft candy such that the food product has a maximum of
    1600 mg steviol glycoside/kg food on a dry weight basis. A steviol glycoside
   composition produced by a recombinant microorganism, plant, or plant cell can be
    incorporated into a processed fruit product (e.g., fruit juices, fruit filling, jams, and
30 jellies) such that the food product has a maximum of 1000 mg steviol glycoside/kg
    food on a dry weight basis.
                                                54

           For example, such a steviol glycoside composition can have from 90-99%
   rebaudioside A and an undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants, and
   be incorporated into a food product at from 25-1600 mg/kg, e.g., 100-500 mg/kg, 25
    100 mg/kg, 250-1000 mg/kg, 50-500 mg/kg or 500-1000 mg/kg on a dry weight basis.
 5         Such a steviol glycoside composition can be a rebaudioside B-enriched
   composition having greater than 3% rebaudioside B and be incorporated into the food
   product such that the amount of rebaudioside B in the product is from 25-1600 mg/kg,
   e.g., 100-500 mg/kg, 25-100 mg/kg, 250-1000 mg/kg, 50-500 mg/kg or 500-1000
   mg/kg on a dry weight basis. Typically, the rebaudioside B-enriched composition has
10 an undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants.
           Such a steviol glycoside composition can be a rebaudioside C-enriched
   composition having greater than 15% rebaudioside C and be incorporated into the
   food product such that the amount of rebaudioside C in the product is from 20-600
   mg/kg, e.g., 100-600 mg/kg, 20-100 mg/kg, 20-95 mg/kg, 20-250 mg/kg, 50-75
15 mg/kg or 50-95 mg/kg on a dry weight basis. Typically, the rebaudioside C-enriched
   composition has an undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants.
           Such a steviol glycoside composition can be a rebaudioside D-enriched
   composition having greater than 3% rebaudioside D and be incorporated into the food
   product such that the amount of rebaudioside D in the product is from 25-1600 mg/kg,
20 e.g., 100-500 mg/kg, 25-100 mg/kg, 250-1000 mg/kg, 50-500 mg/kg or 500-1000
   mg/kg on a dry weight basis. Typically, the rebaudioside D-enriched composition has
   an undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants.
           Such a steviol glycoside composition can be a rebaudioside E-enriched
   composition having greater than 3% rebaudioside E and be incorporated into the food
25 product such that the amount of rebaudioside E in the product is from 25-1600 mg/kg,
   e.g., 100-500 mg/kg, 25-100 mg/kg, 250-1000 mg/kg, 50-500 mg/kg or 500-1000
   mg/kg on a dry weight basis. Typically, the rebaudioside E-enriched composition has
   an undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants.
           Such a steviol glycoside composition can be a rebaudioside F-enriched
30 composition having greater than 4% rebaudioside F and be incorporated into the food
   product such that the amount of rebaudioside F in the product is from 25-1000 mg/kg,
   e.g., 100-600 mg/kg, 25-100 mg/kg, 25-95 mg/kg, 50-75 mg/kg or 50-95 mg/kg on a
                                             55

   dry weight basis. Typically, the rebaudioside F-enriched composition has an
   undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants.
            Such a steviol glycoside composition can be a dulcoside A-enriched
   composition having greater than 4% dulcoside A and be incorporated into the food
 5 product such that the amount of dulcoside A in the product is from 25-1000 mg/kg,
   e.g., 100-600 mg/kg, 25-100 mg/kg, 25-95 mg/kg, 50-75 mg/kg or 50-95 mg/kg on a
   dry weight basis. Typically, the dulcoside A-enriched composition has an
   undetectable amount of stevia plant-derived contaminants.
            In some embodiments, a substantially pure steviol or steviol glycoside is
10 incorporated into a tabletop sweetener or "cup-for-cup" product. Such products
   typically are diluted to the appropriate sweetness level with one or more bulking
   agents, e.g., maltodextrins, known to those skilled in the art. Steviol glycoside
   compositions enriched for rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D,
   rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, or dulcoside A can be package in a sachet, for
15 example, at from 10,000 to 30,000 mg steviol glycoside/kg product on a dry weight
   basis, for tabletop use.
   VI. Plant Breeding
            A. Polymorphisms
20          Polymorphisms among the nucleic acids described herein (e.g., UGT9 1D2
   nucleic acids) can be used as markers in plant genetic mapping and plant breeding
   programs in Stevia. See, e.g., Yao et al., Genome, 1999, 42:657-661. Thus, the
   polymorphisms described herein can be used in a method of identifying whether that
   polymorphism is associated with variation in a trait. The method involves measuring
25 the correlation between variation in the trait in plants of a Stevia line or population
   and the presence of one or more genetic polymorphisms in those plants, thereby
   identifying whether or not the genetic polymorphisms are associated with variation in
   the trait. Typically, the trait is the total amount of steviol glycosides present in leaves
   of the plant, although the trait also can be the amount of a particular steviol glycoside,
30 e.g., rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E,
   rebaudioside F, or dulcoside A. In some embodiments, the trait is the amount of
   steviol, or the amount of an isoprenoid precursor. A statistically significant correlation
                                                  56

   between the trait and the presence of the polymorphic marker is determined using an
   appropriate parametric or non-parametric statistic, e.g., Chi-square test, Student's t
   test, Mann-Whitney test, or F-test. A statistically significant correlation between, for
   example, the amount of rebaudioside A in a plant and presence of a polymorphic
 5 marker indicates that the marker may be useful in a marker-assisted breeding program
   for selection of altered rebaudioside A levels.
            Polymorphisms may be detected by means known in the art, including without
   limitation, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified
   polymorphic DNA detection (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism
10 (AFLP), simple sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellites. Discovery, detection, and
   genotyping of polymorphisms have been described in the literature. See, e.g., Henry,
   ed. (2001) Plant Genotyping. The DNA Fingerprinting of Plants Wallingford: CABI
   Publishing; and Phillips and Vasil, eds. (2001) DNA-based Markers in Plants
   Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers. For example, a primer or probe derived
15 from the nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:9, or SEQ ID
   NO:96, or the complements thereof, can be used to identify one or more individual
   plants that possess the polymorphic allele that is correlated with a desired steviol
   glycoside composition. Those plants then can be used in a breeding program to
   combine the polymorphic allele with a plurality of other alleles at other loci that are
20 correlated with the desired steviol glycoside composition. As will be evident to one
   of skill, the number and type of markers required can differ, depending on the trait(s)
   to be selected for and the degree of correlation for each marker. The methods,
   therefore, involve detecting a plurality of polymorphisms in the genome of the plant
   in certain embodiments. It will be appreciated that the method may further comprise
25 storing the results of the step of detecting the plurality of polymorphisms on a
   computer readable medium.
            Thus, in some embodiments, a method for identifying Stevia plant lines or
   populations comprises supplying a nucleic acid sample for a Stevia plant, providing
   amplification primers for amplifying a region of a Stevia plant corresponding to a
30 UGT gene having 90% or greater sequence identity to a nucleic acid encoding the
   polypeptides set forth inSEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7, present in the sample, applying the
   amplification primers to the nucleic acid sample such that amplification of the region
                                                57

   occurs, and identifying plants having a desired trait based on the presence of one or
   more polymorphisms in the amplified nucleic acid sample that correlate with the trait.
            In some embodiments, a method of determining the presence of a
   polynucleotide in a Stevia plant involves contacting at least one probe or primer pair
 5 with nucleic acid from the plant. The probe or primer pair is specific for a
   polynucleotide that encodes a UGT polypeptide having at least 90% sequence identity
   to SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7. The presence or absence of the polynucleotide is then
   determined.
            In addition to methods for detecting polymorphisms and determining the
10 genotype of a Stevia plant, kits suitable for carrying out the methods are also
   described, as well as a computer readable medium produced by such methods that
   contains data generated by the methods. A kit for genotyping a Stevia biological
   sample includes a primer pair that specifically amplifies, or a probe that specifically
   hybridizes to, a polynucleotide that encodes a UGT polypeptide having at least 90%
15 sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Such kits typically have the primer or
   probe contained within suitable packaging material.
            In some embodiments of the methods and kits described herein, one or more
   sets of oligonucleotides, each capable of recognizing the presence or absence of a
   specific and defined genomic position, is used. For polyploid Stevia lines or
20 populations, more oligonucleotides are desirable. The lower limit is one
   oligonucleotide pair and the upper limit is set by the desired resolution capacity of the
   method and the test kit. Hybridization of the oligonucleotides to DNA from the Stevia
   plant is preferably recorded in situ by any conventional labelling system, applying for
   instance terminal transferase and conventional recordable labels. As an alternative to
25 in situ labelling the hybridized sample DNA may be released from the solid support
   and subsequently hybridized with labelled polynucleotide sequences corresponding to
   each of the original oligonucleotide sequences attached to the solid support.
   Hybridization is optionally reversible and the solid support can be returned to its
   original state for reuse. A labelled dideoxynucleotide can be incorporated at the end of
30 the oligonucleotide provided that the oligonucleotide is hybridized to genomic DNA
   as template. The nucleotide sequence at the genomic position adjacent to the region
   matching the oligonucleotide is known and therefore the particular nucleotide which
                                               58

   will be incorporated (A, C, G, T or U) is known. Co-dominant scoring is achieved
   using paired, i.e. two or parallel, i.e. three, flanking oligonucleotide sequences. The
   results obtained are recorded as full, empty, failure or null alleles and can be used to
   distinguish between heterozygous and/or homozygous genotypes. Optional post
 5 hybridization treatments, including washing and digestion, are provided in order to
   remove sample DNA not fully hybridized to the solid support-attached
   oligonucleotide sequences, for example before and after labelling. The presence or
   absence of hybridization is recorded using a method allowing the recording of the
   hybridization state, typically on a computer readable medium.

           B. Breeding Programs
           Stevia is typically an outcrossing species, although self-polination is
   occasionally observed. Thus, a Stevia plant breeding program typically involves the
   use of one or more of: recurrent selection mass selection, bulk selection, and
15 intercrossing. These techniques can be used alone or in combination with one or
   more other techniques in a breeding program. See, Yadav et al., Can. J. Plant Sci. 91:
    1-27 (2011). Each identified plant can be crossed to a different plant to produce seed,
   which is then germinated to form progeny plants. Seed from one or more progeny
   plants possessing the desired phenotype(s) and desired polymorphism(s) is
20 composited and then randomly mated to form a subsequent progeny generation. The
   breeding program can repeat these steps for an additional 0 to 5 generations as
   appropriate in order to achieve the desired stability in the resulting plant population,
   which retains the polymorphic allele(s). In most breeding programs, analysis for the
   particular polymorphic allele will be carried out in each generation, although analysis
25 can be carried out in alternate generations if desired. Selfing of progeny plants may
   be carried out for those stevia lines and populations in which selfing is feasible.
           Recurrent selection is a method used in a plant breeding program to improve a
   population of plants. The method entails individual plants cross pollinating with each
   other to form progeny. The progeny are grown and the superior progeny selected by
30 any number of selection methods, which include individual plant, half-sib progeny,
   full-sib progeny and selfed progeny. The selected progeny are self pollinated or cross
   pollinated with each other to form progeny for another population. This population is
                                                  59

   planted and again superior plants are selected to self pollinate or cross pollinate with
   each other. Recurrent selection is a cyclical process and therefore can be repeated as
   many times as desired. The objective of recurrent selection is to improve the traits of
   a population. The improved population can then be used as a source of breeding
 5 material to obtain new varieties for commercial or breeding use, including the
   production of a synthetic cultivar. A synthetic cultivar is the resultant progeny
   formed by the intercrossing of several selected varieties. The number of parental
   plant varieties, populations, wild accessions, ecotypes, etc., that are used to generate a
   synthetic can vary from as little as 10 to as much as 500. Typically, about 100 to 300
10 varieties, populations, etc., are used a parents for the synthetic variety. Seed from the
   parental seed production plot of a synthetic variety can be sold to the farmer.
   Alternatively, seed from the parental seed production plot can subsequently undergo
   one or two generations of multiplication, depending on the amount of seed produced
   in the parental plot and the demand for seed.
15         Mass selection is a useful technique when used in conjunction with molecular
   marker-assisted selection. In mass selection, seeds from individuals are selected
   based on phenotype or genotype. These selected seeds are then bulked and used to
   grow the next generation. Bulk selection requires growing a population of plants in a
   bulk plot, allowing the plants to self-pollinate, harvesting the seed in bulk and then
20 using a sample of the seed harvested in bulk to plant the next generation. Also,
   instead of self pollination, directed pollination could be used as part of the breeding
   program.
           Thus, in some embodiments, a method of making a Stevia plant line or
   population involves identifying one or more plants in the line or population in which
25 the presence of a polymorphism at a locus having nucleotide sequence encoding a
   polypeptide that is at least 90% identical to SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, or 7 is associated
   with variation in a trait of interest. The identified plant(s) is then crossed with itself
   or a different stevia plant to produce seed, and at least one progeny plant grown from
   the seed is again crossed with itself or a different stevia plant for an additional 0-5
30 generations to make a line or population that possesses the polymorphism.
           In some cases, selection for other useful traits is also carried out, e.g., selection
   for disease resistance. Selection for such other traits can be carried out before, during
                                                60

        or after identification of individual plants that possess the desired polymorphic allele.
                Marker-assisted breeding techniques may be used in addition to, or as an
        alternative to, other sorts of identification techniques.
                The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do
 5      not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.

                A nucleotide sequence encoding a truncated baker's yeast HMG CoA
10      reductase was cloned into a yeast high copy episomal plasmid vector such that the
        coding sequence was operably linked to and under the transcriptional control of a
        promoter which can be repressed by the amino acid methionine. See, U.S. Patent

                                Example 3 -- Construction of Yeast Strains
                 A yeast strain designated EFSC301 was modified by replacing the endogenous
         ERG9 promoter with the copper inducible CUP] promoter. Strain EFSC301 is a
         derivative of EUROSCARF collection yeast strain BY4742. See, the world wide web
  20     at uni-frankfurt.de/fbl5/mikro/euroscarf/data/by.html.   In standard yeast growth
         medium, the ERG9 gene is transcribed at very low levels, since the concentration of
         copper in such medium is low. The decrease in ergosterol production in this strain
         results in increased amounts of isoprene units available for steviol biosynthesis. The
                                                     65

   yeast strain was also modified by genomically integrating the Stevia UGT85C2 and
   UGT74G1 genes, each under the transcriptional control of the strong constitutive
   GPD1 promoter. See Table 8. The strain has one copy of each of the Stevia
   UGT85C2 and UGT74G1 genes integrated in the MUS1241 strain genome.

      Example 4 -- Analysis of Steviol Glycoside Pathway Gene Expression in Yeast
           To examine steviol glycoside biosynthesis in yeast, the expression cassettes of
   the 36 entry vectors of Tables 1-7 and Example 1 were randomly concatenated in
   ligation reactions to create artificial yeast chromosomes ("eYACs"). The process is
10 shown schematically in FIG 5.
           Two different sets of ligations were carried out. Ligation set A included all
   genes listed in Tables 1-7, except that no bi-functional CDPS-KS genes (Table 4)
   were included. Ligation set B included all genes listed in Tables 1-7 except that no
   mono-functional CDPS and KS genes (Tables 2-3) were included.
15         From 30 to 200 pg of DNA was prepared from each of the cassette-containing
   entry vectors. The gene expression cassettes were released from each vector by
   digestion with the restriction enzyme AscI. The cassettes were then randomly
   concatenated into eYACs by ligation with T4 ligase in a 3 hour reaction. The success
   of the concatenation reaction was assessed by the viscosity of the reaction mixture,
20 since concatenated DNA is highly viscous. DNA fragments ("arms") containing a
   centromere, two telomeres and the LEU2 and TRP1 selection markers were added to
   the end of the concatenated expression cassettes, thereby creating functional eYACs.
           The eYACs were transformed into spheroplasts of the competent yeast strain
   MUS 1243 by zymolyase digestion of the yeast cell wall, followed by treatment with a
25 CaCl 2/PEG buffer, making the spheroplasts permeable to large molecules such as
   eYACs.
           After transformation, the yeast spheroplasts were embedded in a noble agar
   based solid growth medium, in which regeneration of the cell wall can take place.
   Colonies appeared from 4-8 days after inoculation. The regeneration medium lacked
30 the amino acids leucine and tryptophan, thus selecting for the presence of double
   armed eYACs in the yeast cells.
                                                 66

           About 3,000 transformants were obtained for each set. Each transformant was
   re-streaked and tested for yeast strain markers and the genetic presence of both arms
   of the eYAC, i.e., the LEU2 and TRP1 markers. More than 97% of the transformants
   had the correct genotype. Each transformant was given a CEY designation number.
 5         Initially, 24 CEYs from each set were grown for 24 hours in 2 ml of Synthetic
   Complete medium (SC), without methionine, so as to induce gene expression from the
   eYACs. After 24 hours, the supernatant from each culture was collected and
   subjected to LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-coupled Mass Spectrometry (Triple
   Quadropole)) analysis for the presence of rubusoside. Since the Stevia UGT74G1 and
10 UGT85C2 genes are co-expressed in each CEY transformant, the expected end
   product when steviol is produced is rubusoside (steviol-(13-p-D-glucopyranosyloxy)
   p-D-glucopyranosyl ester).
           None of the CEYs from set B produced detectable levels of rubusoside,
   whereas 7 of the CEYs from set A did. Strain CEY19 was the top producer. CEY19
15 produced a compound with a mass of 665.2, which could correspond to a sodium
   adduct of rubusoside. A compound with a mass of 643.2 also was seen, and probably
   corresponds to protonated rubusoside. MS-MS-based molecular fractionation of the
   665.2 mass compound resulted in a break down mass of 503.2, which corresponds to
   steviol monoside as a sodium adduct. Since the mass, the fractionation pattern, the
20 HPLC spectrum, and the retention standard of this compound corresponded exactly to
   that of a rubusoside standard produced in vitro by the glucosylation of steviol using
   Stevia enzymes 85C2 and 74G1, the compound produced by CEY was determined to
   be rubusoside.
           Additional screening for rubusoside production
25         An additional 95 clones from set A and 95 clones from set B were grown in 96
   deep-well trays in 1 ml SC medium without methionine. Supernatants from each of
   these cultures were combined in pools of two clones, analyzed by LC-MS, and the
   MS signal/noise ratio determined. The MS s/n ratio is an approximate measure of the
   relative rubusoside content. When a pool of 2 CEYs was found to produce
30 rubusoside, each clone in that pool was analyzed separately. The results showed that
   no set B CEYs produced rubusoside, while at least 28 CEYs from set A produced
   detectable levels of rubusoside.
                                              67

            Identification of genes present in rubusoside producing CEY clones
            To correlate the gene content of eYACs to rubusoside production, a PCR
   protocol was developed in which similar sized fragments (0.5 kb) of all the possible
   eYAC-borne genes could be amplified. Internal primers of 20-25 nt were placed so
 5 that a similar annealing temperature could be used to amplify all genes. Genomic
   DNA, which includes eYAC DNA, was prepared from 4 CEYs with no rubusoside
   production, 4 with low rubusoside production and 6 with high to very high rubusoside
   production. Using equimolar amounts of these 14 DNA preparations, analytical PCR
   was performed for all 37 genes for these 14 CEYs, as well as positive and negative
10 controls. All genes were amplified except one, apparently due to primer failure.
            The genes present in the six high rubusoside-producing CEY strains are shown
   in Table 9. The genes present in the eight low or no rubusoside-producing CEY
   strains are shown in Table 10.

                  Example 5 -- Modification of Yeast Culture Conditions
           Experiments were carried out with strain CEY213 in order to determine
   culture conditions conducive to maximum rubusoside production. The starting
   material was a glycerol freezer stock (-80'C) of CEY213. Frozen cells originally came
 5 from an agar plate containing SC yeast medium without tryptophan, leucine and
   histidine (SC-TLH), and containing 2 mM methionine. Five ml of liquid SC-TLH
   medium containing 2 mM methionine was inoculated with a loop-full of freeze stock
   CEY213 yeast cells. eYAC expression in CEY213 is repressed under these
   conditions. The cells were grown overnight at 300 C with slow shaking (170 rpm) and
10 were designated as "pre-cultures."
           The CEY 213 pre-cultures were used to inoculate 25-50 ml of SC media
   without methionine, in which the parameters indicated below were varied.
   Rubusoside production under each of the growth conditions was measured by
   centrifuging 500 pl of each culture medium, transferring 250 Pl of the supernatant to
15 a new tube, adding 250 pl methanol, shaking thoroughly and centrifuging for 10
   minutes at maximum speed. An aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed for
   rubusoside production by LC-MS.
           Copper Levels
           CEY213 precultures were grown in SC medium to which 50 pM
20 bathocuproinedisulfonic acid was added. Bathocuproinedisulfonic acid chelates
   copper in the growth medium. The ERG9 gene in CEY213 has been modified so that
   expression is controlled by the CUP] promoter. A decrease in copper levels in the
   medium will further decrease ERG9 activity and thereby increase the amount of
   isoprene units available for steviol biosynthesis.
25         Chelation of copper ions in the growth medium had a detrimental effect on
   growth of the yeast culture and rubusoside production was decreased proportionally.
   These results suggested that even without copper chelation, strain CEY213 is at its
   minimum rate of ergosterol biosynthesis, and no more isoprene units can be diverted
   from ergosterol biosynthesis towards steviol glycoside production.
                                               70

            Glucose
           Doubling the available glucose from 2 to 4% had a marginal effect on
   rubusoside production, about a 5-10% increase in rubusoside production.
           Limiting available nitrogen
 5          CEY213 pre-cultures were grown under conditions of limited available
   nitrogen. Limiting nitrogen during growth of yeast in culture is known to increase
   production of ergosterol. When the concentration of NH 4 SO 4 was decreased from
   4g/l to 2, 1 or 0.4 g/l, the growth rate of CEY213 decreased in proportion to the
   amount of nitrogen. Rubusoside production decreased proportionally with the
10 decrease in growth.
           Aeration of cultures
            CEY213 was grown in Ehrlenmeyer flasks with or without baffles. The
   results indicated that there was at best a marginal effect of increased aeration via the
   use of baffles. If anything, the lack of aeration via the lack of baffles increased
15 production.
            Optical Density at Initiation, Fermentation Time and Growth temperature
            Cultures were initiated at two different optical densities, OD6 00 =0. 1 or
   OD60 0=1.0 of pre-cultured CEY213. Fermentation was then carried out for 24, 48, 72
   or 144 hours at a temperature of 20, 25 or 300 C.
20         As shown in FIG 6, the density of the batch culture at fermentation start, the
   culture temperature and the length of time in fermentation, in combination, had a
   significant effect on the amount of rubusoside produced by CEY213. Thus, 144 hours
   growth of a culture with a starting density of OD60 0=1.0, at 300 C, resulted in the
   production of no less than 8.5 mgs/liter of rubusoside.
25
                     Example 6 -- Large Scale Production of Rubusoside
           A series of fermentation experiments with CEY213 were performed using 3
   kinds of yeast medium (rich medium and two types of synthetic medium), varying
   inoculation density, and changing timing of eYAC gene cassette expression.
30         Batch Fermentation Conditions
           Batch fermentation was carried out by centrifuging a CEY213 pre-culture,
   discarding the supernatant and re-suspending the cells in 6 liters of SC-TLH medium
                                                71

   containing 100pM methionine and 4% glucose. The OD 600 was adjusted to 1.0 in a
    100 ml Ehrlenmeyer flask without baffles and the cells were allowed to grow for 144
   hours at 300 C with slow shaking.
            Recovery of Rubusoside
 5          After fermentation, the culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was mixed
   with an equal volume of methanol, shaken thoroughly, and centrifuged to remove
   precipitated material. The resulting supernatant was purified by flash C18-silica
   column chromatography with methanol as the eluent, followed by preparative HPLC
   to obtain one major compound, with one additional minor compound detected.
10          The purified compound was analyzed by 1H and     13
                                                                C NMR, and the data are
   shown in FIG. 7. The compound was confirmed to be rubusoside based on
   comparison to 1H and    1C  NMR literature values for rubusoside. Quantitative
   analysis indicated that CEY213 fermentation produced 12.8 mgs/liter of rubusoside.
15                              Example 7 -- IP3GGT Activity
            1. Enzymatic Activity of Ipomoea purpurea3GGT glycosyltransferase in vitro
            The enzymatic activity of Ipomoea purpurea3GGT glycosyltransferase
   (IP3GGT) using steviol as a substrate was determined in vitro. Genes for Stevia
   rebaudianaUGT85C2 and IP3GGT glycosyltransferase were each expressed in E.
20 coli and each enzyme was purified.
            The enzymatic reaction was performed in two steps. First, 0.5 mM steviol
   (9.55 mgs total) was incubated with ca. 0.5 pg UGT85C2 enzyme for 16 hours at 30
   0C  in a reaction buffer (containing 1 mM UDP-glucose, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5
   mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM KCl, 0.1 U/ul calf intestine phosphatase). Then ca. 0.5 pg
25 IP3GGT enzyme was added and the reaction mixture incubated for an additional 20
   hours at 300 C.
            Analysis of the reaction products indicated about 100% conversion of steviol
   to steviol-13-0-monoside, 25% of which was further glycosylated into stevio-13-0
    1,2-bioside. The theoretical steviol-13-0-1,2-bioside yield was about 4.8 mg. The
30 reaction mixture was then subjected to preparative HPLC, which yielded 2.5 mg
   steviol-13-0-1,2-bioside (52% purification yield). Using LC-MS, the mass of the
   purified compound had a different retention time than rubusoside and steviol-13-0
                                               72

    1,3-bioside. The purified compound was subjected to H NMR, heteronuclear single
   quantum coherence (HSQC)-NMR and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation
   (HMBC)-NMR analysis, which confirmed that the compound was steviol-13-0-1,2
   bioside.
 5
           2. In vivo expression of IP3GGT in steviol- or steviol monoside-fed yeast
           To determine whether the IP3GGT was active in yeast, the 2p high copy
   (episomal) plasmid, pMUS 10, containing an unmodified IP3GGT coding sequence
   operably linked to a strong GPD1 promoter was transformed into the yeast strain
10 MUS1245. MUS1245 contains a genomically integrated UGT85C2 expression
   cassette. The resulting yeast strain was grown in SC medium without histidine to
   select for the continued presence of the IP3GGT expression plasmid, at a starting
   density of OD 60 0=0.2. Steviol or steviol monoside was added to the medium at 3 mM.
   After growth for 72 hours at 300 C, culture supernatants were assayed for the presence
15 of steviol and steviol glucosides by HPLC.
           LC-MS analysis indicated that no 1,2-glucosylated steviol-13-0-glucoside was
   detected after feeding with steviol, although steviol-13-0-monoside could be
   detected. In contrast, low but detectable amounts of the steviol 1,2-bioside were
   produced by MUS1245 carrying pMIUS1O after feeding with steviol-13-0-monoside.
20 These results show that the native Ipomoea purpurea3GGT coding sequence is
   expressed in yeast at levels sufficient to obtain detectable in vivo conversion of steviol
   monoside to steviol 1,2-bioside.
                         Example 8 -- Modification of Yeast Strains
25         EXG1 and EXG2
           S. cerevisiaemay contain enzymes that degrade the 1,2 or 1,3 sugar bonds in
   steviol 1,2- and steviol 1,3-biosides. To test this possibility, yeast strain CEY213 was
   grown for 3 days at 300 C on media containing 0.1 mM of each of the two biosides.
   LC-MS analysis of the culture showed the level of 1,2-bioside to be stable, whereas
30 the 1,3-bond in the 1,3-bioside appeared to completely hydrolyse within the limits of
   detection of the assay.
                                               73

                Twenty-five S. cerevisiae mutants, each disrupted in one known or putative
        glycoside hydrolase gene, were examined for their ability to degrade steviol biosides.
       A culture of each yeast mutant was grown as described above on media containing
        steviol 1,3-bioside and analyzed by LC-MS. The yeast strain carrying a mutation in
 5     the EXG1 (exo-1,3-p-glucanase) gene was found to have lost most of the 1,3-bioside
       hydrolysing activity. The nucleotide sequence of the yeast EXG1 gene is reported in
       Vazquez de Aldana et al. Gene 97:173-182 (1991). The yeast strain carrying a
       mutation in the EXG2 gene (another exo-1,3-p-glucanase) showed a small decrease in
       hydrolysing activity. Correa, et al., Current Genetics 22:283-288 (1992).
10              A double mutant yeast strain (exg1 exg2) was made. When the double mutant
        strain was grown on media containing steviol 1,3-bioside, no hydrolysis of the bioside
       was detected.
                Example 9 - Increased Titer of Steviol Biosynthesis
15              Individual clones of enzymes from each of the different enzyme classes tested
        in Example 4 (and Table 11) were examined using eYAC technology to identify
       particular clones that exhibited the greatest production of steviol from isopentenyl
       pyrophoshate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. The GGPPS, KO and KAH enzymes have
       been tested on eYACs, individually or in the case of GGPPS enzymes individually or
20      in pools of two (e.g., Synechococcus sp. + S. acidocaldariusGGPPS or Aspergillus
       nidulans GGPPS alone), in a S. cerevisiae strain expressing all remaining enzymatic
        steps in the steviol pathway. The results indicated that the Synechococcus spp.
        GGPPS clone MM-7 (encoded by SEQ ID NO:24) was the most efficient. GGPPS
       clones from Aspergillus nidulans and Sulfulobus acidocaldariusalso were quite
25      active. The results also indicated that among the KO and KAH clones, the Stevia KO
       clone MM-18 (encoded by SEQ ID NO:52) and the A. thalianaKAH clone MM-24
        (encoded by SEQ ID NO:62) resulted in the greatest steviol production.

                 S. cerevisiae strain CEY213, described in Example 4, was transformed with
        high copy plasmids carrying one of the CDPS or KS genes shown in Table 11,
 5      operably linked to the strong GPD 1 promoter. Preliminary experiments indicated that
        overexpression of the Stevia rebaudianaCDPS (CDPS-I, encoded by SEQ ID
        NO:34) in CEY213 gave an increase in rubusoside production relative to CEY213
        that lacked the high copy CDPS-I overexpressing plasmid. The experiments also
        indicated that the Stevia rebaudianaKO (KO-1, encoded by SEQ ID NO:52) was the
10      most active KO of the two tested.
                 To construct a yeast strain with consistently high levels of steviol glycoside
        production, expression cassettes containing the GGPPS-10 clone, the KO-i clone
        (SEQ ID NO:52) and the KAH-3 clone (SEQ ID NO:62) were stably integrated into
        the genome of the S. cerevisiaestrain CEN.PK 1l l-61A. Expression of these
15      cassettes was driven by the constitutive GPD1 and TPJ1 promoters. In addition,
        expression cassettes containing KS-i (SEQ ID NO:40), CDPS-i (SEQ ID NO:34) and
        UGT74GI (SEQ ID NO:2) were stably integrated into the genome. The resulting
        yeast strain, EFSC1751, however, did not produce any steviol-19-0-monoside when
        grown at laboratory scale under the conditions described in Example 6.
20               To determine the basis for the lack of steviol glycoside production in
        EFSC1751, CDPS-3, CDPS -4, CDPS -5 and CPR-I genes, alone or in combination,
        were expressed in strain EFSC1751. CPR-I is from Stevia rebaudianaand its
        sequence can be found at Genbank Accession DQ269454.4. The results showed that
        CPR-i, when expressed with either CDPS-3, CDPS-4 or CDPS-5, resulted in
25      production of steviol-19-0-monoside in EFSC1751. None of these genes alone in the
        same strain resulted in any production. These results indicate that the genomically
        integrated copy of CDPS-i, Stevia enzyme, is non-functional in this yeast construct,
                                                    76

   whereas the Bradyrhizobium, Arabidopsis or Zea CDPS clones were functional in this
   construct. In addition, the plant-derived KAH and/or KO genes integrated into the
   chromosome for this construct appear to require an exogenous CPR for activity. The
   CPR from Giberellafujikuroi(MM-29) also appears to be able to work with plant
 5 derived KAH and/or KO polypeptides.
           The two leading GGPPS candidates, GGPPS-6 (encoded by SEQ ID NO:23)
   and GGPPS-7 (encoded by SEQ ID NO:24), were further expressed individually in a
   S. cerevisiae strain that has a functional steviol glycoside pathway (including
   UGT74G1) but no GGPPS genes. Transformants then were analyzed for the
10 production of 19-SMG by LC-MS analysis of culture samples that had been boiled in
   50% DMSO for 5 minutes and centrifuged at 16000 relative centrifugal force (RCF)
   for 5 minutes. It was found that many transformants containing the GGPPS-6
   expressing plasmid did not produce 19-SMG.
           Very few transformants were obtained containing GGPPS-7, indicating that
15 GGPPS-7 (Synechococcus sp.) may be the more active of the two enzymes, and that
   the activity could be high enough to confer toxicity. For example, a dramatic increase
   in GGPP production could result in a drain on a downstream pathway such as
   ergosterol production. To test this hypothesis, a UPC2-1 gene was co-expressed with
   GGPPS-7, and ergosterol feeding of the cells was attempted to see if this would
20 rescue growth of cells. However, cell growth was not rescued.
           Cell toxicity also may be due to an accumulation of GGPP or a metabolite of
   GGPP. To test this hypothesis, CDPS-5 was further overexpressed in the GGPPS-7
   expressing yeast strain to see if the toxicity could be alleviated by increased GGPP
   usage. CDPS5 over-expression did appear to rescue growth to some extent since
25 transformants with a plasmid overexpressing this enzyme along with the GGPPS-7
   gave rise to a few colonies. The number of transformants was still low. Over
   expression of CDPS-5 in a similar strain but with GGPPS-10 instead of GGPPS-7
   resulted in a doubling of steviol glycoside production, and these results together could
   suggest that CDPS is a limiting bottleneck in the introduced steviol glycoside
30 biosynthesis pathway.
           In summary, based upon production of 19-SMG or rubusoside in test tube cell
   cultures at 30'C with yeast medium + 2% glucose, for 24-72 hours, the following
                                                77

   conclusions were made with the eYAC constructs: KS-I (Stevia rebaudiana,encoded
   by SEQ ID NO:40), KO-I (S. rebaudiana,encoded by SEQ ID NO:52) and KAH-I
   (S. rebaudiana)or KAH-3 (Arabidopsis thaliana,encoded by SEQ ID NO:62) appear
   to be the best combinations for the steviol pathway. GGPPS-7 (Synechococcus sp.)
 5 appears to show the highest amount of activity for this step, but if downstream
   bottlenecks occur overexpression also could lead to toxicity and overall lower levels
   of steviol glycosides. All combinations of CDPS and CPR gene analogs were tested
   and it was found that all 3 CPRs in Table II were active, and that combinations of
   CPR-I (S. rebaudiana,encoded by SEQ ID NO:70) or CPR-3 (Gibberellafujikuroi,
10 encoded by SEQ ID NO:72) with either CDPS-5 (Zea mays) or CDPS-4 (A. thaliana)
   were particularly useful. CDPS-5 appears to be the optimal CDPS in the pathway.
   Combinations can be further tested in a reporter strain with reduced flux to sterol
   pathways.
           To investigate the potential for even higher activity of the CDPS from Zea
15 mays (CDPS-5), this gene was expressed from a 2micron multicopy plasmid using the
   GPD promoter, with and without a plastid signal peptide, to determine if activity is
   higher in the cytoplasm when targeting sequences are removed. The nucleotide
   sequence and amino acid sequence of the CDPS-5 from Zea mays and containing the
   chloroplast signal peptide are set forth in SEQ ID NOs:80 and 81, respectively. The
20 chloroplast signal peptide is encoded by nucleotides 1-150 of SEQ ID NO:80, and
   corresponds to amino acids I to 50 of SEQ ID NO:81. The plasmid was transformed
   into the stable rubusoside producer strain (EFSC1859) that has GGPPS-10, CDPS-5,
   KS-1, KO-1, KAH-3, CPR-I and UGT74GI (SEQ ID NO:2) integrated into the
   genome and expressed from the strong constitutive GPD and TPI promoters.
25 Furthermore, in strain EFSCi859, expression of squalene synthase, which is encoded
   by ERG9, was downregulated by displacement of the endogenous promoter with the
   CUPI inducible promoter. In addition to these genes, strain EFSC1859 also expresses
   UGT85C2 (SEQ ID NO:3) from a 2micron multicopy vector using a GPDI promoter.
   Rubusoside and 19-SMG production were measured by LC-MS to estimate the
30 production level. The removal of the plastid leader sequence did not appear to
   increase steviol glycoside production as compared to the wild-type sequence.
                                               78

   However, this work demonstrates that the leader sequences can be removed without
   causing a loss of steviol pathway function.
            Similarly, plasmids were constructed for CPR-3, KAH-3 and KO-I without
   membrane anchoring sequences (i.e., nucleotides 4-63 of SEQ ID NO:72; nucleotides
 5 4-87 of SEQ ID NO:62; and nucleotides 1-117 of SEQ ID NO:52) and were
   transformed into strain EFSC1859 with the UGT85C2 integrated on the chromosome
   rather than on a plasmid. It is expected that these enzymes will be functional without
   the anchoring sequence.

           Stevia EST Analysis
           A tBLASTN search of a Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana)leaf EST (Expressed
   Sequence Tags) database (Brandle et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 50:613-622, 2002) was
15 carried out using complete Ipomoea (Jpomoeapurpurea)UGT79 type UGT
   (IP3GGT), Bellis (Bellisperennis)UGT94B1, Stevia UGT79A2, Stevia UGT76G1
   and Stevia UGT91D1 amino acid sequences as queries, thus representing UGTs from
   all Family 1 glycosyltransferase sub-families known to primarily contain
   diglycosyltransferases. Partial sequences for 9 previously undescribed UGT genes
20 were identified. One of the partial sequences was from the UGT 79 sub-family ("79
   EVI"), one from the UGT 76 sub-family ("76-EVI") and two from the UGT 91 sub
   family ("91-EV-1" and "91-EV2"), as well as members of the UGT 71, 72, 78, 84 and
   88 sub-families. Seven of the partial sequences were isolated using Stevia cDNA or
   cDNA libraries as the PCR template for isolation. In addition, two Stevia members of
25 the UGT 76 sub-family were isolated, GenBank accession ACT33422.1 which is a
   member of the 76G1 sub-family (Mohankumar), and GenBank accession
   ACM47734.1 which is a member of the 76G2 (Yang) sub-family.
           Pyrosequencing
           Additional UGT clones were identified and isolated by performing
30 pyrosequencing with Stevia cDNA as follows. Stevia mRNA was prepared from
   Stevia leaves, using the Ambion@ Micro Poly PuristTM mRNA preparation kit. As a
   quality control, reverse transcribed mRNA was tested for the presence of the Stevia
                                              79

   Rebaudioside A pathway UGT genes 85C2, 74G1 and 76G1, by employing analytical
   PCR with oligonucleotide primers identical to 21 nucleotides at the 5'- and 3'-termini
   of each sequence. The amplified full length mRNA was then used for pyrosequencing
   and contig assembly (MOgene, St. Louis, MO USA). About 3.4 million reads of an
 5 average length of 393 nucleotides were performed, and the resulting raw sequences
   used to obtain 25907 sequence contigs. A database was constructed, containing
   publicly available amino acid sequences of a total of ca. 1,500 UGTs. About 150 of
   the sequenced UGTs were fully annotated UGTs from a wide variety of sub-families.
   The remaining sequenced UGTs were partially annotated homologs of these. A
10 BLASTX search was performed (CLC Genomics, Muehltal, Germany), using the
   25907 Stevia EST contigs as query, to the fabricated UGT database (Genetic code     =
    1, Low complexity = Yes, Expect value = 10.0, Word size = 3, No of processors = 2,
   Matrix = BLOSUM62, Gap cost (open) = 11, Gap cost (extension)= 1). The results
   suggested that sequences for more than 90 previously unknown UGTs from Stevia
15 were present in the pyrosequencing database.
            No additional members of the UGT 79 sub-family or the UGT 94 sub-family
   were identified in the pyrosequencing database. However, the analysis showed new
   members of the UGT 76 and 91 sub-families. For a few of the genes, full length
   sequence data was immediately available from the pyrosequencing EST data. A
20 previously constructed Stevia plasmid cDNA library was used to obtain full-length
   sequences for those members for which partial sequence data was obtained. An
   oligonucleotide primer identical to each specific, partial UGT sequence was combined
   with an oligonucleotide primer identical to the library plasmid vector sequence.
   These primers were employed in PCR to obtain the full length product, which was
25 subsequently sequenced. Based on the full length sequence, a second PCR was
   performed using a proof-reading PCR polymerase enzyme for amplification of the full
   length UGT gene from a Stevia cDNA library as the template for the reaction. Using
   this strategy, five members of the UGT 76 sub-family, six members of the UGT 91
   sub-family, as well as ten members of other UGT sub-families were isolated.
30          Each of the 7 UGTs identified from the Stevia EST database, the 2 publicly
   available Stevia UGT 76 sequences, and the 21 UGTs identified from pyrosequencing
   was cloned into the E. coli expression vectors pET30A+ or pETDuet (making use of
                                              80

   the HIS-tag for purification purposes) and expressed in the autolysis-prone E. coli
   strains XjA and XjB. For a large number of these UGTs, expression of the UGT
   protein resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies. In order to overcome formation
   of those inclusion bodies, some of these UGTs were expressed in the low temperature
 5 expression strain "Arctic Express" (Agilent Technologies). For those which failed to
   express in this system, coupled in vitro transcription-translation of PCR products
   (TNT*T7 Quick for PCR DNA kit, Promega) was attempted, allowing successful
   expression of the remaining UGTs. Efficiency of the reaction was ensured by labeling
         35
   with    S-methionine, separation on SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging detection of a
10 protein band of the expected size for the UGT protein in question.
            UGT polypeptides from each clone, expressed as described above, were tested
   for 1,2-glycosylation activity, using steviol-13-0-monoglucoside as substrate. In
   vitro transcribed/translated protein, corresponding to approximately one fifth of the
   total protein formed in a 25 pL reaction, was used in an in vitro reaction, using 0.5
15 mM steviol-13-0-monoglucoside (SMG) as substrate, in a reaction buffer (containing
    1 mM UDP-glucose, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM KCl, 0.1 U/pI
   calf intestine phosphatase). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 0C for 20 hours.
   The reaction mixture was then analyzed by LC-MS analysis for the presence of
   Steviol-1,2-bioside. LC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 1100 Series
20 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) fitted with a Phenomenex@ Synergy Hydro-RP
   column (250 x 3 mm, 3 pm particles, 80 A pore size) and hyphenated to a TSQ
   Quantum (ThermoFisher Scientific) triple quadropole mass spectrometer with
   electrospray ionization. Elution was carried out using a mobile phase (30 'C)
   containing MeCN (0.01% Formic acid) and H2 0 (0.01% Formic acid) by applying a
25 gradient composed of 0.6-*0.4 ml/min, 5% MeCN for 4 min; 0.4 ml/min, 5->40%
   MeCN for 2 min; 0.4 ml/min, 40-*55% MeCN for 11 min; 0.4-*1.0 ml/min,
   55--100% MeCN for 3 min. Steviol biosides were detected using SIM (Single Ion
   Monitoring) on Mw 665.2 [M+Nai]. None of the 30 UGT enzymes tested exhibited
   detectable steviol-13-0-monoglucoside glycosylation activity.
30          The nucleotide sequences of the six UGT91 members identified by
   pyrosequencing were compared to the sequence of Stevia UGT91D1 in Genbank
   Accession No. AY345980. It appeared that the GenBank sequence encoded 12
                                               81

   additional amino acids at the N-terminus, relative to the six sequences identified by
   pyrosequencing. To re-test UGT91D1 family members for activity, UGT91D1
   sequences were re-isolated by PCR amplification of Stevia leaf cDNA. The resulting
   PCR products were cloned into a plasmid vector and enzymatic activity for each
 5 product was measured as described above by: GST-tagged expression in E. coli,
   coupled in vitro transcription-translation, and/or in vivo expression in yeast. Steviol
    1,2-glucosylation activity was detected from one clone by all three methods. This
   clone was designated UGT91D2e. The amino acid sequence of UGT91D2e is set
   forth in SEQ ID NO:5. In contrast, no 1,2-glucosylation activity was detected from a
10 clone having the same sequence as described by Accession No. AY345980 (Protein
   Accession number AAR06918), but lacking the 12 amino acids of the amino
   terminus.
                      Example 11 - Analysis of UGT91D2e Sequences
15 Sequence variants of UGT91D2e
           As evidenced in FIG. 19B, a small number of amino acid modifications exist
   between the active (91D2e) variants and the closest inactive homologs (91D1). The
   91D1 genes cloned by Ma et al., Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 2003 36(2):123-9
   (Protein Accession number AAM53963, GI:21435782 ) and Brandle et al., supra
20 (Protein Accession number AAR06918, GI:37993665) did not exhibit the 1,2
   glycosylating activity required for RebA biosynthesis. To ascertain which amino acids
   are required for activity, 21 single site-directed mutants were created such that the
   amino acid in UGT91D2e (SEQ ID NO:5) was changed to the corresponding amino
   acid in an inactive homolog. See Table 12. In addition, a site-directed mutation was
25 made such that position 364 (S-->P) also was changed. The mutants were made using
   the QuikChange@ II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's
   protocols (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and the pGEX-4TI vectors were
   transformed into a XJb Autolysis E. coli strain (ZymoResearch, Orange, CA). A
   mutant was not made to change residue 162 from a glycine to an aspartic acid.
30         In order to assess the activity of the mutant enzymes, a substrate-feeding
   experiment was performed in vitro using protein produced in E. coli. Initially, E. coli
   cells were grown overnight at 30'C, followed by induction with 3 mM arabinose and
                                                 82

   0.1 mM IPTG, and further incubation at 20'C. For the in vitro assay, cells were
   induced overnight at 20 C, lysed by a freeze/thaw cycle, and the crude cell extract
   used for an enzymatic reaction in which the substrates were 0.5 mM steviol-13-0
   glucoside and 0.5 mM rubusoside.
 5         The results are shown in Table 12 for the steviol monoglucoside (SMG) and
   Rubusoside (Rub) substrates. A "+" indicates that diglycosylation activity was
   detected, a "-" indicates activity was not detected, and "NA" indicates the assay was
   not performed. The noted mutations are based on the numbering of the 91D2e
   sequence (SEQ ID NO:5).
10         As some of the genes have a tendency to express in inclusion bodies in E. coli,
   the coding sequences that did not show activity in the E. coli experiments also were
   produced by coupled in vitro transcription-translation of PCR products (TNT*T7
   Quick for PCR DNA kit, Promega) as above in Example 10. Briefly, 2 PL of DNA
   from the PCR amplification of the five single mutants and the wild type enzyme were
15 incubated for 90 minutes at 30'C with the kit master mix and 1 PL L-[3 5 S]
   Methionine, in a total of 25 pL reaction. For each sample, a volume of 2 PL final
   reaction was run on a SDS-PAGE gel. All six proteins showed similar levels of
   soluble recombinant protein as judged by visual observation of the SDS-PAGE gel.
   The results for the in vitro-translated proteins are shown on the right side of Table 12.
20 The percentages in this table indicate the approximate amount of conversion of
   substrate to product based on relative peak areas of substrate and product.

           The approximate amount of diglycosylation activity as compared to
   UGT91D2e (SEQ ID NO:5) was found to be: 6.1% for T144S, 26.2% for M152L,
   30.7% for L213F, 4.3% for S364P, and 14.7% for G384C using 13-SMG as substrate.
 5 For rubusoside, the approximate amount of diglycosylation activity as compared to
   UGT91D2e was 1.4%, 23.4%, 43.7%, 10.9% and 35.2% for T144S, M152L, L213F,
   S364P, and G384C, respectively.
           These results indicate that 5 of the 22 amino acid mutations were noticeably
   deleterious for activity when done in isolation. It is also possible that combinations of
10 the other 17 mutations also could result in inactivity or loss of activity.
           By aligning the 9 1D2e sequences and the variants described above with
   proteins termed At72B1, Mt85H2, VvGT1 and Mt71G1 (Osmani et al (2009)
   Phytochemistry 70, 325-347), and analyzing predicted tertiary structures (alpha
   helices, beta-sheets, and coil regions), regions can be identified where mutations are
15 likely to result in loss of diglycosylation activity. The first three mutations that are
                                                84

   deleterious are found in the N-terminal domain, in regions that are thought to be
   loops. The N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1-240), in particular the predicted
   loop regions of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 20-26, 39-43, 88-95, 121-124,
    142-158, 185-198, and 203-214), are thought to be primarily responsible for binding
 5 of the glucose acceptor molecule substrate. The fourth mutation that appears to be
   deleterious for activity is found in the C-terminal domain, in a region that is believed
   to be the C5 loop (corresponding to amino acids 381-386). This loop is also thought
   to be important for glucose acceptor substrate specificity. Nineteen of the twenty-two
   mutations that separate the inactive versus the active rubusoside diglycosylase
10 enzymes are located within five amino acids of the predicted acceptor substrate
   binding regions of 911D2e. Therefore it is likely that the published 91 D1 enzymes
   catalyze a glycosyl transferase reaction between UDP-glucose and an alternative
   acceptor substrate.
15                 Example 12 -- Production of Rebaudioside A in Yeast
   Productionof'RebaudiosideA in Steviol-Fed Yeast
           The yeast strain EFSC 1580, which contains a genomically integrated
   UGT74G1 expression cassette, was transformed with three different 2P high copy
   (episomal) plasmids for co-expression of Stevia UGTs 91D2e (SEQ ID NO:5), 85C2
20 (SEQ ID NO:3), and 76G1 (SEQ ID NO:7). The three plasmids, designated pMUS44,
   pMUS7 and pMUS9, contain coding sequences for UGT91D2e, UGT85C2 and
   UGT76G1, respectively, operably linked to the strong GPD1 promoter. The resulting
   yeast strain was grown in SC medium without uracil, histidine, and leucine to select
   for the continued presence of the pMUS44, pMUS7 and pMUS9 expression plasmids.
25 Steviol was added to the medium to a final concentration of 250PM, and the strain
   was cultured at 300 C. At 18 hours and 72 hours of culture, aliquots of the
   supernatants and cell pellets were analyzed for the presence of Rebaudioside A by
   LC-MS. LC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC
   system (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) fitted with a Phenomenex@
30 Synergy Hydro-RP column (250 x 3 mm, 3 pm particles, 80 A pore size) and
   hyphenated to a TSQ Quantum (ThermoFisher Scientific) triple quadropole mass
   spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Elution was carried out using a mobile
                                                85

   phase (30 C) containing MeCN (0.01% Formic acid) and H20 (0.01% Formic acid)
   by applying a gradient composed of 0.6--0.4 ml/min, 5% MeCN for 4 min; 0.4
   ml/min, 5-*40% MeCN for 2 min; 0.4 ml/min, 40-*55% MeCN for 11 min; 0.4-1.0
   ml/min, 55-100% MeCN for 3 min. Steviol biosides were detected using SIM
 5 (Single Ion Monitoring).
           LC-MS results showed that detectable amounts of Rebaudioside A were found
   in the supernatant at 18 and 72 hours of culture when strain EFSC 1580 containing
   pMUS44, pMUS7 and pMUS9 was grown in the presence of steviol. The product co
   eluted with a Rebaudioside A standard and the expected mass was confirmed as the
10 [M+Na] = 989. By comparing the absorbance of the product to the absorbance of a
   10pM Rebaudioside A standard, the accumulation in the supernatant of the cell
   culture was estimated to be more than 6mg/L at 18 hours, and more than 15 mg/L at
   72 hours.
15 Productionof RebaudiosideA and RebaudiosideD in Glucose-Fed Yeast
           Yeast strain CEY213, described in Example 4, contains steviol biosynthetic
   pathway genes expressed from eYACs as well as genomically integrated UGT74G1
   and UGT85C2 expression cassettes. Strain CEY213 produces rubusoside, as
   described in Example 6.
20         Strain CEY213 was transformed with a 2p high copy (episomal) dual
   expression plasmid, pMUS47, for simultaneous expression of UGT91D2e (SEQ ID
   NO:5) and UGT76G1 (SEQ ID NO:7). The pMUS47 plasmid contains two
   expression cassettes, one having the coding sequence of UGT91D2e and the other
   having the coding sequence of UGT76Gl. Both coding sequences are operably
25 linked to the strong constitutive GPD1 promoter. The resulting yeast strain was pre
   cultured overnight at 30'C in SC medium without histidine, leucine and tryptophan in
   order to maintain selection for the presence of eYACs, without uracil in order to
   maintain selection for the presence pMUS47, and finally with methionine (2mM) in
   order to suppress promoters present on the eYACs. The next day, the cells were
30 washed and transferred to an identical medium, but without methionine, for induction
   of the eYAC promoters. Samples were collected after 24 hours and 99 hours of
                                              86

   incubation, and supernatants and cell pellets analyzed for the presence of
   Rebaudioside A and Rebaudioside D, using LC-MS as described above.
            The results showed that detectable amounts of Rebaudioside A were found in
   the supernatants at both 24 and 99 hours. The product co-eluted with a Rebaudioside
 5 A standard and the expected mass was confirmed as the [M+Na] = 989. By
   comparing the absorbance of the product to a 10pM Rebaudioside A standard, the
   accumulation of Rebaudioside A in the supernatant was estimated to be more than
   3mg/L at 24 hours and more than 6 mg/L at 99 hours. See FIG. 9. The results also
   indicated that small amounts of stevioside and rubusoside were present in the yeast
10 cell pellet and that detectable amounts of stevioside and rubusoside were present in
   the culture supernatant. See FIG. 9.
            The results also showed that small but detectable amounts of Rebaudioside D
   were produced, suggesting that UGT91D2e is capable of conjugating an additional
   glucose to the 19-0 glucose of either stevioside producing Rebaudioside E or directly
15 to the 19-0 glucose of Rebaudioside A. These results also suggest that UGT76G1
   may be capable of accepting Rebaudioside E as a substrate to produce Rebaudioside
   D. See FIG. 2C.
    Example 13 -- Production of Rebaudioside A with codon optimized sequences for
20                                     UGT sequences
            Optimal coding sequences for UGT 91d2e, 74G1, 76G1, and 85C2 were
   designed and synthesized for yeast expression using two methodologies, supplied by
   GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany) (SEQ ID NOs: 6, 2, 8, and 4, respectively) or DNA
   2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) (SEQ ID NOs: 84, 83, 85, and 82, respectively). The amino
25 acid sequences of UGT 91d2e, 74G1, 76G1, and 85C2 (SEQ ID NOs: 5, 1, 7, and 3,
   respectively) were not changed.
            High copy number plasmids containing expression cassettes with all four
   optimized UGTs were constructed and expressed, and their activity compared to
   expression products of similar constructs containing wild-type sequences. The
30 plasmids were transformed into the universal Watchmaker strain, EFSC301
   (described in Example 3). UGTs were inserted in high copy (2p) vectors and
   expressed from a strong constitutive promoter (GPD1) (vectors P423-GPD, P424
                                               87

   GPD, P425-GPD, and P426-GPD). After overnight growth and re -inoculation in
   fresh media at an OD6 00 of 0.25, the culture medium (SC -leu-trp-ura-his) was
   supplemented with 25 pM steviol (final concentration), and production of Rubusoside
   (Rub), 19-SMG (19SMG) and RebA (RebA) was measured in the media after 24h.
 5 The experiment was repeated, in part due to the fact that 19-SMG was undetectable in
   one of the first samples.
            The results from the two separate studies, shown in Table 13 below, indicate
   that all eight of the codon-optimized UGTs were active. However, enzyme
   expression for at least one of the codon-optimized UGTs in each strategy was reduced
10 by the new codon optimization algorithm used to make the constructs. It appears that
   in the GeneArt modified constructs (SEQ ID NOs: 6, 2, 8, and 4), a bottleneck was
   potentially created between rubusoside and RebA. It is expected that individual
   enzyme activity assays and expression analyses of these coding sequences expressed
   in the yeast strains will allow for the optimal combination of UGT genes in the
15 pathway.

       Example 14 - Production of Rebaudioside A using UGTs with sequence tags
20          Fusions of small peptides or protein binding domains with the UGT proteins
   85C2, 91D2e, 74G1, and 76G1 can promote interactions between the UGTs
   (channeling) or aid in targeting/anchoring the UGTs to specific components of the
   yeast cells.
           To assess if scaffolding of the UGTs in the RebA pathway could result in
25 active pathway enzymes, the DNA 2.0 codon-optimized UGTs 85C2 and 74G1 were
   fused in-frame to a string of 4 high-affinity, short (also known as PMI) peptides that
                                                88

   resemble the p53 protein motif. The p53 protein motif interacts with the MDM2
   protein in humans (see Li et al., J Mol Biol. 2010, 398(2):200-13). DNA 2.0 codon
   optimized UGTs 85C2, 91D2e, 74G1 and 76G1 (SEQ ID NOs: 82, 84, 83, and 85,
   respectively) were fused in-frame to the first 158 amino acids of the human protein
 5 MDM2 (gene accession number ABT 17086). A small GS-rich linker region also was
   fused just prior to the N-terminal methionine of the UGTs. Unfused, the affinity of
   PMI/MDM2 binding is in the low nM range representing a high-affinity binding.
   Yeast cells transformed with the above constructs are expected to produce a UGT
   scaffold around the 4 X PMI (P53-like) peptide repeat fused N-terminally to the 85C2
10 protein (designated 85C2_P53) scaffold.
           The laboratory yeast strain BY4741, deleted for TRP1, was transformed with
   expression plasmids p423-426 GPD (Mumberg et al, Gene, 156 (1995), 119-122)
   expressing Stevia rebaudianaUGTs 74G1,76G1 and 91D2e with N-terminal, in
   frame fusions of the first 158 amino acids of human MDM2 protein, and expressing
15 Stevia rebaudianaUGT85C2 with an N-terminal in-frame fusion of 4 repeats of the
   synthetic PMI peptide (4 X TSFAEYWNLLSP, SEQ ID NO:86). See SEQ ID NOs:
   88, 90, 92, and 94 for the amino acid sequences of the 85C2, 74G1, 91D2e, and 76G1
   fusion proteins, respectively; see SEQ ID NOs: 89, 92, 93, and 95 for the nucleotide
   sequences encoding the fusion proteins. This yeast strain and a control strain
20 (expressing the four UGT's without any fusions) were grown overnight in synthetic
   yeast medium selecting for the presence of plasmids and then transferred the next day
   to a 96 deep-well tray containing synthetic yeast medium to a cell density giving an
   OD60 0 of 1. A final concentration of 100pM steviol was added. After 72 hours,
   samples were taken and analysed by LC-MS, as described in Example 12. As
25 indicated in FIGs. 1OA and 10B, the UGTs are active in yeast when expressed with
   the various fusion tags.
                              Example 15 -UGT91D2e Activity
           Additional sub-family 91 UGTs were cloned using cDNA/library preparations
30 made from 3 Stevia sources of different genetic backgrounds. Oligonucleotide
   primers identical to UGT91D1/91D2e were used for PCR amplification of the cDNA
   preparations, and the resulting PCR products of correct size were cloned into
                                              89

   appropriate plasmid vectors. Numerous clones from each experiment were
   sequenced, and the sequencing results showed that UGT91D nucleic acids with slight
   variations in sequence could be amplified. The twenty UGT9 ID variants with the
   greatest differences in sequence relative to UGT91D2e were expressed by in vitro
 5 transcription-translation followed by enzymatic testing for steviol-13-0
   monoglucoside-1,2-glucosylating activity. One of the variants showed weak 1,2
   bioside glucosylation activity, while the reminder showed no detectable glucosylation
   activity. It therefore appears that UGT91D2 polypeptides are the primary steviol-13
   0-monoglucoside-1,2-glucosylating enzymes in Stevia.
10 Enzymatic activity of UGT91D2e
            UGT91D2e (SEQ ID NO:5), made by coupled in vitro transcription
   translation, was tested for the ability to xylosylate and rhamnosylate steviol-13-0
   monoglucoside in an in vitro enzyme assay, using UDP-xylose or UDP-rhamnose as
   the sugar donors rather than UDP-glucose.
15          The xylosylation assay was performed as follows: 3 mM UDP-glucuronic acid
   was mixed with ca. 1 pg Arabidopsis thaliana-encodedUDP-glucuronic acid
   decarboxylase UXS3 (produced in E. coli and then purified), 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH
   8.0), 1 mM DTT, 6 pg BSA, 1 mM MgCl 2, and 1% calf intestine phosphatase. The
   reaction mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 30 0C, in order for UDP-glucuronic
20 acid to be turned into UDP-xylose. Then 1.5 mM steviol-13-0-monoglucoside
   substrate and ca. 0.5 pg UGT9 1D2e enzyme made as described in Example 9 was
   added to the mixture, which was allowed to incubate at 30 0C for an additional 20
   hours.
            The rhamnosylation assay was performed in the following way: 3 mM UDP
25 glucose was mixed with 0.6 pg of each of the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of
   Arabidopsis thaliana-encodedRHM2 rhamnose synthetase (produced in E. coli and
   then purified), 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 1.5 mM NADPH, 1.5 mM
   NAD+, 6 pg BSA, 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1% calf intestine phosphatase. The reaction
   mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 30 0 C, in order for UDP-glucose to be turned
30 into UDP-rhamnose. Then 1.5 mM steviol-13-0-monoglucoside substrate and ca. 0.5
   pg UGT9 1D2e enzyme was added to the mixture, which was allowed to incubate at
   30 0C for an additional 20 hours.
                                                90

            The results indicated that UGT9 1D2e was capable of carrying out xylosylation
   of the steviol-13-0-monoglucoside substrate at about one half to one third the rate
   observed with UDP-glucose, forming 1,2-xylosylated steviol-13-0-monoside, which
   is a precursor to Rebaudioside F. UGT9 1D2e was capable of carrying out
 5 rhamnosylation of the steviol-13-0-monoglucoside substrate at about the same rate as
   the rate observed with UDP-glucose, forming 1,2-rhamnosylated steviol-13-0
   monoside, which is a precursor for Rebaudioside C (Dulcoside B). These results
   indicate that synthesis of appropriate precursor molecules and expression of
   appropriate UGTs in vivo should result in the production of Rebaudioside F and C in
10 vivo. See FIGs. 2B and 2D.
            UGT91D2e also was tested for its ability to 1,2-glucosylate substrates other
   than steviol-13-0-monoglucoside in vitro, i.e., rubusoside, steviol-1,3-bioside and
    1,3-stevioside. The results indicated that UGT 91D2e was not active when a 1,3
   bound glucose was present (e.g., steviol 1,3-bioside and 1,3-stevioside), while UGT
15 91D2e was active regardless of primary glucosylation at the 19-0 position. These
   results suggest that steviol 1,3-bioside and 1,3-stevioside are likely not present in the
   in vivo Stevia pathway for rebA formation. See FIG. 2A and FIG. 3.

20          Different ecotypes of S. rebaudianaare genetically diverse. Investigation of
   96 clones of 9 IDs from different Stevia RNA accessions revealed many amino acid
   changes between six investigated ecotypes (e.g., at nucleotide 74 (resulting in an
   amino acid change of G to D), 89 (Y to F), 131 (V to A), 137 (F to S), 278 (P to     Q),

30 respect to the nucleotide sequence of 91D2e set forth in SEQ ID NO:9. Some
   additional variation from these polymorphisms was noted, which is likely due to
   sequencing or PCR errors, particularly if the polymorphisms were found only once.

Twenty coding regions were chosen for further analysis. See Table 14 for
descriptions of clones that were isolated. The numbering of the amino acids in Table
14 is based on the amino acid sequence of UGT91D2e set forth in SEQ ID NO:5.

            All of the clones in Table 14 were tested for activity using 13-SMG as a
   substrate. Clone 5 had weak 1,2-glycosylating activity whereas the remaining
   nineteen did not appear to have activity under the conditions tested. The sequence of
 5 clone 5 is set forth in SEQ ID NO:95 and has the following mutations with respect to
   wild-type UGT92D2e (SEQ ID NO:5): G206R, Y207C, and W343R.
                               Example 17 -UGT85C homologs
            The genetic diversity of UGT85Cs from six different S. rebaudianaecotypes
10 was examined to identify homologs that have the same or enhanced activity in
   pathways for steviol glycoside production. PCR primers were designed that were
   specific for UGT85C genes, and PCR reactions were carried out on cDNA (some
   were done on cDNA libraries, some were done on cDNA preparations). The resulting
   PCR products were cloned and 96 clones were sequenced. Amino acid
15 polymorphisms were mapped and 16 UGT 85C clones were chosen with varying
   common polymorphism representation. See Table 15. Additional modifications were
   also noted for some clones, but could be due to PCR errors or were not common
   polymorphisms. Polymorphisms are described with respect to the nucleotide and
   amino acid numbering of the wild-type S. rebaudianaUGT85C nucleotide sequence
20 set forth in Accession No. AY345978.1 (see Table 8).

           The clones were expressed through coupled in vitro transcription-translation of
   PCR products (TNT*T7 Quick for PCR DNA kit, Promega) and assayed for
   glycosylation activity on the substrates steviol and steviol-19-0-glucoside (0.5 mM), as
   described in previous examples. The UGT85Cs produced from clones 1, 4, 16, 17, 19,
 5 20, 21, 26, 29, 30, 31, 37, and 39 were soluble and were able to convert 19-SMG to
   rubusoside in a 90 min assay. The UGT85C produced from clone 27 was considered
   insoluble. Although UGT85Cs produced from clones 2 and 33 were considered
   insoluble, trace amounts of rubusoside were produced despite the protein band not being
   visible. These experiments were independently performed three times. The experiments
10 showed that the following amino acid mutations did not result in a loss of activity: V13F,
   F15L, H60D, A65S, E71Q, 187F, K220T, R243W, T270M, T270R, Q289H, L334S,
   A389V, 1394V, P397S, E418V, G440D, and H441N. Additional mutations that were
   seen in active clones include K9E in clone 37, KIOR in clone 26, Q21H in clone 2,
   M27V in clone 30, L91P in clone 4, Y298C in clone 31, K350T in clone 37, H368R in
15 clone 1, G420R in clone 19, L431P in clone 4, R444G in clone 16, and M471T in clone
   30.
           The only common polymorphisms that were not tested were T270A and 1336T,
   which are both fairly conservative substitutions. Clone 17 had the most changes
   incorporated as compared to UGT85C, 6/480 amino acids. The 17-20 amino acids that
?0 appear to be changeable represent approximately a 4% difference at the amino acid level.
           Generally, there is low genetic diversity among the 85Cs and it is likely that all of
   the 85C homologs with the common polymorphisms set forth in Table 15 will be active.
                                Example 18 -UGT76G homologs
25         The genetic diversity of UGT76Gs from six different S. rebaudianaecotypes was
   examined to identify homologs that have the same or enhanced activity in pathways for
   steviol glycoside production. PCR primers were designed that were specific for
   UGT76G, and PCR reactions were carried out on preparations of cDNA (cDNA libraries
   or cDNA preparations). The resulting PCR fragments were cloned and 96 clones were
30 sequenced. Common amino acid polymorphisms were mapped and sixteen UGT76G

   S376L, D377A, G379A, L380F, S438P, and K441N. Generally, there was very high
10 diversity among the 76Gs.
           The clones were expressed through in vitro translation and assayed for
   glycosylation activity using 0.5 mM steviol-13-0-glucoside and 0.5 mM stevioside as
   substrates, as described in previous examples. Reactions were carried out for 90 min at
   30 0C. The native 76G1 activity was found in thee new 76Gs designated 76GC4,
15 76GG7 and 76G_H12, by formation of 1,3-bioside when steviol-13-0-glucoside was
   used as substrate. Activity in this case was determined comparatively to the positive
   control, the functional 76G1. Clones 76GG7 and 76G H12 produced slightly higher
   levels of Reb A than the control but 76GC4 had slightly less Reb A than the control.
   The number of changes in these clones represents a difference of about 7% at the amino
?0 acid level, from the control enzyme. SEQ ID NOs: 98, 100, and 102 set forth the amino
   acid sequence of 76GC4, 76GG7, and 76G_H12, respectively. SEQ ID NOs: 97, 99,
   and 101 set forth the nucleotide sequences encoding 76GC4, 76GG7, and 76G_H12,
   respectively. SEQ ID NOs: 98, 100, and 102 set forth the amino acid sequence of
   76GC4, 76GG7, and 76G_H12, respectively. SEQ ID NOs: 97, 99, and 101 set forth
25 the nucleotide sequences encoding 76GC4, 76GG7, and 76G_H12, respectively.
           Table 16 summarizes the amino acid changes of the 76G clones that had activity,
   as compared to the wildtype enzyme. There are a large number of overlapping
   polymorphisms in the active clones, thus it is expected that these polymorphisms do not
   cause a loss of activity for the enzyme. It appears that certain mutations are frequent in
                                                 97

   inactive clones, such as the P-*S mutation at position 80 or the F-*V mutation at

    Example 19 - Expression of truncated yeast HMG-CoA reductase and other HMG
                                         CoA reductases
           In S. cerevisiae,the mevalonate pathway is heavily regulated, for example, at the
   level of the enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.
10 Expressing a truncated HMG-CoA reductase (tHMG 1, encoding an enzyme stabilized
   from degradation) is one method in which flux towards PPP production can be increased
   in yeast. For example, expression of tHMG1 in yeast has led to dramatic overproduction
   of -carotene. See, Verwaal et al., 2007, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 73:4342.
   Interestingly, such yeast did not show a darker orange coloration on solid growth medium
15 as was expected, but rather a stronger yellow color, likely due to even higher over
   production of the intermediate phytoene.
           To determine if expression of HMG-CoA reductase could be used to improve flux
   to the steviol and steviol glycoside pathways, a yeast reporter strain for testing isoprenoid
                                               98

   flux was prepared by substituting the inherent promoter of the ERG9 gene with a CUP1
   promoter. See, U.S. Patent Application No. 61/346853, filed May 20, 2010.
           The genes used to produce the yeast strain are shown in Table 17. The genes
   from the source organisms were codon optimized according to DNA 2.0 IncTM. For the
 5 purpose of monitoring the cellular prenyl phosphate availability, a construct was
   produced which had a high copy number plasmid containing gene expression cassettes
   (methionine-repressible promoters) with the genes for the three enzymes needed to turn
   prenyl phosphates into -carotene (GGPP synthase from Xanthophyllomyces
   dendrorhous,phytoene synthase and beta carotene synthase from X dendrorhous, and
10 zeta carotene synthase and delta carotene synthase from Neurosporacrassa). See,
   Verwaal et al., 2007 supra; and U.S. Patent Application No. 61/346853.

           The yeast tHMG1 was expressed in the CEN.PK-based yeast strain that produces
   p-carotene, resulting in a color change from orange to light yellow. Interestingly,
   expression of the full length HMGs from Artemisia annua, Trypanosoma cruzi and
   Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the NADH-dependent HMG's from Pseudomonas
 5 mevalonii and Archeoglobusfulgidus produced a similar result, indicating these genes
   also improve the flux through the mevalonate pathway in yeast (similar overexpression of
   Bos taurus HMG had no such effect). Finally, the same color change was seen after over
   expression of Leishmania infantum acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (first enzyme of
   mevalonate pathway, described in Tabe 17) or native S. cerevisiae (CAB1, YDR53 1W) or
10 B. subtilis, (acc. No. YP004204141) pantothenate kinases (known to result in increased
   acetyl-CoA production).
           To test if the color change in these experiments were indeed due to higher GGPP
   availability, the yeast tHMG1, P. mevalonii or S. aureus HMGs, or B. subtilis
   pantothenate kinase were expressed in a stable 19-SMG producer strain. None of these
15 constructs appeared to produce an increase in 19-SMG or rubusoside production
   (UGT85C2 co-expressed) under the conditions tested. Mevalonate feeding to the yeast
   reporter strain also did not result in increased rubusoside production. The rubusoside
   reporter strain, however, has not been genetically modified to reduce the ERG9-encoded
   flux towards ergosterol biosynthesis. It is expected that control of flux to ergosterol
?0 production would result in increased steviol glycoside production using the HMG
   reductase genes and other mevalonate pathway genes found to be beneficial to beta
   carotene production.
                            Example 20 - Production of RebC in vivo
25         The synthesis of a precursor molecule to Rebaudioside C, steviol-13-0
   glucopyranosyl-1,2-rhamnoside, was shown in vitro in Example 15. In that example
   steviol-13-0-monoglucoside was used as a substrate, along with UDP-glucose and the
   Arabidopsis thalianaRHM2 enzyme (locus tag AT1G53500) and UGT91D2e. To
   further demonstrate the pathway shown in Fig. 2B, production of Rebaudioside C from
30 steviol was accomplished in vivo.
                                                  100

            A yeast strain capable of producing Rebaudioside C was constructed, and
   production of rebaudioside C and rebaudioside A was assayed by LC-MS. A modified
   Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain BY4742 was constructed and designated EYS583-7A.
   The use of BY4742 has been described by Naesby et al., Microb Cell Fact. 8:45 (2009)
 5 All four UGTs (91D2d, 76G1, 74G1, and 85C2) were constitutively expressed iin
   plasmids with GPD promoters. This type of strain has been described by Naesby et. al,
   Microb Cell Fact. 8:45 (2009). UGT85C2 was inserted in plasmid P423 GPD
   (ATCC#87355), UGT74G1 was cloned into P424 GPD (ATCC#87357) and both
   UGT91D2e and UGT76G1 were cloned into P425-GPD (ATCC#87359) with 91D2e in
10 the original multiple cloning site (MCS), and 76G1 inserted with an additional GPD
   promoter and a CYC terminator. The resulting strain was transformed with plasmid P426
   GPD (ATCC#87361) containing the RHM2 gene expressed from the GPD promoter. The
   strain was grown on SC medium lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan and uracil for 24
   hours. The culture was then re-inoculated to an OD6 00 of 0.4 in fresh media containing
15 25 pM steviol, and the yeast was allowed to grow for 72 more hours before detecting if
   Rebaudioside C was present in the supernatant and the cell pellets. Rebaudioside C was
   quantified using an authentic Rebaudioside C standard (Chromadex, Irvine CA). A total
   of 1.27 gM  0.36 gM of RebC was detected in the supernatant. Similarly, 3.17 gM 
   1.09 gM RebA was detected in the cell pellet One of skill in the art will recognize that
?0 different ratios of of RebC to RebA can be obtained by modulation of the activity of the
   RHM2 enzyme and/or by usage of UGT91D2e or UGT76G1-like enzymes with higher
   activity for the UDP-rhamnose reactions. The alternative UGTs can be mutagenized
   versions of the wildtype enzymes or unique enzymes that are obtained through discovery
   initiatives.
25          One of skill in the art will recognize that a yeast strain capable of production of
   Rebaudioside A from glucose, such as strain CEY213 transformed with a plasmid
   containing UGT91D2e and UGT76G1 in Example 12 would produce Rebaudioside C
   with the addition of the RHM2 gene either via a vector or integrated into the

            Example 21 -- Production of Steviol Glycosides using UGTs expressed
                                        in Escherichia coli
   Activity of UGT enzymes in gram negative bacteria
           The wildtype genes for UGTs 91D2e, 74G1, 76G1, and 85C2 were cloned
 5 individually into E. coli XjB-autolysis BL21(DE3) cells using the pET30 vector system
   from Novagen (EMD4 Biosciences, Madison, WI), except for UGT91D2e, which was
   cloned into a pGEX 4T-1 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) vector. Similar cloning was
   described in Examples 7 and 10. All vectors use an IPTG-inducible promoter. Plasmid
   DNA was transformed into chemically competent cells as described by the vendor.
10         Transformants displaying the desired antibiotic resistance were grown overnight
   at 30 0C in 2 mL cultures using NZCYM- media and antibiotic. For in vivo feedings, 5
   cultures were grown: UGT 91d2e, 74G1, 76G1, and 85C2 individually, and a mix of all 4
   clones. The following day, the cultures were induced to a final concentration of 0.3 mM
   IPTG and 3 mM arabinose, and grown 2 days at 20 0C in the presence of 50 gM steviol
15 (UGT74G1, UGT85C2 and the quadruple mix) or 50gM rubusoside (UGT91D2e and
   UGT76G1). The temperature was raised to 30 0 C and the cells were grown for one more
   day. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min., and the
   supernatants were removed for LC-MS analysis. The cells were resuspended in 50%
   DMSO, lysed at 80'C for 5 min and the lysates were analyzed by LC-MS.
?0         For in vitro assays, transformants displaying the desired antibiotic resistance were
   grown overnight at 30 0 C in 2 mL cultures using NZCYM- media and antibiotic. The
   following day, the cultures were induced to a final concentration of 0.3 mM IPTG and 3
   mM arabinose, and grown for 24h at 20 0 C. The cells were then harvested by
   centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 200 gL GT-buffer (RBC
25 Bioscience) and 3 tablets/100ml of Complete mini, protease inhibitor (Roche), transferred
   to Eppendorf tubes, vortexed and frozen at -80 0 C for 1.5 hour. Cells were thawed on ice,
   and left at room temperature for 3 miutes. When approximately half-way thawed, 15 gl
   of 0.14 mg/ml H 2 0 DNase solution + 30 gl 0.05M MgCl 2 was added to each tube and the
   samples were incubated for approximately 5 minutes at room temperature. The cells were
                                                102

     centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 minutes. One-hundred gL of supernatant (lysate)
     was transferred to fresh microfuge tubes, and 100 gL of glycerol was added.
             Enzyme assays were performed by adding 15.15 gL H 20, 7.5 gL 4X Buffer
     (400mM Tris, 20mM MgCl2, 4mM KCl), 0.3 gL FastAP TM (lu/ gL) from Fermentas,
 5   0.45 gL of a 100 mM stock of UDP-glucose, 0.6 gL of substrate (steviol or rubusoside)
     and 6 gL of the crude enzyme preparations described above. UGT74G1, UGT85C2, as
     well as all four UGTs mixed were incubated with steviol. UGT 76G1 and 85C2 were
     incubated with rubusoside. The enzyme assays were incubated overnight at 37 0 C.
     Following centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes, 30 gL samples were transferred to a
10   fresh 96 well plate and 30 gL of DMSO was added. The samples were then subjected to
     LC-MS analysis. Similar in vitro experiments were also done using steviol 1,2-bioside
     (for UGT76G1 and UGT74G1) or Rebaudioside B (for UGT74G1) as substrates.
             No activity was detected in the in vivo feedings. Table 18 illustrates the results
     for the in vitro assays.

             These results indicate that the UGT enzymes are all active in E. coli cells.
     However, the substrates may not be readily imported into the cytoplasm. It is expected
                                                   103

   that if the steviol were produced in E. coli from precursor pathways, the production of the
   various steviol glycoside products would be feasible from glucose. It is unexpected that
   the 74G1 and 85G1 UGTs, which have slightly overlapping substrate specificities, can
   produce rubusoside from steviol singly. The mix of the four crude enzyme preparations
 5 gave very low levels of the monosides, which indicates that the conversion to di- and tri
   glycosides was efficient. With respect to UGT91D2e, the preparation that was used had
   lost some of its original activity after long-term storage. It is expected that a fresh
   preparation of the enzyme would have yielded higher levels of Rebaudioside A.
10          Example 22 -- Production of Steviol Glycosides in Physcomitrella patens
   Feeding experiments in moss cells
            The genes for UGT 91d2e, 74G1, 76G1, and 85C2 were cloned into
   Physcomitrellapatens using the pTHUbi:Gateway vector system described in U.S. Patent
   Publication No. 20100297722. This vector uses a strong maize Ubiquitin promoter. PCR
15 primers were designed to amplify the coding regions in previous examples (native
   sequences) with the addition of "CACC" upstream of the start codon. Plasmid DNA was
   digested with Swal and used for transformation into protoplasts (generally around
   0.5x106 protoplasts). Transformants displaying the desired resistance were grown 1 day
   in 10 mL cultures and then fed either steviol, rubusoside, or buffer + DMSO as indicated
?0 by Table 19. One-half mL of buffer containing substrate was added per 10 mL of culture,
   and final concentrations of 0.1% DMSO, 50 gM steviol or rubusoside, and 0.125 mM
   phosphate buffer were added to the cultures. A positive control was done where the YFP
   (yellow fluorescent protein) was expressed in the presence of steviol or just buffer and
   DMSO. Cultures were grown 2 more days prior to separation of cells and freezing in
25 liquid nitrogen until further analysis. In some cases multiple UGT-containing plasmids
   were transformed into the same protoplast cells, to illustrate conversion of multiple steps
   within the moss cells.

           Expression was positive in the controls (tubes 1 and 2) as measured by fluorescent
   signal observation. The supernatants from the experiments were analyzed by LC-MS;
   200 gL of each supernatant sample was mixed with an equal volume of 50 percent

   microliters of the resulting supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS.
           Protoplast pellets were thawed on ice and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 containing 3
   tablets/100 ml of Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor (Roche) was added to reach a final
   volume of 150 gL. The solutions were divided in two: 75 pL was transferred to a new
10 tube and protoplasts were pelleted (15,700 relative centrifugal force, 1 minute). Pellets
   were washed with 75 gL Milli-Q water before resuspenion in 150 gL DMSO (50
                                               105

   percent). Samples were then heated (80 degrees Celsius, 10 minutes), vortexed and
   centrifuged (15,700 relative centrifugal force, 10 minutes). Fifty gL of the resulting
   supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS.
           No steviol glycoside production was detectable in supernatants or pellets. It is
 5 unknown if the steviol and rubusoside can be transported into moss cells.
   In vitro feeding ofpellet extracts
       In vitro feeding experiments were conducted with samples 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13 and
   17). Glass beads (425-600 microns) were added to the remaining 75 gL of the original
10 resuspensions and protoplasts were mechanically lysed by vortexing 3 times, 2 minutes
   each time, at 4 degrees Celsius and storage on ice in between vortexing. The samples
   were spun (15,700 relative centrifugal force, 10 minutes, 4 degrees Celsius) and 6 gL of
   resulting supernatants was used in in vitro enzyme reactions. For the enzyme reactions
   FastAP TM phosphatase (Fermentas) was used (0.3 U/reaction) and the UDP
15 glucose:substrate ratio was 5. The samples were fed either steviol or rubusoside
   according to Table 20.

          Reactions were incubated at 30 0C overnight. After incubation, an equal amount of
   DMSO (100 percent) was added to the samples and mixed, then the sample was spun
   (15,700 relative centrifugal force, 10 minutes) and 30 gL of the resulting supernatant was
 5 analyzed by LC-MS.
           LC-MS analysis showed conversion of rubusoside to 1,3-stevioside by
   UGT76G1. None of the other steviol glycosides were detectable. It is unknown if
   soluble expression of the UGTs occurred in Physcomitrella. It is expected if one UGT is
   active in the moss cells, the others would also be active if expression occurred. In
10 addition, the cloning was done in a transient manner. Stable integration of the genes is
   expected to produce additional clones that are active for UGT activity when tested.
           Methods are known to those with skill in the art for increasing soluble expression
   of recombinant proteins. Alternative promoters, ribosome binding sites, codon usage, co
   expression with chaperones, and change in temperature are non-limiting examples of
15 methods for increasing soluble expression of recombinant proteins.
           Example 23 -- Production of Steviol Glycosides in Aspergillus nidulans
   Activity of UGT enzymes in fungal cells
           The native genes for UGT 91D2e, 74G1, 76G1, and 85C2 were cloned into
?0 Aspergillus nidulans using a PCR-fabricated expression cassette and the USER vector
   system. Cloning methods are described in Hansen et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 77:
   3044-3051 (2011). Briefly, a nucleotide sequence encoding each UGT was inserted
   between the constitutive PgpdA promoter and the TtrpC terminator, in a vector
   containing additionally two targeting sequences for genomic integration and argB as
25 selection marker. Plasmid DNA was transformed into A. nidulans protoplasts according
   to Nielsen et al., Fungal Genet. Biol. 43:54-64 (2006) and Johnstone et al., EMBO J.
   4:1307-1311 (1985). Transformants displaying the desired resistance were grown for 48
   hours in 150 mL cultures using minimal media (1% Glucose; 10 mM NaNO 3; mineral
   mix).
30         Cell lysates prepared by disruption of the mycelia with glass beads were used to
                                                107

   determine the activities of the individual UGTs in in vitro. The cell lysates of strains
   expressing 74G1 and 85C2 were incubated with 0.5 mM steviol and the strains
   expressing 76G1 and 91D2e were incubated with 0.5 mM steviol-13-0-glucoside for 24
   hours, and the supernatants further analyzed using LC/MS. No steviol glycosides were
 5 detected.
           It is unknown whether soluble expression of the UGT enzymes was achieved as
   these products are not typically visible on SDS-PAGE. Since Aspergillus and
   Saccharomyces are both fungi, it is expected that additional experimentation would result
   in active clones. Methods are known to those with skill in the art for increasing soluble
10 expression of recombinant proteins. Alternative promoters, inducer levels, ribosome
   binding sites, codon usage, co-expression with chaperones, and change in temperature are
   non-limiting examples of methods for increasing soluble expression of recombinant
   proteins.
