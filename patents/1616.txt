Application No. 2013308635 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present

                                                    TECHNICAL FIELD
              [002]         Methods of treating conditions with antibodies that bind colony stimulating
 factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) are provided. Such methods include, but are not limited to,
methods of treating inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
                                                      BACKGROUND
              [003]          Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease, characterized
by symmetric polyarthritis involving primarily small joints of the hands and feet, although
 other joints are also affected. Patients with more aggressive - most commonly Rheumatoid
 Factor (RF) positive- disease may present with extra-articular manifestations, such as
 rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, scleritis, pericarditis, and Felty's syndrome. The majority of
patients with RA experience progressive deterioration of cartilage and bone in the affected
joints, which may eventually lead to permanent disability. Historically, the long-term
prognosis of RA has been poor, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing significant
 functional disability within 10 years from the time of diagnosis. RA has also been associated
 with a reduced life expectancy of about 3-10 years.
              [004]          Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (referred to herein as CSF1R; also
 referred to in the art as FMS, FIM2, C-FMS, M-CSF receptor, and CD115) is a single-pass
 transmembrane receptor with an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and a C-terminal
 intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand binding of CSF 1 or the interleukin
 34 ligand (referred to herein as IL-34; Lin et al., Science 320: 807-11 (2008)) to CSF1R leads
 to receptor dimerization, upregulation of CSF1R protein tyrosine kinase activity,
phosphorylation of CSF1R tyrosine residues, and downstream signaling events. Both CSF1
 and IL-34 stimulate monocyte survival, proliferation, and differentiation into macrophages,
 as well as other monocytic cell lineages such as osteoclasts, dendritic cells, and microglia.
              [005]          Many tumor cells have been found to secrete CSF1, which activates
 monocyte/macrophage cells through CSF1R. The level of CSF1 in tumors has been shown to
                                                             1
 10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

correlate with the level of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor. Higher levels
of TAMs have been found to correlate with poorer patient prognoses. In addition, CSF1 has
been found to promote tumor growth and progression to metastasis in, for example, human
breast cancer xenografts in mice. See, e.g., Paulus et al., Cancer Res. 66: 4349-56 (2006).
Further, CSF1R plays a role in osteolytic bone destruction in bone metastasis. See, e.g., Ohno
et al., Mol. Cancer Ther. 5: 2634-43 (2006).
             [006]          CSF1 and its receptor have also been found to be involved in various
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. See, e.g., Hamilton, Nat. Rev. 8: 533-44 (2008). For
example, synovial endothelial cells from joints afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis have been
found to produce CSF1, suggesting a role for CSF1 and its receptor in the disease. Blocking
CSF1R activity with an antibody results in positive clinical effects in mouse models of
arthritis, including a reduction in the destruction of bone and cartilage and a reduction in
macrophage numbers. See, e.g., Kitaura et al., J Clin. Invest. 115: 3418-3427 (2005).
             [007]         Mature differentiated myeloid lineage cells such as macrophages, microglial
cells, and osteoclasts contribute to pathology of various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis and diseases of bone loss. Differentiated myeloid lineage cells are derived
from peripheral blood monocyte intermediates. CSF1R stimulation contributes to
development of monocytes from bone marrow precursors, to monocyte proliferation and
survival, and to differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes into differentiated myeloid
lineage cells such as macrophages, microglial cells, and osteoclasts. CSF1R stimulation thus
contributes to proliferation, survival, activation, and maturation of differentiated myeloid
lineage cells, and in the pathologic setting, CSF1R stimulation contributes to the ability of
differentiated myeloid lineage cells to mediate disease pathology.

                                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
             [047]          Methods of reducing the level of one or more factors selected from IL-6, IL
1P, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and
MMP-9 in a subject comprising administering antibodies that bind CSF1R and block CSF1
and IL-34 ligand binding are provided. As discussed herein, antibodies that bind CSF1R and
block CSF1 and IL-34 ligand binding are effective for reducing the levels of one or more
factors selected from IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9,
CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 and treating conditions associated with elevated
levels of those factors. Exemplary such conditions include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid
arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Castleman's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,
ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lupus erythematosus, and
inflammatory bowel disease. The present inventors found that contacting synovial biopsy
samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients with an antibody that binds CSF1R reduces the
levels of IL-6, IL-1 , IL-8, CCL2 (also referred to as MCP-1), CXCL1O, TNF-a, CCL7,
CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9.

Definitions
             [049]         Unless otherwise defined, scientific and technical terms used in connection
with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of
ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall
include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular.
             [050]         Exemplary techniques used in connection with recombinant DNA,
oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation,
lipofection), enzymatic reactions, and purification techniques are known in the art. Many
such techniques and procedures are described, e.g., in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A
LaboratoryManual (2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor,
N.Y. (1989)), among other places. In addition, exemplary techniques for chemical syntheses,
chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of
patients are also known in the art.
             [051]           In this application, the use of "or" means "and/or" unless stated otherwise. In
the context of a multiple dependent claim, the use of "or" refers back to more than one
preceding independent or dependent claim in the alternative only. Also, terms such as
"element" or "component" encompass both elements and components comprising one unit
and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated
otherwise.
             [052]         In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except
where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the
word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive
sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or
addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
             [053]         As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms,
unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:
             [054]          The terms "nucleic acid molecule" and "polynucleotide" may be used
interchangeably, and refer to a polymer of nucleotides. Such polymers of nucleotides may
contain natural and/or non-natural nucleotides, and include, but are not limited to, DNA,
RNA, and PNA. "Nucleic acid sequence" refers to the linear sequence of nucleotides that
comprise the nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide.
             [055]          The terms "polypeptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably to refer to a
polymer of amino acid residues, and are not limited to a minimum length. Such polymers of
                                                              15
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

amino acid residues may contain natural or non-natural amino acid residues, and include, but
are not limited to, peptides, oligopeptides, dimers, trimers, and multimers of amino acid
residues. Both full-length proteins and fragments thereof are encompassed by the definition.
The terms also include post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, for example,
glycosylation, sialylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and the like. Furthermore, for
purposes of the present invention, a "polypeptide" refers to a protein which includes
modifications, such as deletions, additions, and substitutions (generally conservative in
nature), to the native sequence, as long as the protein maintains the desired activity. These
modifications may be deliberate, as through site-directed mutagenesis, or may be accidental,
such as through mutations of hosts which produce the proteins or errors due to PCR
amplification.
             [056] The term "CSF1R" refers herein to the full-length CSF1R, which includes the
N-terminal ECD, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain,
with or without an N-terminal leader sequence. In some embodiments, the CSF1R is a human
CSF1R having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2.
             [057]          The term "CSF1R extracellular domain" ("CSF1R ECD") as used herein
refers to a CSF IR polypeptide that lacks the intracellular and transmembrane domains.
CSF1R ECDs include the full-length CSF1R ECD and CSF1R ECD fragments that are
capable of binding CSF1 and/or IL-34. The human full-length CSF1R ECD is defined herein
as comprising either amino acids 1 to 512 (i.e., including the leader sequence) or amino acids
20 to 512 (i.e., lacking the leader sequence) of SEQ ID NO: 2. In some embodiments, a
human CSF1R ECD fragment comprises amino acids 20 to 506 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (see SEQ
ID NO: 5). In some embodiments, a human CSF1R fragment ends at amino acid 507, 508,
509, 510, or 511. In some embodiments, a cyno CSF1R ECD comprises the sequence of SEQ
ID NO: 7 (with leader sequence) or amino acids 20 to 506 of SEQ ID NO: 7 (without leader
sequence).
             [058] With reference to anti-CSF1R antibodies the term "blocks binding of" a
ligand, such as CSF1 and/or IL-34, and grammatical variants thereof, are used to refer to the
ability to inhibit the interaction between CSF1R and a CSF1R ligand, such as CSF1 and/or
IL-34. Such inhibition may occur through any mechanism, including direct interference with
ligand binding, e.g., because of overlapping binding sites on CSF1R, and/or conformational
changes in CSF1R induced by the antibody that alter ligand affinity, etc. Antibodies and
antibody fragments referred to as "functional" are characterized by having such properties.

             [059] An "immunological" activity refers only to the ability to induce the
production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally
occurring CSF1R polypeptide.
             [060]          The term "antibody" as used herein refers to a molecule comprising at least
complementarity-determining region (CDR) 1, CDR2, and CDR3 of a heavy chain and at
least CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of a light chain, wherein the molecule is capable of binding to
antigen. The term antibody includes, but is not limited to, fragments that are capable of
binding antigen, such as Fv, single-chain Fv (scFv), Fab, Fab', and (Fab')2. The term
antibody also includes, but is not limited to, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, and
antibodies of various species such as mouse, human, cynomolgus monkey, etc.
             [061]         In some embodiments, an antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region
and a light chain variable region. In some embodiments, an antibody comprises at least one
heavy chain comprising a heavy chain variable region and at least a portion of a heavy chain
constant region, and at least one light chain comprising a light chain variable region and at
least a portion of a light chain constant region. In some embodiments, an antibody comprises
two heavy chains, wherein each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region and at
least a portion of a heavy chain constant region, and two light chains, wherein each light
chain comprises a light chain variable region and at least a portion of a light chain constant
region. As used herein, a single-chain Fv (scFv), or any other antibody that comprises, for
example, a single polypeptide chain comprising all six CDRs (three heavy chain CDRs and
three light chain CDRs) is considered to have a heavy chain and a light chain. In some such
embodiments, the heavy chain is the region of the antibody that comprises the three heavy
chain CDRs and the light chain in the region of the antibody that comprises the three light
chain CDRs.
             [062]          The term "heavy chain variable region" as used herein refers to a region
comprising heavy chain CDR1, framework (FR) 2, CDR2, FR3, and CDR3. In some
embodiments, a heavy chain variable region also comprises at least a portion of an FRI
and/or at least a portion of an FR4. In some embodiments, a heavy chain CDR1 corresponds
to Kabat residues 26 to 35; a heavy chain CDR2 corresponds to Kabat residues 50 to 65; and
a heavy chain CDR3 corresponds to Kabat residues 95 to 102. See, e.g., Kabat Sequences of
Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987 and 1991, NIH, Bethesda, Md.); and Figure 1. In
some embodiments, a heavy chain CDR1 corresponds to Kabat residues 31 to 35; a heavy
                                                         17

chain CDR2 corresponds to Kabat residues 50 to 65; and a heavy chain CDR3 corresponds to
Kabat residues 95 to 102. See id.
             [063]          The term "heavy chain constant region" as used herein refers to a region
comprising at least three heavy chain constant domains, CHI, CH2 , and CH3 . Nonlimiting
exemplary heavy chain constant regions include y, 6, and a. Nonlimiting exemplary heavy
chain constant regions also include , and pt. Each heavy constant region corresponds to an
antibody isotype. For example, an antibody comprising a y constant region is an IgG
antibody, an antibody comprising a 6 constant region is an IgD antibody, and an antibody
comprising an a constant region is an IgA antibody. Further, an antibody comprising a p
constant region is an IgM antibody, and an antibody comprising an c constant region is an
IgE antibody. Certain isotypes can be further subdivided into subclasses. For example, IgG
antibodies include, but are not limited to, IgGI (comprising a 71 constant region), IgG2
(comprising a              72  constant region), IgG3 (comprising a 73 constant region), and IgG4
(comprising a 74 constant region) antibodies; IgA antibodies include, but are not limited to,
IgAl (comprising an ai constant region) and IgA2 (comprising an                  U2 constant region)
antibodies; and IgM antibodies include, but are not limited to, IgMI and IgM2.
             [064]          In some embodiments, a heavy chain constant region comprises one or more
mutations (or substitutions), additions, or deletions that confer a desired characteristic on the
antibody. A nonlimiting exemplary mutation is the S241P mutation in the IgG4 hinge region
(between constant domains CHI and CH2), which alters the IgG4 motif CPSCP to CPPCP,
which is similar to the corresponding motif in IgGI. That mutation, in some embodiments,
results in a more stable IgG4 antibody. See, e.g., Angal et al., Mol. Immunol. 30: 105-108
(1993); Bloom et al., Prot.Sci. 6: 407-415 (1997); Schuurman et al., Mol. Immunol. 38: 1-8
(2001).
             [065]          The term "heavy chain" as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising at
least a heavy chain variable region, with or without a leader sequence. In some embodiments,
a heavy chain comprises at least a portion of a heavy chain constant region. The term "full
length heavy chain" as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising a heavy chain variable
region and a heavy chain constant region, with or without a leader sequence.

CDR2 corresponds to Kabat residues 50 to 56; and a light chain CDR3 corresponds to Kabat
residues 89 to 97. See, e.g., Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987
and 1991, NIH, Bethesda, Md.); and Figure 1.
             [067]          The term "light chain constant region" as used herein refers to a region
comprising a light chain constant domain, CL. Nonlimiting exemplary light chain constant
regions include X and              K.
             [068]          The term "light chain" as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising at
least a light chain variable region, with or without a leader sequence. In some embodiments, a
light chain comprises at least a portion of a light chain constant region. The term "full-length
light chain" as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising a light chain variable region
and a light chain constant region, with or without a leader sequence.
             [069]         A "chimeric antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody comprising at
least one variable region from a first species (such as mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, etc.)
and at least one constant region from a second species (such as human, cynomolgus monkey,
etc.). In some embodiments, a chimeric antibody comprises at least one mouse variable
region and at least one human constant region. In some embodiments, a chimeric antibody
comprises at least one cynomolgus variable region and at least one human constant region. In
some embodiments, a chimeric antibody comprises at least one rat variable region and at least
one mouse constant region. In some embodiments, all of the variable regions of a chimeric
antibody are from a first species and all of the constant regions of the chimeric antibody are
from a second species.
             [070]         A "humanized antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody in which at
least one amino acid in a framework region of a non-human variable region has been replaced
with the corresponding amino acid from a human variable region. In some embodiments, a
humanized antibody comprises at least one human constant region or fragment thereof. In
some embodiments, a humanized antibody is a Fab, an scFv, a (Fab')2, etc.
             [071]         A "CDR-grafted antibody" as used herein refers to a humanized antibody in
which the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a first (non-human) species have
been grafted onto the framework regions (FRs) of a second (human) species.
             [072]         A "human antibody" as used herein refers to antibodies produced in humans,
antibodies produced in non-human animals that comprise human immunoglobulin genes,
such as XenoMouse@, and antibodies selected using in vitro methods, such as phage display,
wherein the antibody repertoire is based on a human immunoglobulin sequences.

10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

             [073]          The term "leader sequence" refers to a sequence of amino acid residues
located at the N terminus of a polypeptide that facilitates secretion of a polypeptide from a
mammalian cell. A leader sequence may be cleaved upon export of the polypeptide from the
mammalian cell, forming a mature protein. Leader sequences may be natural or synthetic,
and they may be heterologous or homologous to the protein to which they are attached.
Exemplary leader sequences include, but are not limited to, antibody leader sequences, such
as, for example, the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4, which correspond to
human light and heavy chain leader sequences, respectively. Nonlimiting exemplary leader
sequences also include leader sequences from heterologous proteins. In some embodiments,
an antibody lacks a leader sequence. In some embodiments, an antibody comprises at least
one leader sequence, which may be selected from native antibody leader sequences and
heterologous leader sequences.
             [074]          The term "vector" is used to describe a polynucleotide that may be engineered
to contain a cloned polynucleotide or polynucleotides that may be propagated in a host cell.
A vector may include one or more of the following elements: an origin of replication, one or
more regulatory sequences (such as, for example, promoters and/or enhancers) that regulate
the expression of the polypeptide of interest, and/or one or more selectable marker genes
(such as, for example, antibiotic resistance genes and genes that may be used in colorimetric
assays, e.g., p-galactosidase). The term "expression vector" refers to a vector that is used to
express a polypeptide of interest in a host cell.
             [075]         A "host cell" refers to a cell that may be or has been a recipient of a vector or
isolated polynucleotide. Host cells may be prokaryotic cells or eukaryotic cells. Exemplary
eukaryotic cells include mammalian cells, such as primate or non-primate animal cells;
fungal cells, such as yeast; plant cells; and insect cells. Nonlimiting exemplary mammalian
cells include, but are not limited to, NSO cells, PER.C6@ cells (Crucell), and 293 and CHO
cells, and their derivatives, such as 293-6E and DG44 cells, respectively.
             [076]          The term "isolated" as used herein refers to a molecule that has been
separated from at least some of the components with which it is typically found in nature. For
example, a polypeptide is referred to as "isolated" when it is separated from at least some of
the components of the cell in which it was produced. Where a polypeptide is secreted by a
cell after expression, physically separating the supernatant containing the polypeptide from
the cell that produced it is considered to be "isolating" the polypeptide. Similarly, a
polynucleotide is referred to as "isolated" when it is not part of the larger polynucleotide
                                                            20
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

(such as, for example, genomic DNA or mitochondrial DNA, in the case of a DNA
polynucleotide) in which it is typically found in nature, or is separated from at least some of
the components of the cell in which it was produced, e.g., in the case of an RNA
polynucleotide. Thus, a DNA polynucleotide that is contained in a vector inside a host cell
may be referred to as "isolated" so long as that polynucleotide is not found in that vector in
nature.
             [077]          The term "elevated level" means a higher level of a protein, such as a
cytokine or matrix metalloproteinase, in a particular tissue of a subject relative to the same
tissue in a control, such as an individual or individuals who are not suffering from an
inflammatory condition or other condition described herein. The elevated level may be the
result of any mechanism, such as increased expression, increased stability, decreased
degradation, increased secretion, decreased clearance, etc., of the protein.
             [078]          The term "reduce" or "reduces" means to lower the level of a protein, such as
a cytokine or matrix metalloproteinase, in a particular tissue of a subject by at least 10%. In
some embodiments, an agent, such as an antibody that binds CSF1R, reduces the level of a
protein, such as a cytokine or matrix metalloproteinase, in a particular tissue of a subject by
at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%,
at least 50%, at least             5 5 %, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 7 0%, at least 7 5 %, at least 80%,
at least 85%, or at least 90%. In some embodiments, the level of a protein is reduced relative
to the level of the protein prior to contacting with an agent, such as an antibody that binds
CSF1R.
             [079]          The term "resistant," when used in the context of resistance to a therapeutic
agent, means a decreased response or lack of response to a standard dose of the therapeutic
agent, relative to the subject's response to the standard dose of the therapeutic agent in the
past, or relative to the expected response of a similar subject with a similar disorder to the
standard dose of the therapeutic agent. Thus, in some embodiments, a subject may be
resistant to therapeutic agent although the subject has not previously been given the
therapeutic agent, or the subject may develop resistance to the therapeutic agent after having
responded to the agent on one or more previous occasions.
             [080]          The terms "subject" and "patient"are used interchangeably herein to refer to
a human. In some embodiments, methods of treating other mammals, including, but not
limited to, rodents, simians, felines, canines, equines, bovines, porcines, ovines, caprines,
                                                              21

mammalian laboratory animals, mammalian farm animals, mammalian sport animals, and
mammalian pets, are also provided.
             [081]          The term "sample," as used herein, refers to a composition that is obtained or
derived from a subject that contains a cellular and/or other molecular entity that is to be
characterized, quantitated, and/or identified, for example based on physical, biochemical,
chemical and/or physiological characteristics. An exemplary sample is a tissue sample.
Another exemplary sample is serum or plasma sample.
             [082]          The term "tissue sample" refers to a collection of similar cells obtained from
a tissue of a subject. The source of the tissue sample may be solid tissue as from a fresh,
frozen and/or preserved organ or tissue sample or biopsy or aspirate; blood or any blood
constituents; bodily fluids such as cerebral spinal fluid, amniotic fluid, peritoneal fluid,
synovial fluid, or interstitial fluid; cells from any time in gestation or development of the
subject. In some embodiments, a tissue sample is a synovial biopsy tissue sample and/or a
synovial fluid sample. In some embodiments, a tissue sample is a synovial fluid sample. The
tissue sample may also be primary or cultured cells or cell lines. Optionally, the tissue sample
is obtained from a disease tissue/organ. The tissue sample may contain compounds that are
not naturally intermixed with the tissue in nature such as preservatives, anticoagulants,
buffers, fixatives, nutrients, antibiotics, or the like. A "control sample" or "control tissue", as
used herein, refers to a sample, cell, or tissue obtained from a source known, or believed, not
to be afflicted with the disease for which the subject is being treated.
             [083]          For the purposes herein a "section" of a tissue sample means a part or piece of
a tissue sample, such as a thin slice of tissue or cells cut from a solid tissue sample.
             [084]         As used herein, "rheumatoid arthritis"or "RA" refers to a recognized
disease state that may be diagnosed according to the 1987, 2000, or 2010 criteria for the
classification of RA (American Rheumatism Association or Americal College of
Rheumatology), or any similar criteria. In some embodiments, the term "rheumatoid arthritis"
refers to a chronic autoimmune disease characterized primarily by inflammation of the lining
(synovium) of the joints, which can lead to joint damage, resulting in chronic pain, loss of
function, and disability. Because RA can affect multiple organs of the body, including skin,
lungs, and eyes, it is referred to as a systemic illness.
             [085]          The term "rheumatoid arthritis" includes not only active and early RA, but
also incipient RA, as defined below. Physiological indicators of RA include, symmetric joint
swelling which is characteristic though not invariable in RA. Fusiform swelling of the
                                                           22

proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the hands as well as metacarpophalangeal (MCP),
wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints are commonly affected
 and swelling is easily detected. Pain on passive motion is the most sensitive test for joint
 inflammation, and inflammation and structural deformity often limits the range of motion for
the affected joint. Typical visible changes include ulnar deviation of the fingers at the MCP
joints, hyperextension, or hyperflexion of the MCP and PIP joints, flexion contractures of the
 elbows, and subluxation of the carpal bones and toes. The subject with RA may be resistant
to a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), and/or a non-steroidal anti
 inflammatory drug (NSAID). Nonlimiting exemplary "DMARDs" include
hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, etanercept, infliximab
 (plus oral and subcutaneous MTX), azathioprine, D-penicillamine, gold salts (oral), gold salts
 (intramuscular), minocycline, cyclosporine including cyclosporine A and topical
 cyclosporine, staphylococcal protein A (Goodyear and Silverman, J. Exp. Med., 197(9):1125
 1139 (2003)), including salts and derivatives thereof, etc. Further candidates for therapy
 according to this invention include those who have experienced an inadequate response to
previous or current treatment with TNF inhibitors such as etanercept, infliximab, golimumab,
 certolizumab, and/or adalimumab because of toxicity, inadequate efficacy, and/or resistance.
              [086]         A patient with "active rheumatoid arthritis"means a patient with active and
not latent symptoms of RA. Subjects with "early active rheumatoid arthritis"are those
 subjects with active RA diagnosed for at least 8 weeks but no longer than four years,
 according to the revised 1987, 2000, or 2010 criteria for the classification of RA (American
Rheumatism Association or Americal College of Rheumatology).
              [087]          Subjects with "early rheumatoid arthritis"are those subjects with RA
 diagnosed for at least eight weeks but no longer than four years, according to the revised
 1987, 2000, or 2010 criteria for classification of RA (American Rheumatism Association or
Americal College of Rheumatology). RA includes, for example, juvenile-onset RA, juvenile
 idiopathic arthritis (JIA), or juvenile RA (JRA).
              [088]         Patients with "incipient RA" have early polyarthritis that does not fully meet
ACR criteria for a diagnosis of RA, in association with the presence of RA-specific
prognostic biomarkers such as anti-CCP and shared epitope. They include patients with
positive anti-CCP antibodies who present with polyarthritis, but do not yet have a diagnosis
 of RA, and are at high risk for going on to develop bona fide ACR criteria RA (95%
probability).

              [089]          The term "inflammatory arthritis"encompasses any arthritis caused by an
 autoimmune condition. Nonlimiting examples of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune
 conditions that may involve inflammatory arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis (including
juvenile-onset RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
 (JRA)), ankylosing spondylitis, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), psoriatic arthritis,
reactive arthritis, scleroderma, Still's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, acute and
 chronic arthritis, rheumatoid synovitis, gout or gouty arthritis, acute immunological arthritis,
 chronic inflammatory arthritis, degenerative arthritis, type II collagen-induced arthritis,
 infectious arthritis, septic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, proliferative arthritis, vertebral arthritis,
 osteoarthritis, arthritis chronica progrediente, arthritis deformans, polyarthritis chronica
primaria, reactive arthritis, menopausal arthritis, estrogen-depletion arthritis, Felty's
 syndrome, and rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA.
              [090]          "Joint damage" is used in the broadest sense and refers to damage or partial
 or complete destruction to any part of one or more joints, including the connective tissue and
 cartilage, where damage includes structural and/or functional damage of any cause, and may
 or may not cause joint pain/arthalgia. It includes, without limitation, joint damage associated
with or resulting from inflammatory joint disease as well as non-inflammatory joint disease.
 This damage may be caused by any condition, such as an autoimmune disease, especially
 inflammatory arthritis, and most especially rheumatoid arthritis. For purposes herein, joints
 are points of contact between elements of a skeleton (of a vertebrate such as an animal) with
the parts that surround and support it and include, but are not limited to, for example, hips,
joints between the vertebrae of the spine, joints between the spine and pelvis (sacroiliac
joints), joints where the tendons and ligaments attach to bones, joints between the ribs and
 spine, shoulders, knees, feet, elbows, hands, fingers, ankles and toes, but especially joints in
the hands and feet.
              [091]          The term "lupus" as used herein is an autoimmune disease or disorder that in
 general involves antibodies that attack connective tissue. The principal form of lupus is a
 systemic one, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including cutaneous SLE and
 subacutecutaneous SLE, as well as other types of lupus (including nephritis, extrarenal,
 cerebritis, pediatric, non-renal, discoid, and alopecia). In certain embodiments, the term
 "systemic lupus erythematosus" refers to a chronic autoimmune disease that can result in
 skin lesions, joint pain and swelling, kidney disease (lupus nephritis), fluid around the heart
 and/or lungs, inflammation of the heart, and various other systemic conditions. In certain
                                                           24
 10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

embodiments, the term "lupus nephritis" refers to inflammation of the kidneys that occurs in
patients with SLE. Lupus nephritis may include, for example, glomerulonephritis and/or
interstitial nephritis, and can lead to hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney failure. Lupus
nephritis may be classified based on severity and extent of disease, for example, as defined
by the International Society of Nephrology/Renal/Pathology Society. Lupus nephritis classes
include class I (minimal mesangial lupus nephritis), class II (mesangial proliferative lupus
nephritis), class III (focal lupus nephritis), class IV (diffuse segmental (IV-S) or diffuse
global (IV-G) lupus nephritis), class V (membranous lupus nephritis), and class VI (advanced
sclerosing lupus nephritis). The term "lupus nephritis" encompasses all of the classes.
             [092]          The term "multiple sclerosis" ("MS") refers to the chronic and often
disabling disease of the central nervous system characterized by the progressive destruction
of the myelin. "Demyelination" occurs when the myelin sheath becomes inflamed, injured,
and detaches from the nerve fiber. There are four internationally recognized forms of MS,
namely, primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis (RRMS), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and progressive
relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS).
             [093]          "Primaryprogressive multiple sclerosis" or "PPMS" is characterized by a
gradual progression of the disease from its onset with no superimposed relapses and
remissions at all. There may be periods of a leveling off of disease activity and there may be
good and bad days or weeks. PPMS differs from RRMS and SPMS in that onset is typically
in the late thirties or early forties, men are as likely as women to develop it, and initial
disease activity is often in the spinal cord and not in the brain. PPMS often migrates into the
brain, but is less likely to damage brain areas than RRMS or SPMS; for example, people with
PPMS are less likely to develop cognitive problems. PPMS is the sub-type of MS that is least
likely to show inflammatory (gadolinium enhancing) lesions on MRI scans. The primary
progressive form of the disease affects between 10 and 150% of all people with multiple
sclerosis. PPMS may be defined according to the criteria in McDonald et al. Ann Neurol
50:121-7 (2001). The subject with PPMS treated herein is usually one with a probable or
definitive diagnosis of PPMS.
             [094]          "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis" or "RRMS" is characterized by
relapses (also known as exacerbations) during which time new symptoms can appear and old
ones resurface or worsen. The relapses are followed by periods of remission, during which
time the person fully or partially recovers from the deficits acquired during the relapse.

Relapses can last for days, weeks, or months, and recovery can be slow and gradual or almost
instantaneous. The vast majority of people presenting with MS are first diagnosed with
RRMS. This is typically when they are in their twenties or thirties, though diagnoses much
earlier or later are known. Twice as many women as men present with this sub-type of MS.
During relapses, myelin, a protective insulating sheath around the nerve fibers (neurons) in
the white matter regions of the central nervous system (CNS), may be damaged in an
inflammatory response by the body's own immune system. This causes a wide variety of
neurological symptoms that vary considerably depending on which areas of the CNS are
damaged. Immediately after a relapse, the inflammatory response dies down and a special
type of glial cell in the CNS (called an oligodendrocyte) sponsors remyelination - a process
whereby the myelin sheath around the axon may be repaired. It is this remyelination that may
be responsible for the remission. Approximately 50% of patients with RRMS convert to
SPMS within 10 years of disease onset. After 30 years, this figure rises to 90%. At any one
time, the relapsing-remitting form of the disease accounts around 55% of all people with MS.
             [095]          "Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis" or "SPMS" is characterized by a
steady progression of clinical neurological damage with or without superimposed relapses
and minor remissions and plateau. People who develop SPMS will have previously
experienced a period of RRMS which may have lasted anywhere from two to forty years or
more. Any superimposed relapses and remissions tend to tail off over time. From the onset of
the secondary progressive phase of the disease, disability starts advancing much quicker than
it did during RRMS though the progress can still be quite slow in some individuals. SPMS
tends to be associated with lower levels of inflammatory lesion formation than in RRMS but
the total burden of disease continues to progress. At any one time, SPMS accounts around
30% of all people with multiple sclerosis.
             [096]          "Progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis" or "PRMS" is characterized by a
steady progression of clinical neurological damage with superimposed relapses and
remissions. There is significant recovery immediately following a relapse but between
relapses there is a gradual worsening of symptoms. PRMS affects around 5% of all people
with multiple sclerosis. Some neurologists believe PRMS is a variant of PPMS.
             [097]          The term "CD16+ disorder" means a disease in which CD16+ monocytes of a
mammal cause, mediate or otherwise contribute to morbidity in the mammal. Also included
are diseases in which reduction of CD 16+ monocytes has an ameliorative effect on
progression of the disease. Included within this term are CD 16+ inflammatory diseases,

             [099]          The term "methotrexate inadequate responder" as used herein refers to a
subject who has experienced, or is experiencing, an inadequate response to methotrexate
treatment, for example, because of toxicity and/or inadequate efficacy at standard doses. In
some embodiments, a methotrexate inadequate responder has experienced, or is experiencing,
an inadequate response to methotrexate after receiving a standard dose for at least two weeks,
at least three weeks, at least four weeks, at least six weeks, or at least twelve weeks.
             [0100] The term "TNF inhibitor inadequate responder" as used herein refers to a
subject who has experienced, or is experiencing, an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor,
for example, because of toxicity and/or inadequate efficacy at standard doses. In some
embodiments, a TNF inhibitor inadequate responder has experienced, or is experiencing, an
inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor after receiving a standard dose for at least two weeks,
at least three weeks, at least four weeks, at least six weeks, or at least twelve weeks. In some
                                                       28
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

embodiments, a TNF inhibitor inadequate responder has experienced, or is experiencing, an
inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor selected from infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab
pegol, golimumab, and etanercept. In some embodiments, the TNF inhibitor is a TNF-a
inhibitor.
             [0101] The term "substantially the same" and "substantially unchanged" and
grammatical variants thereof, when used to refer to the level of a protein or cell type, such as
CD 16- monocytes, denote a sufficiently high degree of similarity between the levels being
compared, e.g., as indicated by numeric values, such that one of skill in the art would
consider the difference between the levels to be of little or no biological and/or statistical
significance.
             [0102] The term "substantially reduced" and "substantially decreased" and
grammatical variants thereof, when used to refer to the level of a protein or cell type, such as
CD16+ monocytes, denote a sufficiently high degree of difference between the levels being
compared, e.g., as indicated by numeric values, such that one of skill in the art would
consider the difference between the levels to be of biological and/or statistical significance.
             [0103] An "anti-[factor] agent" or a "[factor] inhibitor" as used herein, refer to an
agent that antagonizes the factor activity, such as by binding to the factor or a receptor for the
factor (if any), or by specifically inhibiting expression of the factor or a receptor for the factor
(if any). Exemplary anti-[factor] agents include, but are not limited to, anti-[factor]
antibodies, anti-[factor] receptor antibodies, soluble [factor] receptors that bind to the factor,
small molecules that bind the [factor] or [factor] receptor, antisense oligonucleotides that are
complementary to [factor] or [factor] receptor pre-mRNA or mRNA, etc. Nonlimiting
exemplary factors include TNF-a, IL-I, IL-6, CD20, CD19, and GM-CSF.
             [0104] An agent "antagonizes" factor activity when the agent neutralizes, blocks,
inhibits, abrogates, reduces, and/or interferes with the activity of the factor, including its
binding to one or more receptors when the factor is a ligand.
             [0105] "Treatment," as used herein, refers to both therapeutic treatment and
prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen)
the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. In certain embodiments, the term "treatment"
covers any administration or application of a therapeutic for disease in a mammal, including a
human, and includes inhibiting or slowing the disease or progression of the disease; partially
or fully relieving the disease, for example, by causing regression, or restoring or repairing a
lost, missing, or defective function; stimulating an inefficient process; or causing the disease
                                                  29
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

plateau to have reduced severity. The term "treatment"also includes reducing the severity of
any phenotypic characteristic and/or reducing the incidence, degree, or likelihood of that
characteristic. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as
those prone to have the disorder or those in whom the disorder is to be prevented.
             [0106] "Chronic"administration refers to administration of an agent in a continuous
mode as opposed to an acute mode, so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect (activity)
for an extended period of time. "Intermittent"administration is treatment that is not
consecutively done without interruption, but rather is cyclic in nature.
             [0107] The term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to
an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a subject. In certain
embodiments, an effective amount refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods
of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. A therapeutically
effective amount of an anti-CSF1R antibody of the invention may vary according to factors
such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the anti
CSF1R antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective
amount encompasses an amount in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the anti-CSF1R
antibody are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. In some embodiments, the
expression "effective amount" refers to an amount of the antibody that is effective for
treating the CD16+ disorder. When the disorder is RA, such effective amount can result in
one or more of: reducing the signs or symptoms of RA (e.g. achieving ACR20, ACR50, or
ACR70 response at week 24 and/or week 48), reducing disease activity (e.g. Disease Activity
Score, DAS28), slowing the progression of structural joint damage, improving physical
function, etc.
             [0108] A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at
dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result.
Typically, but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an
earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount would be less than the
therapeutically effective amount.
             [0109] Administration "in combination with" one or more further therapeutic agents
includes simultaneous (concurrent) and consecutive administration in any order.
             [0110] A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier"refers to a non-toxic solid,
semisolid, or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material, formulation auxiliary, or carrier
conventional in the art for use with a therapeutic agent that together comprise a
                                                  30
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

"pharmaceutical composition" for administration to a subject. A pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and
is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. The pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier is appropriate for the formulation employed. For example, if the therapeutic agent is to
be administered orally, the carrier may be a gel capsule. If the therapeutic agent is to be
administered subcutaneously, the carrier ideally is not irritable to the skin and does not cause
injection site reaction.
Anti-CSF1R Antibodies
             [0111] Anti-CSF1R antibodies include, but are not limited to, humanized antibodies,
chimeric antibodies, mouse antibodies, human antibodies, and antibodies comprising the
heavy chain and/or light chain CDRs discussed herein.
             Exemplary Humanized Antibodies
             [0112] In some embodiments, humanized antibodies that bind CSF1R are provided.
Humanized antibodies are useful as therapeutic molecules because humanized antibodies
reduce or eliminate the human immune response to non-human antibodies (such as the
human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response), which can result in an immune response to
an antibody therapeutic, and decreased effectiveness of the therapeutic.
             [0113] Nonlimiting exemplary humanized antibodies include huAbI through
huAb 16, described herein. Nonlimiting exemplary humanized antibodies also include
antibodies comprising a heavy chain variable region of an antibody selected from huAb 1 to
huAbl6 and/or a light chain variable region of an antibody selected from huAbI to huAbl6.
Nonlimiting exemplary humanized antibodies include antibodies comprising a heavy chain
variable region selected from SEQ ID NOs: 39 to 45 and/or a light chain variable region
selected from SEQ ID NOs: 46 to 52. Exemplary humanized antibodies also include, but are
not limited to, humanized antibodies comprising heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3,
and/or light chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of an antibody selected from 0301, 0302, and
0311.
             [0114] In some embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R antibody comprises heavy
chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 and/or a light chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 of an antibody
selected from 0301, 0302, and 0311. Nonlimiting exemplary humanized anti-CSF1R
antibodies include antibodies comprising sets of heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3
selected from: SEQ ID NOs: 15, 16, and 17; SEQ ID NOs: 21, 22, and 23; and SEQ ID NOs:

             Furtherexemplary humanized antibodies
             [0116] In some embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R antibody comprises a heavy
chain comprising a variable region sequence that is at least 90%, at least 910%, at least 92%,
at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least
99% identical to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 9, 11, 13, and 39 to 45, and wherein
the antibody binds CSF1R. In some embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R antibody
comprises a light chain comprising a variable region sequence that is at least 90%, at least
91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least
98%, or at least 99% identical to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 10, 12, 14, and 46

antibody comprises a heavy chain comprising a variable region sequence that is at least 90%,
at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%,
at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 9, 11, 13,

least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at
least 98%, or at least 99% identical to a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 10, 12, 14, and
46 to 52; wherein the antibody binds CSF1R.

             [0117] As used herein, whether a particular polypeptide is, for example, at least 95%
identical to an amino acid sequence can be determined using, e.g., a computer program.
When determining whether a particular sequence is, for example, 95% identical to a reference
sequence, the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino
acid sequence.
             [0118] In some embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R antibody comprises at least
one of the CDRs discussed herein. That is, in some embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R
antibody comprises at least one CDR selected from a heavy chain CDR1 discussed herein, a
heavy chain CDR2 discussed herein, a heavy chain CDR3 discussed herein, a light chain
CDR1 discussed herein, a light chain CDR2 discussed herein, and a light chain CDR3
discussed herein. Further, in some embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R antibody
comprises at least one mutated CDR based on a CDR discussed herein, wherein the mutated
CDR comprises 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid substitutions relative to the CDR discussed herein. In
some embodiments, one or more of the amino acid substitutions are conservative amino acid
substitutions. One skilled in the art can select one or more suitable conservative amino acid
substitutions for a particular CDR sequence, wherein the suitable conservative amino acid
substitutions are not predicted to significantly alter the binding properties of the antibody
comprising the mutated CDR.
             [0119] Exemplary humanized anti-CSF1R antibodies also include antibodies that
compete for binding to CSF1R with an antibody described herein. Thus, in some
embodiments, a humanized anti-CSF1R antibody is provided that competes for binding to
CSF1R with an antibody selected from Fabs 0301, 0302, and 0311; and bivalent (i.e., having
two heavy chains and two light chains) antibody versions of those Fabs.
             Exemplary humanized antibody constantregions
             [0120] In some embodiments, a humanized antibody described herein comprises one
or more human constant regions. In some embodiments, the human heavy chain constant
region is of an isotype selected from IgA, IgG, and IgD. In some embodiments, the human
light chain constant region is of an isotype selected from    K and X. In some embodiments, a
humanized antibody described herein comprises a human IgG constant region. In some
embodiments, a humanized antibody described herein comprises a human IgG4 heavy chain
constant region. In some such embodiments, a humanized antibody described herein
comprises an S241P mutation in the human IgG4 constant region. In some embodiments, a
                                                   33
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

humanized antibody described herein comprises a human IgG4 constant region and a human
K  light chain.
             [0121] The choice of heavy chain constant region can determine whether or not an
antibody will have effector function in vivo. Such effector function, in some embodiments,
includes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and can result in killing of the cell to which the antibody is
bound. In some methods of treatment, including methods of treating some cancers, cell
killing may be desirable, for example, when the antibody binds to a cell that supports the
maintenance or growth of the tumor. Exemplary cells that may support the maintenance or
growth of a tumor include, but are not limited to, tumor cells themselves, cells that aid in the
recruitment of vasculature to the tumor, and cells that provide ligands, growth factors, or
counter-receptors that support or promote tumor growth or tumor survival. In some
embodiments, when effector function is desirable, an anti-CSF1R antibody comprising a
human IgGI heavy chain or a human IgG3 heavy chain is selected.
             [0122] In some methods of treatment, effector function may not be desirable. For
example, in some embodiments, it may be desirable that antibodies used in the treatment of
lupus and/or MS and/or RA and/or osteolysis do not have effector function. Thus, in some
embodiments, anti-CSF1R antibodies developed for the treatment of cancer may not be
suitable for use in treatment of lupus and/or MS and/or RA and/or osteolysis. Accordingly, in
some embodiments, an anti-CSF1R antibody that lacks significant effector function is used in
treatment of lupus and/or MS and/or RA and/or osteolysis. In some embodiments, an anti
CSF1R antibody for treatment of lupus and/or MS and/or RA and/or osteolysis comprises a
human IgG4 or IgG2 heavy chain constant region. In some embodiments, an IgG4 constant
region comprises an S241 P mutation.
             [0123] An antibody may be humanized by any method. Nonlimiting exemplary
methods of humanization include methods described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101;

at least eight, at least nine, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 15, or at least 20 amino
acids in the framework regions of a non-human variable region are replaced with an amino
acid from one or more corresponding locations in one or more human framework regions.
             [0125] In some embodiments, some of the corresponding human amino acids used for
substitution are from the framework regions of different human immunoglobulin genes. That
is, in some such embodiments, one or more of the non-human amino acids may be replaced
with corresponding amino acids from a human framework region of a first human antibody or
encoded by a first human immunoglobulin gene, one or more of the non-human amino acids
may be replaced with corresponding amino acids from a human framework region of a
second human antibody or encoded by a second human immunoglobulin gene, one or more
of the non-human amino acids may be replaced with corresponding amino acids from a
human framework region of a third human antibody or encoded by a third human
immunoglobulin gene, etc. Further, in some embodiments, all of the corresponding human
amino acids being used for substitution in a single framework region, for example, FR2, need
not be from the same human framework. In some embodiments, however, all of the
corresponding human amino acids being used for substitution are from the same human
antibody or encoded by the same human immunoglobulin gene.
             [0126] In some embodiments, an antibody is humanized by replacing one or more
entire framework regions with corresponding human framework regions. In some
embodiments, a human framework region is selected that has the highest level of homology
to the non-human framework region being replaced. In some embodiments, such a
humanized antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody.
             [0127] In some embodiments, following CDR-grafting, one or more framework
amino acids are changed back to the corresponding amino acid in a mouse framework region.
Such "back mutations" are made, in some embodiments, to retain one or more mouse
framework amino acids that appear to contribute to the structure of one or more of the CDRs
and/or that may be involved in antigen contacts and/or appear to be involved in the overall
structural integrity of the antibody. In some embodiments, ten or fewer, nine or fewer, eight
or fewer, seven or fewer, six or fewer, five or fewer, four or fewer, three or fewer, two or
fewer, one, or zero back mutations are made to the framework regions of an antibody
following CDR grafting.
             [0128] In some embodiments, a humanized antibody also comprises a human heavy
chain constant region and/or a human light chain constant region.

some embodiments, an antibody that blocks ligand binding binds to the extracellular domain
of CSF1R. In some embodiments, an antibody blocks ligand binding to CSF1R when it
reduces the amount of detectable binding of a ligand to CSF1R by at least 50%, using the
assay described, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 8,206,715 B2, Example 7, which is incorporated herein
by reference for any purpose. In some embodiments, an antibody reduces the amount of
detectable binding of a ligand to CSF1R by at least 60%, at least 7 0%, at least 80%, or at
least 90%. In some such embodiments, the antibody is said to block ligand binding by at least
50%, at least 60%, at least 7 0%, etc.
             [0179] In some embodiments, an anti-CSF1R antibody inhibits ligand-induced
CSF1R phosphorylation. In some embodiments, an anti-CSF1R antibody inhibits CSF1
induced CSF1R phosphorylation. In some embodiments, an anti-CSF1R antibody inhibits IL

80%, or at least 90%. In some such embodiments, the antibody is said to inhibit ligand
induced CSF1R phosphorylation by at least at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, etc.
             [0180] In some embodiments, an antibody inhibits monocyte proliferation and/or
survival responses in the presence of CSF1 and/or IL-34. In some embodiments, an antibody
is considered to "inhibit monocyte proliferation and/or survival responses" when it reduces
the amount of monocyte proliferation and/or survival responses in the presence of CSF 1
and/or IL-34 by at least 50%, using the assay described, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 8,206,715 B2,
Example 10, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. In some
embodiments, an antibody reduces the amount of monocyte proliferation and/or survival
responses in the presence of CSF1 and/or IL-34 by at least 60%, at least 7 0%, at least 80%,
or at least 90%. In some such embodiments, the antibody is said to inhibit monocyte
proliferation and/or survival responses by at least at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, etc.
Exemplary Antibody Conjugates
             [0181] In some embodiments, an anti-CSF1R antibody is conjugated to a label and/or
a cytotoxic agent. As used herein, a label is a moiety that facilitates detection of the antibody
and/or facilitates detection of a molecule to which the antibody binds. Nonlimiting exemplary
labels include, but are not limited to, radioisotopes, fluorescent groups, enzymatic groups,
chemiluminescent groups, biotin, epitope tags, metal-binding tags, etc. One skilled in the art
can select a suitable label according to the intended application.
             [0182] As used herein, a cytotoxic agent is a moiety that reduces the proliferative
capacity of one or more cells. A cell has reduced proliferative capacity when the cell
becomes less able to proliferate, for example, because the cell undergoes apoptosis or
otherwise dies, the cell fails to proceed through the cell cycle and/or fails to divide, the cell
differentiates, etc. Nonlimiting exemplary cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to,
radioisotopes, toxins, and chemotherapeutic agents. One skilled in the art can select a suitable
cytotoxic according to the intended application.
             [0183] In some embodiments, a label and/or a cytotoxic agent is conjugated to an
antibody using chemical methods in vitro. Nonlimiting exemplary chemical methods of
conjugation are known in the art, and include services, methods and/or reagents
commercially available from, e.g., Thermo Scientific Life Science Research Produces
(formerly Pierce; Rockford, IL), Prozyme (Hayward, CA), SACRI Antibody Services
(Calgary, Canada), AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC), etc. In some embodiments, when a label
and/or cytotoxic agent is a polypeptide, the label and/or cytotoxic agent can be expressed
                                                   46
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

from the same expression vector with at least one antibody chain to produce a polypeptide
comprising the label and/or cytotoxic agent fused to an antibody chain. One skilled in the art
can select a suitable method for conjugating a label and/or cytotoxic agent to an antibody
according to the intended application.
Exemplary Leader Sequences
             [0184] In order for some secreted proteins to express and secrete in large quantities, a
leader sequence from a heterologous protein may be desirable. In some embodiments, a
leader sequence is selected from SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4, which are light chain and heavy
chain leader sequences, respectively. In some embodiments, employing heterologous leader
sequences may be advantageous in that a resulting mature polypeptide may remain unaltered
as the leader sequence is removed in the ER during the secretion process. The addition of a
heterologous leader sequence may be required to express and secrete some proteins.
             [0185] Certain exemplary leader sequence sequences are described, e.g., in the online
Leader sequence Database maintained by the Department of Biochemistry, National
University of Singapore. See Choo et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 6: 249 (2005); and PCT
Publication No. WO 2006/081430.
Nucleic Acid Molecules Encoding Anti-CSF1R Antibodies
             [0186] Nucleic acid molecules comprising polynucleotides that encode one or more
chains of anti-CSF1R antibodies are provided. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule
comprises a polynucleotide that encodes a heavy chain or a light chain of an anti-CSF1R
antibody. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule comprises both a polynucleotide
that encodes a heavy chain and a polynucleotide that encodes a light chain, of an anti-CSF1R
antibody. In some embodiments, a first nucleic acid molecule comprises a first
polynucleotide that encodes a heavy chain and a second nucleic acid molecule comprises a
second polynucleotide that encodes a light chain.
             [0187] In some such embodiments, the heavy chain and the light chain are expressed
from one nucleic acid molecule, or from two separate nucleic acid molecules, as two separate
polypeptides. In some embodiments, such as when an antibody is an scFv, a single
polynucleotide encodes a single polypeptide comprising both a heavy chain and a light chain
linked together.
             [0188] In some embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a heavy chain or light chain
of an anti-CSF1R antibody comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes a leader sequence,
which, when translated, is located at the N terminus of the heavy chain or light chain. As
                                                   47
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

discussed above, the leader sequence may be the native heavy or light chain leader sequence,
or may be another heterologous leader sequence.
             [0189] Nucleic acid molecules may be constructed using recombinant DNA
techniques conventional in the art. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule is an
expression vector that is suitable for expression in a selected host cell.
Anti-CSF1R Antibody Expression and Production
             Vectors
             [0190] Vectors comprising polynucleotides that encode anti-CSF1R heavy chains
and/or anti-CSF1R light chains are provided. Vectors comprising polynucleotides that encode
anti-CSF1R heavy chains and/or anti-CSF1R light chains are also provided. Such vectors
include, but are not limited to, DNA vectors, phage vectors, viral vectors, retroviral vectors,
etc. In some embodiments, a vector comprises a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a
heavy chain and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a light chain. In some
embodiments, the heavy chain and light chain are expressed from the vector as two separate
polypeptides. In some embodiments, the heavy chain and light chain are expressed as part of
a single polypeptide, such as, for example, when the antibody is an scFv.
             [0191] In some embodiments, a first vector comprises a polynucleotide that encodes a
heavy chain and a second vector comprises a polynucleotide that encodes a light chain. In
some embodiments, the first vector and second vector are transfected into host cells in similar
amounts (such as similar molar amounts or similar mass amounts). In some embodiments, a
mole- or mass-ratio of between 5:1 and 1:5 of the first vector and the second vector is
transfected into host cells. In some embodiments, a mass ratio of between 1:1 and 1:5 for the
vector encoding the heavy chain and the vector encoding the light chain is used. In some
embodiments, a mass ratio of 1:2 for the vector encoding the heavy chain and the vector
encoding the light chain is used.
             [0192] In some embodiments, a vector is selected that is optimized for expression of
polypeptides in CHO or CHO-derived cells, or in NSO cells. Exemplary such vectors are
described, e.g., in Running Deer et al., Biotechnol. Prog.20:880-889 (2004).
             [0193] In some embodiments, a vector is chosen for in vivo expression of anti-CSF1R
heavy chains and/or anti-CSF1R light chains in animals, including humans. In some such
embodiments, expression of the polypeptide is under the control of a promoter that functions
in a tissue-specific manner. For example, liver-specific promoters are described, e.g., in PCT
Publication No. WO 2006/076288.

             Host Cells
             [0194] In various embodiments, anti-CSF1R heavy chains and/or anti-CSF1R light
chains may be expressed in prokaryotic cells, such as bacterial cells; or in eukaryotic cells,
such as fungal cells (such as yeast), plant cells, insect cells, and mammalian cells. Such
expression may be carried out, for example, according to procedures known in the art.
Exemplary eukaryotic cells that may be used to express polypeptides include, but are not
limited to, COS cells, including COS 7 cells; 293 cells, including 293-6E cells; CHO cells,
including CHO-S and DG44 cells; PER.C6@ cells (Crucell); and NSO cells. In some
embodiments, anti-CSF1R heavy chains and/or anti-CSF1R light chains may be expressed in
yeast. See, e.g., U.S. Publication No. US 2006/0270045 Al. In some embodiments, a
particular eukaryotic host cell is selected based on its ability to make desired post
translational modifications to the anti-CSF1R heavy chains and/or anti-CSF1R light chains.
For example, in some embodiments, CHO cells produce polypeptides that have a higher level
of sialylation than the same polypeptide produced in 293 cells.
             [0195] Introduction of one or more nucleic acids into a desired host cell may be
accomplished by any method, including but not limited to, calcium phosphate transfection,
DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation,
transduction, infection, etc. Nonlimiting exemplary methods are described, e.g., in Sambrook
et al., Molecular Cloning, A LaboratoryManual, 3 rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
Press (2001). Nucleic acids may be transiently or stably transfected in the desired host cells,
according to any suitable method.
             [0196] In some embodiments, one or more polypeptides may be produced in vivo in
an animal that has been engineered or transfected with one or more nucleic acid molecules
encoding the polypeptides, according to any suitable method.
             Purification of Anti-CSF1R Antibodies
             [0197] Anti-CSF1R antibodies may be purified by any suitable method. Such
methods include, but are not limited to, the use of affinity matrices or hydrophobic
interaction chromatography. Suitable affinity ligands include the CSF1R ECD and ligands
that bind antibody constant regions. For example, a Protein A, Protein G, Protein A/G, or an
antibody affinity column may be used to bind the constant region and to purify an anti
CSF1R antibody. Hydrophobic interactive chromatography, for example, a butyl or phenyl
column, may also suitable for purifying some polypeptides. Many methods of purifying
polypeptides are known in the art.

             Cell-free Production of Anti-CSF1R Antibodies
             [0198] In some embodiments, an anti-CSF1R antibody is produced in a cell-free
system. Nonlimiting exemplary cell-free systems are described, e.g., in Sitaraman et al.,
Methods Mol. Biol. 498: 229-44 (2009); Spirin, Trends Biotechnol. 22: 538-45 (2004); Endo
et al., Biotechnol. Adv. 21: 695-713 (2003).
Methods of Detecting Factors
             [0199] The present disclosure relates to methods of reducing one or more factors
selected from IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL6,
MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9. In some embodiments, a subject has an elevated level of one
or more factors selected from IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5,
CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 prior to treatment with the antibodies
described herein. In some embodiments, the level of a factor is determined by detecting the
level of the protein. Nonlimiting exemplary amino acid sequences for human IL-6, IL-1I3, IL
8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-2
are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 96 to 108, respectively. Any native forms of the proteins,
including naturally-occurring variants, such as variants comprising substitutions and/or
deletions (such as truncations), variants comprising post-translational modifications, splice
variants, and allelic variants, are specifically contemplated.
             [0200] In some embodiments, the level of the factor is determined by detecting the
level of the mRNA. Exemplary nucleotide sequences for human IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2,
CXCL1O, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 mRNA
(or its complement, cDNA) are known in the art. In some instances, the level of an mRNA
may correlate with the level of the encoded protein, so that detection of the mRNA level may
be used to determine whether the level of the protein is, for example, elevated prior to
treatment, or has been reduced following treatment. In some embodiments, the level of the
protein is determined. It should be noted, however, that it is not necessary to determine the
level of the factor(s) before or after treatment with the antibody in order to carry out the
methods described herein. It can be assumed, in some instances, that a particular condition
involves an elevated level of one or more of the recited factors, and therefore that a subject
with the condition would benefit from a treatment that reduces one or more of the recited
factors. Therefore, unless explicitly stated, detecting the level of one or more factors before
or after treatment is not required in order to carry out the claimed methods.

10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

             [0201] Any method of detecting the level of a protein in a sample is contemplated.
One skilled in the art can select a suitable method depending on the type of sample being
analyzed and the identity and number of proteins being detected. Nonlimiting exemplary
such methods include immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blotting, multiplex analyte
detection (using, for example, Luminex* technology), mass spectrometry, etc.
             [0202] Similarly, any method of detecting the level of an mRNA in a sample is
contemplated. One skilled in the art can select a suitable method depending on the type of
sample being analyzed and the identity and number of mRNAs being detected. Nonlimiting
exemplary such methods include RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR and microarray-based
methods, etc.
             [0203] Any method of determining the levels of CD16+ and/or CD16- monocytes is
contemplated. One skilled in the art can select a suitable method depending on the type of
sample being analyzed. Nonlimiting exemplary methods of determining the levels of CD16+
and/or CD 16- monocytes include methods provided by commercial kits, such as CD 16+
Moncyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyl Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).

are shown in Table 9 (Table of Sequences; SEQ ID NOs: 96 to 108, respectively). Additional
native mature sequences may also exist. In some embodiments, native mature sequences have
 1 to 10 or more amino acids deleted from the amino terminus of the mature sequences shown
in Table 9. In some embodiments, native mature sequences have one or more amino acid
additions, deletions, and/or substitutions in relative to the mature sequences shown in Table
9. All of the native mature forms of each factor are intended to be encompassed herein.

MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9, administering to a subject with inflammatory arthritis an
effective amount of an antibody that binds CSF1R and blocks CSF1 and IL-34 ligand
binding, such as huAbI to huAb 16, reduces cartilage damage. Reducing cartilage damage, in
some embodiments, comprises reducing chondrocyte loss, reducing collagen disruption,
and/or reducing cartilage loss. Cartilage damage can be measured by any method in the art,
including, but not limited to, imaging one or more affected joints. Nonlimiting exemplary
imaging techniques for detecting cartilage damage include MRI, CT scan, arthroscopy, and x
ray imaging. In some embodiments, the progression of cartilage damage is slowed following
administration of the antibody and/or during a particular time interval during which the
subject is undergoing treatment with the antibody. The treatment may be a single dose or

level of N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) in urine from the subject, wherein an elevated level of
NTx indicates elevated bone resorption in the subject. Thus, in some embodiments, a reduced
level of NTx indicates a reduction in bone resorption. NTx levels may be determined, in
certain instances, before and after treatment with an antibody that binds CSF 1R, and/or may
be determined periodically throughout the course of treatment to monitor the effectiveness of
the treatment in reducing bone loss. NTx levels may be determined using any method in the

level of C-terminal telopeptide (CTx) in serum from the subject, wherein an elevated level of
CTx indicates elevated bone resorption in the subject. Thus, in some embodiments, a reduced
level of CTx indicates a reduction in bone resorption. CTx levels may be determined, in
certain instances, before and after treatment with an antibody that binds CSF 1R, and/or may
be determined periodically throughout the course of treatment to monitor the effectiveness of
the treatment in reducing bone loss. CTx levels may be determined using any method in the

In some embodiments, the subject has an autoimmune condition selected from rheumatoid
arthritis and SLE (lupus). In some embodiments, following administration of an effective
amount of an antibody that binds CSF1R and blocks CSF1 and IL-34 ligand binding, the
number of CD 16- monocytes is substantially unchanged. In some embodiments, CD 16+
monocytes are reduced to a greater extent than CD 16- monocytes are reduced when an
antibody that binds CSF1R and blocks CSF1 and IL-34 ligand binding is administered to the
subject. In some embodiments, CD16+ monocytes are reduced by at least 20%, at least 30%,
at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 7 0%, at least 80%, or at least 90%. In some embodiments,
CD16- monocytes are reduced by less than 30%, less than 20%, or less than 10%. In some

rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Castleman's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lupus erythematosus, and
inflammatory bowel disease. In some embodiments, a subject with a CD16+ disorder has an
elevated level of CD 16+ monocytes, compared to the level of CD 16+ monocytes in a healthy
individual or a pool of healthy individuals. In some embodiments, a subject with a CD16+

monocyte level prior to developing the CD16+ disorder (for example, in some embodiments,
substantially prior to developing any symptoms of the CD16+ disorder such that the subject
would, in retrospect, be considered "healthy" at the time).
             [0226] In some embodiments, methods of identifying subjects who may benefit from
an antibody that binds CSF1R, wherein the antibody blocks binding of CSF1 to CSF1R and
blocks binding of IL-34 to CSF1R (such as huAbI to huAb16) are provided. In some such
embodiments, a method comprises determining the level of at least one, at least two, at least
three, or at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or at
least ten factors selected from IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5,
CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the subject. In some embodiments, an
elevated level of at least one of the factors in the subject indicates that the subject may benefit
from the antibody that binds CSF1R. In some embodiments, the subject has a CD16+
disorder. In some embodiments, the subject has rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments,
the subject has an elevated level of CD16+ monocytes.
             [0227] In some embodiments, methods of predicting responsiveness in a subject
suffering from an inflammatory condition to an antibody that binds CSF1R, wherein the
antibody blocks binding of CSF1 to CSF1R and blocks binding of IL-34 to CSF1R (such as
huAbI to huAb 16) are provided. In some such embodiments, a method comprises
determining the level of at least one, at least two, at least three, or at least four, at least five, at
least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or at least ten factors selected from IL-6,
IL-13, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL1O, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2,
and MMP-9 in the subject. In some embodiments, an elevated level of at least one of the
factors in the subject indicates that the subject is more likely to respond to the antibody that
binds CSF1R. In some embodiments, the subject has a CD16+ disorder. In some
embodiments, the subject has rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments, the subject has an
elevated level of CD16+ monocytes.
             [0228] Many patients have an inadequate response to methotrexate, alone or in
combination with a TNF inhibitor. In some embodiments of the methods described herein,
the subject has a condition that is resistant to methotrexate (e.g., the subject is methotrexate
inadequate responder). A subject with a condition that is resistant to methotrexate, such as a
subject who is a methotrexate inadequate responder, may have previously responded to
methotrexate, but may have become resistant to methotrexate, or the subject may have never
                                                     59
10375519_1 (GHMatters) P99336.AU.1

responded to methotrexate. Resistance to methotrexate means that aspects of the condition
that would be expected to improve following a standard dose of methotrexate do not
improve, and/or improvement only occurs if greater than a standard dose of methotrexate is
administered. In some embodiments, a methotrexate inadequate responder has experienced,
or is experiencing, an inadequate response to methotrexate after receiving a standard dose for
at least two weeks, at least three weeks, at least four weeks, at least six weeks, or at least
twelve weeks. A "standard" dose is determined by a medical professional, and may depend
on the subject's age, weight, healthy history, severity of disease, the frequency of dosing, etc.
             [0229] In some embodiments of the methods described herein, the subject is a TNF
inhibitor inadequate responder. A subject who is a TNF inhibitor inadequate responder, may
have previously responded to a TNF inhibitor, but may have become less responsive to the
TNF inhibitor, or the subject may have never responded to the TNF inhibitor. Inadequate
response to a TNF inhibitor means that aspects of the condition that would be expected to
improve following a standard dose of the TNF inhibitor do not improve, and/or improvement
only occurs if greater than a standard dose is administered. In some embodiments, a TNF
inhibitor inadequate responder has experienced, or is experiencing, an inadequate response to
the TNF inhibitor after receiving a standard dose for at least two weeks, at least three weeks,
at least four weeks, at least six weeks, or at least twelve weeks. A "standard" dose is
determined by a medical professional, and may depend on the subject's age, weight, healthy
history, severity of disease, the frequency of dosing, etc. In some embodiments, a TNF
inhibitor inadequate responder has experienced, or is experiencing, an inadequate response to
a TNF inhibitor selected from infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, and
etanercept.
             [0230] In some embodiments, methods of treating a methotrexate inadequate
responder are provided. In some embodiments, a method comprises administering to the
methotrexate inadequate responder an antibody that binds CSF1 R, wherein the antibody
blocks binding of CSF1 to CSF1R and blocks binding of IL-34 to CSF1R, such as huAbI to
huAb 16. In some embodiments, the inadequate responder has a CD 16+ disorder. In some
embodiments, the CD 16+ disorder is selected from rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, Castleman's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's
disease, and ulcerative colitis, lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease. In
some embodiments, the CD16+ disorder is rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments, the
antibody substantially reduces the number of CD 16+ monocytes. In some embodiments, the
                                                 60

factors selected from IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9,
CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the inadequate responder is reduced following
administration of the antibody. In some embodiments, the inadequate responder has an
elevated level of CD16+ monocytes, for example, as compared to the level of CD16+
monocytes in a healthy individual or pool of healthy individuals. In some embodiments, the
antibody substantially reduces the number of CD16+ monocytes. In some embodiments, the
number of CD 16- monocytes are substantially unchanged following administration of the
antibody.
             [0231] In some embodiments, methods of treating a TNF inhibitor inadequate
responder are provided. In some embodiments, a method comprises administering to the
TNF inhibitor inadequate responder an antibody that binds CSF1R, wherein the antibody
blocks binding of CSF1 to CSF1R and blocks binding of IL-34 to CSF1R, such as huAbI to
huAb 16. In some embodiments, the inadequate responder has a CD 16+ disorder. In some
embodiments, the CD 16+ disorder is selected from rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, Castleman's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's
disease, and ulcerative colitis, lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease. In
some embodiments, the CD16+ disorder is rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments, the
antibody substantially reduces the number of CD 16+ monocytes. In some embodiments, the
number of CD 16- monocytes are substantially unchanged following administration of the
antibody. In some embodiments, the level of at least one, at least two, at least three, or at
least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or at least ten
factors selected from IL-6, IL-1I3, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9,
CXCL6, MMP-7, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the inadequate responder is reduced following
administration of the antibody. In some embodiments, the inadequate responder has an
elevated level of CD 16+ monocytes, for example, as compared to the level of CD 16+
monocytes in a healthy individual or pool of healthy individuals. In some embodiments, the
antibody substantially reduces the number of CD 16+ monocytes. In some embodiments, the
number of CD 16- monocytes are substantially unchanged following administration of the
antibody.

             Routes of Administration and Carriers
             [0232] In various embodiments, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered in vivo
by various routes, including, but not limited to, oral, intra-arterial, parenteral, intranasal,
intramuscular, intracardiac, intraventricular, intratracheal, buccal, rectal, intraperitoneal,
intradermal, topical, transdermal, and intrathecal, or otherwise by implantation or inhalation.
The subject compositions may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid, or
gaseous forms; including, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments,
solutions, suppositories, enemas, injections, inhalants, and aerosols. A nucleic acid molecule
encoding an anti-CSF1R antibody may be coated onto gold microparticles and delivered
intradermally by a particle bombardment device, or "gene gun," as described in the literature
(see, e.g., Tang et al., Nature 356:152-154 (1992)). The appropriate formulation and route of
administration may be selected according to the intended application.
             [0233] In various embodiments, compositions comprising anti-CSF1R antibodies are
provided in formulations with a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (see,
e.g., Gennaro, Remington: The Science and PracticeofPharmacy with Facts and
Comparisons:Drugfacts Plus, 2 0 th ed. (2003); Ansel et al., PharmaceuticalDosage Forms
and Drug Delivery Systems,         7 th ed., Lippencott Williams and Wilkins (2004); Kibbe et al.,
Handbook ofPharmaceuticalExcipients, 3 rd ed., Pharmaceutical Press (2000)). Various
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, which include vehicles, adjuvants, and diluents, are
available. Moreover, various pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as Ph
adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the
like, are also available. Non-limiting exemplary carriers include saline, buffered saline,
dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof.
             [0234] In various embodiments, compositions comprising anti-CSF1R antibodies
may be formulated for injection, including subcutaneous administration, by dissolving,
suspending, or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or
other oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids, or propylene
glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents,
suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives. In various
embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for inhalation, for example, using
pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and
the like. The compositions may also be formulated, in various embodiments, into sustained
release microcapsules, such as with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. A non
                                                    62

limiting exemplary biodegradable formulation includes poly lactic acid-glycolic acid
polymer. A non-limiting exemplary non-biodegradable formulation includes a polyglycerin
fatty acid ester. Certain methods of making such formulations are described, for example, in
EP 1 125 584 Al.
             [0235] Pharmaceutical packs and kits comprising one or more containers, each
containing one or more doses of an anti-CSF1R antibody are also provided. In some
embodiments, a unit dosage is provided wherein the unit dosage contains a predetermined
amount of a composition comprising an anti-CSF1R antibody, with or without one or more
additional agents. In some embodiments, such a unit dosage is supplied in single-use prefilled
syringe for injection. In various embodiments, the composition contained in the unit dosage
may comprise saline, sucrose, or the like; a buffer, such as phosphate, or the like; and/or be
formulated within a stable and effective Ph range. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the
composition may be provided as a lyophilized powder that may be reconstituted upon
addition of an appropriate liquid, for example, sterile water. In some embodiments, the
composition comprises one or more substances that inhibit protein aggregation, including,
but not limited to, sucrose and arginine. In some embodiments, a composition of the
invention comprises heparin and/or a proteoglycan.
             [0236] Pharmaceutical compositions are administered in an amount effective for
treatment or prophylaxis of the specific indication. The therapeutically effective amount is
typically dependent on the weight of the subject being treated, his or her physical or health
condition, the extensiveness of the condition to be treated, or the age of the subject being
treated. In general, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered in an amount in the range of
about 10 pg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight per dose. In some
embodiments, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered in an amount in the range of
about 50 pg/kg body weight to about 5 mg/kg body weight per dose. In some embodiments,
anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered in an amount in the range of about 100 pg/kg
body weight to about 10 mg/kg body weight per dose. In some embodiments, anti-CSF1R
antibodies may be administered in an amount in the range of about 100 pg/kg body weight to
about 20 mg/kg body weight per dose. In some embodiments, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be
administered in an amount in the range of about 0.5 mg/kg body weight to about 20 mg/kg
body weight per dose. In some embodiments, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered at
a dose of 0.2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg body weight.

             [0237] By appropriate dosing of an anti-CSF1R antibody (such as huAbl), effective
treatment may be achieved while minimizing certain adverse events, including, but not
limited to, elevation of creatine kinase (CK) and/or elevation of one or more hepatic
transaminases, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), and/or elevation of total bilirubin. In some embodiments, a dose of an anti-CSF1R
antibody (such as huAb 1) is selected such that CK levels are less than 1Ox the upper limit of
normal (ULN). In some embodiments, a dose of an anti-CSF1R antibody (such as huAbl) is
selected such that AST and/or ALT levels are less than 8x the upper limit of normal (ULN).
In some embodiments, a dose of an anti-CSF1R antibody (such as huAbl) is selected such
that AST and/or ALT levels are less than 3x ULN and total bilirubin is less than 2x ULN.
CK, bilirubin, AST, and/or ALT levels may be determined by any method in the art.
Methods of determining CK, AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels, and for determining the upper
limit of normal, are known in the art. In some embodiments, a baseline level of CK, AST,
ALT and/or bilirubin is determined for a subject prior to beginning treatment. In some
embodiments, levels CK, AST, ALT and/or bilirubin are determined during treatment, e.g., to
detect possible hepatic toxicity.
             [0238] Methods of determining CK, AST, ALT and bilirubin levels are known in the
art. In some embodiments, levels AST and ALT are determined using a coupled enzyme
reaction and measuring the decrease of NADH. In some embodiments, CK level is
determined using a coupled enzyme reaction and measuring formation of NADH. In some
embodiments, bilirubin level is determined by reacting bilirubin in a sample with diazotized
sulfanilic acid and photometrically measuring azobilirubin. Assays to determine CK, AST,
ALT and bilirubin levels are available from (and/or run by) many laboratories, such as Quest
Diagnostics, Mayo Medical Laboratories, etc. In some embodiments, the baseline level and
the treatment level of CK, AST, ALT and/or bilirubin are determined by the same laboratory.
Typically, each laboratory that assays CK, AST, ALT and/or bilirubin levels has determined
a normal range and ULN for CK, AST, ALT and/or bilirubin assays in that laboratory. In
various embodiments, CK, AST, ALT and/or bilirubin levels are determined in serum,
plasma, or whole blood. In some embodiments, CK, AST, ALT and/or bilirubin levels are
determined in serum or plasma. Information concerning drug-induced liver injury may be
found, e.g., in "Guidance for Industry: Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Permarketing Climical
Evaluation," U.S. Department of Health and Human Sevices, Food and Drug Administration,

             [0239] The anti-CSF1R antibody compositions may be administered as needed to
subjects. Determination of the frequency of administration may be made by persons skilled in
the art, such as an attending physician based on considerations of the condition being treated,
age of the subject being treated, severity of the condition being treated, general state of health
of the subject being treated and the like. In some embodiments, an effective dose of an anti
CSF1R antibody is administered to a subject one or more times. In various embodiments, an
effective dose of an anti-CSF1R antibody is administered to the subject once a month, less
than once a month, such as, for example, every two months or every three months. In other
embodiments, an effective dose of an anti-CSF1R antibody is administered more than once a
month, such as, for example, every three weeks, every two weeks or every week. An
effective dose of an anti-CSF1R antibody is administered to the subject at least once. In some
embodiments, the effective dose of an anti-CSF1R antibody may be administered multiple
times, including for periods of at least a month, at least six months, or at least a year.
             Combination Therapy
             [0240] Anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered alone or with other modes of
treatment. They may be provided before, substantially contemporaneous with, or after other
modes of treatment, for example, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or the
administration of a biologic, such as another therapeutic antibody. For treatment of
inflammatory arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, etc.), anti-CSF1R antibodies may be administered with other therapeutic agents,
for example, methotrexate, anti-TNF agents, including anti-TNF antibodies such as
Remicade@ (infliximab), Humira@ (adalimumab), Simponi@ (golimumab), and certolizumab
pegol, and soluble TNF receptors, such as Enbrel@ (etanercept); glucocorticoids such as
prednisone; leflunomide; azathioprine; JAK inhibitors such as CP 590690; SYK inhibitors
such as R788; anti-IL-6 agents, including anti-IL-6 antibodies such as elsilimomab,
siltuximab, and sirukumab, and anti-IL-6R antibodies such as Actermra@ (tocilizumab); anti
CD-20 agents, including anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituxin@ (rituximab), ibritumomab
tiuxetan, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, veltuzumab, and tositumomab; anti-CD19 agents, such
as anti-CD19 antibodies; anti-GM-CSF agents, such as anti-GM-CSF antibodies and anti
GM-CSFR antibodies; anti-IL-i agents, such as IL-i receptor antagonists, including
                                                65

anakinra; CTLA-4 agonists, such as CTLA4-Ig fusions, including abatacept and belatacept;
immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine.
             [0241] For treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be
administered with other therapeutic agents, for example, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil@);
corticosteroids, such as prednisone, methylprednisone, and prednisolone;
immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan@), azathioprine (Imuran@,
Azasan@), mycophenolate (Cellcept@), leflunomide (Arava), methotrexate (TrexalTM), and
belimumab (Benlysta).
             [0242] For treatment of multiple sclerosis, anti-CSF1R antibodies may be
administered with other therapeutic agents, for example, interferon alpha; interferon beta;
prednisone; anti-alpha4 integrin antibodies such as Tysabri; anti-CD20 antibodies such as
Rituxan; FTY720 (fingolimod; Gilenya@); and cladribine (Leustatin).

             Example 1: Humanized anti-CSF1R antibodies
             [0244] Various humanized anti-CSF1R antibodies were developed previously. See,
e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 2011/140249.
             [0245] The sequences for each of the humanized heavy chain variable regions and
humanized light chain variable regions, aligned with the sequences of the parental chimeric
antibody variable regions and the sequences of the human acceptor variable framework
regions are shown in Figures 1 (heavy chains) and 2 (light chains). The changes in
humanized variable region sequences relative to the human acceptor variable framework
region sequences are boxed. Each of the CDRs for each of the variable regions is shown in a
boxed region, and labeled as "CDR" above the boxed sequences.

             [0247] The 16 humanized antibodies were tested for binding to human, cynomolgus
monkey, and mouse CSF1R ECD, as described previously. See, e.g., PCT Publication No.
WO 2011/140249. The antibodies were found to bind to both human and cynomolgus
monkey CSF1R ECD, but not to mouse CSF1R ECD. The humanized antibodies were also
found to block binding of CSF1 and IL-34 to both human and mouse CSF1R and to inhibit
CSF1-induced and IL-34-induced phosphorylation of human CSF1R expressed in CHO cells.
See, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 2011/140249.

            [0250] Synovial biopsy samples with a volume of approximately 5 mm 3 were
cultured in triplicate in complete medium comprising DMEM (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) with 2 Mm L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml gentamicin, 20 Mm
HEPES buffer, and 10% FCS. Cultures were performed at 37'C in a 5% C02/95% air
humidified environment. Synovial samples were cultured for 4 days in the absence or
presence of increasing concentrations of huAb 1 or control IgG4 antibody ET904 (Eureka
Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA). Cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at -80 0 C in
two separate aliquots. One aliquot was evaluated for production of IL-6 by ELISA. The other
aliquot was evaluated for multiplex analysis of cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase
production using Luminex@ technology (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The three tissue
fragments in each culture condition were pooled, snap-frozen and preserved for Mrna
expression analysis. Some biopsies showed cytokine and/or metalloproteinase levels below
the limit of detection, however such data was still included in the tables and figures discussed
below.
            [0251] The results of the IL-6 production analysis by ELISA are shown in Table 6.

             [0253] Figure 4 shows the results of the multiplex analysis after culturing four of the
synovial biopsy explants in 1 [g/ml huAbI or control antibody for 4 days. Levels of IL-6, IL
1P, IL-8, CCL2 (also referred to as MCP-1), CXCL10, TNF-a, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9,
CXCL6, and MMP-9 were reduced in all four samples after incubation with 1 [g/ml huAb 1,
relative to incubation with 1 [g/ml control antibody. Levels of MMP-7 were reduced in the
two samples with measurable levels of MMP-7 in the control antibody-treated groups.
             [0254] Table 7 below shows the results of the multiplex analysis for the four synovial
biopsy explants shown in Figure 4. In Table 7, the average cytokine level in the four

             Example 3: Anti-CSF1R Antibody treatment reduces tissue macrophage
             numbers in joints in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis
             [0256] Male DBA/1 mice were injected intradermally at the base of the tail on day 0
and day 21 with 150 pl of bovine type II collagen (2 mg/ml) emulsified in Freund's Complete
Adjuvant. For prophylactic dosing, mice were dosed starting on day 0 with vehicle, anti
CSF1R antibody (a chimeric rat anti-mouse CSF1R monoclonal antibody containing a mouse
IgG1 Fc region) at 30 mg/kg, or Enbrel* at 10 mg/kg. Treatment continued 3 times weekly
through day 32. For therapeutic dosing, mice were randomized into treatment groups once
swelling was established in at least one paw. Group mean paw swelling scores were 0.5-1
(out of a possible maximal score of 5) at the time of enrollment. Mice were dosed 3 times a
week with vehicle, anti-CSF1R antibody at 30 mg/kg, or with Enbrel* at 10 mg/kg. Mice
were terminated on arthritis day 23.
             [0257] For both the prophylactic and the therapeutic models, 4 animals from each
dose group were selected as representative animals based on arthritis scores comparable to
the median score sum within the group. At termination, paws and knees were collected into
formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained for F4/80, to identify tissue macrophage.
F4/80 cells were counted in the entire peri-articular soft tissue and dermis of each paw or
knee section present. F4/80-positive cells in the bone marrow were not counted. Total counts
were then normalized to counts per five 200x fields. This was done to account for the
multifocal nature of the F4/80-positive cellular infiltrate. The tissues were generally of
similar sizes with small variations accounted for in the conversion. Statistical significance
was determined by one-way ANOVA followed with a Tukey's post test comparing each
group to each other.
             [0258] The results of the prophylactic anti-CSF1R antibody treatment are shown in
Figure 6. Prophylactic treatment of mice with collagen-induced arthritis with anti-CSF1R
antibody resulted in a significant decrease in the number of macrophages in front paws (A)
and knees (B), and in both cases the reduction was greater than the reduction following
treatment with Enbrel@ (***        = p < 0.001; * = p < 0.05; ns = not significant).
             [0259] The results of the therapeutic anti-CSF1R antibody treatment are shown in
Figure 7. Therapeutic treatment of mice with collagen-induced arthritis with anti-CSF1R
antibody resulted in a significant decrease in the number of macrophages in front paws (A)
