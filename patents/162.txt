         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to medicine intermediates terephthalic acid synthesis
 5 method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Terephthalic acid is used to produce polyethylene terephthalate. Another
   important application of terephthalic acid is the production of plasticizers, which
10 includes two categories: one is the dioctyl terephthalate, which is the product of
   terephthalic acid and 2-ethylhexanol esterification reaction, it is a high flash point, high
   specific resistance of high-quality plasticizer, especially for heat and insulation
   requirements of the production of high cable material; the second is a polyester
   plasticizer, it is a terephthalic acid and polyols, such as diethylene glycol, triethylene
15 glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, butanediol. Such as the product of the esterification
   polycondensation reaction, the relative molecular mass is generally between 1000 and
   4000, and the relative molecular mass ratio of the polyester as a plasticizer is much
   smaller than that of the polyester for chemical and plastic packaging. However, most of
   the    existing   synthetic  methods     are using    p-phenylethanone     and potassium
20 permanganate as reactant, it is complicated and the final yield is not very high.
   Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further improving the
   quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it has important
   economic significance.
