BONDED VENEER PANELS AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME
ABSTRACT
A simulated wood veneer product (100) is disclosed. The simulated wood veneer product (100)
includes a paper substrate (112) and an imprintable wood fiber material (116) applied to one side
of the paper substrate. The imprintable wood fiber material (116) provides the paper substrate
with depth and allows the paper to receive and retain an imprinted wood grain texture. Once
imprinted, the veneer product is printed with a simulated wood grain pattern to create a realistic
simulated veneer product which is referred to herein as a "bonded veneer". The bonded veneer
product can then be adhered to a structural or composite wood panel, such as an MDF panel, to
create a simulated wood veneer panel which can be used in the construction of furniture
products.

BONDED VENEER PANELS AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME
[0001] Incorporated by reference herein is Australian Patent Application No <removed-apn>.
Field
[0001a] The present disclosure relates generally to structural wood products and wood veneers that
are applied to structural wood products for use in furniture, and more particularly to a simulated
veneer product made from a paper substrate and an imprintable material adhered to the paper
substrate.
Background
[0002]     Wood veneers are desirable because they give the appearance of solid wood, with all of its
grain and texture, to products made of composite wood materials. Wood veneers provide stability
and strength as well as improved aesthetic appearance when they are applied over structural or
composite wood products. The use of wood veneers is also desirable for forest sustainability and
lower material costs.
[0003]     Simulated wood veneer products have also had success in lower cost furniture products. In
this regard, paper veneers with printed wood grain patterns have seen some success in the market.
However, these simulated paper veneer products lack the depth and texture of real wood veneers.
Summary of Invention
[0004]     Accordingly, the development of improved simulated veneer products that enhance the
stability and strength of structural wood panels, allow for deeper three-dimensional grain patterns
over standard paper veneers, reduce costs and provide sustainability of forests would be highly
desirable.
[0005]     The veneer product described herein solves the problems of the prior art by providing a
simulated veneer product comprising a paper substrate and an imprintable material applied to one
side of the paper substrate. The imprintable material provides the paper substrate with depth and
allows the paper substrate to receive and retain an imprinted wood grain texture. Once imprinted,
the veneer product is then printed with a simulated wood grain pattern to create

                                                   2
a very realistic simulated wood veneer product which is referred to herein as a "bonded veneer".
The bonded veneer product can then be adhered to a structural or composite wood panel, such as
a Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) panel, to create a veneer panel which can be used in the
construction of furniture products.
[0006] In one embodiment, the wood grain texture is imprinted into the paper substrate side of
the bonded veneer and also printed on the paper substrate side. The imprintable material side is
glued to the wood panel.
[0007] In another embodiment, the wood grain texture is imprinted into the imprintable material
side and is also printed on the imprintable material side. In this embodiment, the paper substrate
side is glued to the wood panel.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0018] Referring to Fig. 1, a first exemplary embodiment of the bonded veneer is illustrated and
generally indicated at 100. The bonded veneer product 100 includes a substrate 112, which is
preferably a paper material, but may also comprise other suitable substrate materials, including
but not limited to polymer or polymer film materials. The substrate 112 is coated with an
adhesive material 114 and an imprintable material 116.
[0019] The paper substrate 112 is preferably a conventional wood pulp paper material supplied
in wide format roll form. The weight and brightness of the paper can vary depending on the
particular end use application however, the paper is preferably between 0.3mm and 0.4mm
thick.
[0020] Suitable materials for the adhesive material 114 may include urea-formaldehyde resins
(UF), phenol formaldehyde resins (PF), melamine-formaldehyde resins (MF), methylene
diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) or polyurethane (PU) resins. Other adhesives may be used as
suitable for the intended purpose.
[0021] The imprintable material 116 can be selected from a variety of wood fiber materials
including all variations of soft and hard woods. Preferably the imprintable material is a sawdust
material similar to the wood fiber material used in making Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF).
The imprintable material 116 can also be selected from other sustainable materials such as
bamboo fiber, soybeans, cornstarch, or other eco-friendly materials. When adhered to the paper
substrate 112, the wood fiber material 116 provides the paper substrate 112 with an increased
thickness and texture simulating real wood veneer. The wood fiber material 116 is preferably
applied in a thickness that is approximately 0.5mm to about 0.7mm thick. The wood fiber
material 116 may be applied separately or may be premixed into the adhesive 114 prior to
application to the substrate 116 (now shown).

                                                   4
[0022] Referring to Fig. 2, an exemplary method of making the bonded veneer 100 is described.
The paper substrate 112 is preferably supplied in roll form for a continuous production process.
The paper substrate 112 is fed through an adhesive coater device, such as a hot melt coater, to
apply a layer of adhesive 114 and then through a fiber scattering machine which evenly
distributes a layer of raw wood fiber material 116 (sawdust) onto the still wet adhesive 114. The
coating thicknesses of the adhesive 114 and the imprintable sawdust material 116 can be varied
as desired for the intended end-use application.
[0023] Thereafter, the coated substrate 112 is preferably passed through a long drying oven to
dry the adhesive 114 and set the fiber material 116 into a completed bonded veneer product 100.
The bonded veneer 100 is then re-rolled onto a take-up roll for further processing.
[0024] Although not shown in the flow charts, a second application of adhesive and imprintable
wood fiber material can be completed if a thicker veneer material is desired.
[0025] The bonded veneer product 100 is then imprinted (on the paper substrate side) with a
wood grain texture 118 (See Fig. 9) to simulate the look and feel of real wood. The imprinting is
completed in a nip roll imprinting device with one smooth roller and a second roller having a
raised wood grain texture. When the bonded veneer passes through the nip, the wood grain
texture 118 is imprinted into the bonded veneer product 100. The adhesive 114 and fibrous
sawdust material 116 provide the paper substrate 112 with a thickness and pliability that is
capable of receiving and retaining the realistic wood grain texture 118 from the imprinting
rollers.
[0026] After imprinting, the bonded veneer can be rolled again onto a take up roll for later
printing or fed directly into a multi-stage printing assembly to complete the process. The multi
stage printing assembly successively lays down colors to create a simulated wood grain pattern
120 on the imprinted substrate 112. For example, the bonded veneer 100 may be printed using a
six color printing machine. The first cylinder of the printing machine will apply a base coat to
the substrate. The second through sixth cylinders of the printing machine will apply different
colors to the substrate, the combination of which provides the printed appearance of a finished
or natural wood product. The colors may be changed to vary the tone and final appearance of the
print. When completed, the imprinted and printed veneer product 100 mimics real wood veneer
in both texture and appearance.

                                                  5
[0027] Referring now to Figs. 3 and 4, the bonded veneer 100 may be applied to a structural
wood panel 218 with an adhesive 220 to form a bonded veneer panel 200. The bonded veneer
100 is applied to the panel 218 with the paper substrate side 112 facing up (simulated wood
grain facing away from the panel 218). The bonded veneer 100 may be applied to one or more
surfaces of the panel 218, including the edges. Excess bonded veneer 100 is trimmed away from
the panel 218 to create a finished bonded veneer panel 200 which may then be used to make
furniture, shelving and other products that have previously been constructed with real wood
veneer panels.
[0028] Suitable materials for the structural wood panel 218 may be any flat planar structural or
composite wood material, but more particularly comprise engineered wood materials, such as
plywood, hardboard, medium-density fiberboard ("MDF"), particleboard and the like.
[0029] Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, a second exemplary embodiment of the bonded veneer
product is illustrated and generally indicated at 300. The bonded veneer product 300 includes
the same layers as the first embodiment 100. In particular, the bonded veneer product 300
includes a substrate 312 that is coated with an adhesive 314 and an imprintable material 316 is
applied to the adhesive 314. The imprintable material 316 may be applied separately or
premixed into the adhesive 314 prior to application to the substrate 316.
[0030] In contrast, in this embodiment, the simulated wood grain pattern is embossed and
printed onto the exposed back surface of the imprintable material 316. In this regard, the
imprintable material 316 provides an exterior surface texture and appearance that appearance
mimics real wood veneers.
[0031] Like the first embodiment 100 suitable materials for the adhesive 314 in the second
embodiment 300 also include urea-formaldehyde resins (UF), phenol formaldehyde resins (PF),
melamine-formaldehyde resins (MF), methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) or polyurethane
(PU) resins. Other adhesives may be used.
[0032] Referring to Fig. 6, the process steps for forming the bonded veneer 300 are generally
the same as shown in Fig. 2 with the following exceptions. After the bonded veneer 300 exits
the drying ovens and is re-rolled, the rear surface (outer surface) of the imprintable material 316
must be sanded to provide a smooth veener surface capable of accepting the imprinted grain
texture and further accepting the printed wood grain pattern. Accordingly, the rolled material is

                                                   6
passed through a sanding machine to provide the rear surface with a suitable finish for further
processing. Thereafter, the same imprinting and printing steps are completed, the only
difference being that the material 316 receives the imprinted texture and printed patterns.
[0033] Referring to Figs. 7 and 8, the bonded veneer product 300 may be applied to a structural
or composite wood panel 418 with an adhesive 420. The bonded veneer 300 is applied to the
panel 418 with the paper substrate side 316 facing the panel 418 (material 316 and simulated
wood grain texture outwardly facing away from the panel 418). The bonded veneer 300 may be
applied to one or more surfaces of the panel 418, including the edges. Excess bonded veneer 300
is trimmed away from the panel 418 to create a finished bonded veneer panel 400 which may
then be used to make furniture, shelving and other products that have previously been
constructed with real wood veneer panels.
[0034] Like the first embodiment 200, suitable materials for the structural wood panel 418 in the
second embodiment 400 also comprise engineered wood materials, such as plywood, hardboard,
medium-density fibreboard ("MDF"), particleboard and the like.
[0035] Additional coatings may be applied to the imprintable material 116 side or paper
substrate 112 side in order to improve one or more properties such as durability, mold
inhibition, fire retardance, UV protection, or to improve the finished appearance, such as gloss
or matte finish coatings.
[0036] It can therefore be seen that the present invention provides a novel bonded veneer
product that is eco-friendly, stable and strong, low material cost and minimizes the use of
natural wood. The bonded veneer product has the further advantage of reducing costs in
manufacturing.
[0037] It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications
can be made to the illustrated embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present
invention. All such modifications and changes are intended to be within the scope of the present
invention except as limited by the scope of the appended claims.
