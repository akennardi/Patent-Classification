        A method for a marine seismic survey can include towing streamers that are spaced apart
in a cross-line direction by a streamer separation (L) and towing seismic source elements that are
spaced apart in the cross-line direction by a source separation based on an integer (k), an inverse
of a quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S), and the streamer separation as represented by
(k + 1/S)L. The seismic source elements can be actuated and seismic signals can be detected at
each of a plurality of receivers on the streamers.

                                              Background
[0002]          In the past few decades, the petroleum industry has invested heavily in the
development of marine seismic survey techniques that yield knowledge of subterranean
formations beneath a body of water in order to find and extract valuable mineral resources, such
as oil. High-resolution images of a subterranean formation are helpful for quantitative
interpretation and improved reservoir monitoring. For a typical marine seismic survey, a marine
survey vessel tows one or more sources below the water surface and over a subterranean
formation to be surveyed for mineral deposits. Receivers may be located on or near the seafloor,
on one or more streamers towed by the marine survey vessel, or on one or more streamers towed
by another vessel. The marine survey vessel typically contains marine survey equipment, such
as navigation control, source control, receiver control, and recording equipment. The source
control may cause the one or more sources, which can be air guns, marine vibrators,
electromagnetic sources, etc., to produce signals at selected times. Each signal is essentially a
wave called a wavefield that travels down through the water and into the subterranean formation.
At each interface between different types of rock, a portion of the wavefield may be refracted,
and another portion may be reflected, which may include some scattering, back toward the body
of water to propagate toward the water surface. The receivers thereby measure a wavefield that
was initiated by the actuation of the source.

                                          Detailed Description
[0021]          This disclosure is related generally to the field of marine surveying. Marine
surveying can include, for example, seismic surveying, among others. For example, this
disclosure may have applications in marine seismic surveying, in which one or more sources are
used to generate wave-fields, and receivers (towed and/or ocean bottom) receive energy
generated by the sources and affected by the interaction with a subsurface formation. The
receivers thereby collect marine seismic survey data, which can be useful in the discovery and/or
extraction of hydrocarbons from subsurface formations.
[0022]          Marine seismic surveys can cover a large area; for example, hundreds or
thousands of square kilometers of the seafloor. However, only a portion of the area can be
surveyed at a time. A marine seismic survey may be performed with a marine survey vessel
towing an array of seismic source elements and one or more streamers, which may limit the
subline coverage for a sail line. As used herein, "subline" refers to a line of receiver-source
midpoints in the in-line direction for a particular seismic source element and all of the receivers
on a particular streamer. As used herein, "receiver-source midpoint" refers to a planar surface
coordinate in the xy-plane that is mid-way between the location of a particular seismic source
element and the location of a particular receiver where the reflection of a wavefield occurs. The
planar surface coordinate can be expressed as (x,y). The x-coordinate can correspond to an in
line position and the y-coordinate can correspond to a cross-line position. As used herein,
"inline" refers to the direction of travel of the vessel, and "cross-line" is perpendicular to the
                                                    4

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
direction of travel of the vessel. For the sake of efficiency, illustrations and descriptions herein
sublines are drawn assuming that all of the streamers of an array are straight and parallel.
However, sublines can be curved when the streamers are curved such as in a spiral sail line. As
used herein, "fold" refers to a number of times there are contributions to a subline from any
seismic source element and receiver combination. As used herein, "subline coverage" refers to
the distance between the outermost two sublines. As a result of the limits on subline coverage, it
may take several days to several months to complete a marine seismic survey. How much of the
area that can be surveyed at a time can be dependent on a configuration of the array the streamers
and seismic source elements. For example, as the marine seismic survey vessel tows the array of
the streamers and seismic source elements in a particular configuration, the cross-line steamer
spacing and the cross-line source separation can determine the width of a subline coverage
surveyed by the configuration of the streamers and seismic source elements. The cross-line
subline coverage is generally less than the streamer spread width. As used herein, "streamer
spread width" refers to the cross-line distance between the outermost streamers of an array of
streamers.
[0023]          A marine seismic survey can include a single sail line, such as a spiral sail line, or
multiple sail lines to survey a survey area. As the cross-line source separation increases, the
subline coverage increases for a corresponding sail line. Thus, it can be beneficial to increase the
cross-line source separation to increase the subline coverage such that a larger portion of an area
can be surveyed at a time and the overall survey completion time may be reduced by using fewer
sail lines. As the width of each pass increases, a larger portion of the survey area can be
surveyed at a time. Thus, a lesser quantity of sail lines would be needed to complete the marine
seismic survey. As a result, the marine seismic survey can be completed in less time.
[0024]          Increasing the cross-line source separation can improve subsurface sampling.
Increasing the cross-line source separation can yield short near offsets for a large portion of the
streamers. The quantity of receivers with short near offsets can be increased by increasing the
cross-line source separation. As used herein, "offset" refers to the distance between a seismic
source element and any receiver on a streamer. In contrast, "near offset" for a particular
streamer refers to the distance between a seismic source element and the receiver that is most
closely located to the seismic source element. In processing, marine seismic survey data, such as
reflection information, from only the receivers with short near offsets may contribute to the
                                                  5

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
generation of the subsurface image. When a seismic source element and a receiver are located
closely together, the ray path from the seismic source element to the subsurface and back up to
the receiver is generally vertical. In contrast, the ray path through the subsurface is generally at a
high angle when the offset is long. The physics of elastic solids is such that the amplitude of a
reflected wavefield varies with the offset for reflections off of the same interface, even when the
material properties on either side of the interface are the same at each reflection. Reflection
information from reflections at near offsets can be used to infer properties and the composition
of the subsurface and to examine the reflection amplitudes at other offsets. Reflection
information at near offset, such as amplitude, can be used in Amplitude versus Offset (AVO)
analysis to infer the composition of the subsurface. In processing of reflection information for
shallow geology, only the reflection information corresponding to shorter offsets might be used.
Thus, if the near offsets are large such that the streamers are a long distance behind the seismic
source elements or some of the streamers are far from the seismic source elements in the cross
line direction then there may not be reflection information that contributes to the shallow seismic
image. A seismic three dimensional volume may then contain stripes of poor shallow reflection
information at the boundaries between adjacent sail lines. The resolution of a subsurface image
at sail line boundaries can be improved by increasing the cross-line source separation.
[0025]          Short near offsets can aid in the prediction of multiples in the marine seismic
survey data by increasing the quantity of receivers with short near offsets relative to some
previous approaches. With a wider cross-line source separation, the near offset for streamers
near the middle of an array of streamers and the edges of the array of streamers can be short.
Predicted multiples can be subtracted from the marine survey seismic data in any manner known
to one of ordinary skill in the art. As used herein, "multiples" refers to wavefields that have
undergone more than one reflection. For example, a multiple can be a wavefield that reflects off
of the seafloor, such as the solid surface 104 illustrated in Figure 1, then reflects off of the sea
surface, such as the water surface 109, then reflects off of the subsurface, such as the first
uplifted rock layer 112, and then is received by one of the receivers 122. The high resolution of
the reflection information from receivers with short near offsets improves the capability of
predicting multiples.

[0027]          The figures herein follow a numbering convention in which the first digit or digits
correspond to the drawing figure number and the remaining digits identify an element or

and a similar element may be referenced as 326 in Figure 3. Analogous elements within a Figure
may be referenced with a hyphen and extra numeral or letter. See, for example, elements 320-1,
....  320-14 in Figure 3. Such analogous elements may be generally referenced without the

collectively referenced as 320. As will be appreciated, elements shown in the various
embodiments herein can be added, exchanged, and/or eliminated so as to provide a number of
additional embodiments of the present disclosure. In addition, as will be appreciated, the
proportion and the relative scale of the elements provided in the figures are intended to illustrate
certain embodiments of the present invention, and should not be taken in a limiting sense.
[0028]          Figure 1 illustrates a front or review (xz-plane 130) view of marine seismic
surveying in which acoustic signals are emitted by a seismic source 126, such as a seismic source
element, for recording by receivers 122 for processing and analysis in order to help characterize
the structures and distributions of features and materials underlying the solid surface of the earth.
Figure 1 shows a domain volume 102 of the earth's surface comprising a solid volume 106 of
sediment and rock below the solid surface 104 of the earth that, in turn, underlies a fluid volume
108 of water having a water surface 109 such as in an ocean, an inlet or bay, or a large
freshwater lake. The domain volume 102 shown in Figure 1 represents an example experimental
domain for a class of marine seismic surveys. Figure 1 illustrates a first sediment layer 110, an
uplifted rock layer 112, second, underlying rock layer 114, and hydrocarbon-saturated layer 116.
One or more elements of the solid volume 106, such as the first sediment layer 110 and the first
                                                    7

uplifted rock layer 112, can be an overburden for the hydrocarbon-saturated layer 116. In some
instances, the overburden may include salt.
[0029]           Figure 1 shows an example of a marine survey vessel 118 equipped to carry out
marine seismic surveys. In particular, the marine survey vessel 118 can tow one or more
streamers 120 (shown as one streamer for ease of illustration) generally located below the water
surface 109. The streamers 120 can be long cables containing power and data-transmission lines
(electrical, optical fiber, etc.) to which receivers may be connected. In one type of marine
seismic survey, each receiver, such as the receiver 122 represented by the shaded disk in Figure
1, comprises a one or more of sensors including a motion sensor that detects particle
displacement within the water by detecting particle motion variation, such as velocities or
accelerations, and/or a hydrophone that detects variations in pressure. In another type of marine
seismic survey, each receiver can include one or more hydrophones and two or more motion
sensors. The streamers 120 and the marine survey vessel 118 can include sophisticated sensing
electronics and data-processing facilities that allow receiver readings to be correlated with
absolute positions on the water surface and absolute three-dimensional positions with respect to a
three-dimensional coordinate system. In Figure 1, the receivers along the streamers are shown to
lie below the water surface 109, with the receiver positions correlated with overlying surface
positions, such as a surface position 124 correlated with the position of receiver 122. The marine
survey vessel 118 can also tow one or more seismic source elements 126 that produce acoustic
signals as the marine survey vessel 118 and streamers 120 move across the water surface 109. A
seismic source element 126 is a single seismic source such as a single air gun. The seismic
source elements 126 can be grouped together and be components of one or more seismic source
sub-arrays. As used herein, "seismic source sub-array" refers to seismic source elements that can
be actuated separately or simultaneously. For example, seismic source elements of a seismic
source sub-array can be actuated separately and sequentially but without any overlap in
recording time between actuations of the seismic source elements. Alternatively, seismic source
elements of a seismic source sub-array can be actuated simultaneously with an overlap in
recording time between actuations of the seismic source elements. A seismic source sub-array
can be seismic source elements that are coupled to a common tow line. A seismic source sub
array can have a common feed line coupled to the seismic source elements of the seismic source
sub-array.

                                                                             PGS-16144-US-ORGI
[0030]          The streamers 120 can be spaced apart from one another (spaced apart from an
adjacent streamer) by a cross-line streamer separation. The cross-line direction is in the y
direction (not illustrated in Figure 1), which is into and out of the page. Adjacent seismic source
elements 126 can be spaced apart from one another by a cross-line source separation. The cross
line source separation can be greater than the cross-line streamer separation. The cross-line
source separation can be based on the cross-line streamer separation. The cross-line source
separation and the cross-line streamer separation are illustrated and discussed further below in
association with Figures 2-16.
[0031]          The seismic source elements 126 and/or streamers 120 may also be towed by
other independent vessels, or may be otherwise disposed in fluid volume 108. For example,
receivers may be located on ocean bottom cables or nodes fixed at or near the solid surface 104,
and seismic source elements 126 may also be disposed in a nearly-fixed or fixed configuration.
The streamers 120 can be towed by one vessel, such as the marine survey vessel 118, and the
seismic source elements 126 can be towed by one or more other independent vessels. For the
sake of efficiency, illustrations and descriptions herein show seismic receivers located on
streamers, but it should be understood that references to seismic receivers located on a
"streamer" or "cable" should be read to refer equally to seismic receivers located on a towed
streamer, an ocean bottom receiver cable, and/or an array of nodes.
[0032]          Figure 1 shows an expanding, spherical acoustic signal, illustrated as semicircles
of increasing radius centered at the seismic source element 126, representing a down-going
wavefield 128, following an acoustic signal emitted by the seismic source element 126. The
down-going wavefield 128 is, in effect, shown in a vertical plane cross section in Figure 1. The
outward and downward expanding down-going wavefield 128 may eventually reach the solid
surface 104, at which point the outward and downward expanding down-going wavefield 128
may partially scatter, may partially reflect back toward the streamers 120, and may partially
refract downward into the solid volume 106, becoming elastic acoustic signals within the solid
volume 106.
[0033]          One or more lateral force and depth (LFD) control devices (not shown in Figure
 1) can be components of or coupled to the streamers 120. Each LFD control device can include
one or more rotatable control surfaces that when moved to a selected rotary orientation with
respect to the direction of movement of such surfaces through the fluid volume 108 creates a

                                                                              PGS-16144-US-ORGI
hydrodynamic lift in a selected direction to urge the streamer 120 in a direction upward or
downward in the fluid volume 108 or laterally along the water surface 109 with respect to the
direction of motion of the marine survey vessel 118. Thus, the LFD control devices can be used
to maintain the streamers in a particular geometric arrangement. For example, the streamers 120
can be substantially straight and parallel to each other. The LFD control devices can be used to
induce a streamer spread angle. As used herein, "streamer spread angle" refers to an angle
between a sail line of the marine survey vessel 118 and one of the streamers 120. Inducing a
streamer spread angle that is greater than zero degrees can cause the cross-line streamer
separation at the front end of the streamers 120 to be less than the cross-line streamer separation
at the back, or aft, end of the streamers 120. This gradual increase in the cross-line streamer
separation from the front end to the back end of the streamers 120 can "fan out" the streamers
 120. Fanning out the streamers can increase fold uniformity at sublines near the edges of each
sail line, thereby reducing a likelihood that streamer feathering may cause far ends of the
streamers not to contribute to all sublines. Streamer feathering may be caused by prevailing
conditions such as currents.
[0034]           Figure 2 illustrates a plan (yx-plane 232) view of marine seismic surveying with
two seismic source elements 226-1 and 226-2. Figure 2 shows an example of a marine survey
vessel 218, which can be analogous to the marine seismic survey vessel 118 illustrated in Figure
1, equipped to carry out marine seismic surveys. The marine seismic vessel 218 can tow one or
more streamers, such as the streamers 220-1, 220-2, 220-3, and 220-4, which can be analogous to
the streamer 120 illustrated in Figure 1. The streamers 220-1, 220-2, 220-3, and 220-4 can
include one or more receivers (represented by the small rectangles), such as the receivers 222-1,
222-2, 222-3, and 222-4, which can be analogous to the receivers 122 illustrated in Figure 1.
The streamers 220-1, 220-2, 220-3, and 220-4 are referred to collectively as the streamers 220,
the receivers 222-1, 222-2, 222-3, and 222-4 and the receivers not numbered in Figure 2 are
referred to collectively as the receivers 222, and the seismic source elements 226-1 and 226-2 are
referred to collectively as the sources 226. The marine seismic survey vessel can tow one or
more seismic source elements, such as the seismic source elements 226-1 and 226-2, which can
be analogous to the seismic source elements 126 illustrated in Figure 1. The recorded data can
be three-dimensional in that it includes data from wavefields traveling in both an inline (x)
direction and a cross-line (y) direction, plus depth. Although Figure 2 illustrates two seismic

source elements 226-1 and 226-2, four streamers 220, and thirty-two receivers 222, embodiments
are not so limited.
[0035]          The marine survey vessel 218 can include a control system and a recording
system, which may be separate systems that communicate data between each other, or they may
be sub-systems of an integrated system. The control system can be configured to selectively
actuate the seismic source elements 226, while the recording system can be configured to record
the signals generated by the receivers 222 in response to the energy imparted into the water and
thereby into subterranean material formations below the solid surface. The recording system can
be configured to determine and record the geodetic positions of the seismic source elements and
the receivers 222 at any time. Seismic source element actuation and signal recording by the
receivers 222 may be repeated a plurality of times while the marine survey vessel 218 moves
through the water. Each actuation record may include, for each of the receivers 222, signals
corresponding to the energy produced by the seismic source elements 226.
[0036]          The cross-line streamer separation 231 illustrates the spacing of the streamer 220
2 from the streamer 220-3. The cross-line direction is in the y-direction illustrated in Figure 2.
Although only indicated for the streamers 220-2 and 220-3, the streamer 220-1 can be spaced
apart from the streamer 220-2 by the cross-line streamer separation 231 and the streamer 220-3
can be spaced apart from the streamer 220-4 by the cross-line streamer separation 231. The
cross-line streamer separation 231 can be a nominal cross-line streamer separation. As used
herein, a "nominal cross-line streamer separation" refers to the cross-line distance between the
front ends of adjacent streamers. The cross-line streamer separation 231 can be an average
cross-line streamer separation. When the streamers 220 are irregularly spaced apart from one
another, the cross-line separation 231 can be the average of the cross-line separation between
each of the streamers 220. For example, the cross-line streamer separation 231 can be the
average of the spacing of the streamer 220-1 from the streamer 220-2, the spacing of the
streamer 220-2 from the streamer 220-3, and the spacing of the streamer 220-3 from the streamer
220-4. In at least one embodiment, the streamers 220 can be towed in a curved path.
[0037]          As illustrated in Figure 2, the seismic source element 226-1 is spaced apart from
the seismic source element 226-2 by a cross-line source separation 250. In at least one
embodiment, the cross-line source separation 250 can be directly proportional to the cross-line
streamer separation 231, which is a distance identified as length (L). In at least one embodiment,
                                                   11

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
the constant of proportionality can be a fraction rather than a whole number as represented by the
expression k + 1/S. In at least one embodiment, the cross-line source separation 250 can be
based on an integer (k), an inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements 226 (1/S), and
the cross-line streamer separation 231 for a particular marine seismic survey. The cross-line
source separation 250 can be based on a sum of the integer (k) and the inverse of the quantity of
the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the cross-line streamer separation (L) as
represented by the expression (k + 1/S)L. As an example, when the cross-line source separation
250 is an odd or even multiple of the cross-line streamer separation 231 plus one half of the
cross-line streamer separation 231, the cross-line subline separation is one quarter of the cross
line streamer separation 231. In at least one embodiment, the integer (k) can be between one and
one less than a quantity of the streamers (N-1), inclusive. As in the example of Figure 2 where
there are four streamers 220, the integer (k) can be 1, 2, or 3. In at least one embodiment, the
integer (k) can be between one and half of the quantity of the streamers (N/2), inclusive. As in
the example of Figure 2 where there are four streamers 220, the integer (k) can be 1 or 2. In at
least one embodiment, the integer (k) can be between one and half of one less than the quantity
of the streamers ((N- 1)/2), inclusive. As in the example of Figure 2 where there are four
streamers 220, the integer (k) can be I or 2. For example, if N is 8 then the range of the integer
(k) is bounded by I and 7/2 (3.5). The integer (k) can be 1, 2, or 3. In at least one embodiment,
the cross-line source separation 250 can be based on an integer (k), a multiple (a) of an inverse
of the quantity of the seismic source elements 226 (a/S), and the cross-line streamer separation
231 for a particular marine seismic survey. Additional examples of various cross-line source
separations based on various values of the integer (k), various cross-line streamer separation, and
various quantities of seismic source elements are discussed further below in association with
Figures 3-13A.
[0038]          In at least one embodiment, the cross-line source separation 250 can be based on
an even integer (ke) and the cross-line streamer separation (L) 231. The cross-line source
separation 250 can be based on the multiplication of the even integer (ke) and the cross-line
streamer separation (L) 231 as represented by the expression keL. The even integer (ke) ensures
that the seismic source elements 226 are nominally positioned in between a pair of adjacent
streamers as opposed to being positioned in line with a streamer. As used herein, "nominally
positioned in between a pair of adjacent streamers" refers to situations where outside factors,
                                                  17

                                                                              PGS-16144-US-ORGI
such as waves and turbulence caused by one or more vessels, temporarily causes a seismic
source element to not be positioned in between a pair of adjacent streamers. In some previous
approaches, seismic source elements may be positioned in line with a streamer when the cross
line source separation is based on the multiplication of an odd integer and the cross-line streamer
separation. If a seismic source element, such as the seismic source element 226-1, was in line
with a streamer, such as the streamer 220-2, then there may be physical interference with the
respective connections of the seismic source element 226-1 and the streamer 220-2, signal
interference in the form of noise in the marine seismic survey data, or both physical and signal
interference. Positioning a seismic source element between a pair of streamers can improve the
cross-line spatial resolution relative to that when a seismic source element is positioned in line
with a streamer. Figures 5 and 8 illustrate examples of configurations of an array of seismic
source elements and streamers where the cross-line source separation is based on the
multiplication of an even integer (ke) and the cross-line streamer separation (L).
[0039]          For the sake of efficiency, illustrations and descriptions herein include individual
seismic source elements. However, in at least one embodiment the cross-line source separation
250 can be the distance between adjacent seismic source sub-arrays. As used herein, a "seismic
source sub-array" refers to a plurality of seismic source elements. For example, a first seismic
source sub-array can be positioned where the seismic source element 226-1 is positioned in
Figure 2 and a second seismic source sub-array can be positioned where the seismic source
element 226-2. If the seismic source elements of a seismic source sub-array are actuated
together then the location of the seismic source sub-array can be grouped together and
represented by a single point at the geometric center of the seismic source sub-array. The cross
line source separation 250 would then be the distance between the geometric centers of the first
and second seismic source sub-arrays. In contrast, if the seismic source elements of a seismic
source sub-array are actuated individually then the cross-line source separation 250 can be the
distance between corresponding seismic source elements of the first and second seismic source
sub-arrays. The first seismic source sub-array can include the same quantity or a different
quantity of seismic source elements as the second seismic source sub-array. The cross-line
source separation 250 can be based on a sum of the integer (k) and the inverse of the quantity of
the seismic source sub-arrays (1/SA) multiplied by the cross-line streamer separation (L) as
represented by the expression (k + 1/SA)L.

                                                                                PGS-16144-US-ORGI
[0040]           As discussed above, a benefit increasing the cross-line source separation can be
shorter near offsets over a large portion of the streamers. A wider cross-line source separation
can yield shorter near offsets to the outer streamers in an array of streamers than for a narrower
source separation. For example, in Figure 2 the near offset for the seismic source element 226-1
and the streamer 220-1 is the distance from the seismic source element 226-1 and the receiver
222-1. The near offset for the seismic source element 226-1 and the streamer 220-2 is the
distance from the seismic source element 226-1 and the receiver 222-2. Figure 2 illustrates the
seismic source elements 226 being positioned fore of the streamers 220. However, the seismic
source elements 226 can be positioned above the streamers 220 such that the seismic source
elements 226 are aft of the front end of the streamers 220. Therefore, the near offset of a
streamer may not be the receiver located at the front end of the streamer. The seismic source
elements 226 can be positioned above the streamers 220 by using longer lines to the seismic
source elements 226 or by having the seismic source elements be towed by another vessel.
[0041]           With a wider cross-line source separation, the near offset for streamers near the
middle of the array of streamers, such as the streamers 220-2 and 220-3, and the near offset for
streamers near the edges of the array of streamers, such as the streamers 220-1 and 220-4 can be
short. Short near offsets can aid in the prediction of multiples in marine seismic survey data.
Predicted multiples can be subtracted from the marine survey seismic data. Subtracting
multiples from marine seismic survey data can be performed in any manner known to one of
ordinary skill in the art.
[0042]           Figure 3 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 334) view of a previous configuration
of seismic source elements 326-1 and 326-2 and streamers 320-1, 320-2, 320-3, 320-4, 320-5,
320-6, 320-7, 320-8, 320-9, 320-10, 320-11, 320-12, 320-13, and 320-14 where two seismic
source elements 326-1 and 326-2 positioned in between the innermost two streamers 320-7 and
320-8. Each of the circles illustrated in Figures 3-9 and 11-13A represents a receiver, such as the
receiver 122 illustrated in Figure 1, on each of the streamers. Figures 3-9 and 11-13A show
fourteen streamers and two (or three) seismic source elements configured to be towed by a
marine survey vessel, such as the marine survey vessel 218 illustrated in Figure 2.
[0043]           In Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 351 between the seismic source
elements 326-1 and 326-2 is half of the cross-line streamer separation 331 (L/2). The cross-line
direction is in the y-direction illustrated in Figures 3-15B. Although the cross-line streamer
                                                     14

                                                                              PGS-16144-US-ORGI
separation 331 is shown as being between the streamer 320-1 and 320-2, the cross-line streamer
separation 331 can be the distance between any two adjacent streamers of the streamers 320 or
the average of the distances between adjacent streamers of the streamers 320. This also applies
to the cross-line streamer separation illustrated in Figures 4-9 and 1 1-13A. Although in Figures
3-9 and 1 1-13A the streamers and the seismic source elements are illustrated to be on the water
surface, the streamers, the seismic source elements, or the streamers and the seismic source
elements can be at a depth below the water surface.
[0044]          In Figures 3-9 and 1 1-13A, ray paths are shown from each of the seismic source
elements down to the solid surface at a respective receiver-source midpoint and back up to one of
the streamers. For example, the receiver-source midpoint 378 corresponds to the streamer 320-7
and the seismic source element 326-1 illustrated in Figure 3. A ray path can represent a
trajectory of a point on an acoustic wavefront propagating from a seismic source element, to the
subsurface and then back up to a receiver. For example, from the seismic source element 326-1
to the solid surface 304 and then back up to the streamer 320-7 illustrated in Figure 3. The
nominal cross-line subline separation is a fraction of the cross-line streamer separation for a
particular configuration of an array of seismic source elements and streamers. For example, the
nominal cross-line subline separation 333 illustrated in Figure 3 is one quarter of the cross-line
streamer separation 331 (L/4). As used herein, "nominal cross-line subline separation" refers to
a distance in the cross-line direction between adjacent sublines that is dependent on the cross-line
streamer separation. A smaller nominal cross-line subline separation in the cross-line direction
can increase the cross-line resolution of marine seismic survey data and an image generated from
the marine seismic survey data. The subline coverage can be the distance between the outermost
receiver-source midpoints. For example, the subline coverage 340 shows the length of the
subline coverage for the particular configuration illustrated in Figure 3.   As discussed further
below in association with Figures 13B-15, a receiver-source midpoint has a corresponding full
fold subline. Thus, the nominal cross-line subline separation can be analogous to a cross-line
subline separation between adjacent full fold sublines.
[0045]          In the example of Figure 3, the cross-line streamer separation 331 is 100 meters
(in) such that the cross-line source separation 351 is 50 m. The seismic source element 326-1 is
positioned 25 m to the right of the streamer 320-7 and the seismic source element 326-2 is
                                                   '15

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
positioned 25 m to the left of the streamer 320-8. The nominal cross-line subline separation 333
is 25 m. The subline coverage 340 is 675 m.
[0046]          Figure 4 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 434) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 426-1 and 426-2 and streamers 420-1, 420-2, 420-3, 420-4. 420-5, 420
6, 420-7, 420-8, 420-9, 420-10, 420-11, 420-12, 420-13, and 420-14 where two seismic source
elements 426-1 and 426-2 are positioned outside the innermost two streamers 420-7 and 420-8.
In contrast to the example of Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 450 is greater than the
cross-line source separation 351 such that the seismic source elements 426-1 and 426-2 are
positioned outside the streamers 420-7 and 420-8. The cross-line source separation 450 can be
analogous to the cross-line source separation 250 illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 4, the cross
line source separation 450 is based on the cross-line streamer separation 431 (L).
[0047]          The cross-line source separation 450 is based on the sum of the integer (k) and the
inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the cross-line streamer
separation 431 (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1I/S)L. As in the example of Figure 3,
the cross-line streamer separation 431 is 100 m. In the example of Figure 4, the integer (k) is
one and there are two seismic source elements 426. Thus, the cross-line source separation 450 is
(1+1/2)*100 m, or 150 m. The seismic source element 426-1 is positioned 25 m to the left of the
streamer 420-7 and the seismic source element 426-2 is positioned 25 m to the right of the
streamer 420-8.
[0048]            Even though the cross-line source separation 450 is wider than the cross-line
source separation 351, the nominal cross-line subline separation 433 is still one quarter of the
cross-line streamer separation 431 (L/4), or 25 m, as in the example of Figure 3, without having
to increase the quantity of streamers (N) or decrease the cross-line streamer separation (L) 431.
The subline coverage 441 is 725 m, 50 m greater than the subline coverage 340 in the example of
Figure 3. However, the subline coverage 441 includes two zero fold sublines as indicated by the
open vertical arrows.
[0049]          Sublines and their corresponding coordinates can be described using a uniform
rectangular grid regardless of the geometry of the streamers. For example, if prevailing
conditions causes the geometry of the streamers to be curved, the sublines are still described
using the same uniform rectangular grid. Sublines can be spaced apart from one another by the
nominal cross-line subline separation. However, for some cross-line source separations, such as
                                                    16

                                                                                PGS-16144-US-ORGI
the cross-line source separation 450, there may be an irregularity in the cross-line subline
separations within a particular subline coverage, such as the subline coverage 441. The
irregularity in the cross-line subline separations can be a cross-line subline separation different
than the nominal cross-line subline separation for certain outer portions of the subline coverage.
The irregularity in the cross-line subline separations can be represented by a "zero fold subline,"
which refers to a location where a finite fold subline (non-zero fold subline) would be if the
nominal cross-line subline separation continued but for the irregularity in the cross-line subline
separations. A zero fold subline can correspond to a reduction marine seismic survey data or
contributions to a subsurface image. Zero fold sublines are discussed further below in
association with Figures 13-15.
[0050]           Figure 5 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 534) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 526-1 and 526-2 and streamers 520-1, 520-2, 520-3, 520-4, 520-5, 520
6, 520-7, 520-8, 520-9, 520-10, 520-11, 520-12, 520-13, and 520-14 where two seismic source
elements 526-1 and 526-2 are outside the innermost two streamers 520-7 and 520-8. In contrast
to the example of Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 552 is wider than the cross-line
source separation 351 such that the seismic source elements 526-1 and 526-2 are positioned
outside the streamers 520-7 and 520-8. The cross-line source separation 552 can be analogous to
the cross-line source separation 250 illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 5, the cross-line source
separation 552 is based on the cross-line streamer separation 531 (L).
[0051]           The cross-line source separation 552 is based on the even integer (ke) multiplied
by the cross-line streamer separation 531 (L) as represented by the expression keL. As in the
example of Figure 4, the cross-line streamer separation 531 is 100 in. However, in contrast to
the example of Figure 4, in the example of Figure 5 the even integer (ke) is two. Thus, the cross
line source separation 552 is 2*100 m, or 200 in. The seismic source element 526-1 is
positioned 50 m to the left of the streamer 520-7 and the seismic source element 526-2 is
positioned 50 m to the right of the streamer 520-8.      The nominal cross-line subline separation
533 is half of the cross-line streamer separation 531 (L/2), or 50 m. The subline coverage 543 is
750 m, 25 m greater than the subline coverage 441 in the example of Figure 4. The subline
coverage 543 does not include zero fold sublines but does include double fold sublines as
indicated by the thick vertical arrows. Double fold sublines correspond to two coincidental, or
nearly coincidental, receiver-source midpoints.

[0052]           Figure 6 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 634) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 626-1 and 626-2 and streamers 620-1, 620-2, 620-3, 620-4, 620-5, 620
6, 620-7, 620-8, 620-9, 620-10, 620-11, 620-12, 620-13, and 620-14 where two seismic source
elements 626-1 and 626-2 are positioned outside the innermost two streamers 620-7 and 620-8.
In contrast to the example of Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 654 is wider than the
cross-line source separation 351 such that the seismic source elements 626-1 and 626-2 are
positioned outside the streamers 620-7 and 620-8. The cross-line source separation 654 can be
analogous to the cross-line source separation 250 illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 6, the cross
line source separation 654 is based on the cross-line streamer separation 631 (L).
[0053]           The cross-line source separation 654 is based on the sum of the integer (k) and the
inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the cross-line streamer
separation 631 (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1/S)L. As in the example of Figure 4,
the cross-line streamer separation 631 is 100 m and there are two seismic source elements 626.
However, in the example of Figure 6, the integer (k) is two. Thus, the cross-line source
separation 654 is (2+1/2)*100 m, or 250 in. The seismic source element 626-1 is positioned 75
m to the left of the streamer 620-7 and the seismic source element 626-2 is positioned 75 m to
the right of the streamer 620-8.
[0054]           Even though the cross-line source separation 654 is wider than the cross-line
source separation 351 of the example of Figure 3 and even wider than the cross-line source
separation 450 of the example of Figure 4, the nominal cross-line subline separation 633 is still
one quarter of the cross-line streamer separation 631 (L/4), or 25 m. The nominal cross-line
subline separation 633 remains one quarter of the cross-line streamer separation 631 (L/4)
without having to increase the quantity of streamers (N) or decrease the cross-line streamer
separation (L) 631. Increasing the integer (k) from one as in the example of Figure 4 to two
increases the subline coverage 644 from 725 to 775 m. However, the subline coverage 644
includes four zero fold sublines as indicated by the open vertical arrows.
[0055]           Figure 7 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 734) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 726-1 and 726-2 and streamers 720-1, 720-2, 720-3, 720-4, 720-5, 720
6, 720-7, 720-8, 720-9, 720-10, 720-11, 720-12, 720-13, and 720-14 where two seismic source
elements 726-1 and 726-2 are positioned outside the innermost four streamers 720-6. 720-7, 720
8, and 720-9. In contrast to the example of Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 756 is
                                                     18

                                                                                PGS-16144-US-ORGI
wider than the cross-line source separation 351 such that the seismic source elements 726-1 and
726-2 are positioned outside the streamers 720-7 and 720-8 and outside the streamers 720-6 and
720-9. The cross-line source separation 756 can be analogous to the cross-line source separation
250 illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 7, the cross-line source separation 756 is based on the
cross-line streamer separation 731 (L).
[0056]           The cross-line source separation 756 is based on the sum of the integer (k) and the
inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the cross-line streamer
separation 731 (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1/S)L. As in the example of Figure 4,
the cross-line streamer separation 731 is 100 m and there are two seismic source elements 726.
However, in the example of Figure 7, the integer (k) is three. Thus, the cross-line source
separation 756 is (3+1/2)*100 m, or 350 in. The seismic source element 726-1 is positioned 25
in to the left of the streamer 720-6 (125 m to the left of the streamer 720-7) and the seismic
source element 726-2 is positioned 25 in to the right of the streamer 720-9 (125 m to the right of
the streamer 720-8).
[0057]           Even though the cross-line source separation 756 is wider than the cross-line
source separation 351 of the example of Figure 3 and even wider than the cross-line source
separation 450 of the example of Figure 4, the nominal cross-line subline separation 733 is still
one quarter of the cross-line streamer separation 731 (L/4), or 25 m. The nominal cross-line
subline separation remains one quarter of the cross-line streamer separation 731 (L/4) without
having to increase the quantity of streamers (N) or decrease the cross-line streamer separation
(L) 731. Increasing the integer (k) from one as in the example of Figure 4 to three increases the
subline coverage 745 from 725 to 825 m. However, the subline coverage 745 includes six zero
fold sublines as indicated by the open vertical arrows.
[0058]           Figure 8 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 834) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 826-1 and 826-2 and streamers 820-1, 820-2, 820-3, 820-4, 820-5. 820
6, 820-7, 820-8, 820-9, 820-10, 820-11, 820-12, 820-13, and 820-14 where two seismic source
elements 826-1 and 826-2 positioned outside the innermost four streamers 820-6, 820-7, 820-8,
and 820-9. In contrast to the example of Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 858 is wider
than the cross-line source separation 351 such that the seismic source elements 826-1 and 826-2
are positioned outside the streamers 820-7 and 820-8 and outside the streamers 820-6 and 820-9.
The cross-line source separation 858 can be analogous to the cross-line source separation 250
                                                     19

                                                                                PGS-16144-US-ORGI
illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 8, the cross-line source separation 858 is based on the cross-line
streamer separation 831 (L).
[0059]           The cross-line source separation 856 is based on the even integer (ke) multiplied
by the cross-line streamer separation 831 (L) as represented by the expression keL. As in the
example of Figure 4, the cross-line streamer separation 831 is 100 m. However, in contrast to
the example of Figure 4, in the example of Figure 8 the even integer (ke) is four. Thus, the cross
line source separation 856 is 4*100 m., or 400 m. The seismic source element 826-1 is
positioned 50 m to the left of the streamer 820-6 (150 m to the left of the streamer 820-7) and the
seismic source element 826-2 is positioned 50 m to the right of the streamer 820-9 (150 m to the
right of the streamer 820-8). The nominal cross-line subline separation 833 is half of the cross
line streamer separation 831 (L/2), or 50 m. The subline coverage 846 is 850 m, 125 m greater
than the subline coverage 441 in the example of Figure 4. The subline coverage 846 does not
include zero fold sublines but does include double fold sublines as indicated by the thick vertical
arrows. Double fold sublines correspond to two coincidental, or nearly coincidental, receiver
source midpoints.
[0060]           Figure 9 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 934) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 926-1 and 926-2 and streamers 920-1, 920-2, 920-3, 920-4, 920-5, 920
6, 920-7, 920-8, 920-9, 920-10, 920-11, 920-12, 920-13, and 920-14 where two seismic source
elements 926-1 and 926-2 positioned outside the innermost four streamers 920-6, 920-7, 920-8,
and 920-9. In contrast to the example of Figure 3, the cross-line source separation 960 is wider
than the cross-line source separation 351 such that the seismic source elements 926-1 and 926-2
are positioned outside the streamers 920-7 and 920-8 and outside the streamers 920-6 and 920-9.
The cross-line source separation 960 can be analogous to the cross-line source separation 250
illustrated in Figure 2.
[0061]           In Figure 9, the cross-line source separation 960 is based on the cross-line
streamer separation 931 (L). The cross-line source separation 960 is based on the sum of the
integer (k) and the inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the
cross-line streamer separation 931 (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1/S)L. As in the
example of Figure 4, the cross-line streamer separation 931 is 100 m and there are two seismic
source elements 926. However, in the example of Figure 9, the integer (k) is four. Thus, the
cross-line source separation 960 is (4+1/2)* 100 in, or 450 m. The seismic source element 926-1
                                                    20

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
is positioned 75 m to the left of the streamer 920-6 (175 m to the left of the streamer 920-7) and
the seismic source element 926-2 is positioned 75 m to the right of the streamer 920-9 (175 in to
the right of the streamer 920-8).
[0062]          Even though the cross-line source separation 956 is wider than the cross-line
source separation 351 in the example of Figure 3 and even wider than the cross-line source
separation 450 in the example of Figure 4, the nominal cross-line subline separation 933 is still
one quarter of the cross-line streamer separation 931 (L/4), or 25 m, without having to increase
the quantity of streamers (N) or decrease the cross-line streamer separation (L) 931. Increasing
the integer (k) from one as in the example of Figure 4 to four increases the subline coverage 947
from 725 to 875 m. However, the subline coverage 947 includes eight zero fold sublines as
indicated by the open vertical arrows. The nominal cross-line subline separation 833 of the
example of Figure 8 is L/2. In contrast, the nominal cross-line subline separation 933 is L/4. In
Figure 8, there is a full fold subline (indicated by the thin vertical arrows) or a double fold
subline (indicated by the thick vertical arrows) every L/2 of the subline coverage 846. However,
in Figure 9 is a full fold subline (indicated by the thin vertical arrows) every L/4 only in the
middle of the subline coverage 947, but at the ends of the subline coverage 947 there is a full
fold subline every L/2. Full fold sublines correspond to a single receiver-source midpoint.
[0063]          Figure 10 illustrates a plan (yx-plane 1032) view of marine seismic surveying
with three seismic source elements 1026-1, 1026-2, and 1026-3. Figure 10 is analogous to
Figure 2 except that there are three seismic source elements 1026-1, 1026-2, and 1026-3. The
marine seismic survey vessel 1018 can tow one or more seismic source elements, such as the
seismic source elements 1026-1, 1026-2, and 1026-3, which can be analogous to the seismic
source elements 126 illustrated in Figure 1. The seismic source elements 1026-1, 1026-2, and
1026-3 are referred to collectively as the seismic source elements 1026.
[0064]          The cross-line streamer separation 1031 illustrates the spacing of the streamer
1020-2 from the streamer 1020-3.       Although only indicated for the streamers 1020-2 and 1020
3, the streamer 1020-1 can be spaced apart from the streamer 1020-2 by the cross-line streamer
separation 1031 and the streamer 1020-3 can be spaced apart from the streamer 1020-4 by the
cross-line streamer separation 1031. The cross-line streamer separation 1031 can be a nominal
cross-line streamer separation. The cross-line streamer separation 1031 can be an average cross
line streamer separation. When the streamers 1020 are irregularly spaced apart from one
                                                   71

                                                                             PGS-16144-US-ORGI
another, the cross-line separation 1031 can be the average of the cross-line separation between
each of the streamers 1020. For example, the cross-line streamer separation 1031 can be the
average of the spacing of the streamer 1020-1 from the streamer 1020-2, the spacing of the
streamer 1020-2 from the streamer 1020-3, and the spacing of the streamer 1020-3 from the
streamer 1020-4. In at least one embodiment, the streamers 1020 can be towed in a curved path.
[0065]          As illustrated in Figure 10, the seismic source element 1026-1 is spaced apart
from the seismic source element 1026-2 by a cross-line source separation 1062 and the seismic
source element 1026-2 is spaced apart from the seismic source element 1026-3 by the cross-line
source separation 1062. In at least one embodiment, the cross-line source separation 1062 can be
directly proportional to the cross-line streamer separation 1031 (L). In at least one embodiment,
the cross-line source separation 1062 can be based on an integer (k), an inverse of the quantity of
the seismic source elements 1026 (1/S), and the cross-line streamer separation 1031 for a
particular marine survey. The cross-line source separation 1062 can be based on a sum of the
integer (k) and the inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the
cross-line streamer separation (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1/S)L. The integer (k)
can be between one and one less than a quantity of the streamers (N-1), inclusive. As in the
example of Figure 10 where there are four streamers 1020, the integer (k) can be 1, 2, or 3.
[0066]          In at least one embodiment, the integer (k) can be between one and half of the
quantity of the streamers (N/2), inclusive. As in the example of Figure 10 where there are four
streamers 1020, the integer (k) can be 1 or 2. In at least one embodiment, the integer (k) can be
between one and half of one less than the quantity of the streamers ((N-1)/2), inclusive. As in
the example of Figure 10 where there are four streamers 1020 (N = 4), then the range of the
integer (k) is bounded by I and 3/2 (1.5). Thus, the integer (k) can be 1.
[0067]          Although not illustrated in Figure 10, in at least one embodiment the cross-line
source separation 1062 can be the distance between adjacent seismic source sub-arrays. A first
seismic source sub-array, including a plurality of seismic source elements, can be positioned
where the seismic source element 1026-1 is positioned in Figure 10. Similarly, a second seismic
source sub-array, including a different plurality of seismic source elements, can be positioned
where the seismic source element 1026-2 is positioned in Figure 10 and a third seismic source
sub-array, including yet another different plurality of seismic source elements, can be positioned
where the seismic source element 1026-3 is positioned in Figure 10. If the seismic source

                                                                              PGS-16144-US-ORGI
elements of a seismic source sub-array are actuated together then the location of the seismic
source sub-array can be grouped together and represented by a single point at the geometric
center of the seismic source sub-array. The cross-line source separation 1062 would then be the
distance between the geometric centers of the first and second seismic source sub-arrays and the
distance between the geometric centers of the second and third seismic source sub-arrays. In
contrast, if the seismic source elements of a seismic source sub-array are actuated individually
then the cross-line source separation 1062 can be the distance between corresponding seismic
source elements of the first and second seismic source sub-arrays. The first seismic source sub
array can include the same quantity or a different quantity of seismic source elements as the
second or third seismic source sub-arrays. The second seismic source sub-array can include the
same quantity or a different quantity of seismic source elements as the first or third seismic
source sub-arrays. The cross-line source separation 1062 can be based on a sum of the integer
(k) and the inverse of the quantity of the seismic source sub-arrays (1/SA) multiplied by the
cross-line streamer separation (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1/SA)L.
[0068]           As discussed above, a benefit increasing the cross-line source separation can be
shorter near offsets over a large portion of the streamers. A wider cross-line source separation
can yield shorter near offsets to the outer streamers in an array of streamers than for a narrower
source separation. For example, in Figure 10 the near offset for the seismic source element
1026-1 and the streamer 1020-1 is the distance from the seismic source element 1026-1 and the
receiver 1022-1. The near offset for the seismic source element 1026-1 and the streamer 1020-2
is the distance from the seismic source element 1026-1 and the receiver 1022-2. Figure 10
illustrates the seismic source elements 1026 being positioned forward of the streamers 1020.
However, the seismic source elements 1026 can be positioned above the streamers 1020 such
that the seismic source elements 1026 are aft of the front end of the streamers 1020. Therefore,
the near offset of a streamer may not be the receiver located at the front end of the streamer. The
seismic source elements 1026 can be positioned above the streamers 1020 by using longer lines
to the seismic source elements 1026 or by having the seismic source elements be towed by
another vessel.
[0069]           With a wider cross-line source separation, the near offset for streamers near the
middle of the array of streamers, such as the streamers 1020-2 and 1020-3, and the near offset for
streamers near the edges of the array of streamers, such as the streamers 1020-1 and 1020-4 can
                                                  ?I

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
be relatively short (as compared to the near offset distance if the if the cross-line source
separation was smaller). Short near offsets can aid in the prediction of multiples in marine
seismic survey data. Predicted multiples can be subtracted from the marine survey seismic data.
Subtracting multiples from marine seismic survey data can be performed in any manner known
to one of ordinary skill in the art.
[0070]           Figure 11 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 1134) view of a previous
configuration of seismic source elements 1126-1, 1126-2, and 1126-3 and streamers 1120-1,
1120-2, 1120-3, 1120-4, 1120-5, 1120-6, 1120-7, 1120-8, 1120-9, 1120-10, 1120-11, 1120-12,
1120-13, and 1120-14 where three seismic source elements 1126-1, 1126-2. and 1126-3 are
positioned in between the innermost two streamers 1120-7 and 1120-8. In some previous
approaches to marine seismic surveying, seismic source elements may be positioned in between
the innermost two streamers as illustrated in Figure 11. In Figure 11, the cross-line source
separation 1161 between the seismic source elements 1126-1 and 1126-2 and the seismic source
elements 1126-2 and 1126-3 is one third of the cross-line streamer separation 1131 (L/3). The
nominal cross-line subline separation 1133 is one sixth of the cross-line streamer separation 1131
(L/6). The subline coverage 1148 shows the length of the subline for this configuration.
[0071]           In the example of Figure 11, the cross-line streamer separation 1131 is 150 in
such that the cross-line source separation 1161 is 50 in. The seismic source element 1126-1 is
positioned 25 in to the right of the streamer 1120-7, the seismic source element 1126-2 is
positioned 75 m to the right of the seismic source element 1126-1 (midway between the
streamers 1120-7 and 1120-8), and the seismic source element 1126-3 is positioned 25 m to the
left of the streamer 1120-8. The nominal cross-line subline separation 1133 is 25 m. The
subline coverage 1148 is 1,025 m.
[0072]           Figure 12 illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 1234) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 1226-1, 1226-2, and 1226-3 and streamers 1220-1, 1220-2. 1220-3,
1220-4, 1220-5, 1220-6, 1220-7, 1220-8, 1220-9, 1220-10, 1220-11, 1220-12, 1220-13, and
 1220-14 where two of three seismic source elements 1226-1, 1226-2, and 1226-3 are positioned
outside the innermost two streamers 1220-7 and 1220-8. In contrast to the example of Figure 11,
the cross-line source separation 1262 is wider than the cross-line source separation 1161 such
that the seismic source elements 1226-1 and 1226-3 are positioned outside the streamers 1220-7
                                                    ?14

                                                                              PGS-16144-US-ORGI
and 1220-8. The cross-line source separation 1262 can be analogous to the cross-line source
separation 1062 illustrated in Figure 10.
[0073]           In Figure 12, the cross-line source separation 1262 is based on the cross-line
streamer separation 1231 (L). The cross-line source separation 1262 is based on the sum of the
integer (k) and the inverse of the quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S) multiplied by the
cross-line streamer separation 1231 (L) as represented by the expression (k + 1I/S)L. As in the
example of Figure 11, the cross-line streamer separation 1231 is 150 m. In the example of
Figure 12, the integer (k) is one and there are three seismic source elements 1226. Thus, the
cross-line source separation 1262 is (1+1/3)* 150 m, or 200 m. The seismic source element
1226-1 is positioned 25 m to the right of the streamer 1220-6, the seismic source element 1226-2
is positioned 75 m to right of the streamer 1220-7 (midway between the streamers 1220-7 and
 1220-8) and the seismic source element 1226-3 is positioned 25 m to the left of the streamer
1220-9.
[0074]           Even though the cross-line source separation 1262 is wider than the cross-line
source separation 1161, the nominal cross-line subline separation 1233 is still one sixth of the
cross-line streamer separation 1231 (L/6), or 25 m, as in the example of Figure 11 without
having to increase the quantity of streamers (N) or decrease the cross-line streamer separation
(L) 1231. The subline coverage 1249 is 1,175 In, 150 m greater than the subline coverage 1148
in the example of Figure 11. However, the subline coverage 1249 includes six zero fold sublines
as indicated by the open vertical arrows.
[0075]           Figure 13A illustrates a front or rear (yz-plane 1334) view of a configuration of
seismic source elements 1326-1 and 1326-2 and streamers 1320-1, 1320-2, 1320-3, 1320-4,
 1320-5, 1320-6, 1320-7, 1320-8, 1320-9, 1320-10, 1320-11, 1320-12, 1320-13, and 1320-14
with two seismic source elements 1326-1 and 1326-2 positioned outside the innermost four
streamers 1320-6, 1320-7. 1320-8, and 1320-9. Figure 13A is the same as Figure 7 and
illustrates the same configuration of the fourteen streamers 1320-1 to 1320-14 and two seismic
source elements 1326-1 and 1326-2. As in the example of Figure 7, the cross-line streamer
separation 1331 is 100 in, there are two seismic source elements 1326, and the integer (k) is
three. Thus, the cross-line source separation 1356 is (3+1/2)*100 m, or 350 in. The nominal
cross-line subline separation 1333 is one quarter of the cross-line streamer separation 1331, or 25
                                                   ?5

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
m. The subline coverage 1345 is 825 m; however, the subline coverage 1345 includes six zero
fold sublines as indicated by the open vertical arrows.
[0076]           Figure 13B illustrates a plan (yx-plane 1332) view of sublines for consecutive
actuations of seismic source elements 1326-1 and 1326-2 associated with a configuration of an
array of seismic source elements 1326-1 and 1326-2 and streamers 1320 for one sail line.          In
Figure 13B, the zero fold sublines 1370 are dashed and correspond to the vertical arrows
illustrated in Figure 13A. Full fold sublines, such as the full fold subline 1372, are solid and
correspond to nominally recorded data corresponding to receiver-source midpoints illustrated in
Figure 13A. As used herein, "nominally recorded data" refers to situations where recorded data
corresponds to points other than receiver-source midpoints.
[0077]           Figure 13B illustrates the gaps in the subline coverage 1345, represented by the
zero fold sublines 1370, and indicated by the vertical arrows in Figure 13A. A zero fold does not
necessarily imply a complete lack of marine seismic survey data corresponding to the zero fold
sublines 1370. Zero fold sublines can assume perfectly uniformed source and receiver geometry
with parallel streamers. However, in practice seismic source elements, receivers, and streamers
move around such that there may be some data recorded that correspond to the zero fold
sublines. Very low or zero fold sublines can affect the cross-line resolution of the marine
seismic survey data because very low or zero fold sublines may make negligible or no
contributions to an overall seismic image in locations corresponding to the very low or zero fold
sublines. As a result, a marine seismic image generated from the marine seismic survey data
may have a lesser resolution at the edges of a sail than the cross-line resolution at the center of
the sail line as illustrated in Figure 13B.
[0078]           Figure 14 illustrates a plan or yx-plane 1432 of a cross-line sail line separation
1480 between two adjacent sail lines 1482-1 and 1482-2 such that there is no overlap of the
sublines. As used herein, "cross-line sail line separation" refers to the distance in the cross-line
direction between two adjacent sail lines. As used herein, "nominal cross-line sail line
separation" refers to a cross-line sail line separation such that there is no overlap of the sublines
corresponding to adjacent sail lines. The sublines illustrated in Figure 14 correspond to the
configuration of the streamers and seismic source elements illustrated in Figures 7 and 13A and
two sets of the sublines illustrated in Figure 13B placed side by side. However, Figure 14 shows
the sublines corresponding to the configuration of the streamers and seismic source elements
                                                   ?6

                                                                                PGS-16144-US-ORGI
illustrated in Figures 7 and 13A along two adjacent sail lines 1482-1 and 1482-2. The arrows on
the sail lines 1482-1 and 1482-2 do not limit the sailing direction. The sail lines 1482-1 and
1482-2 can be oriented in opposing directions. The sublines corresponding to the sail line 1482
1 are identified by the bracket 1484-1 and the sublines corresponding to the sail line 1482-2 are
identified by the bracket 1484-2. The vertical dashed line 1477 represents a midline halfway
between the cross-line sail line separation 1480. In Figure 14, the zero fold sublines 1470-1 and
1470-2 are dashed whereas the full fold sublines, such as the full fold sublines 1472-1 and 1472
2, are solid. The zero fold sublines 1470-1 and the full fold 1472-1 correspond to the sail line
1482-1 whereas the zero fold sublines 1470-2 and the full fold 1472-2 correspond to the sail line
1482-2.
[0079]            As illustrated in Figure 14, performing a marine seismic survey may include a
cross-line sail line separation 1480 being a nominal cross-line sail line separation. The rightmost
subline corresponding to the sail line 1482-1 is adjacent to the leftmost subline corresponding to
the sail line 1482-2. The rightmost subline corresponding to the sail line 1482-1 may be spaced
apart from the leftmost subline corresponding to the sail line 1482-2 by the nominal cross-line
subline separation 1433. The nominal cross-line sail line separation can be the quantity of
sublines multiplied by the cross-line subline separation for one sail line. Based on the
configuration of the array of the streamers and seismic source elements illustrated in Figures 7
and 13A, in the example of Figure 15 there are thirty-four fold sublines and the cross-line subline
separation is 25 in such that the cross-line sail line separation 1480 is 850 m.
[0080]            Although a zero fold does not necessarily imply a complete lack of marine
seismic survey data corresponding to the zero fold sublines 1470-1 and 1470-2 as discussed
above, very low or zero fold sublines can affect the cross-line resolution of the marine seismic
survey data because very low or zero fold sublines may make negligible or no contributions to an
overall seismic image in locations corresponding to the very low or zero fold sublines. As a
result, a marine seismic image generated from the marine seismic survey data from two adjacent
sail lines, such the sail lines 1482-1 and 1482-2, may have a lesser resolution at the edges of a
combined surveyed area for both the sail lines 1482-1 and 1482-2 and at the center of the total
survey area than the resolution at the center of the surveyed area corresponding to a particular
sail line as illustrated in Figure 14. Additional adjacent sail lines (not illustrated in Figure 14)
                                                    ?7

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
would cause an alternating pattern in the marine seismic survey image of higher resolution and
lower resolution as well as alternating image quality in the cross-line direction.
[0081]           Figure 15A illustrates a plan (yz-plane 1532) view of sublines for two adjacent
sail lines 1582-1 and 1582-2 where the cross-line sail line separation 1581 is such that there is
overlap of the sublines. If a nominal cross-line sail line separation is used such that the sublines
corresponding to one sail line do not overlap the sublines corresponding to an adjacent sail line
as illustrated in Figure 14. At least one embodiment can include a cross-line sail line separation
1581 that is less than the nominal cross-line sail line separation 1480 as illustrated in Figure 14.
Because the cross-line sail line separation 1581 that is less than the nominal cross-line sail line
separation, some of the sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-1 (identified by the bracket
1584-1) overlap some the sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-2 (identified by the
bracket 1584-2). Zero fold sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-1 are spatially coincident
with full fold sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-2 and vice versa.
[0082]           Figure 15A shows the sublines corresponding along two adjacent sail lines 1582-1
and 1582-2 to the configuration of the array of streamers and seismic source elements illustrated
in Figures 7 and 13A. The arrows on the sail lines 1582-1 and 1582-2 do not limit the sailing
direction. The sail lines 1582-1 and 1582-2 can be oriented in opposing directions. The vertical
dashed 1577 line represents a midline halfway between the cross-line sail line separation 1581.
In Figure 15A, the zero fold sublines 1570 are dashed whereas the full fold sublines, such as the
full fold sublines 1572, are solid. No zero fold sublines, such as the zero fold sublines 1470-1
and 1470-2 illustrated in Figure 14, are evident in the overlap zone between the adjacent sail
lines 1582-1 and 1582-2.
[0083]           The cross-line sail line separation 1581 can be based on the configuration of the
streamers and seismic source elements. A particular configuration of the streamers and seismic
source elements., such as those illustrated in Figures 7 and 13A, can cause a particular pattern of
full fold sublines and zero fold sublines at the outer areas of each sail line Thus, the cross-line
sail line separation 1581 can be such that some of the full fold sublines from one sail line
complement some of the zero fold sublines from an adjacent sail line, and vice versa.
[0084]           As illustrated by the example of Figure 15A, the full fold sublines corresponding
to the sail line 1582-1 complement, or "fill in," the zero fold sublines corresponding to the sail
line 1582-2. Similarly, the full fold sublines corresponding to the sail line sail line 1581-2
                                                   ?8

                                                                               PGS-16144-US-ORGI
complement, or "fill in," the zero fold sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-1. Thus, the
cross-line resolution and seismic image quality can be maintained across the overlap zone
between the adjacent sail lines 1582-1 and 1582-2. However, the leftmost zero fold sublines
corresponding to the sail line 1582-1 and the rightmost zero fold sublines corresponding to the
sail line 1582-2 can be complemented, or be "filled in," by full fold sublines corresponding to
additional adjacent sail lines (not illustrated in Figure 15A).
[00851           To have the full fold sublines corresponding to the sail line sail line 1581-2
complement, or "fill in," the zero fold sublines corresponding to the sail line 1581-1 and vice
versa, the cross-line sail line separation 1581 can be the quantity of full fold sublines between the
adjacent sail lines 1582-1 and 1582-2 multiplied by the cross-line subline separation. In the
example of Figure 15, there are twenty-eight full fold sublines between the adjacent sail lines
 1582-1 and 1582-2 and the cross-line subline separation is 25 m such that the cross-line sail line
separation 1581 is 700 m. The cross-line sail line separation 1581 can be the same as the
nominal cross-line sail line separation for the configuration of the streamers and seismic source
elements as in the example of Figure 3 along adjacent sail lines as in the example of Figure 14.
[0086]           Figure 15B illustrates a plan (yx-plane 1532) view of sublines for two adjacent
sail lines 1582-1 and 1582-2 where the cross-line sail line separation 1581 is such that there is
overlap of the sublines. Figure 15B shows the same sail line separation 1581 as Figure 15A but
the sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-1 (identified by the bracket 1584-1) are
illustrated above the sublines corresponding to the sail line 1582-2 (identified by the bracket
1584-2). The zero fold sublines 1570-1 and the full fold sublines 1572-1 correspond to the sail
line 1582-1 whereas the zero fold sublines 1570-2 and the full fold sublines 1572-2 correspond
to the sail line 1582-2. Figure 15B illustrates that the full fold sublines 1572-1 complement, or
"fill in," the zero fold sublines 1570-2 and the full fold sublines 1572-2 complement, or "fill in,"
the zero fold sublines 1570-1.
[0087]           At least one embodiment can include inducing a streamer spread angle that is
greater than zero degrees to fan out the streamers. Fanning out the streamers can ensure that
receivers located at the back ends of the streamers contribute to all sublines corresponding to a
particular sail line despite any prevailing conditions. When a streamer spread angle is induced,
the cross-line source separation can be based on the nominal cross-line streamer separation.

[0088]           Figure 16 illustrates a method for a marine seismic survey. The method can
comprise, at block 1690, towing streamers that are spaced apart in a cross-line direction by a
streamer separation (L). At block 1692, the method can include towing seismic source elements
that are spaced apart in the cross-line direction by a source separation based on an integer (k), an
inverse of a quantity of the seismic source elements (1/S), and the streamer separation as
represented by (k + 1I/S)L.
[0089]           Although not illustrated in Figure 16, the method can include determining a value
of the integer (k) based on a quantity of the streamers (N). The method can include determining
a value of the integer (k) between one and one less than a quantity of the plurality of streamers
(N-1), inclusive, between one and half of the quantity of the plurality of streamers (N/2),
inclusive, or between one and half of one less than the quantity of the plurality of streamers ((N
 1)/2), inclusive.
[0090]           Although not illustrated in Figure 16, the streamers and the seismic source
elements can be towed by a marine survey vessel. The streamers can be towed by a first marine
survey vessel and the seismic source elements can be towed by a second marine survey vessel.
The streamers can be towed by a first marine survey vessel, a first one of the seismic source
elements can be towed by a second marine survey vessel, and a second one of the seismic source
elements can be towed by a third marine survey vessel.
[0091]           At block 1694, the method can include actuating the seismic source elements. At
block 1696, the method can include detecting seismic signals at each of a plurality of receivers
on the streamers.
[0092]           Figure 17 illustrates a method for a marine seismic survey. The method can
include, at block 1791, determining a quantity of streamers of an array. At block 1793, the
method can include determining a quantity of seismic source elements of the array. At block
1795, the method can include performing a marine seismic survey with a plurality of seismic
source elements and a plurality of streamers, wherein a cross-line source separation between
each of the seismic source elements is directly proportional to a cross-line streamer separation
(L) between each of the streamers. The cross-line source separation can be directly proportional
to the cross-line streamer separation (L) by a sum of an integer (k) less than or equal to a
quantity (N) of the plurality of the streamers and an inverse of a quantity of the seismic source
elements (1/S).

[0093]          Although not illustrated in Figure 17, the method can include determining a value
of the integer (k) for a particular subline coverage. The value of the integer (k) can be increased
to increase a subline coverage. The method can include maintaining a marine seismic survey
resolution while increasing the cross-line source separation, without increasing the quantity (N)
of the plurality of the streamers.
[0094]          Although not illustrated in Figure 17, the marine seismic survey can be performed
along two or more adjacent sail lines. A cross-line sail line separation between the two adjacent
sail lines can be such that a subline of one of the two adjacent sail lines complements a subline of
another one of the two adjacent sail lines. The cross-line sail line separation between the two
adjacent sail lines can be such that a full fold subline of one of the two adjacent sail lines
complements a zero fold subline of another one of the two adjacent sail lines. A cross-line
subline separation between the complementing sublines of the one of the two adjacent sail lines
and the complementing sublines of the other one of the two adjacent sail lines can be maintained.
The method can include subtracting a predicted multiple from the marine seismic survey data.
