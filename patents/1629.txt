   The present invention relates to a gaming system and a
   method of gaming.
   Background of the Invention
15
   Gaming machines are available in a wide variety of styles
   and game plays. Such machines may include physical reels
   carrying symbols and/or a video display where symbols are
   displayed virtually whether represented as reels or
20 otherwise, for example as a Keno or Pachinko game.
   Many users of gaming machines enjoy a mechanical
   interaction with their game playing and as such some
   machines are provided with mechanical side levers that
25 players can pull to trigger a game. Another type of gaming
   machine may include a transparent lotto sphere mounted on
   the machine housing and containing lotto or 'Keno' balls
   randomly agitating inside the sphere.
30 While such gaming machines provide users with enjoyment, a
   need exists for alternative gaming machines in order to
   maintain or increase player enjoyment.

   Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
15
   The present invention incorporates mechanical outcomes in
   the electronic gaming system of a gaming machine in that a
   result or selection from a physical component, or
   mechanical aspect, of a gaming machine is recognized and
20 used in game play.                    A mechanical aspect of the gaming
   machine generally comprises physical objects moving
   randomly, or seemingly moving randomly, within an
   enclosure, for example Keno balls agitating within a
   spherical container.
25
   In one embodiment interaction between a physical aspect
   and an electronic aspect of a gaming machine is achieved
   by assigning an identifier to some or each physical
   object, selecting a physical object and identifying the
30 properties of that physical object, and using the
   information regarding the properties during game play to
   award a prize, bonus game, etc.
   In another embodiment the electronic aspect of the gaming
35 machine selects an object and causes the object to change
   physical appearance for a period of time before the object
   returns to its original appearance. Examples of a change
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                  - 5
   in appearance may include illuminating a ball or changing
   its colour.                      The ball with the altered appearance can then
   be used in game play as a bonus feature, etc.
 5 In general, the gaming system can take a number of
   different forms. In a first form, a stand alone gaming
   machine is provided wherein all or most components
   required for implementing the game are present in a player
   operable gaming machine.
10
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
15 game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
20 architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
25
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.                    For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
30 gaming server are selectively modifiable.                      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
35 skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                 - 6
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
 5 the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
10 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54 and a game
   play mechanism 56 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions.
15
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
20 display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                    a
25 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
30 machine 202 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   202 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which is
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.                     A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 202
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
35 interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   gameplay.                   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.                Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.            A reading device may also be provided for the
 5 purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
   as part of a loyalty program.                The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
   portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.
10
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.                Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
15 panel 29 of the console 12.                A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 202.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
20 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.                Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.                The top box 26 may also include
25 a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
30 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.                Instructions and data to control
35 operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                  - 8
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
 5 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.                      The input/output interface 105 and/or the
10 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.                 A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.                      Persons
15 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
20 controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader 108, a
   printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism
   110 and a coin output mechanism 111.                      Additional hardware
   may be included as part of the gaming machine 100, or
25 hardware may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
30 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,                     accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
35
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.                      The memory 103 includes RAM
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                 - 9
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                     The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                     The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
 5 some system or game related code.                     The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
10
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
15
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.                     The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
20 two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.                     The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 202, 100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
25 implementing game play.                     While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
30 network 201.                     The displays 204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
35 promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                             - 10
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
 5 collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
10 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to monitor and
   carry out the Jackpot game.                  Additional servers 212 may be
   provided to implement other functions depending on the
   embodiment implemented for the gaming venue.
15 In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.                  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
20 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.                 In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
25 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
30 example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.                  An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
35
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                - 11
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
 5 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.                    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.                    For example, the game
10 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.                    Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
15 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Figures 6, 7 and 8 illustrate an embodiment of a gaming
   machine wherein the mechanical aspect of the gaming
20 machine 202 is an enclosure in the form of a transparent
   ring tube 300 mounted vertically on the top box 26.                     A
   number of physical objects are free to move inside ring
   tube 300. In this embodiment the objects are balls 302
   aligned in single file inside the tube 300 to form a ring
25 of balls which can be propelled, by pneumatic bursts,
   mechanical drive or other means, to spin the ring of balls
   around the tube 300 and give the impression of a                    'spinning
   wheel' game or                   'roulette wheel' game.
30 In one embodiment the mechanism for propelling the balls
   may cause the balls to change direction within the tube so
   that the 'spinning wheel' appears to rotate backward as if
   tensioning a spring which is then released to propel
   forward.
35
   While the ring of balls 302 can spin continuously within
   the tube 300, part of the tube is hidden from the sight of
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                      - 12
   a user of the gaming machine by the top box 26 which in
   this embodiment supports a secondary display in the form
   of a screen 304. Screen 304 is a video display unit that
   may be a cathode ray tube, liquid crystal display or a
 5 plasma display.
   Screen 304 is adapted to show information regarding the
   physical objects located in the mechanical aspect of the
   gaming machine 202. Specific to the embodiment
10 illustrated, information regarding the physical balls 302,
   including the colour of the ball and/or the ball number,
   is communicated to the game controller 60 which processes
   the information to display on screen 304 a virtual image
   of the balls 302 that are hidden from view.
15
   As best illustrated in Figure 7, screen 304 illustrates a
   virtual representation (300v) of part of ring tube 300 and
   virtual representations          (302v) of the colours and numbers
   of the hidden balls inside the virtual ring 300v in the
20 same order they physically appear in the ring. This gives
   the appearance that the physical balls have moved onto the
   screen as they have spun around the ring. The entire ring
   of balls is represented in a physical and virtual
   combination.
25
   It is understood that instead of the balls being propelled
   to move within tube ring 300, the balls 302 may remain
   still within the ring and the tube ring itself may be
   driven to spin relative to the gaming machine.
30
   The virtual balls 302v can be displayed when the spinning
   ring of physical balls 302 comes to rest or even while the
   ring is spinning, what is displayed may depend on the
   speed at which the balls are spinning, for example the
35 balls may be shown as "blurred" in the same manner a
   virtual reel is simulated as spinning when the balls move
   quickly. The physical balls 302 illustrated in Figure 7 do
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                           - 13
   not bear number markings. It is understood to persons
   skilled in the art that numbers may be assigned to the
   virtual balls 302v only, to the physical balls 302 only or
   to both the virtual and physical balls.
 5
   During game play one of the balls 302w may be selected as
   the        'winning ball'. A winning ball may be determined
   according to the resting position of the ball when the
   ring 300, 300v stops spinning. Figure 8 illustrates a
10 physical/virtual ring of balls whereby each ball is
   identified by colour only, namely the colours white w,
   blue b and gold g.               On the screen 304 is a pyramid 312
   that points to the position of the lowest ball 302w in the
   virtual ring tube 300v, which the game has determined to
15 be the selected winning position. The pyramid 312 points
   to the winning ball 302w.                The virtual winning ball has a
   corresponding physical ball located at the same position
   in the ring 300 of balls but out of view.
20 Game play and pay prizes can be determined by the colour
   of the winning ball where, for example, one colour pays
   out a prize of greater value than another colour.
   Additional game play parameters can also be introduced
   such as a figurine 314 displayed on screen 304 which flips
25 between upside down              (tails) and right way up  (heads)
   positions as the ring of balls spins.                The resting
   position of the figurine, heads or tails, determines an
   additional dimension of game play, for example, the level
   of pay to a user: mini, minor or major.
30
   The above described embodiments rely on the game
   controller recognizing which physical balls are hidden
   from view and which physical/virtual balls land in the
   winning position. This is achieved by the gaming system
35 comprising a reader that identifies a physical object from
   a plurality of physical objects and communicates data, or
   information, regarding that object to the game controller
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                              - 14
   which can then use that information to display an outcome
   or as a parameter in game play.
   Figure 9 illustrates a block diagram of the operating
 5 components of an embodiment of the present invention. The
   core components of a game controller 101 with processor
   102 and input/output interface 105, and user interface 120
   are present. Other standard components of the game
   controller 101 and user interface 120 that are illustrated
10 in Figure 3 are present in relation to the embodiment of
   Figure 9 but are not shown in Figure 9. In addition to the
   game controller 101 and user interface 120 a mechanical
   interface 400 is provided between physical objects 402 and
   game controller 101. Mechanical interface 400 comprises a
15 reader 404 that is in communication with processor 102.
   Information regarding the physical objects is processed by
   the processor 102 and displayed electronically on display
   406.
20 In one embodiment the reader 404 is a Radio Frequency
   Identification (RFID) reader and each physical object
   carries a transponder that transmits a signal unique to
   that object. The reader includes a microcontroller                   (not
   shown) and a magnetic loop antenna (not shown) operating
25 at RFID frequency. The transponder is specifically a
   passive RFID tag                 (not shown),  although it is foreseeable
   that a semi-passive or an active tag may be used.
   In the above embodiment of the spinning ring of balls, the
30 balls are hollow and each ball contains RFID tag
   components, namely an antenna and an integrated circuit.
   An incoming radio frequency signal provides sufficient
   power for the integrated circuit to transmit a response
   signal encoded with a unique code.
35
   Each RFID tag is mapped in a tag database 65, which is in
   data communication with processor 102. Each RFID tag is
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                    - 15
   mapped against the colour, alpha numeral, or other
   identifying feature of the physical object such that on
   receipt of a specific coded signal the processor is able
   to identify which physical object has been read.   For
 5 example, the pyramid 312 in Figure 8 points to a white
   ball that has come to rest as the winning ball 302w.
   Winning ball 302w internally carries an RFID tag coded
   with a unique code that is transmitted as a signal. When
   the reader 404 receives a signal from ball 302w and passes
10 the signal on to the game controller, the unique code is
   found on tag database 65 as belonging to a white ball.
   Game controller 60 then generates a virtual representation
   302w of a white ball for display on screen 304.  Given the
15 computer processing speeds involved in reading the
   physical objects, processing and displaying the
   information, the virtual winning white ball 302w appears
   on screen 304 simultaneously, or almost simultaneously, as
   the physical wining white ball 302w comes to rest in the
20 winning position.
   Game controller 60 may also or alternatively use the
   information that a white ball has been during game play,
   for example to determine an outcome or award a prize.
25
   So that the hidden physical balls in the lower part of
   ring tube 300 can be virtually shown on the screen 304,
   the reader may simultaneously read multiple physical
   balls. In one embodiment the reader would be located in
30 the vicinity behind the screen and sufficiently near to
   the lower part of the ring tube to enable the physical
   balls to read.
   Alternatively, the game controller could have a map of the
35 order of balls 302 in the ring tube 300. In this case each
   unique code associated with a coloured ball would be
   mapped with an additional identifier to distinguish one
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                               - 16
   coloured ball from another ball of the same colour. For
   example, if the winning ball is identified as "White 6",
   by consulting the map of ball order the game controller
   can calculate that the three balls to the left of the
 5 winning white ball 302w, closest to furthest (as shown in
   Figure 8),                  are "white", "white" and "blue", while the
   three balls to the right of the winning ball 302w are,
   closest to furthest, "blue", "white" and "white".                   This
   order can then be displayed.
10
   The reader 404 can also track the location of a ball by
   repeatedly sending and receiving signals to a particular
   ball. A series of location points for that ball can then
   be mapped by the controller to determine its position, and
15 predict future positions if the movements are regular
   enough.
   In the above embodiment, selection of a winning ball
   relies on the random propulsion of the spinning ring of
20 balls. In an advanced embodiment it is envisaged that the
   random selector of the gaming machine is not the spinning
   ring of balls but is instead a random number generator. A
   winning ball can be preselected by the random number
   generator, tracked and the spinning ring of balls could be
25 mechanically controlled to stop spinning to bring the
   selected winning ball into the winning position.
   To prevent external interference of the RFID method of
   communication and possible breach of security, the balls
30 302 are provided with radio frequency shielding to
   obstruct external interference.                   Shielding from external
   interference is provided by a metallic mesh surrounding
   each RFID tag in each ball to provide a faraday cage.
35 In an alternative embodiment the reader does not rely on
   RFID technology but is instead a camera that identifies a
   ball by reading its external physical appearance and
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                              - 17
   forwarding that information to the game controller. Using
   again the arrangement illustrated in Figure 8 as an
   example, a camera (not shown) could be suitably placed to
   obtain images of the physical balls hidden by screen 304.
 5 Using image processing software information regarding the
   colour, size, markings, etc. of the object can be obtained
   from images obtained by the camera and conveyed to the
   game controller 60 for displaying virtually or for use in
   game play.
10
   Figures 10(a) and 10(b) illustrate another embodiment of
   integrating a physical aspect with the electronic aspect
   of a gaming machine. This embodiment implements a lotto,
   or Keno, attachment on top of a gaming machine. The
15 physical objects in the form of balls 502 are contained in
   a spherical transparent lotto container 500 mounted in
   front of a back panel 501. The balls 502 are made to
   agitate randomly within the container 500 by flowing jets
   of air upwardly into the container.
20
   A winning ball 502w is selected when the jet of air stops
   and the first ball to drop into a transparent chute 504 at
   the bottom of the container 500 is the winning ball 502w.
   Transparent chute 504 leads into the interior of the
25 gaming machine.                  Winning ball 502w can either remain
   stationary within chute 504 for an amount of time or may
   roll directly into the gaming machine interior. Balls 502
   are returned into the container 500 from the interior of
   the gaming machine through back panel 501 and through an
30 inlet 506 to drop the balls back into the container.
   Figure 11 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the
   lotto attachment where chute 504 comprises a horizontal
   extension 508 for collecting selected balls and allowing
35 them to be viewed before depositing the selected balls
   into the gaming machine interior. To prevent balls from
   unintentionally entering chute 504 a valve (not shown) may
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                               - 18
   be provided at the chute entrance at the bottom of
   container 500.                   Alternatively chute 504 may be designed to
   have a length that only supports the desired number of
   selected balls.
 5
   To determine which ball(s) has dropped into chute 504,
   that is, has been selected as a winning ball, a similar
   system to that described above in relation to Figures 6 to
   9 is used. Namely, each ball contains an RFID tag which
10 transmits a signal particular to that ball such that an
   RFID reader receiving that particular signal forwards data
   relating to that signal to the game controller where the
   ball selected can be identified.                   Alternatively, a camera
   can be used to visually identify selected balls in which
15 case there would be no need for each ball to carry an RFID
   tag.
   As in the embodiment of Figures 6 to 9, once the ball has
   been identified game controller can use the information.
20 The information displayed on a screen can include:
   characteristics of the winning ball(s),                  namely colour,
   number, etc.; consequences of the ball being selected
   "Number 15 wins $10";                  or a virtual representation of the
   winning ball.
25
   The information regarding the winning ball(s) can
   alternatively or additionally be used during game play,
   for example to trigger a bonus game, additional prize or
   other game feature.                   In one embodiment the gaming machine
30 spinning reels 510                  (Figure 10a) may include vacant
   positions, or may be entirely empty transparent reel
   tubes, that can be filled with physical balls 502 selected
   from the lotto container and transferred through chute 504
   to fill the vacant positions in the reels.                   The balls
35 themselves then adopt the role of gaming symbols usually
   printed on the surface of spinning reels to form game
   sequences when the reels spin to a stop position.
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                              - 19
   In this embodiment the RFID reader is also capable of
   reading and distinguishing balls when they fall into
   position in the vacant reels.
 5
   It is understood that while the description refers to
   balls as the physical objects carrying identifiers in the
   form of RFID tags and/or physical external markings, the
   physical objects may take many different forms, such as
10 coins, characters, or any objects that are able to move
   around within, or with, an enclosure and to carry
   identifying information.
   Figures 12 to 14(c) illustrate another embodiment where a
15 physical aspect of a gaming machine is incorporated with
   the electronic aspect in which a physical object is made
   to change physical appearance for a period of time before
   the object is returned to its original appearance. One
   method of changing the appearance is to illuminate an
20 object to make it stand out from other objects.
   Figures 12, 13(a),                 13(b) and 13(c) show a ring tube 600
   containing balls 602 similar to the above example of the
    'spinning wheel' game. In this embodiment, one or more
25 balls 602i are illuminated by applying a charge to the
   ball.            Illumination of the ball 602i could be achieved in
   one embodiment by installing a Light Emitting Diode (LED)
   or other light emitting device inside the ball, which has
   a translucent plastic shell through which light is
30 diffused, and activating the LED to illuminate the ball.
   The electronics required to illuminate the ball 602i
   include:               a light   (such as an LED), and an inductive
   circuit adapted to extract energy from a received signal
35 to power the light. Inductive circuit typically includes
   an antenna for receiving the signal. All these electronics
   are housed inside the ball, or inside any other physical
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                   - 20
   object to be illuminated.
   The ball is remotely illuminated as it nears a charge
   transmitter that is transmitting a signal. Turning to
 5 Figures 12, 13(a),                      13(b) and 13(c) for example, a charge
   transmitter                     (not shown) is operational within the charging
   zone 601 of the spinning ring of balls 602. In one
   example, an antenna of the charge transmitter may be
   highly directional such that the ball 602i closest to the
10 charge transmitter illuminates. In another example, each
   ball may have an individual identifier and inductive
   circuit may include a processing section which determines
   whether an identifier in the transmitted signal matches a
   stored identifier such that it only provides power to the
15 light when the identifiers match.
   The illuminated ball 602i continues spinning within the
   ring of balls until the spinning ring slows to a stop.
   Another ball 602i may be illuminated before the spinning
20 ring stops. Figure 12 shows a screen 604 illustrating a
    'major pay zone',                    a  'minor pay zone' and a 'mini pay zone'
   at a bottom part of a virtual ring 608 corresponding to
   the physical ring tube 600 with balls 602.                      If, when the
   spinning ring of balls stop, an illuminated ball 602i
25 lands in one of the pay zones a bonus is added to the game
   play. The value of the bonus is dependent on which zone
   the illuminated ball 602i lands in.
   Alternatively, a bonus may be awarded simply because a
30 ball has been illuminated. The bonus award may vary in
   value depending on which ball has been illuminated, namely
   a specifically coloured ball or a ball having a particular
   number, letter or other marking.
35 Figures 13(a) to 13(c) illustrate the steps involved in
   charging a ball in the 'spinning wheel' game. Figure 13(a)
   illustrates the balls moving in an anti-clockwise
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                                - 21
   direction. All balls are in a normal state.                    A charge
   transmitter 605 applies a charge to one of the balls 602i
   in Figure 13(b) as the ball passes through the charging
   zone 601. A further two balls 602i in the ring of balls
 5 are charged in Figure 13(c) so that three balls are shown
   illuminated. The illuminated balls add value and variation
   to game play.
   After a period of time, which can be predetermined, the
10 illuminated balls lose their charge, dim and return to a
   normal state.
   In another embodiment the balls do not simply illuminate
   but may pulsate, or change colour, or carry out some other
15 visual effect to create interesting game play and/or to
   differentiate one illuminated ball from another.
   In one embodiment the illuminating balls each also include
   an RFID tag. Incorporating RFID technology with remote
   illumination of balls allows a reader to identify which
20 ball has been illuminated, for example, a                   'white' ball or
   a number                '15' ball.     This information can then be used in
   game play.                    Taking this concept further, the game
   controller 60 can choose which ball to illuminate and then
   instruct the charge transmitter to emit a signal to be
25 received by only the chosen ball, which in turn is then
   illuminated.
   As has been illustrated above, combining RFID technology
   in game play together with the concept of changing the
30 physical appearance of an object allows for an endless
   number of possible game plays and styles. Instead of RFID
   tag technology other forms of readers to identify an
   object may be used, for example, a camera to visually
   identify an object.
35
   As illustrated in Figure 12 the concept of illuminating
   balls in a                   'spinning wheel' can also be combined with the
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                               - 22
   concept of representing a virtual part of the spinning
   ring of balls on a screen 604.                    The illuminated ball 602i,
   as it nears screen 604 and becomes hidden from view,
   appears as a virtual representation of an illuminated ball
 5 on screen 604.                   Additionally, with the physical charging
   zone 601 located behind screen 604 the charge transmitter
   may be placed very close to the physical ring 600 without
   being visible to a player.
10 The concept of causing objects to appear differently can
   be applied to other types of games. Figures 14(a) to 14(c)
   illustrate the use of illuminating balls to differentiate
   them from other balls with the physical aspect of a
    'lotto' attachment similar to that described in relation
15 to Figures 10(a) and 10(b).                    In this embodiment at least
   one of balls 702i, is packed with electronics for
   receiving a signal to illuminate the ball. Before
   dispensing balls 702 into lotto container 700 a charge
   transmitter 705 transmits a charge to ball 702i to cause
20 it to illuminate. The balls are then dispensed into lotto
   container 700 and agitated. Selecting illuminated ball
   702i as the winning ball signifies a specific outcome in
   game play that would be different than if a non
   illuminated ball was selected. More than one ball may be
25 illuminated. In another embodiment the ball could be
   illuminated after it is dispensed into the lotto
   container.
   In a simplest form of the game, game controller 60
30 determines if a ball, or how many balls, are illuminated
   and uses this information in game play. In a more complex
   form, and in combination with RFID tag technology, game
   controller can determine which ball(s) has been
   highlighted/illuminated and/or predetermine which ball(s)
35 to highlight/illuminate.
   Illumination of objects is not the only manner of causing
   10290817_1(GHMaters) P77467.AU.5

                                              - 23
   the appearance of an object to be altered or distinguished
   from other objects. Another manner is to change the colour
   of an object or to cause a symbol or other marking to
   appear on the object.
 5
   For example, an object, such as a ball, may be coated with
   a chemical coating that when exposed to certain
   conditions, such as heat or ultra violet (UV) light,
   changes colour.                  As the surface coating cools the object
10 returns to its original colour.                   In this example an infra
   red camera or a visual camera could be used to identify
   the location and markings of a                  'hot' ball or a ball that
   has changed colour.
15 It need not necessarily be the entire surface of the
   object that is coated with a heat sensitive or UV light
   sensitive composition. A marking, such as a letter or
   number, may be imprinted on the surface in the sensitive
   composition so that when exposed to the sensitive
20 conditions the marking 'appears' on the object.
   The above described methods of game play and gaming
   machines are some examples of how a physical aspect of a
   gamine machine, such as a ring of balls or lotto
25 container, can interact with the electronic aspect and
   controls of the gaming machine. A person skilled in the
   art should appreciate that the physical aspect may vary in
   form and game style suffice that an occurrence with the
   physical aspect affects the electronic aspect of the
30 gaming machine.
   In the preceding description, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
35 "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
   not to preclude the presence or addition of further
