                                               ABSTRACT
            Unique blends of fibers that incorporate synthetic cellulosic fibers to render fabrics made
with such blends more durable than fabrics made with natural cellulosic fibers such as cotton.
While more durable than cotton, the synthetic cellulosic fibers used in the blends are still
inexpensive and comfortable to the wearer.            Thus, the benefits of cotton (affordability and
comfort) are still attained while a drawback of cotton - low durability - is avoided.            In one
embodiment, the fiber blend includes FR modacrylic fibers and synthetic cellulosic fibers,
preferably, but not necessarily non-FR lyocell fibers such as TENCELTM and TENCEL A100TM.
Other fibers may be added to the blend, including, but not limited to, additional types of
inherently FR fibers, anti-static fibers, anti-microbial fibers, stretch fibers, and/or high tenacity
fibers.       The fiber blends disclosed herein may be used to form various types of FR fabrics.
Desired colors may be imparted in a variety of ways and with a variety of dyes to the fabrics
disclosed herein.       Fabrics having the fibers blends disclosed herein can be used to construct the
entirety of, or various portions of, a variety of protective garments for protecting the wearer
against electrical arc flash and flames, including, but not limited to, coveralls, jumpsuits, shirts,
jackets, vests, and trousers.

               FLAME RESISTANT FABRICS AND GARMENTS MADE FROM SAME
                                            Field of the Invention
             The present invention relates to protective fabrics, and more specifically to flame resistant
fabrics, having a unique blend of fibers and garments made from such fabrics.
                                       Background of the Invention
             Many occupations can potentially expose an individual to electrical arc flash and/or
flames. To avoid being injured while working in such conditions, these individuals typically
wear protective garments constructed of flame resistant materials designed to protect them from
electrical arc flash and/or flames. Such protective clothing can include various garments, for
example, coveralls, pants, and shirts. Fabrics from which such garments are constructed, and
consequently the resulting garments as well, are required to pass a variety of safety and/or
performance standards, including ASTM F 1506, NFPA 2112, NFPA 70E, MIL C 43829C.
             Many protective garments have been made from fabrics comprising natural cellulosic
fibers, such as cotton.         Cotton fibers are inexpensive and fabrics made from such fibers
comfortable to wear. However, the use of cotton fibers in such fabrics has many disadvantages.
To begin, cotton fibers are not durable. Thus, fabrics made with them have poor wear life and
must be replaced unacceptably often.
             Furthermore, cotton fibers pose a health hazard to personnel during the fiber spinning and
fabric weaving processes. When natural cotton fibers are used to make fabrics and garments, the
cotton fibers can be inhaled and over time can cause respiratory problems, which can lead to
byssinosis or "brown lung" disease. Work environments where personnel work with natural
cotton and are exposed to breathing hazardous cotton fibers are thus subject to governmental and
regulatory restrictions for handling and processing of such fibers.
             Moreover, cotton fibers are not inherently flame resistant and thus apt to burn. Thus,
these fibers (or the yarns or fabrics made with such fibers) have historically been treated with a
                                                       1
UJS2000 10272105.1

FR compound to render such fibers (or the yarns or fabrics made with such fibers) flame resistant.
Treatment of cotton fibers (or the yarns or fabrics made with such fibers) with an FR compound
significantly increases the cost of such fibers (or the yarns or fabrics made with such fibers).
            To avoid the cost associated with such FR treatment, cotton fibers have been combined
with FR modacrylic fibers. The FR modacrylic fibers control and counteract the flammability of
the cotton fibers to prevent the cotton fibers from burning. In this way, the cotton fibers (or the
yarns or fabrics made with such fibers) need not be treated with a FR compound.
            However, the FR modacrylic fibers have durability problems similar to those of cotton,
and thus fabrics made with blends of these fibers have poor wear life. Moreover, both natural
cotton fibers and FR modacrylic fibers are relatively unstable after thermal exposure, rendering it
difficult if not impossible for fabrics made with only these fibers to pass the requisite safety and
performance standards for protective garments.         Thus, additional inherently FR fibers, such as
aramid fibers, have been added to the fiber blend to impart thermal stability to the blend to ensure
compliance of the resulting fabric with the requisite safety and performance standards (e.g., by
decreasing char lengths in vertical flame tests of such fabrics).
            Because of the presence of cotton fibers, the resulting fabrics still exhibit durability
problems and unacceptable wear life. Thus, a need exists for fiber blends that include fibers that
are more durable than natural cellulosic fibers such as cotton but that still realize the cost and
comfort advantages of cotton in such blends.
                                       Summary of the Invention
            This invention discloses unique blends of fibers that incorporate synthetic cellulosic fibers
to render fabrics made with such blends more durable than fabrics made with natural cellulosic
fibers such as cotton. While more durable than cotton, the synthetic cellulosic fibers used in the
blends are still inexpensive and comfortable to the wearer.              Thus, the benefits of cotton
(affordability and comfort) are still attained while a drawback of cotton - low durability - is
                                                    2

avoided.          The resulting fabrics made with the fiber blends disclosed herein are flame resistant,
durable, comfortable, and affordable.
            In one embodiment, the fiber blend includes FR modacrylic fibers and synthetic cellulosic
fibers, preferably, but not necessarily non-FR lyocell fibers such as TENCELTM and TENCEL
A100TM.           The FR modacrylic fibers and the synthetic cellulosic fibers can be combined in any
blend ratio but are preferably, although not necessarily, combined so that the percentage of FR
modacrylic fibers in the blend is greater than the percentage of synthetic cellulosic fibers in the
blend. Other fibers may be added to the blend, including, but not limited to, additional types of
inherently FR fibers, anti-static fibers, anti-microbial fibers, stretch fibers, and/or high tenacity
fibers.
            The fiber blends disclosed herein may be used to form various types of FR fabrics.
By way only of example, the fibers may be used to form nonwoven fabrics or may first be formed
into yarn that is subsequently woven or knitted into a FR fabric.
            In one embodiment, yarns are formed from a fiber blend having approximately 30-60%
FR modacrylic fibers, approximately 20-60% synthetic cellulosic fibers, and approximately 5
30% additional inherently FR fibers. TENCELTM and particularly TENCEL A100TM (both non
FR synthetic cellulosic fibers) and para-aramid fibers (inherently FR fibers) have performed
particularly well in this application. The yarns can subsequently be used to form FR fabrics in a
variety of ways (e.g. weaving, knitting, etc.), all well known in the industry.         Fabrics   made
from the unique fiber blends disclosed herein comply with a variety of the thermal protection
standards, rendering them suitable for use in protective garments.
            Desired colors may be imparted in a variety of ways and with a variety of dyes to the
fabrics disclosed herein having a blend of synthetic cellulosic, FR modacrylic, and optionally
additional inherently FR fibers. The fabrics may be dyed or printed to comply with the standard
for high-visibility safety apparel known in the industry as ANSI 107-2004 (and the European
                                                       3

equivalent EN 471) as well as with the military's infrared reflective requirements (including, but
not limited to, those promulgated under MIL-C-83429 and GL-PD-07-12 (2/28/07)).
            Fabrics having the fibers blends disclosed herein can be used to construct the entirety of,
or various portions of, a variety of protective garments for protecting the wearer against electrical
arc flash and flames, including, but not limited to, coveralls, jumpsuits, shirts, jackets, vests, and
trousers. In one embodiment, a fabric having blends of fibers disclosed herein is used to form at
least a portion of an advanced combat shirt.
                                  Detailed Description of the Invention
            This invention relates to unique blends of fibers that render the resulting fabric flame
resistant, durable, comfortable, and affordable. In one embodiment, the fiber blend includes FR
modacrylic fibers and manmade or synthetic cellulosic fibers. The FR modacrylic fibers and the
synthetic cellulosic fibers can be combined in any blend ratio but are preferably, although not
necessarily, combined so that the percentage of FR modacrylic fibers in the blend is greater than
the percentage of synthetic cellulosic fibers in the blend.
            Any FR modacrylic fibers able to extinguish non-FR fibers may be used, including, but
not limited to, PROTEXTM fibers (including but not limited to PROTEX           WTM   and PROTEX      CTM
fibers) available from Kaneka Corporation of Osaka, Japan, SEFTM available from Solutia, or
blends thereof. The synthetic cellulosic fibers may be, but are not limited to, rayon, FR rayon,
lyocell, MODALTM, cellulose acetate, or blends thereof. An example of a suitable rayon fiber is
Viscose by Lenzing, available from Lenzing Fibers Corporation.              Examples of lyocell fibers
include TENCELTM and TENCEL A100TM, both available from Lenzing Fibers Corporation.
Examples of FR rayon fibers include Lenzing FRTM, also available from Lenzing Fibers
Corporation, and VISILTM, available from Sateri.
            The synthetic fibers used in the blends disclosed herein can be, but preferably are not, FR
treated given that they are being blended with FR modacrylic fibers that control and counteract
the flammability of the synthetic fibers to prevent such fibers from burning.          Use of synthetic
                                                      4
US2000 10272105.1

cellulosic fibers that have not been FR-treated significantly reduces the cost of such fibers (e.g.,
approximately        $1/pound    for non-FR treated synthetic cellulosic fibers vs. approximately
$6/pound for FR-treated synthetic cellulosic fibers).
            Non-FR lyocell fibers such as TENCELTM and TENCEL A100TM fibers have proven to be
particularly suitable in this application. While similar to cotton fibers in that these fibers are
inexpensive and comfortable, they are more durable than natural cotton fibers and have proven
very resistant to abrasion and very moisture absorbent. Consequently, fabrics made from these
fibers have long wear life and are comfortable to the wearer. TENCEL A100TM fibers are less
susceptible to fibrillation, which results when the ends of the fibers split to impart a fuzzy or
prematurely worn appearance to garments made with such fibers. It has been found that fabrics
made with TENCEL AlOOTM fibers are thus better able to retain their appearance even after
repeated launderings.         Moreover, unlike natural cotton typically used in these blends, because
these cellulosic fibers are manmade fibers, they consequently do not pose a breathing hazard to
personnel          during      the     fiber   spinning      or     fabric     fabrication     process.
            In an alternative embodiment, an additional type (or types) of inherently FR fibers (i.e., in
addition to the FR modacrylic fibers which are inherently FR) may be added to the FR
modacrylic/synthetic cellulosic fiber blend. The additional inherently FR fibers may include, but
do not have to include, para-aramid fibers, meta-aramid fibers, polybenzimidazole (PBI) fibers,
polybenzoxazole (PBO) fibers, melamine fibers, carbon fibers, pre-oxidized acrylic fibers,
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers, TANLONTM (available from Shanghai Tanlon Fiber Company),
polyamide-imide fibers such as KERMELTM, and blends thereof. Examples of para-aramid fibers
include KEVLARTM (available from DuPont), TECHNORATM (available from Teijin Twaron BV
of Arnheim, Netherlands), and TWARONTM (also available from Teijin Twaron BV). Examples
of meta-aramid fibers include NOMEXTM (available from DuPont), CONEXTM (available from
Teijin), and APYEILTM (available from Unitika). An example of melamine fibers is BASOFILTM
(available from Basofil Fibers). An example of PAN fibers is Panox@ (available from the SGL
                                                    5
US2000 10272105.1

Group).         As explained above, such inherently FR fibers impart the requisite thermal stability to
the blend to enable fabrics made from such blends to be used in protective garments.
            In other embodiments, additional fibers, including, but not limited to (1) anti-static fibers
to dissipate or minimize static, (2) anti-microbial fibers, (3) stretch fibers (e.g., spandex), and/or
(4) high tenacity fibers such as, but not limited to, nylon and/or polyester fibers (such as
VECTRAN TM ) are added to the blends to improve the wear property of fabrics made with such
blends.
            The fiber blends disclosed herein may be used to form various types of FR fabrics.
By way only of example, the fibers may be used to form nonwoven fabrics or may first be formed
into yarn that is subsequently woven or knitted into a FR fabric.
            In one embodiment, yarns are formed from a fiber blend having approximately 30-60%
FR modacrylic fibers, approximately 20-60% synthetic cellulosic fibers, and approximately 5
30% additional inherently FR fibers. TENCELTM and particularly TENCEL A100TM (both non
FR synthetic cellulosic fibers) and para-aramid fibers (inherently FR fibers) have performed
particularly well in this application. The same types of FR modacrylic fibers, synthetic cellulosic
fibers, and additional inherently FR fibers need not be used in the blend. Rather, multiple types
of each may be blended together.
            The yarns can be formed in conventional ways well known in the industry.          The yarns
may be spun yarns and can comprise a single yarn or two or more individual yarns that are
twisted, or otherwise combined, together. In one embodiment, the yarns are air jet spun yarns.
Typically, the yarns comprise one or more yarns that each have a yarn count in the range of
approximately 5 to 60 cc.        In one embodiment, the yarns comprise two yarns that are twisted
together, each having a yarn count in the range of approximately 10 to 60 cc.
            The yarns can subsequently be used to form FR fabrics in a variety of ways, all well
known in the industry. The yarns can be knitted or woven. In one embodiment, the FR fabric is
formed as a plain weave fabric that comprises a plurality of body yarns.          However, it will be
                                                     6
US2000 10272105.1

appreciated that other configurations could be used including, for instance, a rip-stop or a twill
weave such as a 2 X 1 right hand twill weave.
            Regardless of the manner by which the FR fabric is formed (nonwoven, knitted, woven,
etc.), the FR fabric can be made from a blend of fibers that includes having approximately 30
60% FR modacrylic fibers, approximately 20-60% synthetic cellulosic fibers (preferably, but not
necessarily, TENCELTM fibers and more preferably TENCEL A100TM fibers) and approximately
5-30% additional inherently FR fibers (preferably, but not necessarily, para-aramid fibers). As
discussed above, the FR fabric may include a fiber blend that includes anti-static, anti-microbial,
stretch, and/or high tenacity fibers.
            In a much more specific example that is certainly not intended to limit the scope of the
invention discussed herein, the FR fabric includes a blend of between approximately 40-50% FR
modacrylic fibers, approximately 30-40% synthetic cellulosic fibers (preferably, but not
necessarily, TENCELTM fibers and more preferably TENCEL A100TM fibers), and approximately
10-15% aramid fibers (preferably, but not necessarily, para-aramid fibers).
            The FR fabrics formed with the blends disclosed herein preferably, but not necessarily,
have a weight between approximately 3-12 ounces per square yard ("osy") and more preferably
between approximately 5-9 osy.
            Specific examples of embodiments of fabrics in accordance with the invention are
described as follows.
            Fabric Blend #1:    One embodiment of the invention is a fabric with a blend of
approximately 50% PROTEX WTM (FR modacrylic), approximately 40% TENCEL A100TM
(cellulosic), and approximately 10% TWARONTM (para-aramid).
            Fabric Blend #2:   Another embodiment of the invention is a fabric with a blend of
approximately 45% PROTEX WTM (FR modacrylic), approximately 35% TENCEL A100TM
(cellulosic), approximately 10% Lenzing FRTM or FR rayon (cellulosic), and 10% TWARONTM
(para-aramid).

            Fabric Blend #3:   Another embodiment of the invention is a fabric with a blend of
approximately 50% PROTEX WTM (FR modacrylic), approximately 35% TENCEL A100TM
(cellulosic), approximately 10% nylon, and approximately 5% TWARONTM (para-aramid).
            Fabric Blend #4:   Another embodiment of the invention is a fabric with a blend of
approximately 48% PROTEX WTM (FR modacrylic), approximately 37% TENCEL A100TM
(cellulosic), and approximately 15% TWARONTM (para-aramid).
            As evidenced in Table 1, FR fabrics made from the unique fiber blends disclosed herein
comply with the before-wash vertical flammability requirements set forth in ASTM F 1506 and
NFPA 70E, including having acceptable arc thermal protective values ("ATPV"). Workers who
may be exposed to accidental electric arc flash risk serious burn injury unless they are properly
protected. NFPA 70E is the standard that addresses electrical safety requirements, providing
information on all aspects of electrical safety in the workplace. NFPA 70E offers a method to
match protective clothing to potential exposure levels incorporating Hazard Risk Categories
(HRC). Protective fabrics are tested to determine their ATPV or arc rating in cal/cm2 (calories
per square centimeter). The ATPV is determined by ASTM test method F 1959, where sensors
measure thermal energy properties of protective fabric specimens during exposure to a series of
electric arcs. The measured arc rating determines the HRC for a fabric as follows:
                   Hazard Risk Category and ATPV
                   HRC 1: ATPV: 4 cal/cm 2
                   HRC 2: ATPV: 8 cal/cm2
                   HRC 3: ATPV: 25 cal/cm2
                   HRC 4: ATPV: 40 cal/cm 2
            In addition to complying with ASTM F 1506 and NFPA 70E as discussed above, Fabric
Blends #2-#4 comply with the before-wash vertical flammability requirements set forth in ASTM
2112, including having acceptable char lengths (as measured with the testing method set forth in
ASTM 6413).

            Fabrics made from the fiber blends contemplated in this application also have surprisingly
high resistances to abrasion. As explained above, TENCELTM and TENCEL A100TM fibers are
very durable fibers. It is not surprising, therefore, that Taber abrasion test results of fabrics made
from fiber blends having such fibers indicate substantially high resistance to abrasion - indeed
almost as high as fabrics made from 100% inherently FR fibers and higher than fabrics made with
other fiber blends that comply with the ASTM F 1506, NFPA 2112, and NFPA 70E standards.
Moreover, while abrasion resistance is high, the inclusion of modacrylic and cellulosic fibers in
the blends contemplated herein render the resulting fabric soft and thus more comfortable to the
wearer.
            Desired colors may be imparted in a variety of ways to the fabrics disclosed herein having
a blend of synthetic cellulosic, FR modacrylic, and optionally additional inherently FR fibers. In
one embodiment, the synthetic cellulosic fibers and/or modacrylic fibers are dyed (either prior to
their formation into yarn, after formation into yarns, or in the final fabric).          The synthetic
cellulosic and/or modacrylic fibers may be dyed any of a variety of colors, including, but not
limited to, yellow, fluorescent yellow, green, orange, red, blue, gray, etc. using the dyes (or
combinations of dyes) disclosed herein.
            Dyeing may be achieved using a variety of well-known techniques, including exhaust
dyeing processes using a jet, beam, beck, or jig dyeing apparatus or continuous dyeing processes,
all of which are well known in the art. Suitable dyes for dyeing the modacrylic fibers include, but
                                                    9

are not limited to, basic dyes and disperse dyes. Suitable dyes for dyeing the synthetic cellulosic
fibers include, but are not limited to, fiber reactive dyes, direct dyes, and vat dyes.
            In one embodiment, the fabrics are dyed to comply with the standard for high-visibility
safety apparel known in the industry as ANSI 107-2004 and the European equivalent EN 471. To
comply with ANSI 107-2004, a fabric must (1) be dyed to a high-visibility shade (measured by
reference to a fabric's chromaticity and luminance) and (2) maintain that high-visibility shade
after being subjected to light for a specified period of time (an attribute referred to in the standard
as "light fastness"). The dyes for each of the synthetic cellulosic fibers and the modacrylic fibers
are thus selected so as to achieve dyeing of these fibers to a high-visibility shade. Dyes that
enable dyeing of the synthetic cellulosic fibers to a high-visibility shade include, but are not
limited to, direct dyes (including, but not limited to, Direct Yellow 96) and fiber reactive dyes
(including, but not limited to, Remazol Luminous Yellow FL). Dyes that enable dyeing of the
FR modacrylic fibers to a high-visibility shade include, but are not limited to, basic dyes such as
Basic Yellow 40.
            In one example, the FR modacrylic fibers and the synthetic cellulosic fibers of fabrics
having Fabric Blends #1-4 (disclosed above) as well as an additional fabric blend (Fabric Blend
#5 having approximately 50% PROTEX WTM (FR modacrylic), approximately 39% TENCEL
A100TM (cellulosic), approximately 10% TWARONTM (para-aramid), and approximately 1%
antistat)) were dyed in accordance with a two-step exhaust dyeing process using Basic Yellow 40
to dye the FR modacrylic fibers and Remazol Luminous Yellow FL to dye the TENCEL A100TM
fibers. The results are set forth below in Table 2.

            Fabrics having the FR modacrylic/synthetic cellulosic blends (and particularly those using
TENCELTM and TENCEL A100TM fibers) may be dyed in compliance with the military's infrared
reflective requirements (including, but not limited to, those promulgated under MIL-C-83429 and
GL-PD-07-12 (2/28/07)). Vat dyes have proven particularly suitable for dyeing the fabrics in
compliance with such standards. Vat dyeing techniques, such as, but not limited to, those
disclosed in Textile Dyeing and Coloration by J.R. Aspland (Chapters 4: Vat Dyes: General and
5: Vat Dyes and their Application), are well known in the art and thus not discussed in detail
herein. The fabrics disclosed herein may also be printed with dyes or pigments. For example,
such fabrics may be printed in compliance with the military's infrared reflective requirements
with vat dyes using printing techniques well known in the art.
            After all dyeing has been completed, the fabric then can be finished in conventional
manner.           This finishing process can include the application of FR treatments, anti-microbial
agents, insect repellent agents, pesticides, soil release agents, wicking agents, water repellents
(e.g., perfluorohydrocarbon), stiffening agents, softeners, and the like.
            Fabrics having the fiber blends disclosed herein can be used to construct the entirety of, or
various portions of, a variety of protective garments for protecting the wearer against electrical
arc flash and flames, including, but not limited to, coveralls, jumpsuits, shirts, jackets, vests, and
trousers. Retroreflective elements, such as strips of retroreflective tape, may be provided on
portions of the exterior of the garments to enhance the visibility of the garment wearer.
            In one embodiment, a fabric having blends of fibers disclosed herein is used to form at
least a portion of an advanced combat shirt. Advance combat shirts are worn under bullet proof
vests. When a bullet proof vest is positioned over the shirt, the shoulders and sleeves of the shirt
typically remain exposed but the body portion of the shirt is substantially covered by the vest.
Thus, the shoulders and sleeves of the shirt have traditionally been made from woven or heavy
weight knit FR fabrics (such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,867,154, the entirety of
which is herein incorporated by reference) that protect the wearer against flame and radiant
                                                     12

energy and are typically printed (such as with a camouflage pattern) to ensure the wearer does not
stand out in his or her surrounding environment.
            Because the body portion of the shirt is concealed by the bullet proof vest which protects
the wearer's torso, it need not be made from the same materials or afford the same level of FR
protection to the wearer. The inventors have discovered that forming the body portion of the shirt
from an FR fabric having a blend that includes FR modacrylic and synthetic cellulosic fibers
results in a shirt with better wear properties that is more comfortable to the wearer. In one
embodiment, the body portion of the shirt is formed of a 50/50 blend of FR modacrylic fibers and
synthetic cellulosic fibers (suitable examples of each of which are identified in the discussion
above).
            The blend need not only include FR modacrylic and synthetic cellulosic fibers, however.
Rather, other fibers may be added to the blend, including, but not limited to, additional inherently
FR fibers (suitable examples of which are identified in the discussion above), polyester fibers,
nylon fibers, or fibers that impart stretchability to the resulting fabric (e.g., spandex). In an
alternative embodiment, the fiber blend includes between approximately 30-60% FR modacrylic
fibers, approximately 20-60% synthetic cellulosic fibers, approximately 5-30% additional
inherently FR fibers, and between 5-25% nylon fibers. In a more specific embodiment, the fiber
blend includes approximately 50% modacrylic fibers (and preferably, but not necessarily,
PROTEX WTM fibers), 30% lyocell fibers (and preferably, but not necessarily, TENCEL A100TM
fibers), 10% para-aramid fibers (and preferably, but not necessarily, TWARONTM fibers), and
10% nylon fibers.
            The fiber blend is formed into yarns that is then used to form the fabric for use in the body
portion of the shirt. While any type of yarn may be formed, spun yarns are particularly suitable
in this application given their high absorptive properties. It has been found that a fabric provided
with apertures (i.e., a mesh fabric) is particularly well-suited in this application because the
resulting mesh fabric is breathable and allows air to circulate under the vest and thus keeps the
                                                      13
US2000 10272105.1

wearer cool. The mesh fabric may be formed in a variety of ways, with knitting, and particularly
circular knitting, being particularly suitable.
            Any portion of the shirt may be formed from the mesh material. Depending on the
stretchability of the mesh, it may be desirable to incorporate stretchable panels of FR fabric into
the shirt (such as in side panels of the shirt) for ease of donning and removing the garment by the
wearer. The stretchable panels may be formed of any FR fabric, including, but not limited to, the
fabrics contemplated herein.
            The foregoing is provided for purposes of illustrating, explaining, and describing
embodiments of the present invention. Further modifications and adaptations to these
embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made without departing from
the scope or spirit of the invention.
