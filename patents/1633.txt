  [00021The 'sreen       disclosure relates to compositions, and related methods, that
  comprise defined mixtures of terpenes that have a distinctive fragrance that mimics
  that of non-combustcd panI products, intermediates, and related moieties.
      _Bqkour    ofjjhe disclosure
  i000]The fragrant oils of oranges and lemons are used as aroma flavors in
  beverages, ice cream, gelatins, as well as in perfumes and soaps. Cloves, which
  contain aromatic ols, stimulated the establishment of globa commerce between Asia
  and Europe. The major volatile constituent of cloves, eugeno, is used in perfumes, ice
  cream, baked goods, and candy. Peppermint, which also contains aromatic oils, is
  used in the manufacture of chewing gum, candies, and toothpaste.
 [0004] The fragrant components of the oils in the above-mentioned commodities are
 largely terpenes. Terpenes are also known as terpenoids. in citrus fruits, the major
 aromatic compounds are n0monene and 1,8cineoie (also called eucalyptol), which are
 both terpenes.       The aromatic compounds of clove oil include eugenol and
 beta-caryophiliene, which are terpenes.        The aromatic compounds of peppermint
 include lirnonene, menthone and menthol, which are all terpenes. The main terpenes
 in frankincense are E-beta-ocimene and limone (Ai-Harrasi and Ai-Saidi (2008)
 Molecules.     13:2181-2189).     Myrrh   contains    the lerpenes,  lindestrene   and
 furanoeudesma-1,3-diene, which represent the odor of unprocessed myrrh (Hanus et
at (2005) Biomed. Papers. 149:3-28).
  0005The founder of terpene chemistry is Otto Wallach who received the Nobel Prize
in 1910 (Chrtstmann (2010) Angew Chem. int. Ed. Engl. 49:9580-9586), The terpenes
are classified as "natural products." They are biosynthesized from units of isoprene,

 Definitions and methods
 [0045]An "agonist is a compound that stimulates an increase in a biochemical or
physiological activity. The activity can be the rate of ion transport by an ion channe,
rate of signal transmission by a receptor such as a G-protein-linked receoptor, rate of
secreton of a substance from a ce, enzymatic activity, genetic expression, and so on,
[0046]An "antagonisc       is a compound that reduces or inhibits a biochemical or
physioiogcal activity. For a compound to be an antagonist I is not necessary that
there exist any known agonist, and it is not necessary that the antagonist work by
reducing the activity of a corresponding agonist.
  Oi47 The cannabinoid receptors include CB1 and CB2. CB1 and CB 2 are members of
the G protein-coupled receptor family.                     The ligands of CF         include
delta-tetrahydrocannabincl      (delta 9 -THG),    as    well  as   an  endogenous    ligand,

and the like. Generally, the erm "pure" does not take into account any solvent that
may be used for dissolving the terpene, such as a solvent that is ethanol, acetone.,
tetrahydrofuran, and so on. In other words, unless specified otherwise, either explicitly

  Biochemical ssys for entourage compounds
  [0051) The adilty of a compound, such as a terpene, to serve as an agonist, an
  antagonist, to synergize with another compound, or to function as an entourage
  compond, can be assessed by a number of assey methods. Methods for determining
  b0ndng io ces or subcelluiar parties hat expresos a cannabnod receptor have been

 [0052)A least the following methods are avaiale for use in the present disclosure.
 Human panels have been trained to evaiuata odors, such where the odors had the
 names, grassy green. green spicy, sweet, seasoned, sharp, soupy, mellow, metaioC,
 fragrant fruity, cardboard-like,    and complex (Kurobayeshi         et a1 (2006) Biosci.
 Biotechnol. Biochern. 70:958-965).       The Kurobayashi et a, supra. study included
 detection of odor of terpenes, e.g., myrcene.       Human panes have been trained to
 evaluate the level of odorans, including terpens (laooi; L-arvone) on a scale of
 zero extremelyy mild) to ten (extremely utens). Odorans vre delivered to human
 subjects using an air stream.      The suets receiving the odorants, and providing
 subjective responses on odor intensity, also provided objecive responses using
 electroolfectograms (EOG).       The EOG test involved placing electrodes on the
contraleteral bridge of the nose, earlobe, and rastoids.
[0053]A variety of physioiogioal parameters have been tested, in studies of subject
response to terpenes, e.g,        inaloiol    These parameters include blood oxygen
saturation, pulse rate, breathing rale, eye-blinks, skin conductance, skin temperature,
and surface electrornyogram (Heuberger et a (2004) Neuropsychopharmacology,
29:1925- 932).       Various subjective parameters nave also been tested, in subject
response     to terpenes, including     subjective atteniveness       mood,  cheerfulness,
subjective relaxation, vigor, calmness, alertness (see, e.g, Heuberger et al (2004)

[0056]Detecting the presence of odiferous chemicals, as well as the quantification Cf
one or more odiferous chemicals, can be assessed by the human nose. Quanification
can be in terms of, for example, micrograms/liter of air, nanograns/L of air,
picograrns/L of air, femtograms/L o air, attograms/            of air, and so on.      Also,
quantification can be in terms of micromolas/iiter of air, nanomolss/L of air, picomoles/L
of air. femtomoles/L of air, attomoles/L of air, and so on. The skilled artisan is able to
quantify the concentrations of various volatile compounds, by way of odor.              For
example, 2,4,6-trichioroanisole (TOA) can be detected by way of smell, when it exists
at a concentration of a few nanograms/L of air (HK Rudy. Gerstel Solutions Worldwide

 associated with the blend of terpenes; and a sixth step 260 of selecting the blend of
 terpenos that provides a desired cannabinod activation level The selocte-d blend of
 Ierpenes can be further refined and fine-tuned for an individual patient by adjusting the
 totl     cannabinoid  activation    level    by   adnistering   suoiernental    doses   of
 tetrahydrocannabino! (TIC), cannabidioi (CBD), or other phytocannabinoids. The

 Examrple 2
 [0095To create a database of terpene compositions like the database or library
described herein, naturaly occurring plant samples were analyzed for their chemical
properties. Fig. 3 shows a method 300 for generating such a database. The method
300 involves obtaining a sample in step 310. The sample can be a naturally occurring
plant product, such as a member of the Cannabs genus, or any other plant product,
Step 320 of the method involves analyzing a chemicOal profile of the sample to identify
terpenes therein. The analysis can be any of the chemical analyses described herein,
including chromatography. The analysis step may further comprise other processes for
extracting compounds or otherwise preparing the sample for analysis. The method
further comprises quantifying terpenas in step 330. The terpenes can be quantified by
                                                  22

  quantities can be sed to determine a ratio of terpenes in the compositra i step 340,
  those qluanities. ratos, or other chemicalproperies are emnted too a database of
  terpene compositons. The database may comprise chromatography profles or other
  chemical properties found in   t erpene composittions.
  [0096]An example of one such analysis is shown in Fig. 4, A sample of a nurally
  occurring pint was isiatreda         adnaized using chromatography. The five most
  abundant terpenes in the compcsiton were found to be       -caryophyllene,   inne
  linalool. nyrcene, and apapinne. These terpenes were determined' to be present in
 quantities of 1.85 mg/g, 56 mgg, L50 mg/g, 3.31 ng/g, and 8.40 mg/g, respectively.
 Other ieren'ce were found in race quanties, including camphene, alpha-hunulene,
 aipha-phellandrene, and beta-pinene. These quantities and chemical properties were
 entered into a database, lke the one described herein.
