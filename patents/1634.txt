DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0022] As shown in FIGS. 1-8, a preferred embodiment of the golf club head 10 of the present
invention is generally designated. The golf club head 10 includes a body 20 having a striking
face section 30 with a face center 34, a return section 32 extending rearwards away from an
upper edge 31 of the striking face section 30, sole section 22 extending rearwards away from a
lower edge 33 of the striking face section 30, a hosel 24 for engaging a shaft, a heel end 23, a
toe end 25, an upper opening 26, a hollow interior 27, and an aft end 28. A crown section 40 is
comprised of the return section 32 and a crown insert 42 that is placed over the upper opening
26 to enclose the hollow interior 27. The body 20 also includes three cutouts 70, 72, 74 in a
center area 21 of the sole section 22, which are closed by a cover piece 80 having a density that
is lower than the density of the material used to make the body 20. Each of the crown section 40
and cover piece 80 preferably is composed of a carbon composite material, while the body 20 is
composed of a metal material such as titanium alloy or steel.
[0023] Within the hollow interior 27, two stiffening members 50, 52 extend from the sole
section 22 upward to the return section 32 approximately parallel with the rear surface 36 of the
striking face section 30 and with each other. In an alternative embodiment, the stiffening
members 50, 52 may extend to the crown insert 42 instead; what is important is that the
stiffening members 50, 52 connect the crown section 40 to the sole section 22 proximate the
striking face section 30, without making contact with any portion of the striking face section 30,
even when the striking face section 30 impacts a golf ball. The stiffening members 50, 52 must,
in any event, be closer to the striking face section 30 than to the aft end 28 of the body 20.

                                                   7
[0024] As shown in Figure 3, the preferred embodiment has two stiffening members 50, 52,
each of which is a solid rod composed of a lightweight, strong metal material such as titanium
alloy or steel, though in an alternative embodiment the stiffening members 50, 52 each may be a
hollow tube or other hollow structure made of a strong lightweight metal or a composite
material. In another embodiment, the golf club head 10 may include both the solid rod and
hollow types of stiffening members 50. The stiffening members 50, 52 preferably are co-cast
with the body 20 using a wax molding process, though in alternative embodiments may be
added after the body 20 is manufactured and secured to the body 20 via welding, brazing, solder,
or adhesive, and/or mechanically.
[0025] In the preferred embodiment, each of the stiffening members 50, 52 has a diameter of
0.050 inch to 0.200 inch and a length of 1 to 2.5 inches. The stiffening members 50, 52 are both
located within 1 inch of the rear surface 36 of the striking face section 30 measured along a
vertical plane 60 extending through the face center 34 perpendicular to the striking face section
30. No portion of any stiffening member 50, 52 should be located outside of this 1-inch range;
in fact, it is more preferable for each stiffening member 50, 52 to be located even closer to the
rear surface 36 of the striking face section 30. In the preferred embodiment, the stiffening
members are spaced 0.136 inch to 0.210 inch from the rear surface 36, with the upper end 50a,
52a of each stiffening member 50, 52 spaced a distance D1 that is slightly closer to the rear
surface 36 than the spacing D2 of the lower end 50b, 52b. In the preferred embodiment, D1
ranges from 0.120 inch to 0.150 inch, while D2 ranges from 0.180 inch to 0.210 inch. The
stiffening members 50, 52 are also spaced from one another by a distance D3 of 0.500 to 2.00
inch, more preferably approximately 0.75 to 1.50 inch, and most preferably approximately 1.00
inch. This positioning of the stiffening members 50, 52 optimizes the normalized ball speed
relationship to Characteristic Time (CT), as measured in P s by the U.S. Golf Association
(USGA) CT test.
[0026] Normalized ball speed removes the variable effect of a golf club head's mass and loft,
and the construction of a particular golf ball, from testing the speed of a golf ball upon impact
with any given golf club head, including the golf club head 10 of the present invention; in other
words, it allows an apples-to-apples comparison of golf club head performance. Normalized ball
speed can be determined for a golf club head using the following steps, which are also outlined
in the flow chart of Figure 9.

                                                   8
[0027] First, provide a titanium 6-4 calibration plate 90 with a mass of approximately 190
grams, a diameter D4 of approximately 4 inches, a minimum thickness T1 of approximately
0.100-0.150 inch, and a maximum thickness T2 of approximately 0.200-0.400 inch, as shown in
Figures 10 and 11, and strike the center 92 of the calibration plate with a test golf ball moving at
approximately 109 mph (step 100). Measure the return velocity Vbr of the ball (step 110). Then,
strike the same test golf ball, again traveling at approximately 109 mph, with the center 34 of the
striking face section 30 of the golf club head 10 being assessed (step 120), and measure the
rebound velocity Vr of the test golf ball (step 130). Next, measure and record the mass of the
plate my, golf ball mb, golf club head 10 me, measured head test ball in velocity (109 mph
target) Ve,, measured plate test ball in velocity (109 mph target) ViT, measured head test ball
return velocity Vr, and measured plate test ball return velocity Vbr (step 140). Finally, calculate
the normalized ball speed (Vbalinorm) using the following equation (step 150):
                    mcV     + maVb              +       +     +         1+     p+      - - 0.822
     Vbaltinorm --                                        m           (
                                                      mf + mb
In this equation, Vinh is 100 and mh is 200.
[0028] The golf club head 10 of the present invention has a Vbalinorm > 0.0356x + 140.82, and
more preferably a Vbalinorm       0.0356x + 141.19. The positioning of the stiffening members
50, 52 of the present invention allows the golf club head 10 to satisfy this equation; as shown in
Figure 12, prior art golf club heads, which do not include the stiffening member structure, fall
well short of this performance metric.
[0029] In addition to optimizing the normalized ball speed of the golf club head 10, locating the
stiffening members 50, 52 within the region of the golf club head 10 defined above has the
greatest stress-reducing effect on the golf club head 10. If any of the stiffening members 50, 52
