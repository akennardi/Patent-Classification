                                               ABSTRACT
A structural member having an enclosed profile is formed from a sheet of material having a longitudinal
axis between a front edge and a rear edge, and a transverse axis across the longitudinal axis between a
first side edge and a second side edge. The structural member includes a first flange having a first side
and a second side, a first web extending from the first side of the first flange towards the first side edge,
a second web extending from the second side of the first flange towards the second side edge, and a
second flange. The second flange includes a first return between the first web and the first side edge,
the first return further including an outwardly facing hook between the first return and the first side
edge. The second flange also includes a second return between the second web and the second side
edge, the second return further including an inwardly facing hook between the second return and the
second side edge. The outwardly facing hook and the inwardly facing hook project into each other to
provide an overlapping section, and the second flange includes at least one crimp in the overlapping
section, where a width of the crimp in the direction of the transverse axis of the sheet is less than that
of the overlapping section.

   This application is based the provisional specification filed in relation to New Zealand Patent Application
 5 No. 727847, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                                  TECHNICAL FIELD
   The present disclosure relates to a structural member, more particular a hollow structural section cold
   rolled from a sheet of material.
 0
                                                   BACKGROUND
   Cold-formed structural members are known for use in construction, for example as purlins, rafters,
   girts, and the like. Cold-forming refers to the shaping of flat steel sheet without the use of applied heat.
   Light gauge steel in particular when cold-formed typically provides considerably more strength for its
 5 weight than hot-formed steel (i.e. processed above its recrystallisation temperature).
   The roll-forming process is the method generally preferred for volume production of cold-formed
   structural members, and is often termed cold-rolling. In this process the steel sheet is passed through a
   series of rollers which incrementally 'roll' the shape from the flat sheet.
   Known roll-formed light-gauge steel structural members are typically open shapes. C and Z shaped
20 purlins are the most common, although other shapes and variations on these shapes may be found.
   Such open shapes are easier to manufacture than enclosed shapes. However, enclosed shapes such as
   rectangles, squares, and other hollow shapes are more stable and less prone to buckling and distortion
   when subjected to load than open shapes. Further, open shapes such as in the case of C and Z shaped
   purlins are also notorious for providing bird roosting perches when used on the underside of roofing.
25 This can be a serious nuisance due to the accumulation of bird excrement both on the beams where it is
   very corrosive, and beneath the beams where it can also pose serious problems.
   A method that has been employed is the use of continuous welding to join the edges of a single sheet of
   steel together after roll-forming, to form a hollow section. However, in order to provide protection
   against corrosion of the structural member it is desirable to galvanise the light gauge steel. Welding
                                                         1

    -  - a 1 CI.   -  1Ju -    I'.J
                             1LJ
   precludes galvanising of the sheet prior to cold-rolling, which is much more economical and convenient
   than finishing or galvanising the structural member after cold-forming.
   Another method that has been employed is the use of one of a variety of lock-seam methods to join the
   edges of a single sheet of steel together after roll-forming, to form a hollow section. Lock-seaming folds
 5 the edges of the sheet over each other to produce a mechanical joint. However, these methods require
   the production of very tight radii to achieve the fold, and are difficult to apply to steel sheet other than
   very thin thicknesses, typically 1.0mm or less. Furthermore, it is particularly difficult to design a single
   roll-forming machine that will perform lock-seaming for a range of sheet thicknesses which may be
   required to form a structural member, for example between 1.0 mm to 3.0 mm - which would
 0 otherwise necessitate investment in additional capital equipment.
   It is an object of the present invention to address at least one of the foregoing problems or at least to
   provide the public with a useful choice.

                                                        SUMMARY
   According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a structural member having an
   enclosed profile formed from a sheet of material having a longitudinal axis between a front edge and a
   rear edge, and a transverse axis across the longitudinal axis between a first side edge and a second side
30 edge, the structural member including:
              a first flange having a first side and a second side;
                                                             2

             a first web extending from the first side of the first flange towards the first side edge;
             a second web extending from the second side of the first flange towards the second side edge;
   and
             a second flange including:
 5                    a first return between the first web and the first side edge, the first return further
             including an outwardly facing hook between the first return and the first side edge;
                      a second return between the second web and the second side edge, the second return
             further including an inwardly facing hook between the second return and the second side edge,
                      wherein the outwardly facing hook and the inwardly facing hook project into each other
 0           to provide an overlapping section, and
                      wherein the second flange includes at least one crimp in the overlapping section, and
             the width of the crimp in the direction of the transverse axis of the sheet is less than that of the
             overlapping section.
   According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a
 5 structural member substantially as described herein from a sheet of material having a longitudinal axis
   between a front edge and a rear edge, and a transverse axis across the longitudinal axis between a first
   side edge and a second side edge, wherein the method includes the steps of:
             roll-forming the sheet of material to form the first return and the second return;
             roll-forming the sheet of material to form the first flange, the first web, and the second web;
20           directing the first return towards the second return and forcing the first return away from the
   first flange and/or forcing the second return towards the first flange such that the first return and
   second return pass each other to overlap;
             releasing the first return and/or second return, such that the outwardly facing hook and the
   inwardly facing hook project into each other to provide the overlapping section; and
25           crimping the overlapping section, wherein the width of the crimp in the direction of the
   transverse axis of the sheet is less than that of the overlapping section.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the structural member may be formed from a single sheet of material.
   However, it is also envisaged that in exemplary embodiments the structural member may be formed
   from two sections, such that the first flange is also configured in the manner described with respect to
                                                           3

   the second flange (i.e. having overlapping hooks crimped in the manner described).
   According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method of joining two edges of a
   sheet of material, wherein the method includes:
            forming a first hook on one edge, and a second hook on the second edge,
 5          positioning the first and second hooks such that they project into each other to provide an
   overlapping section, and
            crimping the overlapping section, wherein the width of the crimp in the direction of the
   transverse axis of the sheet is less than that of the overlapping section.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the structural member is an elongate beam. The length of the beam may
 0 be that of the sheet of material from which it is formed, or cut to length.
   Reference to the structural member having an enclosed profile should be understood to mean that the
   cross-sectional shape of the member is hollow, with the interior surfaces of the flanges and webs
   enclosing an interior space of the member - i.e. a hollow structural section. In addition to providing a
   structurally efficient shape, such a profile is envisaged as avoiding creating ledges for birds to perch on
 5 particularly when used in the construction of roofs. It should be appreciated that reference to an
   enclosed profile is not intended to exclude the production of apertures in the structural member (for
   example, for the insertion of fasteners to secure fittings to the structural member).
   Where the structural member is used in roof structures, it is envisaged that a flange may be a horizontal
   element of the structural member, predominantly resisting most of the bending moment experienced
 0 by the structural member in use. Similarly, in such an orientation a web of the structural member may
   be a vertical element of the structural member, predominantly resisting most of the shear forces
   experienced by the structural member in use. It should be appreciated that this is not intended to be
   limiting, as use cases are envisaged in which the structural member may be oriented such that the
   flanges are vertical elements - for example where used as a girt in a wall structure to resist wind loads.
25 Reference to a return should be understood to mean portion of the sheet of material bent out of
   alignment with the adjacent section, typically inwardly. In an exemplary embodiment, the returns may
   be substantially 90* returns. However, it should be appreciated that this is not intended to be limiting;
   for example, the angle of the returns may be such that they are biased to clamp against the adjacent
   portion of the structural member.
30 In an exemplary embodiment, the first web and/or the second web may be formed such that they are
   biased towards an angle of greater than 90* relative to the first flange. It is envisaged that this
                                                          4

                        1LJ
   outwardly acting bias may assist in maintaining the shape of the structural member.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the sheet of material may be made of steel. In an exemplary
   embodiment, the sheet of material is light gauge steel, more particularly steel having a thickness
   between about 0.3 mm and about 3.0 mm. In an exemplary embodiment, the light gauge steel may
 5 have a thickness between about 0.6 mm and about 2.5 mm. In an exemplary embodiment, the light
   gauge steel may have a thickness between about 0.75 mm and about 2.25 mm. The form of the
   structural member is such that tight folds are not required, which allows the same roll-forming
   equipment to be used for a range of thicknesses of sheet. It should be appreciated that this is not
   intended to be limiting, and that the sheet of material may be made of another metal or ductile
 0 material suitable for cold roll-forming.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the sheet of material may be treated for corrosion protection prior to
   forming the structural member. For example, the sheet of material may be galvanised. The form of the
   structural beam allows for an enclosed profile to be produced without the use of welding or other heat
   based joining techniques, which could otherwise compromise corrosion protection applied prior to
 5 formation of the member.
   Reference to crimping should be understood to mean the act of localised deformation of two or more
   layers of sheet material to produce a friction joint between them. It should be appreciated that
   reference to a "crimp" may therefore be understood to mean the localised deformation resulting from
   this action. In an exemplary embodiment, the crimping may be performed by applying the deforming
 0 force with a tool on one side of the overlapping section, with the other side of the overlapping section
   bearing against an anvil.
   In an exemplary embodiment, crimping may be performed on opposing sides of the overlapping section
   - i.e. the flange having the overlapping section may include a first crimp on a first side of the
   overlapping section, and a second crimp on a second side of the overlapping section.
25 As a point of reference for explanation, each hook may include a lead-in portion, a return bend, and
   return portion ending at the side edge of the sheet of material. In an exemplary embodiment, at least
   one of the hooks may include a recurved section in the lead-in portion. This recurved section may allow
   the outward facing surfaces of the respective lead-in portions to be substantially level.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the return bend of the hooks may be such that the return portion is open
30 beyond parallel relative to the lead-in portion - i.e. more open that a "U" shape. It is envisaged that this
   may be particularly applicable to embodiments in which the structural member is manufactured from a
   single sheet, allowing for the overlap to be achieved by a lateral motion with a relatively small degree of
                                                          5

   deflection of the returns as they pass each other. However, it should be appreciated that this is not
   intended to be limiting to all embodiments.
   Further, it should be appreciated that in exemplary embodiments in which the structural member is
   formed from two sections the sections may be positioned relative to each other through a sliding
 5 motion along the longitudinal axis. In such a configuration, the hooks may be generally "U" shaped or
   closed beyond parallel.
   For ease of understanding, the joint created by the crimped hooks will be described as if the crimping
   force is applied from the outside of the structural member - i.e. is applied inwardly. However, it should
   be appreciated that this is not intended to be limiting to all embodiments, and in exemplary
 0 embodiments the crimping force may be applied from inside the structural member.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the width of the crimp along the transverse axis of the sheet may be
   about, or less than, the distance between the respective return bends of the hooks through the overlap.
   In doing so, formation of the joint does not rely on flattening of the return bends - which for thicker
   sheets of material would likely require a bend radius below a recommended minimum bend radius.
 5 Determination of the minimum bend radius may consider factors such as sheet material (for example, a
   higher tensile steel may require a higher bend radius), sheet thickness, the bending angle (generally a
   tighter radius may be used for a more open angle - e.g. a tighter radius may be used for a 90* bend
   than a 180* bend), and tolerance for tensile cracking (dependent on the finish and intended
   application). Minimum bend radius is typically expressed as a multiple of the thickness (T), e.g. 3T. A
 0 traditional lock seam must use a 0.5T radius to achieve flatness.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the minimum bend radius may be greater than 0.5T. In an exemplary
   embodiment, the minimum bend radius may be about or greater than 1.0T. In an exemplary
   embodiment, the minimum bend radius may be about or greater than 2.0T.
   It is envisaged that the joint described herein may enable a single former to be used to manufacture
25 structural members from different thicknesses of sheet. For example, a former configured to produce a
   minimum bend radius of approximately 1.0T from 2.00 mm sheet may also be used to process 1.00 mm
   sheet (with a resulting bend radius of approximately 2.0T) - with the design of the joint being such that
   this difference in bend radius does not negate the effectiveness of the joint.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the crimp in the overlapping section may be substantially centred in the
30 overlapping section. In an exemplary embodiment including a first crimp on a first side of the
   overlapping section, and a second crimp on a second side of the overlapping section, a centre point of
   the first crimp may be offset from a centre point of the second crimp along the overlapping section.
                                                        6

   In an exemplary embodiment, the crimp may include an indentation in the hook to which the deforming
   force is applied. In an exemplary embodiment, the indentation may be provided in the lead-in portion
   of the hook.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the depth of the indentation may be sufficient to bear the end of the
 5 return portion of one of the hooks against the return portion of the other hook, without flattening the
   returns entirely - i.e. the returns do not bear against each other in their entirety through the overlap.
   A further understanding of the functional and advantageous aspects of the present disclosure can be
   realised by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.

 5 FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary structural member in the form of an elongate beam 100. The beam 100
   is formed from a single sheet of material, for example light gauge galvanised steel having a thickness of
   between about 0.3 mm to 3.0 mm.
   The beam 100 includes a first flange 102. A first web 104 extends from a first side of the first flange
   102. A first return 106 is formed at an end of the first web 104 distal from the first flange 102,
 0 substantially parallel with the first flange 102. A second web 108 extends from a second side of the first
   flange 102, substantially parallel with the first web 104. A second return 110 is formed at an end of the
   second web 108 distal from the first flange 102, substantially parallel with the first flange 102.
   In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, swages 112-1 to 112-6 are provided in the first flange 102,
   first web 104, and the second web 108 for additional strength.
 5 The first return 106 and second 110 are joined to provide a second flange by a joint 300, as shown in
   greater detail in FIG. 3C and described below.
   In an exemplary embodiment, the beam 100 may be installed with the first flange 102 against the
   material to which the beam 100 is to be secured. For example, where the beam 100 is used to support
   roofing, the beam may be installed with the first flange 102 facing upwardly, and the roofing material
20 fastened thereto. In doing so, a fastener (such as a screw) is only required to pass through one layer of
   the sheet of material from which the beam 100 is formed.
   FIG. 1B illustrates an exemplary structural member in the form of an elongate beam 150. The beam 150
   is formed from two sheets of material, for example light gauge galvanised steel having a thickness of
   between about 0.3 mm to 3.0 mm.
25 The beam 150 includes a first section formed of a web 152-1 having a first return 154-1 at one end, and
   a second return 156-1 at the distal end, substantially parallel with the first return 154-1. The beam 150
   further includes a second section formed of a web 152-2 having a first return 154-2 at one end, and a
   second return 156-2 at the distal end, substantially parallel with the first return 154-2.
   The first and second sections of the beam 150 are joined by joints 300-1 and 300-2 to create the box
30 section illustrated.

   It should be appreciated that while beam 100 and beam 150 are illustrated as having the joints 300 in
   the ends of the respective beams, it is also envisaged that in exemplary embodiments the joints may be
 5 provided in the sides of those beams (for example, in one of the first web 104 or the second web 104 of
   beam 100, or in webs 152-1 and 152-2 of beam 150).
   FIG. 2A-2E illustrate the manufacture of the beam 100 from a single sheet 200 of light gauge steel using
   cold-rolling techniques. The method is illustrated after a first "outward facing" hook 202 has been
   formed in a first edge of the sheet 200, and a second "inward facing" hook 204 has been formed in a
 0 second edge of the sheet 200. In a first step, rollers act to bend the sheet 200 about points 202-1 and
   202-2 (see FIG. 2A) to produce the first and second returns 106 and 108 (see FIG. 2B).
   The upper flange 102 is then formed by bending the sheet about points 208-1 and 208-2 (see FIG. 2B),
   with the first web 104 and second web 108 rolled out (see FIG. 2C).
   The first and second webs 104 and 108 are rolled closer together. When they begin to meet each other,
 5 as seen in FIG. 2D the second return 110 is depressed towards the upper flange 102 so that the first
   return 106 can be lifted over it, while at the webs 104 and 108 continue to be pushed closer together.
   Referring to FIG. 2E, the inward facing hook 204 of the first return 106 overlaps with the outward facing
   hook 202 of the second return 110. The joint 300 may then be formed, as will be described with
   reference to FIGs. 3A to 3C.
 0 Referring to FIG. 3A, the outward facing hook 202 includes a lead-in portion 302-1, a return bend 304-1,
   and a return portion 306-1 ending at the side edge of the sheet of material 200. The return portion 306
   1 of the outward facing hook 202 includes a recurved section 308. The inward facing hook 204 includes
   a lead-in portion 302-2, a return bend 304-2, and a return portion 306-2 ending at the other side edge
   of the sheet of material 200.
25 It may be seen that in this exemplary embodiment the return portions 306-1 and 306-1 are open
   beyond parallel relative to the lead-in portions 302-1 and 302-2. This assists with positioning the hooks
   202 and 204 such that they overlap each other in the manner illustrated.
   As shown in FIG. 3B, an anvil 310 (for example, a roller wheel) is provided on the inward facing surface
   of the lead-in portion 302-1 of the outward facing hook 202, and a crimping tool 312 (for example, a
30 bead on a roller wheel) is brought to bear on the outward facing surface of the lead-in portion 302-2 of
   the inward facing hook 204 in a position centred on the overlap of the hooks 202 and 204. The hooks
                                                        9

    - - a 1 CI. -  1Ju - 1~ I'.J
   202 and 204 are deformed such that the lead-in portion 302-2 of the inward facing hook 204 bears
   against the return portion 306-1 of the outward facing hook 202, and the return portion 306-2 of the
   inward facing hook 204 bears against the lead-in portion 304-1 of the outward facing hook 202, and the
   lead-in portions 302-1 and 302-2 and return portions 304-1 and 304-2 are brought into parallel.
 5 Referring to FIG. 3C, the crimping tool 312 (not shown in FIG. 3C, but see FIG. 3B) continues to deform
   the inward facing hook 204 such that an indentation 314 is formed in the lead-in portion 302-2. The
   indentation 314 deflects the return portion 306-1 of the outward facing hook 202 such that its distal
   end bears against the return portion 306-2 of the inward facing hook 204, while the end of the return
   portion 306-1 of the outward facing hook 202 adjacent the return bend 304-1 remains elevated above
 0 the return portion 306-2 of the inward facing hook 204 with a gap 316 therebetween. The numerous
   points of contact between the hooks 202 and 204 may reduce the potential for relative movement,
   particularly in circumstances in which the beam is subjected to twisting forces.
   Referring to FIG. 3D, in an exemplary embodiment a second indentation 318 may be formed in the lead
   in portion 302-1 of the outward facing hook 202. The second indentation 318 deforms the return
 5 portion 306-2 of the inward facing hook 204, and bears it against the return portion 306-1 of the
   outward facing hook 202. It is envisaged that this may further increase the tightness and integrity of the
   joint 300 in comparison with that illustrated in FIG. 3C, without increasing the minimum bend radii
   used. However, it should be appreciated that the joint 300 in the stage illustrated in FIG. 3C may still
   have application for use in the exemplary beams described herein.
 0 In an exemplary embodiment, the second indentation 318 may be formed subsequently to formation of
   the indentation 314. In an exemplary embodiment, the second indentation 318 may be formed
   simultaneously with formation of the indentation 314 - for example with a second crimping tool
   mirroring crimping tool 312.
   In an exemplary embodiment, a centre point 320 of the indentation 314 may be offset from a second
25 centre point 322 of the second indentation 318 along the length of the joint 300. For example, in the
   exemplary embodiment illustrated, the centre point 320 may be closer to the free end of the return
   portion 306-1 of the outward facing hook 202 than the second centre point 322 is. It is envisaged that
   this may assist with reducing the spring back of the return portions 306-1 and 306-2.
