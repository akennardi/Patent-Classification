                "A MEDICAL SUPPLIES CONTAINER AND RELATED SYSTEMS"
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to a medical supplies container in a particular,
 5 although not solely to a medical supplies container, that may be made available for limited
   or open use by individuals requiring, for example, first aid supplies at industrial,
   commercial or medical facilities.
   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
 3           Medical supply cupboards are known, however there appears to be no way for
   companies that make such medical supply cupboards available for people to use in their
   organisation to effectively monitor the use of the cupboard and/or its content in real time.
            In a very basic form a medical supplies cupboard may merely be a cabinet having
   a plurality of shelves or drawers in which for example band aids, bandages, creams,
 5 syringes and other medical supplies are kept. Company employees can, at will, take items
   from such a cabinet or container. Consequently, it is often found in commercial premises
   that the state of a first aid cabinet or container leaves a lot to be desired. In order to
   maintain a more strict control over such cabinets some companies will restrict the number
   of users that can access the cabinet, but restricted access can be detrimental to the timely
 3 treatment of an injured or unwell person in an emergency situation.
            A manual record of items coming out and going into the cabinet may also be kept
   in order to keep a track of stock levels. However, this is time consuming and not
   necessarily accurate as it is prone to human error. In certain emergencies when there is
   no time to complete the paper work, errors can creep into stock level documentation. This
.5 can result in items not being available when they are most needed potentially exposing
   companies to liability for lack of proper care.
            Whilst some companies request their staff to inform a person responsible for
   maintaining the cabinet when certain items are running low, this often does not happen.
   This can cause problems when items are required in an emergency but stock has run out.
 0 When stock is running low it also takes time for the person responsible for the cabinet to
   re-order and supplement the cabinet as appropriate.
            Some cabinets are subject to "unexplained stock losses". Again, stock take on
   documentation in such instances will not be maintained and therefore can cause problems
   downstream. As a result a system for checking out medical supplies and medication is not
 5 ideal and is commonly subject to stock losses.
            On some occasions it may be that the wrong items are taken from the cabinet to
   treat a particular injury, or that the cabinet user is unsure about what items to take or how

                                                   -2
   to use them. The risk of injury complications can be increased where incorrect treatment is
   given, or where correct treatment is not given quickly.
   OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
             It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a medical supply
   cabinet or container which overcomes or at least partially ameliorates some of the
   abovementioned disadvantages or which at least provides the public with a useful choice.
             Alternately, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of
    monitoring the inventory of a medical supply cabinet or container which overcomes or at
 3  least partially ameliorates some of the abovementioned disadvantages or which at least
   provides the public with a useful choice.
             In this specification, where reference has been made to external sources of
   information, including patent specifications and other documents, this is generally for the
   purpose of providing a context for discussing the features of the present invention. Unless
 5 stated otherwise, reference to such sources of information is not to be construed, in any
   jurisdiction, as an admission that such sources of information are prior art or form part of
   the common general knowledge in the art.
             For the purpose of this specification, where method steps are described in
   sequence, the sequence does not necessarily mean that the steps are to be chronologically
 3 ordered in that sequence, unless there is no other logical manner of interpreting the
   sequence.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 5          The invention comprises a medical supplies cabinet 1 and a related system for
   stock control.
            The cabinet 1 may be wall hung or floor standing, or in some embodiments may
   be portable. The cabinet 1 has a containment region 2 that is able to be enclosed. It is
   preferably able to be closed by a door or doors 3 that slide or hinge relative a cabinet
 3 housing 4. Alternatively the containment region 2 remains open at all times.
            In some embodiments the doors 3 or other means of enclosing the containment
   region 2 are not secured, so that any person is able to access the contents of the cabinet
   1. In other embodiments some form of lock or other form of security may be provided so
   that only certain people can access the cabinet 1. For example a swipe card may be read
.5 to actuate unlocking of the cabinet 1.
            In some embodiments there may be a finger print scanner or reader 20 which is
   able to obtain and/or interpret information derived from a fingerprint of the user of the
   cabinet 1. Preferably the finger print scanner or reader 20 is positioned on the exterior of
   the cabinet 1, such that a person must permit their fingerprint to be scanned/read prior to
 0 being granted access to the interior of the cabinet 1. The information obtained by the
   scanner or reader 20 may be used to verify that the user is authorised to access the
   cabinet 1. The information obtained by the scanner or reader 20 may also, or alternatively,
   be stored by an electronic recording system. For example, the fingerprint may be as a
   record of the identity of the user of the cabinet for a particular transaction.   In preferred
 5 embodiments the cabinet 1 has a distinctive cross shaped profile as shown in Figure 1, so
   that in an emergency any person would likely recognise it as being a container for medical
   supplies. The cabinet 1 may be green in colour, or backlit with a green illumination, or
   otherwise illuminated. The illumination be constant or may pulse. For example, the cabinet

                                                 - 26
   may have a UPS, such as a battery or onboard generator, so that if there is a power
   outage during a natural disaster the cabinet can remain illuminated, and the illumination
   may pulse to attract the attention of those who are searching for medical supplies.
             The containment region 2 may have one compartment or may be divided into two
 5 or more compartments 5 as shown in Figure 2, such that medical supplies can be arranged
   in an organised manner. In some embodiments the, or each, compartment 5 may contain
   those supplies necessary to treat a specific type of injury or accident, or provide a specific
   type of treatment. For example there may be a compartment containing items suitable for
   treating burns and another compartment containing items suitable for treating cuts.
 3           Within one or more of the compartments there may be one or more stock item
   bays 6 for receiving the various items to be held in the cabinet 1. The compartments 5,
   and the stock item bays 6 inside each compartment 5, may be reconfigurable in their
   dimensions and locations so that the layout of the containment region 2 can be customised
   for different applications. The stock item bays 6 may be designated to receive a specific
 5 type of stock item, for example a left hand bay may be designated to receive bandages,
   while an adjoining bay may be designated to receive sticking plasters.
             In some embodiments there may be one or more indicators, each associated with
   a particular bay 6 inside the cabinet 1 (each of said bays being designated to receive a
   specific type of stock item), and preferably positioned proximate to the associated bay.
 3 There may be an input means for a user of the cabinet 1 to communicate the type of injury
   that they wish to treat. As a result of the input, the indicators will signal the location of
   those bays 6 that contain items which may be useful in treating the injury so that the
   needed items can rapidly be gathered by the user. For example, there may be an LED light
   positioned above each bay 6 inside the containment area 2. There may be a series of press
.5 buttons located on the inside or outside of the housing 4, each corresponding to a
   particular injury type, e.g. burns, cuts, eye injuries, CPR and trauma. If a user presses the
   button corresponding to a cut injury, the LED lights above those bays which hold antiseptic
   solution and butterfly strips may become illuminated to assist the user in locating items
   useful for treating the cut.
 0           Preferably associated with the cabinet 1 is a camera 7. This camera 7 will record
   an image or footage of the person taking medical supplies from the cabinet 1. The image
   or footage may be time or date stamped and/or logged in an electronic recording system.
   In some embodiments time and/or date stamping occurs with reference to an independent
   source of time and/or date data to ensure the accuracy of the time and date records.
 5           The camera 7 may take a photo of the person using the cabinet 1, and preferably
   has suitable optics for close up imagery of the person using the cabinet 1. This photo or
   footage may be recorded automatically. This may be achieved by a proximity sensor 8 that
   triggers the recording, by a switch associated with the cabinet doors contact sensor (not

                                                 - 27
   shown) or other means of triggering a recording. There may be a light or sound indicator
   to encourage the person to look toward the camera 7 as the photo is taken.
            Alternatively the camera 7 may be set to continuously record, such as if it's a
   video camera or by way of time lapse stills. It may include a function to tag or take a
 5 photo as and when someone is engaging with the cabinet 1.
            The camera 7 may be mounted externally of the cabinet 1 as shown in Figure 1.
   Alternatively it may be housed internally as shown in Figure 3 to prevent people from
   tampering with the camera to prior to accessing the cabinet in an effort to prevent their
   identity from being recorded.
 3          In some embodiments a microphone 9 is provided inside or near the cabinet 1 to
   enable the recording of audio streams at the time that the cabinet 1 is accessed. The audio
   information made be date or time stamped and/or stored along with the visual information
   from the camera 7.
            The supplies cabinet 1 includes or is associated with a system for recording activity
 5 of the cabinet, including transactions where users remove items from the cabinet and/or
   replace items back in the cabinet. In particular the system may be used for recording
   and/or monitoring stock levels in the cabinet 1. The system may also be used for reporting
   stock levels for the purposes of reordering stock. This reporting may cause automatic
   reordering of stock as stock is taken, or as stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
 3 Preferably the system is also able to detect and record transactions where new stock is
   added to the cabinet 1.
            A schematic of an exemplary system is shown in Figure 4. The output from
   sensors inside the cabinet 1 can be processed to yield information about stock levels inside
   the cabinet 1. The information processed by the system can be recorded in a data storage
.5 medium 10 to create a historical log of the activity of the cabinet 1. As an example, this
   can be referred to at a later date for health and safety auditing purposes. The information
   processed by the system can also be sent directly or indirectly to a computer 11 or mobile
   phone, such as that of a third party. For example, the system can create an incidence
   report of each transaction which is sent to the computer 11 of the person who is in charge
 0 of monitoring the stock levels and use of the cabinet. As an alternative example, the
   system may have an associated mobile phone application which enables a mobile phone
   user to simultaneously monitor the stock levels and use in relation to a number of supply
   cabinets for which that person is responsible. Furthermore the system may output
   information directly to a supplier or distributor 12, so that re-ordering and replenishment
 5 of stock items can be carried out. Preferably the re-ordering occurs automatically at by, or
   at the prompt of, the system.
            In some embodiments, information processed by the system may be
   communicated via a Wi-Fi connection to a local network, or communicated as an SMS over

                                                - 28
   a cellular or mobile network. Internet and/or network connections may also be used to
   input information into the system and effect system software updates.
            In some embodiments the system comprises or communicates with a data storage
   device such as a network, hard drive or "the cloud" to create a log of transactions involving
 5 the cabinet and/or the items held in the cabinet. Preferably the log is electronically
   accessible. For example, a stock distributor or supplier may be able to input cabinet
   restocking dates to be logged by the system, or the system may use hardware (e.g.
   sensors or scanners) inside the cabinet to detect when re-stocking has occurred. The re
   stock log may be used to show that obligations to comply with legislated health and safety
 3 precautionary requirements are being met by the provision of a regularly re-stocked
   medical supply cabinet.
            In some embodiments the system may interface with an independent time and/or
   date reference for logged events, to ensure the accuracy of time and date data. For
   example the system may receive co-ordinated universal time (UTC) data from an external
 5 source. Reference to an official source of time and date information may permit the log to
   be used for evidential purposes such as mandatory health and safety reporting and/or in
   court proceedings where health and safety liability is at issue.
            The system preferably comprises or communicates with sensors 13 positioned on
   or inside the cabinet 1 to monitor the inventory levels therein, for example as shown in
 3 Figure 2. Sensors 13 of the cabinet are used to be able to determine when an item is taken
   from the cabinet 1 or placed inside the cabinet 1. The sensors 13 are connected to a
   processor that may incorporate software to record at least one or more of:
   a)       what item(s) was/were taken,
   b)       the number of such items taken,
.5 c)       when the item(s) was/were taken, and
   d)       what item(s) was/were added to the cabinet,
   e)       the number of such items added,
   f)       when the item(s) was/were added, and
   g)       the cabinet being accessed but no items were taken or added.
 0          It is preferable that the system will create a transaction record of anyone or more
   of these and may associate the image, footage and/or audio data, or fingerprint
   scanner/reader data with such a transaction record in order to provide information relating
   to the identity of the person associated with the particular record. In some embodiments
   the system may also be able to identify the person who is associated with that particular
 5 record, for example with reference to a data record of individuals known to use the cabinet
   (for example a database of known user fingerprints), or by access codes used to open the
   cabinet.

                                                  - 29
             The sensors 13 allow a real time determination to be made of stock levels in the
   cabinet 1.
             One or more of the sensors may be associated with the door 3 of the cabinet, and
   serve to detect when the door is opened and/or closed. One or more other sensors 13 may
 5 be associated with various compartments 5 and/or stock item bays 6 in the containment
   area 2.
             In the preferred form, at least some of the sensors 13 are load sensors that
   determine the weight of stock bearing on the sensors 13. For example the sensors 13 may
   include micro switches, force sensing resistors or strain gauges. At least one item 14 or a
 3 collection of items that are preferably consolidated such as in a container or pack 15 are
   each located on a load sensor 13 in the containment area 2.
             In the preferred form (for example as shown in Figures 2 and 3), there is a
   plurality of load sensors, each associated with a particular bay 6, or an item 14, or a
   collection of items. In the preferred form containers 15 are provided to carry a collection of
 5 items in a consolidated manner. A container 15 may contain a selection of items for use in
   treating burns or cuts etc. Alternatively, each item of the collection inside the container 15
   may be of a standard size and/or type and/or weight, for example the container 15 may
   hold a plurality of bandages or a plurality of sticking plasters.
             In the preferred embodiment each item 14 or container of items 15 is associated
 3 with one load sensor 13. A plurality of containers 15 of the same type may be associated
   with one load sensor 13 (for example as a stack of containers 15 as seen in Figure 3). The
   sensor 13 can detect changes in the load it is receiving as items 14 or packs 15 are taken
   from or added to the cabinet. If a pack 15 is returned to the cabinet 1 with fewer items
   inside of it, the sensor will detect this too. Because the load on the sensor 13 prior to a
.5 transaction is known by the system, the detected loading subsequent to the transaction
   can be used to calculate how many items have been removed or added during the
   transaction.
             The system may include or refer to a database containing pre-recorded
   information about the items stocked in the cabinet. For example, the database may contain
 0 a record indicating that the weight of a sticking plaster is twenty grams, and that there are
   ten plasters in a box. The system can use the output from a load sensor beneath the box
   of sticking plasters to detect that the box, having been removed from the cabinet, was
   forty grams lighter once replaced. The system can process this output to deduce that two
   plasters have been removed since the cabinet was last restocked with a new box of
 5 plasters, and that there are now only eight plasters left for others to use.
             A person skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative means of counting or
   calculating the number of items removed or added could be employed, for example by the
   use of optical sensors or indexing mechanisms.

             Other information may be input into the system and/or logged as part of the stock
   monitoring functionality. For example, there may be means for the system to monitor
   stock expiry dates. The system may, in turn, generate and output notifications when an
   item of stock has expired or is close to expiry.
             For example, in some embodiments the expiry date for a particular item may be
   entered into the system as an external input (e.g. by a distributor/supplier at the time of
   re-stocking), or the system may be able to ascertain the expiry date by referring to a
   database containing product information associated with stocked items. As a further
   example, the system may be able to calculate the expected expiry date for a particular
 3 item based on a record of the date that the item was added to the cabinet. The record of
   the date that the item was added to the cabinet may have been entered as an input by the
   person who re-stocked the cabinet or may have been generated in response to sensor
   information from inside the cabinet indicating that new stock had been added.
             In alternative embodiments there may be scanners or readers inside the cabinet 1
 5 which are able to obtain expiry date information directly from one or more items. For
   example, a scanner may be able to scan visual indicia displayed on the package of an item
   which indicates its expiry date and relay this to the system for recording.
             In preferred embodiments the cabinet 1 has a series of visual and/or audible
   indicators to provide information about the stock levels of supplies in the cabinet. An
 3 indicator 16, such as an LED light visible from the exterior of the cabinet 1, may be used to
   give an overall indication of inventory status. For example an LED light may glow green if
   all supplies are present in quantities above a specified minimum limit, orange if some of
   the supplies are nearing minimum levels, or red if there are supplies in the cabinet 1 which
   need replenishing.
.5           Similarly there may be indicators 17 inside the cabinet 1 to indicate stock levels.
   Preferably each indicator 17 is associated with a particular stock item bay 6, so as to
   attract attention when that stock item needs replenishing and/or as a guide to the person
   carrying out the replenishment.
             In some embodiments the sensors 13 can be used to detect when a particular item
 0 has been used and replaced inside the cabinet 1. In this embodiment, one or more
   indicators 18 may be used to indicate that an item is 'used' or 'not sterile'. A person
   replenishing the cabinet 1 may need to reset the indicator 18 when clean or new
   equipment is added to the cabinet 1.
             In some embodiments of the present invention, such as that shown in Figure 5,
 5 there may be features of the cabinet 1 which assist a user in quickly and/or correctly
   identifying items contained by the cabinet that are appropriate for treating a particular
   type of injury. A user may be able to indicate a particular type of injury for which

                                                  - 31
   treatment is required (for example by way of a manual input device 21 such as a keyboard
   or a series of press buttons), and this may cause one or more of:
             a)     visual or audible indicators 22 inside the cabinet 1 to be activated in order to
   indicate the location of items which are suitable for treating that injury, and
             b)     a text, image or video display on a screen 23 which provides instructions or
   information pertaining to advisable treatment of the injury,
             c)     an audible message played through speaker 24 to convey information
   pertaining to advisable treatment of the injury.
             For example, the user may be able to select from a series of press buttons 21,
 3 each press button being associated with a different type of injury selected from burns, cuts
   or contusions, in order to indicate that treatment for a burn injury is required. This input
   may cause LED indicators 22 positioned above particular bays 6 of the cabinet 1 to be lit,
   those particular bays 6 being ones which are designated to receive items suitable for
   treating burns. Also, or alternatively, the press button input may trigger a check list of
 5 points for the user to consider when treating the burn injury to be displayed on the screen
   23. The screen 23 may be mounted inside the cabinet 1 and/or on a door of the cabinet.
             In further embodiments the cabinet 1 comprises a communication system 26 to
   facilitate communication between a user and a person who may be able to offer support
   and/or advice pertaining to injury treatment, for example as shown in Figure 6. In
 3 preferred embodiments the communication system 26 includes a screen 23, speaker 24,
   microphone 9, optionally a camera 7, a transmitter for transmitting information from the
   microphone 9 and camera (if present) and a receiver for receiving information to be fed to
   the screen 23 and speaker 24. In some embodiments a single device 25 may act as both a
   transmitter and a receiver. Preferably the transmitter/receiver 25 is communicable with a
.5 further transmitter/ receiver 28 at a remote station 27 so as to provide a video
   conferencing functionality whereby the cabinet user can communicate via a video link with
   a support person/advisor at the remote station 27.
             The communication system 26 may include software for processing inputs and
   outputs from other components of the communication system 26 and from the remote
 0 station 27. Communication between the communication system 26 and the remote station
   27 may be wireless or cabled, and preferably occurs via an internet or network connection.
             For example, as shown in Figure 6, the press button 21 may be pressed to initiate
   a video call that the treatment advisor stationed at the remote station 27 can answer. In
   some embodiments the cabinet mounted camera 7 (either as shown in Figure 1 or in
 5 Figure 5) may be used to obtain images or video feed of the injury that can be fed via the
   transmitter 25 to the remote station 27, and preferably the microphone 9 also picks up an
   audio feed from the injury site. Preferably the remote station 27 also includes a screen 29
   to display the images or video feed, and a speaker 30 to project the audio feed. The

                                                - 32
   remote station 27 preferably has a microphone 31 that the advisor can speak into, and/or
   a manual input (e.g. a keyboard) which the advisor can operate in order to provide advice
   to be relayed back to the cabinet user through the cabinet communication system 26. This
   may include the delivery of text, images or video to be displayed by the screen 23 and/or
 5 the delivery of audible information to be projected from the speaker 24.
            In some embodiments, for example as shown in Figure 7, the cabinet 1 may
   further comprise a portable device 32 able to be worn or mounted upon a user 33 of the
   cabinet 1 during the treatment of an injury at an injury site 34 which is remote from the
   cabinet 1. Preferably the portable device 32 is adapted and configured to be worn or
 3 mounted on the head of the user 33, and for example, may take the form of a headset,
   goggles, glasses, a headband or a helmet.
            The portable device 32 is preferably able to obtain visual and audible data, such as
   images, video and audio which can be used to assist a support person or advisor at a
   remote station 27 in assessing the injury that has occurred at the injury site 34 and
 5 providing advice on injury treatment accordingly. The advisor can then use the
   components of the remote station 27 (as described above in respect of Figure 6) to
   communicate with the user 33 at the injury site 34, either by output which is sent directly
   to the device 32 worn by the user 33, or via the transmitter/receiver 25 of the cabinet 1.
             Preferably the portable device 32 has at least one device for obtaining information
 3 at the injury site 34, and also comprises a transmitter 37 to transmit information from the
   injury site 34. The information obtaining device may be a camera 35 and/or a microphone
   36. Preferably the portable device 32 further comprises one or more of a receiver 37 to
   receive inputs from the other components of the communication system 26 and/or the
   remote station 27, and an information delivery device to present or deliver information to
.5 the user carrying the device 32. A suitable information delivery device may be a speaker
   38 to project an audio feed to the user 33, or a display screen may be used. Preferably the
   portable device 32 has an onboard power supply such as a battery.
             Preferably the data obtaining device 32 has an onboard transmitter and/or
   receiver to enable communication with one or more other components of the
 0 communication system 26 of the cabinet. Preferably this communication is by way of a
   wireless connection. Preferably the transmitter 27 of the portable device 32 sends
   information to the receiver 25 of the communication system 26, or in some embodiments it
   may transmit directly to the receiver 28 of the remote station 27. Outputs transmitted
   from the remote station 27 and/or cabinet mounted components of the communication
 5 system 26 can be received by the receiver 37 of the device 32, and relayed to the user 33.
             Preferably the portable device 32 has associated software which may be used to
   process data before it is transmitted or after it is received. The processing may occur
   before the information is relayed to the user by the information delivery device.

                                                 - 33
             Preferably the data feeds to and from the portable device 32 are continuous and in
   real time.
             For example, as shown in Figure 7, a video stream captured by camera 35 at the
   injury site 34 can be sent to the remote station 27 and displayed on the screen 29 in real
 5 time. The advisor at the remote station 27 can use the video feed to assess the injury. The
   advisor can speak into the microphone 31 to provide instructions as to how the injury
   should be treated. The audio feed from the microphone 31 can be transmitted back to the
   user mounted device 32, and projected from the ear piece speaker 38 to the user 33.
                   Preferably the portable device 32 is stored inside cabinet 1, and when

   communication system 26 of the cabinet. Preferably there are sensors of the cabinet 1
   which can detect when the portable device 32 has been uplifted from the cabinet 1 for use.
   Preferably the connection is established when a sensor output indicates that the device 32
   has been uplifted.
 5          In some embodiments, such as those shown in Figures 6 and 7, one or more of
   the remote station 27, the communication system 26 and the portable device 32 comprise
   or communicate with a data storage medium, preferably an electronic data storage
   medium, and preferably being a storage medium of a data storage device 10 such as a
   network, hard drive or "the cloud". Preferably information from the remote station 27
 3 and/or communication system 26 and/or portable device 32 can be stored on the device
   10 and accessed electronically to create a log of injury incidents, including information
   about the injury sustained and how it was treated. This can be used for reporting, auditing
   or evidential purposes, and may also be used in the production of training or educational
   resources.
.5           Preferably the data storage device 10 is part of, or is integrated with, the
   previously described system for recording activity of the cabinet. Thus information
   regarding a particular injury incident can be associated with a transaction record, along
   with the information relating to the user of the cabinet for that transaction, the time and
   date of the transaction, and the items used from the cabinet in that transaction.
