       6-SUBSTITUTED ESTRADIOL DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF
                                  ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
   [0001]  This application claims priority to and the benefit of provisional patent
  application ser. no. 61/955,578 filed March 19, 2014, the entirety of which is
  incorporated herein by reference.
  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
  [0002] The present invention relates to a method of treating Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
  with 6-substituted estradiol compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or
  prodrugs. The compounds provide for up-regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and/or
  apoliprotein C2 (ApoC2), the protein that activates LPL.
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
  [0003]   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which
 primarily affects the elderly. There are two forms of AD, early-onset and late-onset.
 Early-onset AD is rare, strikes susceptible individuals as early as the third decade, and is
 frequently associated with mutations in a small set of genes. Late onset, or spontaneous
 AD is common, strikes in the seventh or eighth decade, and is a multifactorial disease
 with many genetic risk factors.      Late-onset AD is the leading cause of dementia in
 persons over the age of 65. An estimated 7-10% of the American population over 65, and
 up to 40% of the American population greater than 80 years of age is afflicted with AD.
 Early in the disease, patients experience loss of memory and orientation. As the disease
progresses, additional cognitive functions become impaired, until the patient is
completely incapacitated.
 [0004] It has been widely accepted that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (AP) peptides
in the brain extracellular space and alteration in Ap molecular composition are critical for
developing synaptic and cognitive deficits in AD. AP is produced by sequential limited
proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two aspartyl proteases, beta and
gamma-secretases.     Proteolysis by gamma-secretase is the last processing step resulting
in release of AP,     Normally, gamma-secretase cleavage results in AP proteins of 40
                                             1(a)

  amino acids in length (A040) and 42 amino acids in length (Ap42), the latter being the
  predominant species in senile plaques (Iwatsubo, T., et al, 1994 Neuron 13, 45-53). The
  AO     levels   are   determined    by    the   balance    between      its  production   and
  degradation/clearance, and an attenuated AP catabolism is suggested to cause Ap
  accumulation in aging brains (Tanzi, R. E., et al, 2004 Neuron 43, 605-608).         Previous
  studies have shown that astrocytes and microglia directly take up and degrade Ap42
  (Wyss-Coray, T., et al, 2003 Nat. Med. 9, 453-457; Jiang, Q., et al. 2008 Neuron 58, 681-693)
  and that AP degradation occurs in endosomal-lysosomal compartments (Majumdar, A., et
  al, 2007 Mol Biol. Cell 18, 1490-1496; Mandrekar, S., 2009 J Neurosci. 29, 4252-4262).
  [0005] Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides and mediates
 the cellular uptake of lipoproteins by functioning as a "bridging molecule" between
 lipoproteins and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or lipoprotein receptors in blood
 vessels (Williams, K. J., et al, 1992 . Biol Chem. 267, 13284-13292; Mulder, M., et al,
  1993 . Biol. Chem. 268, 9369-9375). Sulfated GAGs are side chains of proteoglycans
 normally found in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface in the peripheral
 tissues, e.g. adipose, heart and skeletal muscle tissue, and brain. The role of LPL in the
 brain is, to date, unknown.
 [0006] Interestingly, it has been shown that LPL is accumulated in senile plaques of AD
 brains (Rebeck, G. W., et al, 1995 Ann. NeuroL 37, 211-217).                 Moreover, single
 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of the LPL gene are associated
with disease incidence in clinically diagnosed AD subjects, LPL mRNA expression level,
brain cholesterol level, and the severity of AD pathologies, including neurofibrillary
tangles and senile plaque density (Blain, J. F., et al, 2006 Eur, J. Neurosci. 24, 1245
 1251). These results suggest that LPL may have a physiological role in the brain, whose
alternation is associated with the pathogenesis of AD,
[0007] Recently, researchers carried out experiments to determine whether LPL interacts with
AP to promote AP cellular uptake and degradation in astrocytes, and found evidence that LPL
forms a complex with AP and facilitates A0 cell surface binding and uptake in mouse primary
astrocytes through a mechanism that is dependent on heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate
GAG chains, leading to the lysosomal degradation of AP (Nishitsuji, K., et al, 2011 J. Riol.
                                                2

   Chem. 286(8), 6393-6401). In addition, it was found that enhanced cyclin-dependent kinase 5
   (CDK5) activity contributed to LPL up-regulation and promoted AP phagocytosis in
  microglia, whereas inhibition of CDK5 reduced LPL expression and Ap internalization.
  Thus, a viable treatment for AD is the up-regulation of LPL (and/or ApoC2, or apoliprotein C2,
  the protein that activates LPL).  To this end, compounds such as statins have been shown to
  stimulate LPL activity and therefore perhaps could play a role in the pathogenesis of AD
  (Schoonjans, K., et al, 1999 FEBS Lett 452, 160-164; Mead, J, et a], 2002 J. Mol Med. 80, 753
  769).
  [00081 This would be a significant improvement over current treatment of AD. The
  only drugs to treat AD on the market today, Aricept.RTM.,                      Cognex.RTM.,
  Reminyl.RTM. and Exelon.RTM. are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs do not
  address the underlying pathology of AD. They merely enhance the effectiveness of those
 nerve cells still able to function and only provide symptomatic relief from the disease.
  Since the disease continues, the benefits of these treatments are slight.
  [0009] Accordingly, disclosed herein are certain 6-substituted estradiol derivatives that
 provide for the up-regulation of LPL (and/or ApoC2). This is found surprising in that
 estrogen itself has previously been reported to markedly decrease the amounts of fat
 accumulation and LPL mRNA as well as triglyceride accumulation in genetically
 manipulated 3T3-LI adipocytes stably expressing the estrogen receptor (ER) (Homma,
 H., et al, 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275(15), 11404-11411.         As presented below, the instant
 disclosures proved a different and surprising approach for the treatment of AD, thereby
 addressing the deficiencies presented in the prior art.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0010] In light of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
method of treating a patient with Alzheimer's Disease comprising administering to a
patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a 6-substituted estradiol
derivative. The 6-substituted estradiol derivatives of the invention provide for the up
regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and/or apoliprotein C2 (ApoC2).              It will be
understood by those skilled in the art that one or more aspects of this invention can meet
certain objectives, while one or more other aspects can meet certain other objectives.

  [0048] The compounds of the methods of the invention are prepared as described in
 U.S.S.N. 12/627,874 (incorporated herein by reference) and pertain to a method for
 preparing a 6-hydroxymethyl, 6-alkoxyalkyl, 6-alkylthioalkyl, 6-aminomethoxy, 6
 methylaminomethoxy, or 6-methoxyamine derivatives of estradiol. Reaction schemes for
 preparing estradiol derivatives is given below, Schemes 1-3. Such methods can comprise
 reaction     of      a      t-butyldimethylsily   derivative     of     estradiol    with
 LIDAKOR/THF/formaldehyde to obtain a 6-hydroxylated compound followed by such
 steps as: (i) hydrolysis to obtain 6-hydroxymethyl derivative of estradiol; and/or (ii)
treatment with dimethylsulfate followed by hydrolysis to obtain 6-methyloxymethyl
 derivative of estradiol. Compound I can be obtained by further oxidation of compound 3
at the C-17 hydroxyl position.        Compound 33 and other dimethyl compounds can be
prepared according to U.S.S.N. 13/232,798 (incorporated herein by reference).
[0049] In an alternative approach, the compounds of the present invention can also be
prepared by a method comprising such steps as: (i) protecting an estrodial compound, (ii)
acylating   the    protected    estradiol compound   at  the benzylic      6-position with
LIDAKOR/Butyl-Lithium/Diisopropylamine/potassium          tert-amylate, (iii) reducing the
position 6 aldehyde with lithium aluminum hydride, (iv) deprotecting the protected
regions of the estradiol compound. A reaction scheme for preparing estradiol derivatives
is given below in Scheme 2.

[0054] As noted herein, the salts of the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic
"pharmaceutically acceptable salts." Other salts may, however, be useful in the
preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. When the compounds of the present invention contain a basic group,
                                                             23

   salts encompassed within the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to non-toxic
  salts which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or
  inorganic acid, Representative salts include any such salt known in the art.        Where
  compounds of the present invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically
  acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium or potassium salts;
  alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with
  suitable organic ligands, e.g., quaternary ammonium salts.
  [0055] As noted herein, the compounds of the present invention can be used in
  combination with other agents or other agents which will enhance the treatment regime
  for the mammalian subject. For example, the compounds of the methods could be used in
  combination with other estrogen receptor-p modulators. The individual components of
 such combinations can be administered separately at different times during the course of
 therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms to patients or regions of
 such patients in need of such therapy. The instant invention is therefore to be understood
 as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term
 "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly. It will be understood that the scope of
 combinations of the compounds of this invention with other agents useful to treat the
 targeted disease includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical
 composition useful for treating disorders related to estrogen functioning.
 [0056] The following non-limiting examples and data illustrate various aspects and
 features relating to the compounds, compositions and/or methods of the present
 invention, including the synthesis of 6-substituted estradiol derivatives, as are available
 though the methodologies described herein. In comparison with the prior art, the present
compounds and methods provide results and data which are surprising, unexpected and
contrary thereto. While the utility of this invention is illustrated through the preparation
and use of several compounds, moieties and/or substituents thereof, it will be understood
by those skilled in the art that comparable results are obtainable with various other
compounds, moieties and/or substituents, as are commensurate with the scope of this
invention.
[0057] As noted above, the compounds of the methods are prepared according the
procedures disclosed in U.S.S.N. 12/627,874 and U.S.S.N. 13/232,798. To exemplify the

  Example 2
  Methods for Preparing Compounds 3 and 4
  [0070] As outlined in Scheme 2, estradiol derivatives compounds 3 and 4 are
  synthesized in the following manner. The protected estradiol compound is prepared by
  reaction of   p-estradiol    with dihydropyran in THF, using toluenesulfonic acid or
  camphorsulfonic acid as catalyst. As one of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate, this
  reaction is an equilibrium reaction and does not go to completion under such conditions.
 Thus, both the mono-protected estradiols can be found in the reaction mixture. Such
 crude reaction mixture undergoes a trituration step with acetonitrile causing the desired
 bis-THP estradiol to crystallize in approximately 70 %yield.
 [0071] As shown in Scheme 2, the key intermediate is obtained via acylation at the
 benzylic 6-position with the strong base mixture referred to as LiDAKOR: butyl lithium,
 diisopropylamine, and potassium tert-amylate. Under such conditions at -70 *C, one of
 ordinary skill in the art can appreciate the abstraction of a proton at a benzylic position.
 The intermediate is then purified by column chromatography to give a syrup in
 approximately 50 % yield, still containing minor impurities and column solvents.
 Reduction of the aldehyde with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride results in high
yields of the racemic hydroxymethyl estradiol compound.
 [0072] For purposes of preparing compounds 3 and 4, the methoxymethyl compound is
prepared by methylation of hydroxymethyl estradiol compound with sodium hydride and
methyl iodide. The methoxymethyl compound is purified by column chromatography to
give a glassy foam. Deprotecting the protected groups give racemic 6-methoxymethyl
estradiol compound. Separation of the enantiomers is performed using chiral preparative
HPLC to give the compounds 3 and 4. For compound 4, a chiral purity of >95:5 R:S is
realized. For compound 3, a chiral purity of 86:14 S:R is realized. It is well within the
level of one of ordinary skill in the art to employ NMR for determination of the absolute
stereochemistry of the 6-position, where the 4-and 6-protons are diagnostic.

  Expression Profiling of Compounds in Lung, Pancreas, and Ovarian Tumor Cell Lines
  [0073] The study includes three human tumor cell lines: A549, Pane-], and SK-OV-3.
  The lines are each grown in two flasks cultured to roughly 40% confluence. One of the
  flasks is treated by addition of compound to the culture media at a various concentrations,
  i.e. 10 gM, 20 gM 50 pM, or 100 gM. The other, mock treated, flask is treated only with
  the vehicle used to solubilize and deliver the drug. RNA extracted from the pairs of
  treated and untreated samples is subjected to microarray analysis on Agilent Whole
  Human Genome Microarrays (G4112F).             Each analysis reports the difference in
  abundance of messenger RNAs for each of the 41,000 specific mRNA detectors on the
 array. This direct comparison of the treated versus untreated samples for each cell line
 provides extremely sensitive detection of changes in mRNA abundance resulting from
 the drug treatment. As each cell line comparison is self-normalized, the results can be
 compared across the samples with high confidence.
 Cell Preparation
 [0074] Three human tumor cell lines, A549, Panc-l, and SK-OV-3, are each grown in
 two flasks cultured to roughly 40% confluence. One of the flasks is treated by addition
of compound to the culture media at concentrations of 10 IiM, 50 pM and 100 pM. The
other, mock treated, flask is treated only with the vehicle used to solubilize and deliver
the drug. All flasks are cultured for a further 24 hours, and then the cells are scraped free
and washed in ice-cold PBS, then collected by centrifugation. The harvested cells are
immediately frozen, and stored at -80 C or colder.
RNA Purification
[0075] Total RNA is prepared from the frozen tissue samples using Trizol-based cell
lysis followed by 650 C hot phenol extraction and RNeasy chromatography purification.
The purified RNA samples are analyzed spectrophotometrically.          The concentration of
RNA is determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (A260). Given an absorbance
of 1 unit at 260 nm corresponds to 35 [Lg of RNA per ml when measured at pH 11.
                                             30

   RNA Quality Assessment - A260/A280 Absorbance Ratios
   [0076] The ratio of the readings at 260 nm and 280 nm (A260/A280) provides an
  estimate of the purity of RNA with respect to contaminants that absorb UV, such as
  protein.   RNA has a theoretical A260/A280 ratio (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) of
  approximately 2. 1. Extracted RNAs having an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8 or greater provide
  excellent results in this assay.
 RNA QualityAssessment - Capillary Electrophoresis
  [0077] The RNA is tested for relative integrity by determining the ratio of intact 28S
  and ISS ribosomal RNAs, using capillary electrophoresis (Agilent BioAnalyzer).
 Completely intact RNA has a 28S/18S ratio of 2.2. All RNAs accepted for array analysis
 have ratios exceeding 1, the minimal 28S/18S ratio for reliably reproducible microarray
 results as determined by review of internal reproducibility among samples with varying
 28S/18S ratios.
 Probe Productionand Chip Hybridization
 [0078] All RNAs are labeled using 1 microgram of RNA as input to an Agilent Low
 Input Labeling reaction.
 [0079] Test RNA is labeled with Cy5 (650 nm emitter) and reference RNA is labeled
with Cy3 (550 nm emitter) nucleotides.          Labeling, hybridizations and subsequent
washings are carried out on Agilent HJAv2 human expression chips.             The resulting
hybridized chips are scanned on an Agilent microarray scanner, and intensity information
for each detector spot is extracted from the scanned image using Agilent feature
extraction software.
[0080] The most telling test of the quality of the hybridization is the level of variance in
reported ratios from. the large number of duplicates of genes printed on these chips. A set
of gene probes is each printed ten times in random positions across the array. The
median value of the standard deviation of the log 2 ratio across all the sets is used as an
estimator of the overall standard deviation across the entire array.
                                            31

  Data and Analysis
  [0081] The key data for all three hybridizations is collected in a FileMaker Pro
  relational database to allow for easy formulation of searches that can identify genes that
  exhibit particular transcriptional patterns.   The data reported are the red (treated) and
  green (untreated) background-subtracted signals. This is the least modified form of the
  data. A background "surface" is estimated across the slide, based on numerous probes
  that are not complementary to human DNA.          These serve as estimators of both non
  specific binding of labeled cRNA to array surfaces and non-specific binding of labeled
  cRNA to the immobilized DNA oligomers. Using this information, local noise around
  each probe is estimated and this is subtracted from the signal found at the area of
 oligonucleotide deposition for each particular probe feature on the array (gBGSubSignal,
 rBGSubSignal). The ratio of signal from the RNA of the treated cell and the RNA of the
  untreated cell is reported both as a direct ratio and as the log2 ratio (Ratio, Log2Ratio).
 Ratios are determined in an iterative process that normalizes the intensities in each
 channel, so that a scalar is found that maximizes the similarity of intensities of the large
 number of genes that have nearly identical transcriptional levels, and thus should have
 ratios very close to 1.
 [0082] After the ratios have been calculated for the normalized data, the various control
 and duplicate samples arc analyzed to build a model of how reproducible the results arc,
 and how this reproducibility is varies depending on signal strength and noise. With these
 parameters, an estimate of the likelihood that each ratio could have arisen if the red and
 green intensities are randomly drawn from a single process that produced the same
 distribution of intensities is produced. This probability is reported for each sample and is
a measure of the probability that the ratio indicates a difference between the treated and
untreated signal strengths (PValLogRatio). This probability can be used to threshold the
results into changed and unchanged genes. In the database, a threshold of p < 0.001 is
used as the cut point for significant change in mRNA abundance between the treated and
untreated sample (SigO.001).        This threshold reduces the number of expected false
positives to a reasonable level given the -40,000 ratios that are being surveyed in each
assay. A field that indicates significant change and the direction of the change relative to
the untreated sample reduces the result of the assay to a trinary categorical; 1, up
                                               32

  regulated relative to untreated, 0, unchanged relative to untreated and -1, down regulated
 relative to untreated (Tri). Using this representation, one easily constructs searches that
  identify genes that have changed in any single or multiple sets of experiments.
  [0083] The gene expression data found in Table 1 below shows that compound 4 and
 compound 21 up-regulate the LPL and ApoC2 genes, but not the ApoC3 gene.                           Gene
 expression values shown in Table I are log2 values and an average of data obtained from
 three human tumor cell lines (SKOV-3, A549 and Panc-1). A significant change in gene
 expression is p S 0.001. Gene IDs conform to standards developed at the National Center
 for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for the Entrez Gene database.
