1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003]       This invention relates generally to the discovery of novel mixed transition metal iron
(HI/II) catalysts for the extraction of oxygen from C02 and the selective reaction with organic
compounds.
2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     2.1. Introduction
[0004]       The use of CO 2 as a chemical feedstock or an oxidant is an appealing strategy for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions especially if technologies currently being developed to
remove CO2 from fossil fuel fired power plant exhaust gases lead to abundant, high purity, carbon
dioxide feedstocks. If the CO2 gas streams can be used as reactants in processes which yield more
energetic products, such as fuels or value-added intemediates, then the original carbon in the
fossil fuel would be recovered for utilization in another application. Exemplary pathways exist for
converting carbon-dioxide to products which can be used in the energy industry for fuel or by the
chemical industry for chemical feedstock. These include char gasification to make carbon
monoxide from carbon dioxide and carbon, carbon dioxide methanation to make methane from
carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and carbon dioxide reforming to make carbon monoxide and
hydrogen from carbon dioxide and methane. See, for example Kolb and Kolb, 1983, J Chem Ed
60(1) 57-59 "Organic Chemicals from Carbon Dioxide." Others have reported on studies of CO2
as a reagent for organic synthesis. See Colmenares, 2010, Current Organic Synthesis 7(6) 533-542
"Novel Trends in the Utilization of CO2 as a Reagent and Mild Oxidant in the C-C Coupling
Reactions."    The potential for the upgrading of carbon dioxide through industrial processes has
been investigated for over the past one hundred years.

[0008]        In particular non-limiting embodiments, the present invention provides a mixed
transition metal iron (IIIII) catalyst for catalyzing CO 2 oxidation of carbon or an organic
compound. In one embodiment, the mixed transition metal iron (Il/Ill) catalyst is an iron (W/Il)
and a transition metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Bi, Co, Cu, La, Mn, Sn, Sr, Ru,
and Zn. The mixed transition metal iron (II/III) catalyst may further comprise a support and/or an
alkali or alkaline-earth element promoter. The support may be A12O3, SiO 2 , TiO 2 , ZrO2 or a
mixture thereof.
[0009]        The mixed transition metal iron (II/III) catalyst may have the formula Fe2O3(SnO2)o.1
io(A 203 )a m.mo or the formula Fe2O3(SnO2)I o0-o(A 203).a3o.
[0010]        Alternatively, the mixed transition metal iron (II/Ill) catalyst may have the formula
(RuO2).oo 0 o.2Fe 2O 3, or (RuO2).0o5.o.o5Fe203.
[0011]        The invention also provides a method for converting CO2 and carbon to carbon
monoxide which comprises contacting the mixed transition metal iron (II/Ill) catalyst with an
appropriate C02 feed stream under appropriate conditions.           The mixed transition metal iron
(i/Ill) catalyst, and the appropriate CO 2 feed stream may be reacted together at the same time in a
suitable reactor such as a fluidized bed.
[0012]        In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for converting a hydrocarbon
to an oxygenated hydrocarbon which comprises contacting the mixed transition iron (II/III) metal
catalyst with the hydrocarbon and an appropriate C02 feed stream under appropriate conditions so

as to form the oxygenated hydrocarbon. In some embodiments the catalyst may be combined with
reactants which are fed simultaneously to a reaction zone. In other embodiments the catalyst itself
may be transported between reaction zones containing separate reactant feed streams.
[0013]     The hydrocarbon may be an alkane, an alkene, an alkyne, an aromatic compound, a
cyclic compound, a polyaromatic compound or a polycyclic compound. The oxygenated
hydrocarbon may be an alcohol, aldehyde, an anhydride, a carboxylic acid, an ester, an ether, an
epoxide, or a ketone. In one embodiment, the epoxide is ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.
[0014]     The invention also provides a method for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of a first
hydrocarbon comprises contacting the mixed transition iron (11/III) metal catalyst with the first
hydrocarbon and an appropriate CO2 feed stream under appropriate conditions so as to form a
dehydrogenated second hydrocarbon. The first hydrocarbon may be an alkane, an alkene, an
alkyne, an aromatic compound, a cyclic compound, a polyaromatic compound or a polycyclic
compound. For this method, the first hydrocarbon is methane and the second hydrocarbon is
ethane or a higher molecular weight hydrocarbon. For this method the first hydrocarbon can be
methane or any other saturated hydrocarbon and the second hydrocarbon product contains carbon
atoms in which there are fewer carbon-hydrogen bonds when compared to the first hydrocarbon.
[0015]     In the methods above, the alkane may be butane, ethane, methane, or propane; the
alkene may be ethylene or propylene; aromatic compound may be ethyl benzene; or the cyclic
compound may be cyclohexane.

5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0041]     This invention provides specific mixed-metal oxides have been developed which can
remove anoxygen from C02 and utilize the oxygen for the production of higher-value oxygenated,
or oxidized, products. In their reduced forms, the mixed-metal oxides have been shown to remove
oxygen from the strong carbon- oxygen bond of CO2 (bond dissociation energy = -803 kJ/mol).
                                                 4

 WO 2015/020862                                                            PCT/US2014/049007
The mixed-metal oxide is shown to facilitate transfer of the abstracted oxygen to other substrates
and is catalytic in deoxygenation and oxygen transfer. The catalyst is shown to be able to transfer
the abstracted oxygen to carbon-based reductants in several oxidation states such as carbon (C(s),
e.g. pet coke), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4). The catalyst will be useful for
utilization of CO2 for the production of C1 oxygenate from pet coke and char, for the utilization of
CO 2 as an oxygen source for selective hydrocarbon oxidations, dehydrogenations, and oxidative
coupling, and for upgrading low-value hydrocarbons to higher-value or more useful products.
[0042]      Several materials have been developed which catalyze the Reverse-Boudouard
reaction for the production of CO from C02 and carbon in a reactor system operated at 800*C. We
have shown conclusively that the catalyst materials operate by a catalyst-mediated extraction of
oxygen from carbon dioxide to the reduced catalyst surface. The removal of oxygen from CO2 is
followed by transfer of the oxygen to a different carbon atom, and works for carbon in reduced
oxidation states such as C(O), C(-2), or C(-4) , as shown in Figure 1.
[0043]      The potential for the upgrading of carbon dioxide through industrial processes has
been investigated over the course of the past one hundred years. Historically attractive energy
applications have included production of methanol from C02 by methane reforming (Camol
process), methane production by hydrogenation of C02 (Sabatier reaction), and production of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reforming C02 with methane. Carbon dioxide can be
combined with carbon and transformed into carbon monoxide by the Reverse-Boudouard reaction
in a reaction which is thermodynamically favored at high temperature (900*C). Several
researchers have explored catalysts for the Reverse-Boudouard reaction in the past. Among them,
some have explored the oxidation and reduction of iron on elemental carbon supports and
impregnated in coal. Alkali carbonates have also been used to catalyze char gasification by CO2.
Others have studied binary alkali-iron and alkaline-earth-iron mixed metal oxide systems and
shown them to catalyze the formation of CO from carbon dioxide and chars. While other mixed
metal oxides with nickel, ceria, and zirconia have been recently explored for carbon dioxide
utilization by reforming to synthesis gas and by methanation, mixed metal oxides containing
Group 8 metals and reducible oxides of p-block metals, specifically tin, have not been reported for
the gasification of carbon with CO2
[0044]      In one embodiment, this invention provides SnO2Fe2O3A1203 as a catalyst family for
deoxygenation of CO 2 and utilization of the oxygen from CO 2 with other carbon reductants to
produce valuable chemicals and fuels.

[0050]       As used herein the term "mixed transition metal iron (11/111) catalyst" means Fe*2 or
Fe*l mixed with a second metal which may be (i) a d-block element, IUPAC Groups 3-12; (ii) a
"post-transition" metal (Al, Ga, In, Sn, T1, Pb, Bi, Po); or an f-block element such as a lanthanide
or actinide, sometimes referred as to as an "inner transition metal"; or a combination of (i), (ii) or

The term includes various oxidized forms of Fe including reactive species generated in situ such
as Fe0 or Fe+' in the catalyst. Mixed transition metal iron (11111) catalysts are ionic materials; that

[0059]          The reduction temperatures are the range of temperatures at which the materials can be
reduced by hydrogen gas or carbon monoxide gas to make reactive reduced catalysts. The
reduction capacity is the percentage of the mass which is decreased by the removal of oxygen
from the catalyst. The oxidation temperature is the temperature range in which the reduced
material is reoxidized by carbon dioxide.
[0060]          The catalytic reaction can be carried out in a variety of different types of reactors.
Preferably, the reactor is a fluid-type reactor, such as a fluidized bed or a transport reactor. In one
embodiment, a riser reactor may be used. The C02 and carbon and/or organic starting materials
may be provided to the reactor at a defined rate - e.g., a rate such that the residence time is less
than defined time, such as about 5 seconds or less.
[0061]          Preferably, the reactor used is one that is capable of achieving the necessary conditions
to form a specific reaction product. Specifically, it can be beneficial to use a reactor that is
adapted for relatively short residence times of the reactants and the catalyst in the reactor, as noted
above.
[0062]          Another condition to be considered is reaction temperature. In specific embodiments,
the reacting of the C02 and carbon and/or organic starting materials in the presence of the catalyst
can be carried out at a temperature of about 200 "C to about 900 "C, about 300 "C to about 700 'C,

about 350 *C to about 600 *C, about 400 *C to about 500 *C or a temperature of about 550 *C or
less. In other embodiments, the reacting of the CO2 and carbon and/or organic starting materials
can be carried out at a pressure of up to about 25 bar (2.5 MPa) or about 80 bar (8.0 MPa). In
some embodiments, reacting can be carried out at ambient pressure to near ambient pressure.
[0063]      The process of the disclosure can comprise separation of the products into two or more
different fractions.    This can comprise transferring the stream comprising the product(s) to a
separator. In some embodiments, the stream may be separated into a vapor and gas fraction and a
solids fraction, which comprises solid reaction products and the catalyst. The inventive method
also can comprise regenerating and recycling the catalyst into the pyrolysis process. In some
embodiments, this also may include transferring the catalyst from the separator through a
reducing zone prior to re-introduction into the reactor.

6. EXAMPLES
    6.1. MIXED TIN IRON OXIDES FOR CARBON DIOXIDE UTILIZATION
[0069]      The use of C02 as a chemical feedstock is an appealing strategy for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions especially if technologies currently being developed to remove CO 2
from fossil fuel fired power plant exhaust gases lead to abundant, high purity, carbon dioxide
feedstocks-! If the CO 2 gas streams can be used as reactants in processes which yield more
energetic products, such as a fuel or value-added intermediate, then the original carbon in the
fossil fuel would be recovered for utilization in another application. 2        The potential for the
upgrading of carbon dioxide through industrial processes has been investigated for the past one
hundred years. 4 Historically attractive energy applications have included methane production by
hydrogenation of C02 (Sabatier reaction), production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by
reforming C02 with methane (dry methane reforming), production of methanol from CO 2 by
methane reforming (Carnol process), and gasification of chars using CO2 to make CO (Reverse
Boudouard reaction)     4
[0070]      In the Reverse-Boudouard reaction, the transformation becomes thermodynamically
favoured beginning at -700*C but conversion is low below -900*C. Several researchers have
explored catalysts for the Reverse-Boudouard reaction in the past and have been reviewed by
several authors    9.21 The goal of catalysis is to increase the reaction rate at lower temperature.
Among them, some have explored the oxidation and reduction of iron on elemental carbon
supports and impregnated in coal using techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis,            13 CO2
pulsed reactions, and temperature programmed desorption.- 1 -             Alkali carbonates have also
been found to catalyse char gasification by CO 2 and some researchers have studied binary alkali
iron and alkaline-earth-iron mixed metal oxide systems and shown them to catalyse the formation
of CO from carbon dioxide and chars24 -         Recently mixed metal oxides with nickel, ceria, and
zirconia have been explored for carbon dioxide utilization by reforming to synthesis gas and by
                                                    10

 WO 2015/020862                                                            PCT/US2014/049007
methanationL-J. To our knowledge, mixed metal oxides containing Group 8 metals and reducible
oxides of p-block metals, specifically tin, have not been reported for the gasification of carbon
with CO2. However, until now, little work has been done to show conclusively that the oxygen
extracted from C02 by the catalyst materials results in transfer of the extracted oxygen to an
external carbon source rather than incorporation of the oxygen into the catalyst structure. We have
developed mixed metal oxides of tin and iron which catalyze the Reverse-Boudouard reaction for
production of CO from carbon feedstocks such as pet-coke and biomass char. In this disclosure
we characterize the removal of oxygen from C02 by a reduced tin-iron catalyst and show that the
oxygen comes from carbon dioxide and is transferred to other carbon sources as shown in Figure
 1. The reaction was studied using isotopically-labeled C"02, thermogravimetric analysis, and
mass spectroscopy. The results show that the highly stable carbon-oxygen bonds of C02 can be
broken with subsequent transfer of the oxygen to a carbon atom of lower oxidation state. One of
ordinary skill will be able modify the catalyst formulations disclosed herein to make formulations
which abstract oxygen from C02 at lower temperatures and catalysts which can selectively or
partially oxidize other carbon-based reductants leading to higher-value products. Furthermore, the
utilization of CO2 to feed oxygen to catalysts in partial-oxidation processes which currently use
oxygen separation units has the potential to lower capital costs for processes while providing
additional markets for captured carbon dioxide beyond conventional enhanced oil recovery
applications.
[0071]       Mixed metal oxides containing tin are composed of tin-oxide phases which are known
to have temperature-induced oxygen mobility.         - In considering the SnO2Fe2O3A203 catalyst
formulation and the given reaction conditions, it is sensible to question what types of oxygen
containing sites are involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide and to consider the extent of
oxygen transfer synergies. One simplistic perspective is to consider the oxygen in the catalyst
associated with Sn02 as distinct from the oxygen which is associated with A12 0 3 and likewise for
the oxygen associated with Fe2O3. The nominal formulation of the catalyst investigated here is
(Fe2O3)(SnO2)I.41(Al203)1.82 and is given in Figures 1 and 2 along with a proposed mechanism
which broadly describes a pathway for oxygen transfer. This mechanistic hypothesis can be tested
by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). For example, the weight loss observed for loss of oxygen
exclusively from Sn02 (8.1% theoretical observed for all the oxygen in the catalyst). The
theoretical limit to the weight loss due to complete oxygen loss is 32.4%. Intermediate weight
losses could correspond to loss of oxygen from a combination of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 (16.7%), or only
Fe2 O 3 (8.6%), or even by incomplete reduction of Fe2O 3 to FeO (5.7%).
                                                  11

 WO 2015/020862                                                               PCT/US2014/049007
[0072]      Since the thermogravimetric analyses shown in Figure 3 shows the total weight loss to
be only approximately 21.6%, it is not possible that all the oxygen in the materials is available to
reduction. Similarly, since an overall weight loss of 21.6% is observed starting from ambient, it is
not likely that the oxygen originates exclusively from SnO2 or exclusively from Fe2 0 3 given the
elemental analysis (Supplementary Information, Sec. 6.3. below). Figure 3 shows that the overall
weight loss observed from ambient is approximately 21.6%. Approximately 7.4% of the initial
weight is lost upon heating the sample to 800*C in nitrogen (dark grey, inert). Presumably, this
corresponds to loss of surface adsorbed and absorbed species such as adventitious water, oxygen,
or carbon dioxide. Further changes in weight are described relative to the sample weight
following the initial desorption as suggested by the four horizontal lines on the weight profile.
[0073]      Following the inert thermal ramp, the weight of the sample is further decreased when
the material is again heated to 800*C in the presence of 10% CO (N 2 balance, white). The weight
loss due to reduction by CO is approximately 15.4%. Subsequent oxidation with CO 2 results in a
weight gain of about 99.1% of the previous weight loss (light grey). Following the treatment with
CO2 about 0.5% of the initial weight is lost by ramping to 800*C in nitrogen. When the catalyst is
again treated with CO in a second reduction step, a smaller weight loss (-13.3%) is observed
compared to the first reduction step. This is consistent with irreversible transition from mixed
valent Fe20  3  to lower valent Fe304, a transition which accounts for approximately 3.4 wt%
change due to oxygen loss. It is also consistent with the hypothesis that some catalyst is lost to
deactivation, either reversible, or irreversible. One reversible catalyst deactivation route is the
forward    Boudouard     Reaction,    where    one   equivalent  carbon    is  deposited  from    the
disproportionation of two equivalents of CO. A follow-up oxidation step leads to a weight gain
equal in magnitude to the weight loss observed during the previous reduction. A slight weight
gain is then observed when the oxidized catalyst is further oxidized while heated to 800C in air,
returning the sample to approximately the same weight observed after the initial desorption. After
air oxidation, reduction with CO shows a 14.0% weight loss.
[0074]      In a follow-up experiment (Supplementary Information, Sec. 6.3 below), the catalyst
was reduced again with CO after two cycles then oxidized with air. It showed a return to the
weight observed prior to all reduction steps and at the end of each oxidation step. This comparison
shows that the catalyst can obtain oxygen from C02, a relatively poor oxidant, almost as
effectively as it can from 02, a relatively strong oxidant.
[0075]      Overall, the weight changes observed in the thermogravimetric analyses in the absence
of a reductant are most likely due to desorption of adventitious adsorbates (H20, C02, possibly
02) from the surface of the catalyst. In the presence of a reductant, both SnO2 and Fe203 sites are
                                                   12

 WO 2015/020862                                                              PCT/US2014/049007
reduced when heated to 800 0 C, but A1203 sites do not appear to be reduced. The observed weight
loss (15.5%), agrees well with the amount of oxygen calculated to be associated with SnO2 and
Fe203 (16.%).
[0976]       It must be noted that the thermogravimetric analysis cannot be used to conclusively
rule out coincidental weight changes resulting from combinations of partial oxygen losses from
SnO2, Fe 2 0 3 , and A12 0 3 sites. However, Figure 4 shows plots of the observed weight changes
with temperature purge gas over the temperature range from 0-800*C. Each weight change trace is
numbered for distinction. The derivative plots indicate that changes in weight are likely due to
three events and involve two types of active catalytic sites. The weight change observed during
the initial temperature ramp in nitrogen (black) peaks distinctly at 100C in agreement with the
hypothesis that the initial weight loss involves the loss of adventitious absorbates. When the
reduced catalyst is oxidized by treatment with CO2 (dashed traces), two separate events are
observed to occur, the first at approximately 650*C and the second occurring at approximately
720*C. The bimodal distribution for weight change under oxidizing conditions is reproducible in
both C02 treatment steps. These observations are consistent with oxygen abstraction from CO2
occurring at two different sites, one active at slightly lower temperature than the other. In the
reduction steps, a bimodal distribution is also observed. A low temperature weight change is
observed at approximately 400C and is minor compared to the higher temperature weight change
observed at 700C. A third minor weight change is also observable above 700C but is not as
pronounced as the primary peak. It is also observed that in the initial reduction cycle, weight
changes are observed at slightly lower temperatures compared to the next two cycles. This could
indicate that an irreversible transition is made on the active site during the first reduction. This
would be consistent with the transition of Fe2O 3 to Fe304, with the reduction of mixed oxide Fe
(III) /Fe (II) anticipated to be easier than the reduction of a more reduced Fe(I)/Fe(II). Lastly,
the sample is treated with air (- -) after the catalyst has been oxidized with C02, and there is little
observable change in weight during this event.
[0077]       Mass spectroscopy (MS) experiments were conducted with isotopically labelled C"02.
The study reveals details about both the fate of the oxygen abstracted from CO 2 as well as the
capability of the catalyst to transfer metal-oxide-associated oxygen to external carbon sources.
Details of the experiment are provided in the Supplementary Information (Sect. 6.3). In short, gas
exiting a fixed-bed catalyst zone was analysed by MS. Isotopically-labelled C'8 0 2, was used to
follow oxygen through the reaction and shows the original molecular connectivity and the
molecular connectivity of the products. In the presence of a catalyst which abstracts oxygen from
carbon dioxide, heavy oxygen (180) will be removed and C18 0 will be produced as the primary
                                                   13

 WO 2015/020862                                                                 PCT/US2014/049007
product. We anticipated observing this by MS upon treatment of the reduced catalyst with C'802.
It was surmised that this would label the reduced catalyst with 3O and that the labelled catalyst
could then be reduced again with CO with the resulting production of C0180 as shown in Figure
5.
[0078]       The experimental results are shown below in Figure 6 with the observed mass signals
(lower) correlated to the reactor temperature (upper) and purge gas (by shade). The most relevant
segments are the first oxidation segment (light grey), where oxygen is removed from C1O2, and
the last reduction section (white), where CO removes oxygen from the catalyst. Figure 6 shows
that initial reduction with CO (first white segment) gives an increase in mass 44 at approximately
800'C which corresponds to production of C02 using unlabelled oxygen from the catalyst. In the
reduced state, the catalyst removes oxygen from C"O2 at approximately 650'C as shown. The
decrease in the signal intensity of C10     2 is accompanied by corresponding increases in C1 0, but
also unexpectedly by an increase in CO0,             which indicates three potential scenarios. One,
labelled oxygen is coupled to surface bound CO from the previous step. Second, unlabelled
oxygen from the catalyst surface is coupled to C1O before it is dissociated from the catalyst
surface. Third, carbon is deposited on the catalyst surface during the preceding reduction step and
gets coupled to one unlabelled oxygen and one labelled oxygen. All three scenarios require
removal of 180 from C'8 02 and show the capability of the material to utilize oxygen from carbon
dioxide.
[0079]       In the fourth step, the labelled catalyst was again treated with flowing 20% CO. Here
we anticipated observing a decrease in CO and a corresponding increase in CO1 O associated with
reduction of the catalyst by removal of 1S0 which the catalyst abstracted from C'802. Indeed there
is this correlation, however, as Figure 7 shows, we also observed the formation of all the other
species which can be proposed to involve surface bound oxygen (CO'5 0, C0 2 , C 8 0, C' 8 0 2 ). The
observation of all species correlated to the decrease in the CO signal. The appearance of CO 8 0
supports the hypothesis that heavy oxygen (Q0)is abstracted from C' 8 O2by the catalyst, and then
added to a different carbon source, in this case carbon monoxide, to produce partially labelled
carbon dioxide (CO' 80). The observation of C02 may be primarily from incomplete labelling of
the catalyst in the prior oxidation step. The time dependent decrease in signal intensity for CO1 0
but not C02 is consistent with consumption of labelled oxygen from the surface of the catalyst
over time. The observation of C18 0 was unanticipated, but shows that carbon monoxide may
undergo disproportionation to carbon and carbon dioxide with carbon deposition on the catalyst
surface where it picks up an    ISO from the labelled catalyst. It is conceivable that carbon monoxide
is absorbed on the surface of the catalyst, deoxygenated, and then reoxygenated with a labelled
                                                     14

10. The detection of C802 can only be accounted for by mechanistic routes which involve
labelling of the catalyst with '8O in the previous oxidation step followed by transfer of the
labelled oxygen during the subsequent reduction step, either to a carbon which is absorbed by the
catalyst as CO before undergoing oxygen metathesis and oxygen addition, or to a carbon which is
deposited on the catalyst as elemental carbon before undergoing two oxygen additions with
labelled 180 which must have originated from labelled CO2.
[0080]      In   summary,     the mechanistic       investigation   of the C02       utilization  catalyst
Fe2G3(SnO2)Al(A2O3),2         has been conducted and results obtained from mass spectroscopy
experiments using isotopically-labelled carbon dioxide prove that the reduced catalyst abstracts
oxygen from carbon dioxide and transfers it to another carbon. Thermogravimetric evidence
suggests that oxygen from Fe203 and SnO2 are mobile and able to be removed from the catalyst
by reductant. Rapid exchange of oxygen by the catalyst easily occur due to the observed high
mobility of oxygen between the catalyst and carbon dioxide which may lead to potential side
reactions.

          CARBON DIOXIDE UTILIZATION
[0081]       Synthesis of Fe20(Sn02).4(A20ht.s2 Catalyst

 WO 2015/020862                                                           PCT/US2014/049007
[0082]       The mixed oxide catalyst was obtained by co-precipitation of metal salts from aqueous
solutions using conventional procedures. Tin (IV) chloride, pentahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, 98%),
iron (II) nitrate, nonahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, >98%), aluminum nitrate, nonahydrate (Sigma
Aldrich, ?98%) and amnonium hydroxide (BDH Aristar, 28-30%), were obtained and used as
received without further purification.
[0083]       The catalyst was prepared according to the following procedure: 172.24 g (0.491
mole) SnCl4.51H20, 281.24 g (0.696 mole) Fe(NO3)y9H20, and 476.81g (1.271                    mole)
AI(NO3)3'9H20 were dissolved into a beaker containing 1620 g of deionized H20 by mixing for
at least I hour. The salt solution was added at a constant rate of 30 mLmin to a tank containing
 1500 g of DI water. A solution of NL 4OH (504.07g, 4.17 mole) in DI H20 was added at a
variable rate of 8-10 mUmin to maintain the pH of the precipitation at 8.0 0.2. The precipitation
was stopped when all the metals salts were added to the precipitation tank and the pH was equal
to 8.0. The precipitation was allowed to mix for an additional 45 minutes. The precipitate was
filtered into two wet cakes and then washed with DI water until the eluent contained chloride ion,
as detected by a solution of 0.XM Ag(NO3)2, at a ppb level (based on K,p). An LOX of each cake
was used to determine the solid metal oxides content of each cake. By calculation, 195.3g solids
were obtained, >99% yield. Elemental analysis by ICP-MS showed Fe 18.7%, Sn 28.0%, Al
 16.6%, theory Fe 20.3%, Sn 30.2%, Al 17.4%.
[0084]       ThernogravimetricAnalysis
[0085]       Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using TA Instruments TGA Q500
with Advantage for    Q Series  software. The plumbing of the TGA furnace was altered to receive
gas for the sample purge from external mass flow controllers (MFCs), operated via an electronic
control box. This allows for the selection of additional gases for the sample purge compared to
the standard Q500 design. Switching between gases was performed manually via in-line two-way
valves, and flows were set according to MFC calibrations for each gas. Two temperature
programs were used involving multiple steps to demonstrate the addition and removal of oxygen
from the surface of the catalyst. For each analysis, a fresh sample (20-30 mg) was loaded in a
tared, platinum TGA pan at the start of the program. Each program extended over multiple days,
and the same sample was used for the duration. When necessary, the sample was held overnight
or over-weekend in the closed TGA furnace under nitrogen at room temperature. In short, both
programs describe heating the sample to 800'C and soaking for 60 minutes before cooling back
down to 30*C using different gases to observe reducing, oxidizing, or purely thermal effects. In
both programs, two cycles of the following steps are carried out. Thermal desorption is first
observed followed by reduction, then oxidation with COz, again thermal desorption, then
                                                 17

reduction, and oxidation with C02. In one program, the final oxidation with C02 is followed by
oxidation with air, to observe any sites which may require a stronger oxidant than CO2. In the
second program, the second oxidation with CO 2 is followed by another reduction step, then
oxidation with air, to confirm that the weight gain from the reduced sites oxidized in air is the
same as the weight gain observed for oxidation of the reduced sites by carbon dioxide.
[0086]      AutoChem-MS Analysis with Isotopically -Labelled Gases
[0087]      A Micromeritics' AutoChem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer was interfaced with a
Dycor Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer and used to follow the transformations of carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, and oxygen. The AutoChem II 2920 is a fully automated instrument capable of
conducting precise chemical adsorption and temperature programmed reaction studies.            The
sample is contained in a quartz reactor housed in a clamshell furnace, programmable up to 1100
*C. Four gas inlets with high-precision, independently calibrated mass flow controllers provide
accurate delivery of up to four analysis gases over the course of an experiment.         For these
experiments, the AutoChem was operated with constant flow of analysis gas through the sample
reactor. Gases employed were ultra-high purity helium, a certified mixture of 20% CO in helium,
and either  13C or 180 labelled C02. The Isotopically-labelled gases were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich and used as received. Experimental conditions for an exemplary experiment are given in
Table 2 below. The results are given in Results and Discussion Section below.

[0089]       Treatmentof Reduced Catalyst with Air
[0090]      In a thermogravimetric experiment described herein, a program was used to evaluate
the weight loss and weight gain shown by (Fe2O3)(SnO2).4(Al2O3)1.s2 when it was heated to
800*C while being reduced with 10% CO (white) followed by oxidation with 100% CO2 (light

 WO 2015/020862                                                              PCT/US2014/049007
grey). After two cycles the catalyst was reduced again with 10% CO (white), and then oxidized
with air (lighter grey). The weight of the reduced catalyst after oxidation with CO2 was the same
as the weight of the reduced catalyst after oxidation with 02. Experimental results of the
experiment are given in Figure 8.
[0091]       Plots of the observed weight changes with temperatures corresponding to the
experiment described above are shown in Figure 9. The data is displayed by purge gas over the
temperature range from 0-800*C, thus for most weight changes observed when ramping to 800*C
there is a corresponding static weight observation for cooling from 800*C. Each weight change
trace is numbered to indicate that it is associated with a different step in the TGA program. The
derivative plots indicate that changes in weight are likely due to three events and involve two
types of active catalytic sites. The weight change observed during the initial temperature ramp in
nitrogen (black) peaks distinctly at 100*C in agreement with the hypothesis that the initial weight
loss involves the loss of adventitious absorbates. When the reduced catalyst is oxidized by
treatment with C02 (red traces), two separate events are observed to occur, the first at
approximately 650*C and the second occurring at approximately 720"C. The bimodal distribution
for weight change under oxidizing conditions is reproducible in both CO2 treatment steps. These
observations are consistent with oxygen abstraction from CO2 occurring at two different sites, one
active at slightly lower temperature than the other. In the reduction steps (dashed line), a bimodal
distribution is also observed. A low temperature weight change is observed at approximately
400*C and is minor compared to the higher temperature weight change observed. Catalyst
oxidation by 02 (air)(- -) occurs at lower temperatures (-100-400"C) compared to CO2 (-650
750'C). This also shows the relative strengths of 02 and CO2 as oxidants and affinity of the
catalyst for 02 relative to CO2.
[0092]       In summary, the AutoChem-MS studies using isotopically labeled COO2 yield strong
evidence in support of the hypothesis that Fe203(SnO2)1.41(A120 3 ).82 removes oxygen from C02
and transfers it to other carbon sources. The appearance of C180 and C' 6 018 O during oxidation of
the reduced catalyst with C"02 shows the capability of the catalyst to abstract oxygen fTom
carbon dioxide as well as the ability to transfer catalyst-ligated oxygen to an external carbon
source.    The appearance of C1 0' 50, C10, and C802 during reduction of the 1O labeled
oxidized catalyst shows the ability of the catalyst to transfer ligated oxygen's to carbon sources. It
is clear that in addition to the transformations which occur on the desired reaction pathway,
numerous other transformations occur in side routes on the same time scale. Figure 10 depicts a
mechanism which could account for the events observed under the experimental conditions used
in the mass spectroscopy study. Starting from top and moving clockwise, the catalyst precursor is
                                                  19

activated by reduction with CO producing CO2 and vacancies in the coordination sphere of the
active site. The active sites are occupied by oxygen of CO2 and CO is produced (top right corner).
Oxygen from CO2 is combined with CO to make CO2 again and regenerate coordinatively
unsaturated reactive metal centers. The coordinatively unsaturated metal centers can also bind CO
through the nucleophilic carbonyl carbon, and at this point a series of reversible insertions can be
postulated to account for the observed oxygen scrambling. One skilled in the art may be able to
use knowledge of these mechanisms and optimize the process for CO2 utilization via conversion
to CO accordingly.
     6.4. TIN/IRON OXIDE LARGER SCALE DEMONSTRATION
[0093]       Demonstration of Production of Carbon Monoxide from Carbon Dioxide and a Solid
Carbon Source
[0094]       A bench-scale fluidized bed reactor was used to demonstrate the formation of CO
using C02, a solid carbon source, and a promoted catalyst. The fluidized bed reactor consists of a
    inch in diameter stainless steel pipe 5 inches long with a disengagement zone that expands to
 1.5 inches in diameter. A stainless steel frit is used to hold up the catalyst bed and solid carbon
source particles. In this study, SnO 2 Al 20 3 (Fe2 O3 )3 promoted with K and Mg was used as the
catalyst and pet coke char was used as the solid carbon source. The pet coke was treated at 800'C
for 6 hours in a nitrogen purge to produce the pet coke char. Catalyst and pet coke char particles
were mixed together and loaded into the reactor. The reactor is heated to reaction temperature,
typically 800*C, in a nitrogen purge. The reaction is initiated by directing a CO 2 stream to the
fluidized bed and product gases are measured using a CO/CO2 analyzer.            The product stream
from the reactor is diluted with a 200 sccm nitrogen stream before the analyzer to maintain the
minimum flow required for the analyzer.
[0095]       Elementary reaction experiments were also performed much like in the TGA to
observe each step in the proposed mechanism on a larger scale. In each of these experiment steps,
the catalyst (and solid carbon source in the fourth step) was heated in the gas specified in Table 3.
The first step is a temperature ramp to 800*C in N2 to desorb any gas species from the surface of
the catalyst. Step 2 is a temperature ramp to 800'C in 10% CO to reduce the catalyst as proposed
in the mechanism. Step 3 is a temperature ramp to 800*C in pure C02 to observe if the catalyst
can be oxidized by the CO2 to form CO. Step 4 is a temperature ramp to 800"C with the presence
of pet coke char in N2 to observe CO formation using the oxygen stripped from the CO 2 and the
carbon in the pet coke char to form CO. Table 3 shows the conditions for each elementary
reaction step.

[0098]       Bench-Scale FluidizedBed Reactor Results
[0099]       The following results describe the observations seen from the elementary step
reactions performed in the fluidized bed reactor outlined in Table 3. It is important to note that the
CO and C02 vol % profiles shown in the Figures below include a 200 SCCM (-66% of total flow
rate) dilution stream required by the analyzer.
[00100]      Figure 11 shows the temperature, CO, and CO2 profiles during the temperature ramp,
hold, and cool-down of elementary reaction step I in N 2 . CO and C02 begin to desorb from the
surface of the catalyst during the temperature ramp and their concentrations in the gas phase begin
to peak near the hold temperature of 800*C.
[00101]      Figure 12 shows the CO and CO 2 profiles as a function of temperature. During the
temperature ramp, C02 begins to desorb around 400*C and reaches a peak of 0.2 vol % at 750*C.
Then, the CO 2 concentration drops off near 0 vol % in the first 20 minutes of the hold time. CO is
also observed desorbing in the 700 to 800"C range, but at very low levels in the ppm range.
These observations confirm the CO2 and CO desorption seen in the TGA experiments. They differ
somewhat in the specific temperature at which they are observed compared to TGA and MS
results. This could be due to the presence of potassium and magnesium promoters on the surface
of the catalyst materials used in the fluidized bed reactor, which could cause CO 2 to be absorbed
as carbonates.
[00102]      Figure 13 shows the temperature, CO, and C02 profiles during the temperature ramp
and hold of elementary reaction step 2 in 10% CO with the remaining balance N2. The CO
concentration begins to decrease while C02 is produced and begins to increase throughout the
temperature ramp indicating that the CO is reducing the catalyst to form CO2 . Then, once the hold
temperature is reached, the CO 2 gradually drops off while CO gradually increases over the next
400 minutes.
[00103]      Figure 14 shows the CO and CO 2 profiles as a function of temperature.              CO2

minutes. The amount of C02 produced is more than expected from just reduction of the catalyst
and may indicate that other reactions may be occurring.         One possibility is that the forward
Bouduard reaction is consuming the CO to form CO2 and C deposits on the surface of the catalyst.
Additional evidence could be obtained from MS experiments performed with isotopic CO and
CO 2 to discern this possibility.
[00104]      Figure 15 shows the temperature, CO, and CO2 profiles during the temperature ramp,
hold, and cool-down of elementary reaction step 3 in pure C02. CO is produced during the
temperature ramp and begins to decrease near the hold temp of 800*C.         About 40 minutes after
the temperature hold, the CO2 concentration begins decreasing, as well as the CO, due to a
pressure build up before the stainless steel frit holding up the catalyst bed. As a safety measure,
the feed gas, CO2, was vented through pressure relief valves and the feed gas flow rate to the
catalyst bed was greatly reduced resulting in the CO2 concentration dropping off. However, it is
still observed that C02 was consumed and CO produced indicating that the catalyst was being
oxidized by the C02 to form CO.
[00105]      Figure 16 shows the CO and C02 profiles as a function of temperature.            CO is
produced near 400*C and increases to a peak of 15% near 700*C and begins decreasing for the
next 40 minutes of the hold section.
[00106]      Figure 17 shows the temperature, CO, and C02 profiles during the temperature ramp,
hold, and cool-down of elementary reaction step 4 in N2 . Pet coke char was added to the catalyst
bed at ambient temperature before the ramp while maintaining an N 2 purge to prevent air from
entering the reactor and contacting the catalyst. CO and C02 are produced in a short amount of
time near the end of the temperature ramp section.
[00107]      Figure 18 shows the CO and C02 profiles as a function of temperature. C02 was
observed at low levels from 200 to 600*C during the temperature ramp and began to sharply
increase to a peak of 1.7% near 800*C before quickly dropping off to low levels 30 min after
reaching 800*C. CO was also produced and followed a similar profile peaking just above 0.5%.
The observation of CO shows the formation of C-O bonds between pet coke and oxygenated
catalyst while the observation of a high percentage of C02 indicates that scrambling mechanisms
are definitely occurring on the same time scale as the CO dissociation. Further, it may indicate
that the rate limiting step to the mechanism could be dissociation of CO from the active site of the
catalyst. In a CO 2 dilute environment the rate of CO dissociation from the active site should be
slower if the rate law is directly dependent on the concentration of CO 2 (needed to displace CO
from the site and reoxidize the catalyst).

[00108]     It is also noteworthy that the amount of C02 observed during this step is somewhat
high and unexpected between -200-600*C. It is possible that some CO2 from step 3 may have
adsorbed without conversion to CO in step 3. Then, in a CO2 dilute environment the CO2 could
desorb. However, if it were truly simple physical adsorption, all C02 would be anticipated to be
purged away well before the temperature reaches 200'C. The observation of approximately 0.25
vol % CO 2 above 200*C could be explained by any of several reactions of the various oxides with
carbon to produce C02. For example, SnO2 is thermodynamically favored to be reduced by
carbon to make carbon monoxide and is likely also be favorable for C02 formation. The increase
observed near 800*C is in firm agreement with thermodynamic calculations and is likely the
involvement of sites which are harder to reduce. Very little CO was produced in step 4 relative to
C02, again consistent with explanations involving a reduced rate of CO displacement and more
extensive oxidation of pet coke.
     6.5. RUTHENIUM /IRON OXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE UTILIZATION
[00109]     Dry hydrocarbon reforming is the process of converting CxH2x+2 and C02 to syngas
containing CO and H2, typically including some H20 and CO2. The conversion approaches 100%
near 800'C.
[00110]     A few pivotal papers for the field were published in the early 1990's by Ashcroft et
al.[1] and researchers from Haldor Topsoe.[2]. The HaldorTopsoe work included numerous
transition metals on MgO support, one being Ru. [2] Several researchers have investigated
ruthenium-based systems for dry methane reforming since. In 1999, Matsui et a]. investigated 5
wt% Ru on La2O3, Y2 O3 , ZrO2 and A1203 at 600"C and approximately I atm CO2 and CH 4
pressures finding that C02 and methane are readily converted to synthesis gas on La 2O 3 , Y2 0 3 ,
and A120 3 supports.[3]. Near that time Bradford et al. reported ruthenium (0.5-5%) on A1203,
TiO2, and carbon and tested low pressure streams (0.225 C02, 0.225 CH4, 0.55 He) observing 11
 12% C02 conversions at 450*C.[4] Crisafulli et al. took the approach of impregnating nickel
catalysts with ruthenium to improve the performance for dry methane reforrning.[5] Nickel (-2%)
supported on SiO 2 and H-ZSM5 was impregnated with Ru (0.1-0.6%) and showed reforming of
methane (0.15 atm CH 4 , 0.15 atm C0 2) at 600*C to improve with increasing Ru concentration. A
perovskite formulation was studied, CaRuO3[6] as well as a mixed-metal perovskites of
lanthanides (La, Sm, Nd) with Ru-Ni co-catalysts (LngsCavRuo.sNioa203)[7]. The perovskites
showed high conversion of CH 4 and CO2 to CO at 7000 C and 800 0 C at I atm total pressure.

 WO 2015/020862                                                             PCT/US2014/049007
Ruthenium was investigated on Al 20 3 and Si0      2 at I wt% loadings[j], where in a dilute gas
mixture (0.1 atm ClH, 0.1 atm CO2, 0.8 atm helium) at 550'C, the methane conversions are 12
14% increased to 52-57% at 750*C. Sutton et a]. also probed lwt% Ru on A120       3 for dry methane
reforming applied to biomass gasification. [9] More recently, Haldor Topsoe has reported on Ru
supported on ZrO 2 at low pressures (-0.21 bar CH4: 0.83 bar C02, 1.3 bar total pressure)[J01
while others have reported on a combined partial methane oxidation/ carbon dioxide reforming
application at low temperature (550 0 C) with 8 wt% ruthenium on Al203 doped with cerium.[IIJ
[00111]     To our knowledge, no one has reported co-catalyst formulations of ruthenium and iron
for dry hydrocarbon reforming or dry methane reforming or for the application of the catalyzed
dry reforming reaction to any synthesis gas process, such as integrated gasification combined
cycle (IGCC), biomass gasification, or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of liquid transportation fuels.
Ru-Zr-Fe metal alloys (approximately equal percentages of each metal) have been reported for the
methanation of CO 2 at 100*C using H2 (hydrogenation) but not for syngas via dry methane
reforming.[12]
[00112]     We recently discovered that mixed metal oxides of iron and small amounts of
ruthenium (-0.5 -1.5 wt%)       can be formulated by standard co-precipitation methods, and that
mixed metal oxides thereof catalyze the dry reforming of methane utilizing C02 as the oxygen
source (dry methane reforming). Mechanistic investigation indicates that oxygen spillover occurs,
whereby in separate steps, we observe that the fully-reduced catalyst begins to react with pure
C02 at approximately 400*C, increasing in mass until the weight equals the weight of the
oxidized Ru-Fe starting material. Exposure of this oxidized catalyst to pure methane shows
weight loss of similar magnitude with concomitant production of CO and H2 (Figures 19-20). The
onset of this reactivity is between 500 and 600*C with apex in activity at 600C. This activity has
been observed in separate reaction steps with the aid of thermogravimetric analysis and mass
spectroscopy, shown below. Reduction with CO results in a 22% weight loss which looks fully
reversible when oxidized with C02. The magnitude is indicative of oxygen spillover between Fe
and Ru since Ru is present in only a small, catalytic, amount relative to Fe203. When the
reoxidized catalyst was purged with C14, it again showed a significant weight loss, even higher
than the weight loss observed during reduction with CO. Even more promising, the predominant
products as indicated by MS are CO and 1-12, with only a small amount of C02 detected. Under
these conditions, this catalyst appears promising for further development.
[00113]     We have also observed that the material is active in a fixed-bed reactor system under a
co-feed of CO2 and Cl-4 and confirmed the formation of CO and H2 . Results are provided below
(Figures 21-24). Highlights are that at approximately 600'C and 25 bar of a feed mixture (CH4:

C02 = 6:1), we observed production of approximately 10 vol% CO and 10 vol% hydrogen. In
terms of CO2 conversion we observed approximately 30% conversion. When the total pressure is
reduced to approximately I bar, the CO2 conversion is approximately 16%. When the feed
composition is changed to a C02: CH4 ratio of 1:1 and I bar total pressure, approximately 2 vol%
CO is formed (-3% CO 2 conversion) at 500'C, whereas at 600"C, approximately 5 vol% CO and
1 vol% H2 are made (approximately 12% CO2 conversion). When the temperature is raised to
800C approximately 30 volume percent CO is formed and 10 volume percent hydrogen. See Fig.
24 showing the performance of the Ru-Fe catalyst at 630'C and 780*C with a total of I atm
natural gas and carbon dioxide mixture (1 mol CH4: 1 mol C02). In all cases when the total
pressure is increased to 50 bar, no synthesis gas products are observed.
[00114]     At this point the CO2-methane reforming catalyst formulation could be incorporated
into a process by modifying the catalyst formulation to include an additional phase capable of
forming a target product from the synthesis gas made by the Ru-Fe phase. Such products are
methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuels. For methanol synthesis, the approach would be to develop a
catalyst with a copper component similar to the copper-zinc aluminate catalyst used for
commercial methanol synthesis. The copper-zinc aluminate could be incorporated as an additional
phase to the current dry methane reforming formulation, with the goal being to run the process in
a single reactor using a single bifunctional catalyst material. However, it does not necessarily
have to be done this way, and in fact, since the process conditions which we have currently
observed for our dry methane refonning catalyst are lower in pressure and higher in temperature
than the conditions currently encountered in methanol synthesis from syngas, the accomplishment
may be difficult to achieve. To avoid this difficulty, we could set the process up in two reaction
zones, with the synthesis gas produced from CO2 and CH4 being fed to a methanol synthesis zone.
The dry methane reforming catalyst and the methanol synthesis catalyst would be kept separate.
[00115]     Fischer-Tropsch fuels from CO2-derived synthesis gas is another process which could
incorporate the new Ru-Fe catalyst. Like the methanol approach, the objective is conversion of
the syngas to liquid fuels, but in this case it makes a little more sense to consider a single catalyst
approach. The current formulation contains components which are known to have Fr-activity and
we currently know that synthesis gas can be produced at pressures which could be used in high
temperature Fr processes. In one embodiment, the temperature of the C0 2-derived synthesis gas
is lowered by few hundred degrees, while moving the synthesis gas from the CO2-utilization zone
to the FT-zone, where it will be converted to transportation fuels.
