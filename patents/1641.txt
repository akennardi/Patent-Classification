Description of the Related Art
        [0003]        A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and
displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Postage stamps are
purchased from a postal administration or other authorized vendor and are used to pay for
the costs involved in moving mail as well as other business necessities such as insurance
and registration. This payment is made at the time that the postage stamp is received, and
not at the time that the postal services are provided.          While this model has been
successfully used for several years, it also can result in people paying for postage that they
do not use. Specifically, a person may pay for and receive postage, and the postage is
either lost, or it is adhered to an item that does not need to be shipped, or any other of a
range of circumstances occur that result in the individual, who paid for the postage, not
being able to receive the benefit of his purchase. These problems not only arise in the
context of postal services, but can arise in the broader context of any service and service
provider.
                                          SUMMARY
        [0004]        Some embodiments relate to a system for tracking the status of an item.
The system can include, for example, a first database including item information, which
item information can include an identifier indicating the item status, and a processor
operating in accordance with instructions stored in a memory. In some embodiments, the
processor can receive a request to generate an item, update the identifier in the first
                                              -1-

database to indicate the existence of the item, receive a signal indicating that a service
identified by the item has been provided, and update the identifier in the first database to
indicate that the identified service has been provided.
         [0005]     In some embodiments, the system can further include a second
database that can include a user identifier such as, for example, a username, a password,
and/or a user account number. In some embodiments, the system can further include a
third database that can include payment information that can be, for example, associated
with the user identifier in the second database.
         [0006]     In some embodiments, the processor can further receive the user
identifier, and compare the received user identifier to the user identifier stored in the
second database.      In some embodiments, the processor can further request payment
information from the third database after receiving the signal indicating that that the status
of the item has changed.       In some embodiments, the processor can further receive a
second item request, provide a second item in response to the received item request; and
update the first database with the first identifier indicating the existence of the second
item. In some embodiments, the process can further receive a signal indicating that the
status of the second item has changed, and update the first database with the second
identifier indicating the changed item status of the second item.
         [0007]     In some embodiments, the item can be a variety of items, including, for
example, a package, an envelope, and/or any other item.
         [0008]      Some embodiments relate to a method of tracking and creating an item.
The method can include, for example, receiving a request to generate an electronic
version of a item, providing the electronic version of the item in response to the received
request, updating an identifier indicating the existence of the item, receiving a signal
indicating that the item has been received, which receipt of the item corresponds with the
performance of requested services on the item, and updating the identifier to indicate that
the item has been received.
         [0009]     In some embodiments of the method, the item includes a unique
identifier. In some aspects of the method, providing the item includes providing item
information.
         [0010]     In some embodiments, the method further includes receiving a
corporeal embodiment of the item information, receiving item information from the
corporeal embodiment of the item information, receiving a user identifier and querying a

second database to identify a user account associated with the user identifier, requesting
payment information after receiving the signal indicating that the status of the item has
changed, and/or requesting payment. In some embodiments, the identifying the user
account includes, for example, verifying the received user identifier.
         [0011]     Some embodiments relate to a method of tracking status of an item to
control initiation of a process. The method can include, for example, storing in a non
transitory storage device an indication defining a first status of the item, detecting use of
the item in a pre-defined manner, modifying the indication to define a second state of the
item reflective of the detected use; and initiating the process in response to the
modification of the indication to define the second state of the item.

       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE
         [0032]     In the following detailed description, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols
typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative
embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to
be limiting.    Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made,
without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be
readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein,
and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a
wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and
make part of this disclosure.
         [0033]     The system described herein provides for improved tracking of the
status of an item. In some embodiments, the tracking of the status of the item can be used
to trigger a payment transaction when, for example, a service is provided relating to the
item.   In some embodiments, the system described herein provides label information,
tracks label status in a database, updates label status information, and requests payment
when the label status changes to a specified label status. In some embodiments, the label
information can be provided in response to a request for label information, and the label
information can be used to create a label that can be used independently or can be
associated with an object. In some embodiments, the system provides for improved item
tracking of an item received by a service provider, such as, for example, a postal service
provider.
         [0034]     One embodiment relates to a system of tracking the status of an item
that is provided to a customer in advance of the performance of services, and which is
later received by the service provider from the customer at the time that services are
provided.     In one embodiment, the customer can, for example, provide the service
provider with information used to generate the item. In some embodiments, for example,
the service provider can use this received information to generate item information, the
item information corresponding to a digital version of the item, and the service provider
can then send the generated item information to the customer. In some embodiments, the
customer can then take the received generated item information and create the item, the
creation of the item corresponding to the creation of a tangible version of the item.

        [0035]     In some embodiments, the service provider can, for example, maintain
a database containing information relating to the creation of the item, the item, and to the
item status. In some embodiments, the service provider may track a variety of different
item statuses including, for example, a generated status corresponding to the status arising
when the item information is generated, an expired status corresponding to a status arising
if too large a time passes between the generation of the item information, and a used
status corresponding to an item for which the requested services have been provided. In
some embodiments, the different status can result in different system functions such as,
for example, the used status can trigger a payment request and/or a payment or other
follow-on transaction.
        [0036]     In some embodiments, the customer can deliver the item to the service
provider when the customer desires to receive the services.       The service provider can
receive the item and update the item status in the database to reflect that the services
requested by the item are being or have been provided.          This update can, in some
embodiments, trigger a payment request and/or a payment transaction.
        [0037]     In one specific embodiment in which the service provider is a postal
authority and the item is postage, a customer can provide the postal authority with
information and request the generation of postage. The postal authority can generate
postage information and provide this information to the customer who can then create a
physical version of the postage. When the customer would like to have an item associated
with the postage delivered, the customer can affix the postage to the item and deliver the
item to the postal authority. Upon taking possession of the item bearing the postage, the
postal authority can update a database containing information relating to the status of the
postage to indicate that requested services have been provided, and can then request
payment by the customer.
The Label
        [0038]     Figure 1 depicts one embodiment of an item 100.            The item can
comprise any object for which a user desires to receive services.       These services can

other service.
        [0039]     In some embodiments, the item 100 can comprise a label 102, or can
comprise a label 102 affixed and/or associated with an object 104.           Thus, in some
embodiments, the label 102 comprises the item 100 receiving the services, and in other
                                            -6-_

embodiments, the label 102 is affixed and/or associated with the object 104 receiving the
services.
         [0040]     The label 102 can comprise any feature configured for identification of
at least an account. In some embodiments, the label can identify a user account, a class of
requested services, information relating to the label 102 and/or object 104, or any other
desired information. Thus, in one specific embodiment, a label 102 can be configured for
use as postage and can include information identifying a sender's account, the item being
mailed with the label 102, and the type of mail service requested. As depicted in Figure
1, the label 102 can, in some embodiments, be applied to the object 104.
         [0041]     The object 104 can comprise anything capable of receiving services
and of physical association with the label 102. In some embodiments, the object 104 can
comprise, for example, a package, a box, an envelope, a bag, or any other thing. In some
embodiments, the object 104 can be designated for receiving a service from a service
provider, such as, delivery, storage, processing, repair, upgrading, or any other service. In
one specific embodiment, the object can be designated for delivery to a service provider,
and specifically to a mail service provider. In some embodiments, the object 104 can be
further designated for delivery by a service provider, such as by the mail service provider.
         [0042]     In some embodiments, the label 102 can provide identification of the
requested mail services and indication of payment for the requested mail services. In some
embodiments, this information can be located in one or several areas on the label 102.
Figure 1 depicts one embodiment of the label 102 in which this information is located in a
first data area 106, a second data area 108, and a third data area 110. A person of skill in
the arts will recognize that the present disclosure is not limited to the specific number of
data areas 106, 108, 110 depicted in Figure 1, or the positions of the data areas 106, 108,
110 on the label 102.
         [0043]     The data areas 106, 108, 110 can contain information stored in any
desired format. In some embodiments, the data areas 106, 108, 110 can comprise, for
example, text, a text string, an image, a computer readable code, a signal emitter, or any
other desired format. In some embodiments, the computer readable code can comprise,
for example, a barcode such as, for example, a linear barcode, a 2-D barcode, a QR code,
an intelligent mail barcode, or any other desired format of barcode or computer readable
code. In some embodiments, for example, the signal emitter can comprise, a feature
configured to emit energy from a specific portion of the electromagnetic energy spectrum
                                             -7-

in response to an excitation signal.     In some embodiments, this emitting feature can
comprise, for example, an RFID tag, a luminescent tag, or any other signal emitting
feature.
         [0044]     In some embodiments, each of the data areas 106, 108, 110 can
comprise information in one or several formats. In one embodiment, for example, the
first data area 106 can comprise, for example, text, the second data area 108 can comprise,
for example, an intelligent mail bar code, and the third data area can comprise a RFID tag
and a text string.
The Payment Sheet
         [0045]     Figure la depicts one embodiment of a payment sheet 150. In some
embodiments, the payment sheet 150 can comprise an indicator identifying a group of
labels 102, the group comprising at least one label 102. The payment sheet 150 can be
used, for example, to facilitate delivery of a number of items 100 to a service provider as
each of the items 100 in the group of items 100 is associated with an identifier on the
payment sheet 150. Due to the association of each of the items 100 with the payment
sheet 150 identifier, by receiving information identifying the received payment sheet 150,
a service provider can identify the group of items 100 and more quickly receive the items
100 for service.
         [0046]     The payment sheet can be used to provide label information to a central
status tracking system, which central status tracking system will be discussed in detail
below, at the time the label 102 is delivered to the service provider (referred to as
"induction").
         [0047]     As depicted in Figure la, the payment sheet 150 can comprise a
substrate 152. The substrate 152 can comprise any desired material capable of bearing
some or all of the below discussed information.
         [0048]     As further depicted in Figure 1a, one embodiment of the payment sheet
150 comprises a plurality of data fields.       These data fields can include information
relating to a user account, to one or several labels 102, to service costs, service class,
requested services, or any other desired information.
         [0049]     In the embodiment depicted in Figure la, a first data field 154 can
comprise, for example, information relating to a user account, a second data field 156 can
comprise information relating to a first label 102, a third data field 158 can comprise, for
example, information relating to a second label 102, a fourth data field 160 can comprise,

for example, information relating to a third label 102, and a fifth data field 162 can
comprise, for example, information relating the total number of labels 102 captured on the
payment sheet 150. A person of skill in the arts will recognize that the present disclosure
is not limited to the specific number of data fields 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, the format of
the payment sheet 150, or the above enumerated contents of the data fields 154, 156, 158,
160, 162.
The Status Tracking System
         [0050]     Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating an extended status tracking
system 200. The extended status tracking system 200 can be configured, for example, to
generate a label, track label status, and transact payment.     In some embodiments, the
extended status tracking system 200 can further include features configured to read, scan,
and/or receive information from a label 102 that has been delivered to a service provider
by a user and/or customer. In some embodiments, the extended status tracking system
200 can process the label 102 information that was read, scanned, and/or received by the
extended status tracking system 200, and can use this label information to determine a
label status such as payment due, service provided, services being provided, or any other
desired status. In some embodiments, the label status can be used to trigger an event,
such as, for example, a payment request and/or a payment transaction.
         [0051]     In some embodiments, the extended status tracking system 200 can
comprise, for example, a user terminal 202. The user terminal 202 can comprise any

central status tracking system 204, and in some embodiments, the memory can be remote
from the central status tracking system 204.
        [0058]      The memory 210 can include, for example, RAM memory, flash
memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, hard disk, a
removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The
memory can include, for example, software, at least one software module, instructions,
steps of an algorithm, or any other information. In some embodiments, the processor 208
can perform processes in accordance with instruction stored in the memory 210. These
processes can include, for example, controlling features and/or components of the central
status tracking system 204, requesting and/or receiving information from features and/or
components of the central status tracking system 204, requesting and/or receiving
information from features and/or components of the extended status tracking system 200,
transmitting instructions and/or control signals to features and/or components of the
central status tracking system 204, requesting information from an administrator,
transmitting information to the administrator, processing information received from
features and/or components of the central status tracking system 204, processing
information received from features and/or components of the extended status tracking
system 200, processing information received from the administrator, and/or any other
desired processes.
        [0059]      In some embodiments, the memory 210 can comprise one or several
databases. The database can comprise an organized collection of digital data. The data
                                             _1 1-

stored in the database can comprise any desired data, and can, in some embodiments,
relate to functions of the extended status tracking system 200 and/or the central status
tracking system 204.
         [0060]     In some embodiments, and as depicted in Figure 2, the memory 210
comprises a plurality of databases, and specifically provides a label database 212, a user
database 214, and a payment database 216. In some embodiments, the label database 212
can comprise, for example, information relating to the label 102. This information can
include, for example, data relating to the existence of the label 102, the status of the label
102, the properties of the label 102, the identification of the label 102, the association of
the label 102 with a user and/or a user account, or any other desired information.
         [0061]     In some embodimetns, the label database 212 can be located at and/or
in the central status tracking system 204, and in some embodiments, the label database
212 can be remote from the central status tracking system 204. In some embodiments, the
label database 212 can exist within a pre-existing system, and can include information
relating to labels that are compatible with the central status tracking system 204, and/or
information relating to labels that are noncompatible with the central status tracking
system 204.     In some embodiments, for example, a label can be compatible with the
central status tracking system 204 when the label is generated by an associated user
account.     In some embodiments, for example, the label database 212 can include
information relating to every scan generated by a service provider, such as, for example,
every scan of a mail piece collected by a postal service.
         [0062]     In some embodiments the label status information stored in the label
database 212 can indicate a label status including, for example, printed, expired, pending
induction, payment due, refund, or any other desired status. In some embodiments, the
printed status can be associated with a label 102 for which information has been provided
to the user terminal 202; the expired status can be associated with a label 102 whose
information was not received by the central status tracking system 204 within a
designated time period; the pending induction status can be associated with a label 102
that has been added to the payment sheet 150 but whose information has not been
received by the central status tracking system 204; the payment due status can be
associated with a label 102 whose information has be received by the central status
tracking system 204 and for which payment has not been received; and the refund status
                                             -1 %

can be associated with a label 102 for which payment was improperly received, for which
unsatisfactory services were provided, or for which paid money should be refunded.
         [0063]     In some embodiments, the user database 214 can comprise information
relating to the user and/or the user account. In some embodiments, this information can
include, for example, account information such as an account number, a user name, a
password, or any other account identification and/or verification information. In some
embodiments, the user database 214 can comprise information relating to the account
status, including, for example account usage, account payments due, account payments
pending, account payments received, requested label 102, expired labels 102, inducted
labels 102, frequent recipients, frequent label types or label information, or any other
desired information.
         [0064]     In some embodiments, the payment database 216 can comprise
payment information. In some embodiments, this information can include, for example,
an identifier associating payment information with a user account, account payment
information, payment source, payment protocols, and/or any other desired payment
information.    The account payment information can include any information relating to
the payment status of a user account, such as, for example, the amount of payment due,
past payments made, and any other historic, current, or projected financial information.
The payment source can include, for example, identification of a source for payment, such
as, for example, a bank, a credit card, a payment service, or any other source from which
payment can be received.      In some embodiments, the payment protocols can include
instructions or information that facilitates requesting and receiving payment from a
payment source.      In some embodiments these protocols can include, for example, a
verification number, a place or method for submitting a payment request, a time interval
for making payment, or any other instructions or information that facilitates requesting
and receiving payment.
         [0065]     The central status tracking system 204 can, in some embodiments,
comprise a communications module 218 that can be communicatingly connected to the
processor 208. In some embodiments, the communications module 218 can be configured
to communicate with other extended status tracking system 200 entities, such as, for
example, the user terminal 202 and the payment terminal 206. In some embodiments, the
communications module 218 can be configured for wired or wireless communications,
and can be configured to request information and receive inputs from the user terminal
                                            -1'A-

202, the payment terminal 206, and/or components or modules of the central status
tracking system 204.
         [0066]      The central status tracking system 204 can, in some embodiments,
comprise a plurality of modules, which modules can be embodied in hardware or
software, and which can comprise a single piece or hardware or software or systems of
hardware of software. In some embodiments, these modules can be configured to receive
or generate inputs for the central status tracking system 204. In one embodiment, and as
depicted in Figure 2, the central status tracking system 204 can comprise a plurality of
modules, and can specifically comprise an administrator module 220, a scanning module
222, a tracking module 224, a security module 226, and an aggregation module 228.
         [0067]      In some embodiments, the administrator module 220 can comprise an
administrator access point.     In some embodiments, the administrator access point can
comprise any device, software, or feature capable or requesting and receiving information
from the central status tracking system 204 and providing inputs to the central status
tracking system 204. In some embodiments, the administrator access point can comprise
a terminal and/or an access portal. In some embodiments, the administrator terminal can
comprise any device capable or requesting and receiving information from the central
status tracking system 204 and providing inputs to the central status tracking system 204.
In some embodiments, the administrator terminal can comprise any device capable of
allowing an administrator to communicate with a central status tracking system 204. In
some embodiments, the administrator terminal can comprise, for example, a device
comprising a processor such as, for example, a personal computer, a laptop computer,
Smartphone, a cell phone, a tablet, or any other device including a processor. In some
embodiments, the access portal can comprise a web portal, or any other software
configured to allow an administrator to access information from the central status tracking
system 204.
         [0068]      In some embodiments, the administrator access point can be configured
to provide an administrator information relating to, for example, the history of the
extended status tracking system 200, the history of the central status tracking system 204,
statistical and/or financial reports, and payment information. In some embodiments, the
statistical reports can include, for example, use statistics for the labels 102, for the
extended and/or central status tracking systems 200, 204, for shipping, for one or several
user accounts, and/or for any other desired topic. In some embodiments, the financial
                                              Ad-

reports can relate to costs of operating the extended status tracking system 200, costs of
operating the central status tracking system 204, revenues from the use of the extended
and/or central status tracking systems 200, 204, profits for the extended and/or central
status tracking systems 200, 204, and/or any other desired financial report. The payment
information can relate to, for example, outstanding bills, paid bills, requested refunds,
disputed bills, and or any other payment related information. A person of skill in the art
will recognize that the administrator and the administrator module 220 is not limited to
the specific functions and features discussed above, but that it can have more or fewer
features and functions, and can include different combinations of the above outlined,
and/or additional features and functions.
         [0069]     In some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can comprise a device
capable of reading, scanning, and/or receiving information from the label 102. In some
embodiments, the scanning module 222 can comprise components configured to request
and/or receive information from other systems relating to labels scanned in other systems.
Thus, in some embodiments in which a label is scanned by a service provider that is not
associated with the central status tracking system 204, the scanning module 222 can be
configured to request and/or receive information relating to these scanned labels. In some
embodiments, this scanned information can be pushed to the central status tracking
system 204 by the other system, and/or, this scanned information can be requested by the
central status tracking system 204. In some embodiments, this request and/or receipt of
information can occur at regular time intervals, in response to a prompt, and/or in
response to a user input. Thus, the central status tracking system 204 can, for example,
cooperate with a foreign postal authority to receive label information that is scanned in,
for example, a foreign country.
         [0070]     In some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can comprise, for
example, a scanner, a reader, a detector, an interrogator, or any other feature configured to
read, scan, and/or receive information from the label 102.        In some embodiments the
scanning module 222 can comprise a system including one or several devices capable of
reading, scanning, and/or receiving information from a label 102, one or several
processors, memory, a communications network, and/or any other desired feature.           As
depicted in Figure 2, the scanning module 222 can be in communicating connection with
other features of the central status tracking system 204, including, for example, the
processor 208.

        [0071]      In some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can be configured to
read, scan, and/or receive information from the label 102 at some time after the label 102
has been delivered by the user to the service provider. In some embodiments, and as
discussed above, the user can deliver the label 102 to the service provider so that the
service provider can provide requested services such as delivering the label 102 and/or the
item 100.
        [0072]      In some embodiments, this information can be, for example, converted
into digital form by the scanning module and sent to the processor 208 and/or any other
desired component of the central status tracking system 204.
        [0073]      The scanning module 222 can be configured to read and/or receive
information from the label 102 at different points in a process. In some embodiments, for
example, the scanning module 222 can be configured to read, scan, and/or receive
information from the label 102 at the time the label 102 is delivered to the service
provider.   In some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can be configured to read,
scan, and/or receive information from the label 102 after the time the label 102 is
delivered to the service provider. In some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can be
configured to read, scan, and/or receive information from the label 102 while a process is
being performed on the label 102 and/or the object 104 associated with the label 102. In
some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can be configured to read, scan, and/or
receive information from the label 102 before the label 102 and/or the object 104
associated with the label 102 is removed from processing, such as when the label 102
and/or object 104 associated with the label 102 is delivered by a postal authority to a
designated recipient.    Thus, in some embodiments, the scanning module 222 can be
configured to read, scan, and/or receive information from the label 102 at any time that
the label 102 is in the possession of the service provider after the label 102 and/or the
object 104 associated with the label 102 has been delivered to the service provider,
including before, during, or after processing of the label 102 and/or the associated object
104.
        [0074]      In some embodiments, the tracking module 224 can comprise, for
example, a system of one or several sensors, a database, and a processor configured to
receive data relating to the label 102 and to track processing performed in accordance
with the data relating to the label 102. In some embodiments, the data relating to the label
102 can be compiled from the label 102. In some specific embodiments, the data relating
                                             -1 CN

to the label 102 can be compiled, for example, into a manifest listing the label 102 and
any required processing associated with the label 102.        The manifest can be used to
facilitate organization and tracking of a plurality of labels 102, and thus, in some
embodiments, information relating to a plurality of labels 102 can be compiled into the
manifest.
         [0075]    In some embodiments, the security module 226 can comprise, for
example, features and components configured to detect and prevent fraud.         In some
embodiments, the security module 226 can prevent fraudulent payments, fraudulent label
requests, erroneous label requests, and or any other desired function.
         [0076]    In some embodiments, the security module 226 can provide security
benefits to the user, and in some embodiments, the security module 226 can provide
security benefits for the operator of the extended status tracking system 200.    In some
embodiments, the security module 226 can be configured to prevent fraud associated with
a user account, such as, for example, the use of labels associated with an invalid user
account, payment fraud, such as, for example, the use of a stolen credit card or payment
information to transact a payment, and to prevent label fraud, such as, for example,
photocopying and/or reusing a single label.
         [0077]    In one embodiment in which the security module 226 is configured to
prevent improper object 104 labeling, the security module 226 can comprise sampling
features configured to sample all or a portion of labels 102 to determine if the sampled
labels 102 include proper information. This sampling can detect erroneous labeling, such
as when the payment amount associated with the label 102 is insufficient to cover the
requested services, fraudulent labeling such as when a user systematically improperly
labels objects 103, or any other improper labeling practice. In some embodiments, the
sampling can detect the payment specified by the label 102, the services requested by the
label 102, and label and/or object attributes to determine the proper payment amount. In
some embodiments, the security module can compare the calculated payment amount with
the payment amount indicated by the label 102 and determine if the label 102 was
improper. In some embodiments, the security module 226 can determine that labeling is
improper when the payment indicated by the label is more than approximately 10 percent
different from the proper payment amount, more that approximately 5 percent different
from the proper payment amount, more than approximately 2 percent different from the
proper payment amount, more than approximately 1 percent different from the proper
                                            -17-

payment amount, more than approximately 0.5 percent different from the proper payment
amount, or more than any other desired difference between the calculated payment
amount and the payment amount indicated by the label 102. A person of skill in the art
will recognize that the security module 226 can comprise a variety of features and
perform a variety of functions, and that the security module is not limited to the above
enumerated features and functions.
         [0078]     In some embodiments, the security module 226 can be configured to
provide information to the processor 208, which can, based on instructions found in the
memory 210, determine a fraudulent event, and take action to mitigate any loss associated
with the fraudulent event. In some embodiments, this loss mitigation can include, for
example, notifying a customer of fraudulent activity, notifying a payment institution of
fraudulent activity, notifying an item recipient of fraudulent activity, requesting payment
from an account holder and/or from a recipient, seizing the item associated with the fraud,
and/or any other desired action.
         [0079]     In some embodiments of a central status tracking system 204 in which
the central status tracking system 204 cooperates with other systems to request and
receive information, the aggregation module 228 can be configured to request and/or
receive this information from the other systems.        In some specific embodiments, for
example, the aggregation module 228 can be configured to query memory and/or a
database that is not part of the central status tracking system 204 for information relating
to, for example, a scan event, a user account, payment information, security information,
and/or any other desired information. In some embodiments, the aggregation module 228
can be configured to sort information from the memory and/or a database that is not part
of the central status tracking system 204 to determine whether the information in the
memory and/or database not associated with the central status tracking system 204 relates
to labels that are compatible with the central status tracking system 204.           In some
embodiments, this information can be collected from the memory and/or a database that is
not associated with the central status tracking system at a regular interval, in response to a
prompt and/or user request, or in any other desired fashion.
         [0080]     A person of skill in the art will recognize that the extended status
tracking system 200 and/or the central status tracking system 204 can comprise more or
fewer features, components, and/or modules than those outlined above, and can be
capable of performing more of fewer functions than those outlined above.

Operation of the Status Tracking System
        [0081]      The extended status tracking system 200 and the central status tracking
system 204 can be used in connection with the label 102 to track the label 102.
        [0082]      Figure 3 is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a tracking
process 300 for tracking the status of a label 102. In some embodiments, the process 300
is performed by the central status tracking system 204. The process begins at block 302
and moves to block 304 where a request is received for an electronic version of the label
102. In some embodiments, the electronic version of the label 102 corresponds to the
label 102 in digital format.     In response, the electronic version of the label 102 is
provided.    In some embodiments in which the tracking process 300 is being performed
by the central status tracking system 204, the request for the electronic version of the label
102 can be, for example, received by the central status tracking system 204, and
specifically received by the communications module 218 of the central status tracking
system 204.     In some embodiments, the electronic version of the label 102 can be
provided    by the    central  status tracking     system 204,    and specifically    by the
communications module 218 of the central status tracking system 204 to the user terminal
202.
        [0083]      The process 304 then proceeds to block 306 wherein the central status
tracking system 204 identifies the label status in the label database 212.           In some
embodiments, the label status can be identified in the label database 212 of the central
status tracking system 204 by adding an identifier indicating the label status to the label
database 212.
        [0084]      The process 300 proceeds to block 308 and transacts payment. In some
embodiments, payment can be transacted in response to the inclusion of an identifier in
the label database 212 identifying a specified label status.     In some embodiments, the
payment can be transacted between the central status tracking system 204 and the
payment terminal 206.
        [0085]      After payment is transacted in block 308, the process 300 terminates at
block 310. A person of skill in the art will recognize that the tracking process 300 for
tracking a label 102 can include some or all of the above discussed steps, as well as steps
additional to the above requested steps. A person of skill in the art will further recognize
that the tracking process 300 for tracking a label 102 can include the above listed steps
performed in any order, including in an order different than that shown above.

        [0086]      Figure 3a is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a process 350
using the user terminal 202 to interact with the central status tracking system 204 to create
and use a label. The process 350 begins at block 352 when the user terminal 202 requests
an electronic version of the label 102 from the central status tracking system 204.          In
some embodiments, information for inclusion in the label 102 can be submitted to the
central status tracking system 204 with the request for the electronic version of the label
102. In some embodiments, the information submitted with the request for the electronic
version of the label 102 can be used to at least partially generate the electronic version of
the label 102.      In some embodiments, the submitted information can include an
origination address and/or a destination address.        In some embodiments, information
submitted with the request for the electronic version of the label 102 can include an object
description, including a description of the nature of the object, of the size of the object, of
the weight of the object, or of any other attribute of the object 104.                In some
embodiments, the information submitted with the request for the electronic version of the
label 102 can include, for example, information relating to requested services, such as a
class of services, a time period for providing services, insurance, service tracking,
confirmation of completion of performance of requested services, or any other service
request or designation. In some embodiments, the request for the electronic version of the
label 102 can include pricing information for the requested services, customs information
to allow providing services across national boundaries, or any other desired information.
A person of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of information can be provided
with the request for the electronic version of the label 102, and that the present disclosure
is not limited to the above specifically enumerated types of information that can be
provided with the request for the electronic version of the label 102.
        [0087]      After the request for the electronic version of the label 102, the process
350 moves to block 354 and the user terminal 202 provides account information to the
central status tracking system 204. In some embodiments, the account information can be
stored in the memory of the user terminal 202, or can be provided to the user terminal 202
by the user.   In some embodiments, this account information can include, for example, a
user name, a password, an account number, or any other information that identifies the
user account.
        [0088]      After the account information is provided to the central status tracking
system 204 in block 354, the process 350 moves to block 356 and the user terminal 202
                                             -iM-

receives the electronic version of the label 102. In some embodiments, the electronic
version of the label 102 can be received from the central status tracking system 204, and
can include some or all of the information that was submitted with the request for the
electronic version of the label 102 and/or information generated by central status tracking
system 204.
        [0089]      After the electronic version of the label 102 is received in block 356,
the process 350 moves to block 358 and the user terminal 202 creates the physical label
102. In some embodiments, the user terminal 202 can create the physical label 102 by
printing the physical label 102, and/or by directing the printing of the physical label.
        [0090]      After the label 102 is created in block 358, the process 350 moves to
block 310 and the user terminal 202 requests generation of the electronic version of the
payment sheet 150 and then receives the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 from
the central status tracking system 204. In some embodiments, the electronic version of
the payment sheet 150 can comprise the digitized version of the payment sheet 150.
        [0091]      The payment sheet 150 can include information relating to one or
several labels 102, and information, such as information that uniquely identifies the
payment sheet 150. In some embodiments, the central status tracking system 204 can
query the label database 212 for label information in response to the request for
generation of the electronic version of the payment sheet 150. In some embodiments, the
user can select which label information will be included in the electronic version of the
payment sheet 150.      In such an embodiment, the central status tracking system 204
requests the user to select label information for inclusion in the payment sheet 150 and the
user selects label information for inclusion in the payment sheet 150.
        [0092]      In some embodiments, information relating to the one or several labels
102 for inclusion in the payment sheet 150 is submitted with the request for the
generation of the payment sheet 150, and in some embodiments, the information relating
to the one or several labels 102 for inclusion in the payment sheet 150 is generated by the
central status tracking system 204.
        [0093]      In some embodiments, after the central status tracking system 204 has
generated the electronic version of the payment sheet 150, the electronic version of the
payment sheet 150 can be received by the user terminal 202.
        [0094]      After the request for generation of the payment sheet 150 and the
receipt of the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 in block 360, the process 350

moves to block 362 and the user terminal 202 creates the physical version payment sheet
150. In some embodiments, the physical version of the payment sheet 150 can be created
by, for example, printing the physical version of the payment sheet 150.
         [0095]      After the physical version of the payment sheet 150 is created in block
362, the process 350 moves to block 634 and the label 102 is delivered to the service
provider. In some embodiments, the delivery of the label 102 to the service provider can
correspond to the delivery of the label 102, or the object 104 bearing the label 102 to the
service provider.     In some embodiments, the service provider can include a postal
authority.
         [0096]      After the label 102 is delivered in block 362, the process 350 moves to
block 366 and receives the payment request and/or request for other action, including, for
example, a notification of the completion of the providing of the requested services, a
prompt for further input, or any other action, from the central status tracking system 204.
In some embodiments, the payment request may be received directly at the user terminal
202, and in some embodiments, the payment request may be received at the payment
terminal 206.
         [0097]      After the payment request is received in block 366, the process 350
moves to block 368 and the payment is transacted. In some embodiments, the payment
can be transacted between the payment terminal 206 and the central status tracking system
204. In some embodiments, transacting payment in the central status tracking system 204
may comprise receiving a down payment, installment payments, or the like. For example,
a first percentage of the payment may be required when the label is requested, such as
following blocks 352 and 354. In some embodiments, the process 300 may not continue
until the first percentage payment is received. In some embodiments, a second percentage
of the payment may be requested and made following delivery of the label, such as after
block 364. After the payment has been transacted, the process 350 terminates at block
370. A person of skill in the art will recognize that the process 350 for tracking a label
102 can include some or all of the above discussed steps, as well as steps additional to the
above requested steps.      A person of skill in the art will further recognize that the process
350 for tracking a label 102 can include the above listed steps performed in any order,
including in an order different than that shown above.
         [0098]      Figure 3b is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a process 380
for using a central status tracking system to provide integral delivery and return service.

In some embodiments, for example, the process 380 can be used in connection with a
return service, such as, for example, providing a simple method of return for a purchased
item. In some embodiments, the process 380 can be used in connection with a service
sold with a product, such as, for example, a shipping service integrally associated with a
purchased item.
         [0099]     In some embodiments in which the process 380 is used in connection
with a return service, a label 102 can be generated and included with a purchased item. In
the event that the purchaser wishes to return the item, the label 102 can be used to provide
payment for the return service.
         [0100]     In some embodiments in which the process 380 is used in connection
with a service sold with a product, the sold product can include the label 102. In the event
that the service associated with the sold product is used, the label 102 can be used to
provide payment for the associated service. By way of example, a card, such as, for
example, a get-well card, may bear a label 102 that can be used to provide payment for a
designated delivery service. In some embodiments, the cost of the card can be adjusted to
include the cost of the designated delivery service. In such an embodiment, a purchaser
would not need to purchase separate postage to mail the card, but could rather use the
label 102 to provide payment for the delivery service.
         [0101]     Referring again to Figure 3b, the process 380 begins at block 382 and
the central status tracking system 204 generates label information associated with a
service. In some embodiments, the generation of the electronic version of the label 102
can include, for example, formatting information received from the user terminal 202,
including information received from the user terminal 202 with the request for the
electronic version of the label 102. Generation of the electronic version of the label 102
can also include converting information received from the user terminal 202, including
information received from the user terminal 202 with the request for the electronic
version of the label 102, into computer readable coding, and/or verifying destination
address, price, class requests, and service requests. In some embodiments, the generation
of the electronic version of the label 102 can further comprise generating information that
uniquely identifies the user account associated with the label 102 and/or uniquely
identifies the label 102. In some embodiments, the information that uniquely identifies
the user account and/or uniquely identifies the label 102 can be converted to any desired

format including, for example, text, text string, computer readable code, or any other
format.
         [0102]      In some embodiments, the generation of the electronic version of the
label 102 can further comprise, for example, formatting the electronic version of the label
102 so that it is in the desired format.
         [0103]      The process 380 then proceeds to block 384 and the central status
tracking system 204 adds the generated label information and an identifier of a first label
status to a first database. In some embodiments, the first label status corresponds to the
generation of the electronic version of the label 102, and can, for example, be a status
indicating the existence of the electronic version of the label 102.
         [0104]      The process 380 then proceeds to block 386 and the central status
tracking system 204 determines the cost associated with the requested service. In some
embodiments, this cost can be an actual cost, an average cost, and/or an estimated cost. In
some embodiments, for example, when all of the variables associated with the requested
service are known, the cost can be an actual cost. Thus, for example, in embodiments in
which the item weight, size, the shipping distance, and the requested shipping service are
known, such as, when an item of known physical properties is being sent from a known
induction point to a known delivery point, the cost can be the exact cost.          Such an
embodiment may, for example, occur with the returning of a purchased item.
         [0105]      In some embodiments in which some or all of the variables associated
with the requested service are not known, and in which no data exists as to past provided
services, the cost can comprise an estimated cost. Advantageously, the use of labels 102
compatible with the central status tracking system 204 can allow the collection of
information relating to the provided services, such as, for example, the physical properties
of a shipped item and the shipping services. This information can be collected and used
to update the estimated costs to more accurately reflect the actual costs associated with
the provided service.
         [0106]      In some embodiments in which some or all of the variables associated
with the requested services are not known, and in which data exists relating to past
provided services, the cost can comprise an average expected cost based on past provided
services.    As with the estimated costs, the average cost can be updated based on
information collected by the central status tracking system 204 to more accurately reflect
the cost of provided services.

        [0107]       After the cost associated with the requested services is determined, the
process 380 proceeds to block 388 and the central status tracking system 204 associates
the cost information with the label information. In some embodiments, for example, the
cost information can be associated with the label information by inputting an indicator of
the cost information into the first database.
        [0108]       The process 380 then proceeds to block 390 and the central status
tracking system 204 receives an indicator of a status change of the label 102. In some
embodiments, this indication of the label status change can originate from one of the
modules of the central status tracking system 204, including, for example, the scanning
module 222. In some embodiments, the indication of a label status change can comprise
an electronic signal communicated from the scanning module 222 to the processor 208 of
the central status tracking system 204 indicating that the label 102 has been delivered to
the service provider and has been read, scanned, and or received by the scanning module
222. The processor 208 can, in some embodiments, receive this signal and identify the
label 102 corresponding to the signal and the label status change corresponding to the
signal.
        [0109]       The process 380 then proceeds to block 392 and the central status
tracking system 204 updates the label status in the first database to reflect the changed
label status. In some embodiments in which the change in label status corresponds to the
providing of services or to the receipt of a label 102 for providing service, the update of
the label status in the first database can trigger payment processes.
        [0110]       If the change in the label status triggers the start of a payment
transaction, then the process 380 proceeds to block 394 and the central status tracking
system 204 retrieves the cost information associated with the label 102. The process 380
then proceeds to block 396 and central status tracking system 204 requests payment. The
process 380 then terminates at block 398.
        [0111]       Figure 4 is a flow chart illustrating another embodiment of a process
400 for tracking a status of a label. In some embodiments the status of the label 102 can
change during the tracking, which status change can trigger the performance of an act by
the central status tracking system 204. In one embodiment, the change in the status of the
label 102, such as when the label 102 is received by the service provider or when the
service provider provides the requested services, can trigger a payment transaction. The

process 400 depicted in Figure 4 is similar to the process depicted in Figure 3, but
includes additional and different steps than depicted in Figure 3.
        [0112]       The process 400 begins at block 402 and proceeds to block 404 where
the central status tracking system 204 identifies the user. The user can be identified based
on information submitted by the user terminal 202 to the central status tracking system
204. This submitted information can comprise a variety of information types. In some
embodiments, the submitted information can include identification indicia such as, for
example, a username, a password, an account number, or any other identifier.
        [0113]       The tracking process 400 then proceeds to block 406 where the central
status tracking system 204 receives a request for the electronic version of the label 102
from the user terminal 202 and provides electronic version of the label 102 to the user
terminal 202. In some embodiments the request for the electronic version of the label 102
can be received by the communications module 218 of the central status tracking system
204. In some embodiments, the electronic version of the label 102 can be provided to the
user terminal by the communications module 218 of the central status tracking system
204.
        [0114]       The tracking process 400 then proceeds to block 408 where the central
status processing system 204 identifies a first label status in the label database 212. In
some embodiments, the first label status corresponds to the generation of the electronic
version of the label 102, and can, for example, a status indicating the existence of the
electronic version of the label 102.
        [0115]       The tracking process 400 then proceeds to block 410 where the
processor 208 of the central status tracking system 204 receives an indication of a label
status change.     In some embodiments, this indication of the label status change can
originate from one of the modules of the central status tracking system 204, including, for
example, the scanning module 222. In some embodiments, the indication of a label status
change can comprise an electronic signal communicated from the scanning module 222 to
the processor 208 of the central status tracking system 204 indicating that the label 102
has been delivered to the service provider and has been read, scanned, and or received by
the scanning module 222.       The processor 208 can, in some embodiments, receive this
signal and identify the label 102 corresponding to the signal and the label status change
corresponding to the signal.

         [0116]     The tracking process 400 then proceeds to block 412 where the second
label status, corresponding to the change in the label status, is identified in the first
database.    In some embodiments, this change in label status can be identified in a first
database    associated with the central status tracking system 204, and in some
embodiments, this change in label status can be identified in a first database that is
accessible by the aggregation module 228.
         [0117]     In embodiments in which the change in the label status corresponds to
the delivery of the label 102 to the service provider and the providing of requested
services, the status change may trigger, for example, the start of a payment transaction. If
the change in the label status triggers the start of a payment transaction, then the process
400 proceeds to block 414 where payment is transacted. The tracking process 400 then
terminates at block 416.      A person of skill in the art will recognize that the tracking
process 400 for tracking a label 102 can include some or all of the above discussed steps,
as well as steps additional to the above requested steps. A person of skill in the art will
further recognize that the tracking process 400 for tracking a label 102 can include the
above listed steps performed in any order, including in an order different than that shown
above.
         [0118]     Figure 5 is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of the process for
identifying a user defined by block 404 of Figure 4. The process 500 begins at block 502
and proceeds to block 504 wherein user identification information is requested. In some
embodiments, the central status tracking system 204 can request user identification
information from the user terminal 202.        In some embodiments, the request for user
identification information can be in response to a signal received from user terminal 202.
         [0119]     The process 500 then moves to block 506 wherein user identification
information is requested from the user terminal 202.          As discussed above, the user
identification information can comprise any information that identifies a user and/or a
user account.     As also discussed above, this information can be provided by the user
and/or can be stored on the user terminal 202 or other user accessible computing and/or
storage device. In some embodiments, this information is received by the central status
tracking system 204 from the user terminal 202, and can, in some embodiments, be
received by the communications module 218 of the central status tracking system 204
from the user terminal 202.

         [0120]     The process 500 then proceeds to block 508 where the user and/or user
account is matched with the received user information.          In some embodiments, the
processor 208 can receive the user identification information from the user terminal 202
via the communicatons module 218. In some embodiments, the processor 208 can query
the user database 214 to determine if the received user information matches any of the
stored information identifying a user and/or a user account. In some embodiments, the
processor 208 can query the user database 214 for user and/or user account information.
Once the processor 208 has received the user and/or user account information from the
user database 214, the processor 208 matches the user and/or user account information
from the user database 214 with the information received from the user terminal 202. If
the information received from the user terminal 202 matches information received from
the user database 214, then the processor 208 identifies a user and/or user account and
proceeds to block 406 of Figure 4. If the information received from the user terminal 202
does not match information retrieved from the user database 214, then the process can
terminate at block 510, or can direct the user to open a new user account (not depicted).
         [0121]     A person of skill in the art will recognize that the process 500 for
identifying a user can include some or all of the above discussed steps, as well as steps
additional to the above requested steps. A person of skill in the art will further recognize
that the tracking process 500 for identifying a user can include the above listed steps
performed in any order, including in an order different than that shown above.
         [0122]     Figure 6 is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a process for
receiving a request for label information at the central status tracking system 204 and for
providing label information to the user terminal 202 as defined in block 406 of Figure 4.
The process 600 begins at block 602 and proceeds to block 604 wherein a request is
received for the electronic version of the label 102.       As discussed, this request can
originate at the user terminal 202 and can be communicated to the central status tracking
system 204. In some embodiments, this request can be communicated to the central status
tracking system 204 via the communication system or network 205.                    In some
embodiments, the request can be received from the user terminal 202 by the central status
tracking system 204 at the communications module 218 and communicated to the
processor 208. In some embodiments, this request for the electronic version of the label
102 can be made in response to a prompt from the user terminal 202 and/or the central
status tracking system 204 for such a request.

        [0123]      In some embodiments, the request for the electronic version of the
label 102 can include information for inclusion on the electronic version of the label 102.
In some embodiments, for example, a request for the electronic version of the label 102
can include a submission of an origination address and/or a destination address. In some
embodiments, for example, the request for the electronic version of the label 102 can
include an object description, including description of the nature of the object, of the size
of the object, of the weight of the object, or of any other attribute of the object 104. In
some embodiments, the request for the electronic version of the label 102 can include, for
example, information relating to requested services, such as a class of services, a time
period for providing services, insurance, service tracking, confirmation of completion of
performance of requested services, or any other service request or designation. In some
embodiments, the request for label information can include pricing information for the
requested services, customs information to allow providing services across national
boundaries, or any other desired information. A person of skill in the art will recognize
that a variety of information can be provided with the label request, and that the present
disclosure is not limited to the above specifically enumerated types of information that
can be provided with the request for label information.
        [0124]      After the request for the electronic version of the label 102 has been
received by the central status tracking system 204, the process 600 proceeds to decision
state 606 wherein a determination is made as to whether the user account is in good
standing. In some embodiments, this determination can include, for example, the central
status tracking system 204 querying the user database 214 and/or querying the payment
database 216 for information relating to whether the user account is active, whether the
user account is current on outstanding payments, whether the balance of payments due is
above some threshold, whether the account use is outside of some predetermine range, or
any other desired factor. If the user account is not in good standing, the process 600
terminates at block 608.
        [0125]      If the user account is in good standing, as determined by decision state
606, then the process 600 moves to block 610 where the central status tracking system
204 generates the electronic version of the label 102.          In some embodiments, the
generation of the electronic version of the label 102 can include, for example, formatting
information received from the user terminal 202, including information received from the
user terminal 202 with the request for the electronic version of the label 102, converting
                                              -1)0-

information received from the user terminal 202, including information received from the
user terminal 202 with the request for the electronic version of the label 102, into
computer readable coding, and/or verifying destination address, price, class requests, and
service requests. In some embodiments, the generation of the electronic version of the
label 102 can further comprise generating information that uniquely identifies the user
account associated with the label 102 and/or uniquely identifies the label 102. In some
embodiments, the information that uniquely identifies the user account and/or uniquely
identifies the label 102 can be converted to any desired format including, for example,
text, text string, computer readable code, or any other format.
         [0126]      In some embodiments, the generation of the electronic version of the
label 102 can further comprise, for example, formatting the electronic version of the label
102 so that it is in the desired format.
         [0127]      After the label information is generated in block 610, the process 600
proceeds to block 612 where the central status tracking system 204 provides the electronic
version of the label 102 to the user terminal 202. In some embodiments, the electronic
version of the label 102 can be provided to the user in a variety of fashions, including, for
example, by communicating the electronic version of the label 102 from the central status
tracking system 204 to the user terminal 202. In some embodiments, the user can use the
electronic version of the label 102 information to create the physical version of the label
102 such as, for example, by printing the physical version of the label 102, and, can attach
the physical version of the label 102 to the object 104 such as, for example, by adhering
the physical version of the label 102 to the object 104 and/or by printing the physical
version of the label 102 on the object 104.
         [0128]      After the electronic version of the label 102 is provided to the user
terminal in block 612, the process 600 moves to decision state 614 wherein the central
status tracking system 204 determines the number of created labels.                 In some
embodiments, a single label can be created at a time, and in some embodiments, multiple
labels can be created at one time.
         [0129]      After the number of created labels is determined, the process 600
proceeds to decision state 616 and the central status tracking system 204 determines if the
number of created labels requires a payment sheet 150. In some embodiments, a payment
sheet 150 may be required if, for example, more than one label is created at one time.

Advantageously, requiring the use of a payment sheet 150 can facilitate the induction of
multiple items.
        [0130]      If the central status tracking system 204 determines that the number of
labels does not require the creation of a payment sheet 150, then the process proceeds to
decision state 618 and the central status tracking system 204 determines if the generation
of the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 is requested.
        [0131]      If the creation of the payment sheet 150 has not been requested, the
process 600 moves to decision state 620 and the central status tracking system 204
determines whether to proceed. In some embodiments, this determination can be made,
for example, by prompting the user whether he wants to proceed, and proceeding based on
the user input. If it is determined to not proceed, then the process 600 terminates at block
622. If it is determined to proceed, then the process 600 moves to block 630 and proceeds
to block 408 of Figure 4.
        [0132]      Returning again to decision state 616, if it is determined that the
number of created labels requires a payment sheet, then the process 600 proceeds to block
624 and the processor 208 requests and receives information for the generation of the
electronic version of the payment sheet 150. Similarly, if it is determined at decision state
618 that the creation of the payment sheet is requested, the process 600 proceeds to block
624 and the processor 208 requests and receives information for the generation of the
electronic version of the payment sheet 150.
        [0133]      In some embodiments, the information for the generation of the
electronic version of the payment sheet 150 can be requested from the user terminal 202,
or from one of the modules or database of the central status tracking system such as the
label database 212. In some embodiments, the requested information can comprise, for
example, one or several electronic versions of the label 102 generated by the central status
tracking system 204.
        [0134]      After the process 600 requests and receives information for generation
of the electronic version of the payment sheet 150, the process 600 moves to block 626
where the central status tracking system 204 generates the electronic version of the
payment sheet 150.
        [0135]      In some embodiments, the generation of the electronic version of the
payment sheet 150 can include, for example, formatting information from the generated
electronic versions of the labels 102, converting information from the generated electronic

versions of the labels 102 into computer readable coding, and/or verifying destination
address, price, class requests, and service requests. In some embodiments, the generation
of the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 can further comprise generating
information that uniquely identifies the user account associated with the payment sheet
150 and/or uniquely identifies the payment sheet 150.           In some embodiments, the
information that uniquely identifies the user account and/or uniquely identifies the
payment sheet 150 can be converted to any desired format including, for example, text,
text string, computer readable code, or any other format.
         [0136]      After the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 is generated in
block 620, the process 600 moves to block 628 where the central status tracking system
204 provides the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 to the user terminal 202. In
some embodiments, the payment sheet 150 can be provided to the user in a variety of
ways, including, for example, by communicating the payment sheet 150 information from
the central status tracking system 204 to the user terminal 202. In some embodiments, the
user can use the payment sheet 150 information to produce the payment sheet 150 such as,
for example, by printing the payment sheet 150.
         [0137]      After the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 is provided by the
central status tracking system 204 to the user terminal 202 in block 628, then the process
600 proceeds to block 630 and continues at block 408 of Figure 4. A person of skill in the
art will recognize that the process 600 for receiving a request for label information and for
providing label information can include some or all of the above discussed steps, as well
as steps additional to the above requested steps. A person of skill in the art will further
recognize that the process 600 for receiving a request for label information and for
providing label information can include the above listed steps performed in any order,
including in an order different than that shown above.
         [0138]      Figure 7 is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a process for
indicating label status in a first database as defined in blocks 408-412 of Figure 4. In
some embodiments, and as depicted in Figure 7, the process 700 begins at block 704 after
the generation of the electronic version of the label 102, and the processor 208 adds an
indication of the generation of the electronic version of the label to the label database 212.
In some embodiments, the indication of the generation of the electronic version of the
label 102 can include an indication of the time and/or date of the generation of the
electronic version of the label 102 to the label database 212. In some embodiments, this

indication can uniquely identify the created label 102, can identify the user account,
and/or provide any other desired information relating to the label 102.
         [0139]     After the indication of the generation of the electronic version of the
label 102 has been added to the label database 212 by the processor 208, the process 700
continues to decision state 706 where the processor 208 determines if a designated time
has passed since the generation of the electronic version of the label 102.           In some
embodiments, the process 700 can be configured such that a label status is provided for
labels   102 that have not been used within a designated time-frame.                 In some
embodiments, it can be determined in decision state 706 whether the designate time frame
has passed, and if the label status should be updated to indicate that the designated time
frame has passed. In some embodiments, the passing of the designated time frame can
result in a change of the label status to cancelled and/or expired. If it is determined in
decision state 706 that the designated time frame has passed, then the process proceeds to
decision state 708 and the central status tracking system 204 determines if there is a valid
account associated with the label.
         [0140]     In some embodiments, this determination can include querying the user
database 214 for information relating to the status of the user account.             In some
embodiments, this determination can include a query of other portions of the memory
210. In some embodiments, this query can request information relating to recent account
activity, to payment information, or to any other indicators of a valid account.
         [0141]     If it is determined that the label 102 is associated with a valid account,
then the process 700 proceeds to block 710 and waits for the passing of a designated time
interval and then proceeds again to decision state 706.          In some embodiments, this
designated time interval can comprise any desired time interval from one or several
fractions of a second, to one or several months, or to one or several years.
         [0142]     Returning again to decision state 708, if it is determined that a valid
account is not associated with the label, then the process 700 proceeds to block 712 and
the central status tracking system 204 updates the label status indicate it is to cancelled.
In some embodiments, this updated status can be input into the label database 212. After
the label status has been updated, the process 700 terminates at block 714.           In some
embodiments, the process 700 can return to block 414 of Figure 4 and proceed as
previously indicated after block 714

         [0143]       If the designated time frame has not passed since the generation of the
electronic version of the label 102, as determined in decision state 706, the process 700
moves to decision state 716 and the processor 208 determines if the label 102 has been
added to the electronic version of the payment sheet 150. In some embodiments, and as
discussed above, information relating to one or several labels 102 can be aggregated into a
single payment sheet 150.
         [0144]       If the label 102 and/or information relating to the label 102 has not
been included in the payment sheet 150 as determined in decision state 716, then the
process 700 moves to decision state 718 and the processor 208 determines if the
generation of the electronic version of the payment sheet 150 is required.            In some
embodiments, the label 102 is usable regardless of its inclusion in the payment sheet 150,
and in some embodiments, the label 102 is only usable if it is included in the payment
sheet 150.      If inclusion in the payment sheet 150 is required as determined by the
processor at decision state 718, then the process 700 moves to block 720 and waits for the
passing of a designated time interval and then proceeds again to decision state 706. In
some embodiments, this designated time interval can comprise, for example, one or
several second, one or several minutes, one or several hours, one or several days, one or
several weeks, one or several months, and/or any other desired time interval.
         [0145]       Returning again to decision state 716, if it is determined that the label
102 has been added to the payment sheet 150, then the process 700 moves to block 722
and the processor 208 updates the label status in label database 212 to pending induction
and/or pending delivery.
         [0146]       After the label status has been updated to pending induction in block
722, or if it is determined that the payment sheet 150 is not required in decision state 718,
then the process 700 moves to decision state 724 and the processor determines if the label
information has been received by the scanning module 222. As discussed above, after the
user has printed the label 102, the label 102 can be attached to an object, and can be
received by the service provider for the performance of requested services. At some point
after the label 102 has been received by the service provider, the label 102 can be read by
the scanning module 222. If the label 102 has not been read by the scanning module 222,
then the label 102 has not been received and the process moves to block 720 and waits for
the passing of a designated time interval and then proceeds again to decision state 706. In
some embodiments, this designated time interval can comprise, for example, one or

several second, one or several minutes, one or several hours, one or several days, one or
several weeks, one or several months, and/or any other desired time interval.
         [0147]      If the label information has been read by the scanning module 222,
then the label information has been received and the process moves to block 726 where
the label status is updated to payment due. In some embodiments, the label status can be
updated in, for example, the label database 212. After the label status has been updated in
block 726, the process 700 moves to block 728 and returns to the block 414 of process
400 depicted Figure 4, and continues as outlined above. A person of skill in the art will
recognize that the process 700 for tracking a label status can include some or all of the
above discussed steps, as well as steps additional to the above requested steps. A person
of skill in the art will further recognize that the process 700 for tracking a label status in a
database can include the above listed steps performed in any order, including in an order
different than that shown above.
         [0148]      Figure 8 is a flow-chart illustrating n embodiment of the process for
transacting payment as defined in 414 of Figure 4. The process 800 begins at decision
state 802 where the processor 208 determines if the status of the label 102 indicates that a
payment is due. In some embodiments, and as discussed above, the label status is updated
to indicate that a payment is due after the label information has been received by the
central status tracking system 204. If it is determined in decision state 802 that the status
of the label 102 does not indicate that a payment is due, then the process 800 terminates at
block 804.
         [0149]      If it is determined in decision state 802 that the status of the label 102
indicates that a payment is due, then the process 800 moves to decision state 806 and the
processor 208 determines if the label information that was received by the central status
tracking system 204 to cause the status of the label 102 to change to payment due was
received from the label 102. In some embodiments, label information can be received
form the payment sheet 150 and can cause the status of the label 102 to change to indicate
that a payment is due and/or to trigger a payment transaction. In some embodiments,
receipt of the label information from the payment sheet 150 can be sufficient to proceed
with payment transaction. In some embodiments, receipt of label information from the
payment sheet 150 may only be sufficient to proceed with a payment transaction if the
label information has also been received directly from the label 102.

        [0150]      In the embodiment depicted in Figure 8, if it is determined in decision
state 806 that the label information was not received from the label 102, then the process
800 terminates at block 804.
        [0151]      If it is determined that the label information was received from the
label 102 in decision state 806, then the process 800 moves to block 808 and the
processor 208 updates the user account information with the amount of payment due. In
some embodiments this information can be added to a database such as, for example, the
user database 214 and/or the payment database 216.
        [0152]      After the user account information has been updated the user account
information with the amount of payment due in block 808, the process moves to block
810 and the processor 208 queries the payment database 216 for the payment information
associated with the user account and/or user associated with the label 102.         In some
embodiments, the database containing payment information can comprise the payment
database 216. In some embodiments, the request for payment information can comprise a
request for information relating to the source of payment, such as, for example, the name
and/or identification of the financial institution responsible for payment, a routing
number, an account number, a verification number, an account holder name, and/or any
other information required to receive payment.
        [0153]      After the database containing the payment information has been
queried at block 810, the process 800 proceeds to decision state 812 and the central status
tracking system 204 determines if the account associated with the label 102 is valid. In
some embodiments, this determination can include querying the user database 214 for
information relating to the status of the user account.        In some embodiments, this
determination can include a query of other portions of the memory 210.              In some
embodiments, this query can request information relating to recent account activity, to
payment information, or to any other indicators of a valid account.
        [0154]      If it is determined in decision state 812 that the label 102 is not
associated with a valid account, then the process 800 moves to block 814 and proceeds
with loss mitigation steps. In some embodiments, this loss mitigation can include, for
example, notifying a customer of fraudulent activity, notifying a payment institution of
fraudulent activity, notifying an item recipient of fraudulent activity, requesting payment
from an account holder and/or from a recipient, seizing the item associated with the fraud,
and/or any other desired action.

        [0155]      Returning again to decision state 812, if it is determined that the label
102 is associated with a valid account, then the process 800 moves to block 816 and
payment is requested.      This request can comprise a communication to the payment
terminal 206 from the central status tracking system 204.
        [0156]      After the payment has been requested at block 816, the process moves
to block 818 and payment is received.
        [0157]      The process then moves to block 820 and the central status tracking
system 204 determines        if the payment is timely.        In some embodiments, this
determination can be made by comparing information relating to when the payment was
received with pre-determined timeframes. In some embodiments, if payment is received
within certain timeframes, then the payment is timely. Similarly, in some embodiments, if
payment is not received within certain timeframes, then the payment is untimely.
        [0158]      The process 800 then moves to block 822 and updates the label status
and the account information. In some embodiments, the label status can be updated, for
example, to the status "paid." This update can be made, in some embodiments, by adding
an identifier to a database indicative of the changed label status. In some embodiments, a
status associated with the account can be updated. This status can be updated by adding
an identifier to a database indicative of the changed account status. In some embodiments
in which the user database 214 includes information relating to outstanding payments
associated with the user account, the user database 214 can be updated to reflect the new
balance of outstanding payments.
        [0159]      After the account information is updated in block 822, the process 800
moves to block 824 and proceeds to block 416 if process 400 as depicted in Figure 4 and
continues as previously outlined.      A person of skill in the art will recognize that the
tracking process 800 for transacting payment can include some or all of the above
discussed steps, as well as steps additional to the above requested steps. A person of skill
in the art will further recognize that the process 800 for transacting payment can include
the above listed steps performed in any order, including in an order different than that
shown above.
        [0160]      Figure 8a is a flow-chart illustrating one expanded embodiment of a
process 840 for loss mitigation performed in block 814 of Figure 8. As discussed above,
loss mitigation can include, for example, notifying a customer of fraudulent activity,
notifying a payment institution of fraudulent activity, notifying an item recipient of

fraudulent activity, requesting payment from an account holder and/or from a recipient,
seizing the item associated with the fraud, and/or any other desired action.       In some
embodiments, loss mitigation can be performed by the central status tracking system 204,
and/or other systems.
        [0161]      The process 840 begins at block 842 and the central status tracking
system determines the location of the label          102.    In some embodiments, this
determination of the location of the label 102 can include, for example, identifying the
location of the most recent scan event, or by identifying the most recent tracking
information.   This determination of the location of the label 102 can be made, for
example, by querying the scanning module 222 for information relating to the scan event,
querying the tracking module 224 for information relating to the most recent tracking
information, or by querying the aggregation module 228 for information relating to scan
events.
        [0162]      After the location of the label 102 is determined, the process 840
proceeds to block 844 and the central status tracking system 204 requests termination of
the providing of any further services. In some embodiments, this request can comprise a
communication and/or a signal indicating that services should no longer be provided for
the designated label 102. The process 840 then proceeds to block 846 and the label 102 is
seized. In some embodiments, the seizing of the label 102 can include removing the label
102 and any associated item 104 from circulation. In some embodiments, the seizing of
the label 102 can result in forfeiture procedures.
        [0163]      The process then moves to block 848 and the user is notified. In some
embodiments, this notification can comprise, for example, an email, a telephone call, and
electronic communication, or any other desired form of notification that indicates that the
label has been seized due to association with an invalid account. In some embodiments, a
label creator may be able to take steps to retrieve the seized label 102 and any item 104
associated with the label 102. Such step may comprise, for example, the creation of a
new account, payment for provided and requested services, payment of a fine, or any
other action. The process 800 then terminates at block 850.
The Manifesting Label
        [0164]      Figure 9 depicts one embodiment of a manifesting label 900.         The
manifesting label 900 can be, for example, the label produced as a result of a request for a
manifesting label from a manifesting system. A manifesting label 900 can, in some
                                              U~~

embodiments, include information received from the user, and/or information provided

not limited to embodiments including only specific sender information 904.
        [0168]      The destination information 906 can, in some embodiments, identify
the specific services desired by the sender. Specifically, as depicted in Figure 9, the
destination information 906 can identify a destination to which the manifesting label 900
should be delivered. The destination information 906 can include a variety of desired
information, including, for example, an address, identification of the label recipient, an
image, or any other desired information. A person skilled in the art will recognize that the
present disclosure is not limited to embodiments with destination information 906, and is
also not limited to embodiments including only specific destination information 906.
        [0169]      The tracking information 908 provides, in some embodiments, a
unique identification of the manifesting label 900 to allow tracking of the manifesting
label 900 as it progresses through a process and or receives requested services. In some
specific embodiments, the tracking information 908 on the manifesting label 900 can
comprise one or several of: text, a text string, a computer readable code, a barcode, and/or
any other feature configured to allow the identification of the label. As depicted in the

embodiment of Figure 9, the tracking information 908 of the manifesting label 900
comprises a text string comprising a plurality of numbers, and a linear barcode.
        [0170]      The service information 910 can, in some embodiments, provide
information regarding services requested and associated with the manifesting label 900.
In some embodiments this information can include information relating to, for example, a
service class, service timeframe, insurance coverage, or any other service related
information.    The service information 910 contained in the manifesting label 900 of
Figure 9 specifies USPS Priority Mail as the requested service.
        [0171]      The payment information 912 can, in some embodiments, comprise
information indicating transacted payment and/or indicating a responsible payer.       As
depicted in Figure 9, the payment information 912 indicates that payment has been
transacted, the source of the payment, and the manner in which payment was made.
The Manifesting System
        [0172]      Figure  10 is a block-diagram illustrating one embodiment of a
manifesting system 1000.      The manifesting system 1000 can be configured to receive
inputs from a user, generate a label 900, generate a label manifest, and transact payment.
In some embodiments, the manifesting system 1000 can perform more or fewer functions
than those listed above.
        [0173]      As depicted in Figure 10, the manifesting system 1000 can comprise,
for example, a user terminal 1002.      The user terminal 1002 can comprise any device
capable of allowing a user to communicate with a central manifesting system 1004. In
some embodiments, the user terminal 1002 can comprise, for example, a device
comprising a processor such as, for example, a personal computer, a laptop computer,
Smartphone, a cell phone, a tablet, or any other similar device.

        [0176]      The central manifesting system 1004 can comprise a variety of
components and modules capable of performing a variety of functions.            The central
manifesting system 1004 can be configured to receive inputs from components of the
manifesting system 1000 that are not included in the central manifesting system 1004, to
provide information to these components, and to perform label generation, label manifest
generation, and transact payment. In some embodiments the components and modules of
the central manifesting system 1004          can be communicatingly      connected via a
communication feature 1007. The communication feature 1007 can comprise any feature
capable of establishing a communicating connection between the features and modules of
the central manifesting system 1004 and can include, for example, a wired or wireless

prevent improper object 104 labeling, the security module 226 can comprise sampling
features configured to sample all or a portion of manifesting labels 900 to determine if the
                                             -dl;-

sampled manifesting labels 900 include proper information. This sampling can detect
erroneous labeling, such as when the payment amount associated with the manifesting
labels 900 is insufficient to cover the requested services, fraudulent labeling such as when
a user systematically improperly labels objects 104, or any other improper labeling
practice. In some embodiments, the sampling can detect the payment specified by the
manifesting labels 900, the services requested by the manifesting labels 900, and label
and/or object attributes to determine the proper payment amount.
        [0192]      In some embodiments, the security module can compare the calculated
payment amount with the payment amount indicated by the manifesting labels 900 and
determine if the manifesting labels 900 was improper. In some embodiments, the security
module 226 can determine that labeling is improper when the payment indicated by the
label is more than approximately 10 percent different from the proper payment amount,
more that approximately 5 percent different from the proper payment amount, more than
approximately 2 percent different from the proper payment amount, more than
approximately    1 percent different from the proper payment amount, more than
approximately 0.5 percent different from the proper payment amount, or more than any
other desired difference between the calculated payment amount and the payment amount
indicated by the manifesting labels 900. A person of skill in the art will recognize that the
security module 226 can comprise a variety of features and perform a variety of functions,
and that the security module is not limited to the above enumerated features and
functions.
        [0193]      A person of skill in the art will recognize that the manifesting system
and/or the central manifesting system 1004 can comprise more or fewer features,
components, and/or modules than those outlined above, and can be capable of performing
more of fewer functions than those outlined above.
Operation of the Status tracking system
        [0194]      Figure 11 is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a process for
manifesting performed by a central manifesting system 1004. In some embodiments, the
manifesting process can be configured to receive information to produce a manifesting
label 900 and store information relating to the manifesting label 900. The process 1100
begins in block 1102 where the central manifesting system 1004 receives a request for the
generation of the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 and provides the
electronic version of the manifesting label 900 to the user terminal 1002.          In some
                                             AftN

embodiments, the central manifesting system 1004 can be provided by the central
manifesting system 1004, and specifically by the communications module 1018 of the
central manifesting system 1004 to the user terminal 1002.
        [0195]      The process 1100 then moves to block 1104 where the central
manifesting system 1004 updates a database with information relating to the electronic
version of the manifesting label 900. In some embodiments, the processor 1008 updates
the manifest database 1012 with information relating to the electronic version of the
manifesting label 900. In some embodiments, the manifest database 1012 is update with
information relating to the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 including, for
example, sender information, destination information, requested service information,
price information, and/or any other desired information.
        [0196]      The process     1100 proceeds to block       1106 where the central
manifesting system 1004 transacts payment.         In some embodiments, payment can be
transacted in response to providing the electronic version of the manifesting label 900
and/or in response to updating the database with information relating to the electronic
version of the manifesting label 900.
        [0197]      After payment is transacted in block 1106, the process 1100 terminates
at block 1108.     A person of skill in the art will recognize that the process 1100 for
operating the manifesting system 1000 can include some or all of the above discussed
steps, as well as steps additional to the above requested steps. A person of skill in the art
will further recognize that the process 1100 for operating the manifesting system 1000 can
include the above listed steps performed in any order, including in an order different than
that shown above.
        [0198]      Figure 12 is a flow-chart illustrating one embodiment of a process
1200 for using a central manifesting system 1004.       In some embodiments, the process
1200 is performed by the user terminal 1002. In some embodiments, and as depicted in
Figure 12, the process 1200 begins at block 1202 and the user terminal 1002 requests the
generation of the electronic version of the manifesting label 900.         The request for
generation of the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 can be communicated
from the user terminal 1002 to the central manifesting system 1004.
        [0199]      After the request for the electronic version of the manifesting label
900, the process 1200 moves to block 1204 and the user terminal 1002 provides account
information to the central manifesting system 1004. In some embodiments, the account
                                             _7_

information can be stored in the memory of the user terminal 1002, or it can be provided
to the user terminal 1002 by the user.     In some embodiments, this account information
can include, for example, a user name, a password, an account number, or any other
information that identifies the user account.
        [0200]     After the account information is provided to the central manifesting
system 1004 in block 1204, the process 1200 moves to block 1206 and the user terminal
provides information for inclusion on the manifesting label 900.
        [0201]     In some embodiments, the information for inclusion on the manifesting
label 900 can include sender information 904 and/or destination information 906, an
object description, including description of the nature of the object, of the size of the
object, of the weight of the object, or of any other attribute of an object that will be
associated with the manifesting label 900, pricing information for the requested services,
customs information to allow providing services across national boundaries, or any other
desired information.     A person of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of
information can be provided, and that the present disclosure is not limited to the above
specifically enumerated types of information.
        [0202]     After providing information for inclusion in the manifesting label 900
in block 1206, the process 1200 moves to block 1208 and the user terminal 1002 receives
the electronic version of the manifesting label 900. In some embodiments, receiving the
electronic version of the manifesting label 900 can comprise receiving unformatted
information from the central manifesting system 1004 that is formatted by the user
terminal 1002, or receiving a formatted electronic version of the manifesting label 900. In
some embodiments, the manifesting label 900 can be received from the central
manifesting system 1004, and can include some or all of the provided manifesting label
information and/or information generated by central manifesting system 1004.
        [0203]     After the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 is received by
the user terminal 1002 in block 1208, the process 1200 moves to block 1210 and the user
terminal creates the physical version of the manifesting label and/or prints the physical
version of the manifesting label 900.       The process 1200 then moves to block 1212
wherein the payment request is received. In some embodiments, the payment request may
be received directly at the user terminal 1002, and in some embodiments, the payment
request may be received at the payment terminal 1006.

         [0204]     After the payment request is received in block 1212, the process 1200
moves to block 1214 where the payment is transacted, after which the process terminates
at block 1216.    A person of skill in the art will recognize that the process 1200 for using
the manifesting system can include some or all of the above discussed steps, as well as
steps additional to the above requested steps.       A person of skill in the art will further
recognize that the process 1200 for using the manifesting system can include the above
listed steps performed in any order, including in an order different than that shown above.
         [0205]     Figure 13 is a flow-chart illustrating another embodiment of a process
1300 is a flow-chart illustrating another embodiment of a process for manifesting
performed by a central manifesting system.          The process 1300 can be configured to
identify a user, generate a manifesting label 900, update a database with information from
the manifesting label 900, and transact a payment. In some embodiments, the process
1300 can be performed by the central manifesting system 1004.
         [0206]     The process 1300 begins at block 1302 where the central manifesting
system 1004 receives user information from the user terminal. As discussed above, the
user information can comprise any information that identifies a user and/or a user
account. As also discussed above, this information can be provided by the user and/or can
be stored on the user terminal 1002 or other user accessible computing and/or storage
device.    In some embodiments, this information is received by the central manifesting
system 1004 from the user terminal 1002, and can, in some embodiments, be received by
the communications module 1018 of the central status tracking system 1004 from the user
terminal 1002
         [0207]     After the user information is received at the central manifesting system
900, the process 1300 moves to block 1306 wherein the user and/or user account
information is matched with the received user information. In some embodiments, the
processor 1008 can receive the user identification information from the user terminal
1002 via the communications module 1018. In some embodiments, the processor 1008
can query the user database 1014 to determine if the received user information matches
any of the stored information identifying a user and/or a user account.             In some
embodiments, the processor 1008 can query the user database 1014 for user and/or user
account information. Once the processor 1008 has received the user and/or user account
information from the user database 1014, the processor 1008 matches the user and/or user
account information from the user database 1014 with the information received from the

user terminal 1002.     If the information received from the user terminal 1002 matches
information received from the user database 1014, then the processor 1008 identifies a
user and/or user account and proceeds to block 1306. If the information received from the
user terminal 1002 does not match information retrieved from the user database 1014 then
the process 1300 can terminate, or can direct the user to open a new user account.
        [0208]      After information received from the user terminal 1002 is successfully
matched with information retrieved from the user database 1014, the process 1300
proceeds to block 1306 where the central manifesting system 1004 receives a request for
the generation of the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 from the user
terminal 1002. In some embodiments, the electronic version of the manifesting label 900
can comprise the digital form of the manifesting label 900. In some embodiment, the
electronic version of the manifesting label 900 can have the same formatting as the
physical version of the manifesting label, different formatting, or be unformatted.
        [0209]      After the request for the generation of the electronic version of the
manifesting label 900 is received, the process moves to block 1308 where the central
manifesting system 1004 receives information for inclusion on the manifesting label 900
from the user terminal.      In some embodiments, this information can be stored in the
memory of the user terminal 1002, or can be entered into the user terminal 1002 by the
user. In some embodiments, this information can include sender information 904 and/or
destination information 906, an object description, including description of the nature of
the object, of the size of the object, of the weight of the object, or of any other attribute of
an object that will be associated with the manifesting label 900, pricing information for
the requested services, customs information to allow providing services across national
boundaries, or any other desired information. A person of skill in the art will recognize
that a variety of information can be provided, and that the present disclosure is not limited
to the above specifically enumerated types of information.
        [0210]      After the information for inclusion in the manifesting label 900 is
received, the process 1300 proceeds to block 1310 and the central manifesting system
1004 generates the electronic version of the label.       In some embodiments, the central
manifesting system 1004 can generate the electronic version of the manifesting label 900
with information received from the user terminal 1002 and with information generated at
the central manifesting system 1004. In some embodiments, information generated at the
central manifesting system 1004 can include, for example, cost, shipping codes, shipping

zones, computer readable codes, manifesting label 900 identification information, or any
other information.
         [0211]     After the central manifesting system 1004 generates the electronic
version of the manifesting label 900 in block 1310, the process 1300 proceeds to block
1312 and the processor 1008 updates a database with information relating to the
electronic version of the manifesting label.       In one embodiment, the processor 1008
updates the manifest database 1012. In some embodiments, the processor 1008 updates
the manifest database 1012 by adding identifiers indicative of information from the
electronic version of the manifesting label 900 to the manifest database 1012.
         [0212]     After the processor 1008 has updated the manifest database 1012 in
block 1312, the process 1300 proceeds to block 1314 and the central manifesting system
1004 provides the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 to the user terminal
1002.
         [0213]     After the electronic version of the manifesting label 900 is provided to
the user terminal 1002, the process 1300 proceeds to block 1316 and the central
manifesting system 1004 requests payment. After payment is requested, the process 1300
proceeds to block 1318 and the central manifesting system 1004 transacts payment. In
some embodiments, the transacting of payment can include communication between the
central manifesting system 1004 and the user terminal 1002 and/or the payment terminal
1006.    After the process 1300 has transacted payment, the process 1300 terminates at
block 1320.     A person of skill in the art will recognize that the process 1300 for
manifesting performed by a central manifesting system can include some or all of the
above discussed steps, as well as steps additional to the above requested steps. A person
of skill in the art will further recognize that the process 1300 for manifesting performed
by a central manifesting system can include the above listed steps performed in any order,
including in an order different than that shown above.
         [0214]     Figure 14 is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of a process 1400
for authenticating user information defined by blocks 1302 and 1304 as depicted in Figure
13.   The process 1400 can authenticate the user and can verify the good standing of the
user. In some embodiments, the process 1400 is performed by the central manifesting
system 1004.

        [0215]      The process 1400 begins in block 1302 when the central manifesting
system 1004 receives the user information from the user terminal 1002 as discussed
above.
        [0216]      After the user information from the user terminal 1002 is received by
the central manifesting system 1004, the process 1400 moves to block 1402 where the
processor 1008 queries the user database 1014 for stored user information.        In some
embodiments, this information can include, a username, a password, an account number,
an indicator of a responsible payer, and/or any other desired user information.
        [0217]      After the process 1400 receives the user information, the process 1400
proceeds to decision state 1404 and the processor 1008 determines if the received
information identifies an account. In some embodiments, this determination is made by
determining if the information received from the user terminal 1002 matches any of the
information retrieved from the user database 1014. If the information received from the
user terminal 1002 does not match information retrieved from the user database 1014,
then the process 1400 can terminate at block 1406, or the process 1400 can direct the user
to open a new user account. In some embodiments, this determination as to whether to
terminate process 1400 or to request the opening of a new user account can be made
based on predetermined criteria including procedures for opening a new user account.
        [0218]      If the information received from the user terminal 1002 matches
information retrieved from the user database 1014, then the process moves to decision
state and the processor 1008 determines if the account is in good standing.       In some
embodiments, this determination can include, for example, the processor 1008 querying
the user database 1014 and/or querying the payment database 1016 for information
relating to whether the user account is active, whether the user account is current on
outstanding payments, whether the balance of payments due is above some threshold,
whether the account use is outside of some predetermine range, or any other desired
factor. If the user account is not in good standing, the process 1400 terminates at block
1406, or the central manifesting system 1004 can notify the user terminal 1002 that the
user account has been suspended until the account is brought into good standing.
        [0219]      If the processor 1008 determines that the account is in good standing,
then the process 1400 proceeds to block 1410 and the processor 1008 verifies the user.
After the user has been verified, the process 1400 moves to block 1412 and passes to

        [0226]      The system control may be written in any conventional programming
language such as C, C++, BASIC, Pascal, or Java, and ran under a conventional operating

system.      C, C++,     BASIC,    Pascal, Java, and FORTRAN are industry standard
programming languages for which many commercial compilers can be used to create
executable code. The system control may also be written using interpreted languages
such as Perl, Python or Ruby.
         [0227]      The foregoing description details certain embodiments of the systems,
devices, and methods disclosed herein. It will be appreciated, however, that no matter
how detailed the foregoing appears in text, the systems, devices, and methods can be
practiced in many ways.        As is also stated above, it should be noted that the use of
particular terminology when describing certain features or aspects of the invention should
not be taken to imply that the terminology is being re-defined herein to be restricted to
including any specific characteristics of the features or aspects of the technology with
which that terminology is associated.
         [0228]      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various
modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the
described technology. Such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the
scope of the embodiments. It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that parts
included in one embodiment are interchangeable with other embodiments; one or more
parts from a depicted embodiment can be included with other depicted embodiments in
any combination. For example, any of the various components described herein and/or
depicted in the Figures may be combined, interchanged or excluded from other
embodiments.
         [0229]      With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms
herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or
from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The
various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
         [0230]      It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used
herein are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be
interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as
"having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited
to," etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of
an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the
claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an
aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the
                                               r-N.

introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.
However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction
of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim
containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such
recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or
"at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should
typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for
the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.     In addition, even if a
specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the
art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the
recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers,
typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).      Furthermore, in
those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is
used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art
would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C"
would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B
together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those
instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in
general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, or C" would
include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B
together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be
further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or
phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or
drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the
terms, either of the terms, or both terms.     For example, the phrase "A or B" will be
understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
         [0231]     All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety. To the extent publications and patents or patent applications incorporated by
reference contradict the disclosure contained in the specification, the specification is
intended to supersede and/or take precedence over any such contradictory material.

         [0232]     The term "comprising" as used herein is synonymous with "including,"
"containing," or "characterized by," and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude
additional, unrecited elements or method steps.
         [0233]     All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions,
and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in
all instances by the term "about."      Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the
numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations
that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present
invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine
of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should be construed
in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.
         [0234]     The above description discloses several methods and materials of the
present invention.    This invention is susceptible to modifications in the methods and
materials, as well as alterations in the fabrication methods and equipment.            Such
modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this
disclosure or practice of the invention disclosed herein. Consequently, it is not intended
that this invention be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed herein, but that it
cover all modifications and alternatives coming within the true scope and spirit of the
invention as embodied in the attached claims.
         [02351     Throughout this specification and claims which follow, unless the
context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or
group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
integers or steps.
         [02361     The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or
information derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior
publication (or information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common
general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
