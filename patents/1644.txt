                                             Field of the Invention
[002]    The invention relates to compounds and natural substances that enhance the effectiveness of
chemotherapeutic drugs.
                                                  Background
[003]    Drug resistance invariably develops over the course of continuing chemotherapy. Overcoming
this problem is a major challenge in the treatment of cancer. Indeed, tumor cells utilize multiple
mechanisms to increase their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. For example, tumor cells may
overexpress the multiple drug resistant transporter and oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor
genes, as well as induce the activity of NF-E2-related factor 2, a redoxsensing transcription factor that
upregulates a wide spectrum of genes involved in glutathione metabolism and drug detoxification. See
(Huang et al., 2005a; Makarovskiy et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2010); (Salzberg et al., 2007; Sirotnak et al.,
2000); (Singh et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010); and (Huang and Sadee, 2003; Seruga et al., 2010). The
Hedgehog pathway is another cell signaling pathway that is involved in chemoresitance. (Domingo
Domenech et al., 2012).
[004]    To date, no single agent that was designed to target a specific mechanism of resistance has been
found to be effective. However, one potential source of novel therapies for addressing drug resistance
are traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Indeed, such medicines have been used for thousands of years
to restore imbalances of body functions that result from a multitude of diseases. Treatment with herbal
medicines usually involve ingestion of a herbal "extract" that contains multiple chemical components
that can potentially act at different sites and pathways in the body. Thus, these medicines have the
potential to target multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms that may offer a new opportunities in
                                                        1

overcoming drug resistance, or simply improve the efficacy of drugs. See Chow & Huang 2010, Pon et al
2010. As described herein, an ethanol extract from one particular traditional Chinese medicinal herb,
Triperygium wilfordii, which is also known by its Chinese (Mandarin) name, Lei Gong Teng, sensitizes
cancer cells that have become resistant to chemotherapeutic drug therapy, so that the cancer once
again becomes sensitive to the chemothearpeutic drug.
                                          Summary of the Invention
[005]     This invention relates to organic solvent extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii and their use in
cancer treatment, particularly in the treatment of cancers which have exhibited some resistance to
treatment by chemotherapeutic drugs. Of the organic solvent extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii useful in
the various embodiments of the extract may be (i) an ethanol extract; and identifiable by the MS/LC
chromatogram as described in Figure 1.
[006]     In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating a cancer. The method
administers to a patient in need thereof a combination of (a) an organic solvent extract of Tripterygium
wilfordii and (b) a chemotherapeutic drug. The organic solvent extract of Tripterygium wilfordii (a) and
chemotherapeutic drug (b) are administered in a combined amount effective to treat the cancer. The
cancer being treated is at least in part resistant to treatment by the chemotherapeutic drug (b) alone. In
an embodiment of the invention, the method administers (a) in an amount to increase (b)'s efficacy over
the efficacy of (b) when administered alone. In embodiments of the invention, the cancer may be breast
cancer, leukemia or prostate cancer and the chemotherapeutic drug (b) a drug current used to treat
such cancers, e.g., docetaxel, daurorubicin, trastuzumab, and lapatinib.
[007]     The organic solvent extract of Tripterygium wilfordii (a) and chemotherapeutic drug (b) may be
administered sequentially or co-administered. When they are administer sequentially, at least a portion
of (a) is administered prior to administration of (b). The organic solvent extract of Tripterygium wilfordii
(a) may be administered in the same manner and using a similar or the same chemotherapeutic
composition. As noted above, in a method of the invention the organic solvent extract of Tripterygium
wilfordii (a) and chemotherapeutic drug (b) may be co-administered and that may be in a single
composition containing both (a) and (b). Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention relates to a
chemotherapeutic composition comprising a combination of (a) an organic solvent extract of
Tripterygium wilfordii and (b) a chemotherapeutic drug, wherein (a) and (b) are administered in a
combined amount effective to treat the cancer; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

                                              Detailed Description
[064]    Described herein are methods and pharmaceutical formulations for treating cancer by
administering to a patient in need thereof, a combination of an ethanol extract of T. wilfordii, and a
chemotherapeutic drug, wherein the ethanol extract of T. wilfordii, and the chemotherapeutic drug are
administered in a combined amount effective to treat the cancer. In various embodiments, methods of
the invention treat cancer that is at least in part resistant to treatment by a chemotherapeutic drug
when the chemotherapeutic drug is administered alone, i.e., in the absence of the ethanol extract of
T. wilfordii. Therefore, in various embodiments, the methods of the invention overcome anti-cancer
chemotherapeutic drug resistance by contacting a chemotherapeutic drug-resistant cancerous cell with
at least one component of the ethanol extraction of T. Wilfordii, as described herein, and effect a
reversal of the cell's resistance to chemotherapeutic drug, thereby allowing the chemotherapeutic drug
to cause the drug-resistant cancerous cell's death or cytostasis. Thus, the methods of treatment of the
invention are used to inhibit, retard or prevent growth of tumor cells that are resistant to a
chemotherapeutic agent.
[065]    The T. wilfordii extracts of the invention are obtained from the root xylem of Tripterygium
wilfordii Hook f., a medicinal plant that was obtained from the Province of Jilin, China. As stated above,
the methods of the invention use an ethanol extraction of T. Wilfordii. In various embodiments, the
methods of the invention use an ethanol extract of T. Wilfordii that was prepared by combining
extracted material from serial 95% ethanol extractions. In various other embodiments, ethanol
extracted T. Wilfordii material is further extracted by adsorbing the extracted material to a silica gel, and
subjecting the adsorbed material to additional ethanol extractions. The ethanol is typically removed
from extractions by subjecting the extractions to rotary evaporation. The dried material may optionally
be freeze dried. The final, dried ethanol extract of T. wilfordii that is used by the method is termed
LGT-E, and is characterized by having the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry chromatogram
that is described in Figure 2.

[066]     Cancers that can be treated by the methods of the invention include both solid and
haematological tumurs of various organs. Nonlimiting examples of solid tumors are metastatic breast
cancer, and prostate cancer, including androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate
cancer. Haematolgical tumors that are treatable by the methods of the invention include, for example,
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which is characterized by abnormal proliferation of immature
granulocytes, for example, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, in the blood, bone marrow, the
spleen, liver and sometimes in other tissues.
[067]     Non-limiting examples of chemotherapeutic drugs suitable for use in combination with the
extracts or extract components of T. Wilfordii of the invention include: topoisomerase inhibitors,
including, e.g., doxorubicin and daunorubicin; taxanes, including docetaxel; and biologics that target
receptors that are embedded in the surface of targeted cells, for example the HER receptors, including
HER2/neu, which is the target of trastuzumab (sold under the Herceptin* brandname).
[068]     As used herein, the term "treating" or "treatment" refers to coadministering an ethanol extract
of T. wilfordii with a chemotherapeutic drug to a subject that has cancer that is resistant to treatment
with the chemotherapeutic drug, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy,
ameliorate, improve, or affect cancer. In various embodiments, the method of the invention
administers the ethanol extract of T. Wilfordii of the invention and the chemotherapeutic drug that is
co-administered with the extract at the same time or in immediate succession, while in other
embodiments, the ethanol extract of T. Wilfordii is administered prior to the administration of the
chemotherapeutic drug to allow the cells of the cancer that is being treated to become at least partially
sensitized prior to being contacted with the chemotherapeutic drug.
[069]     The term "an effective amount" refers to the amount of the ethanol extract of T. wilfordii that is
required to confer a reduction in the resistance of the cancer cells to a designated chemotherapeutic
drug. Effective amounts may vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on route of
administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other agents.
[070]     As stated above, the invention includes pharmaceutical compositions that comprise the extracts
or extracted components of T. Wilfordii. To practice the method of this invention, the aforementioned
pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically,
rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral" as used herein
includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial,
intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.

[071]     Injectable compositions can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or
suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions.
The injectables, solutions and emulsions may also contain one or more excipients. Suitable excipients
are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical
compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such
as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizers, solubility enhancers, and other such
agents, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate and
cyclodextrins.
[072]    A composition for oral administration can be any orally acceptable dosage form including, but
not limited to, capsules, tablets, emulsions and aqueous suspensions, dispersions and solutions. In the
case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating
agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form,
useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions or emulsions are
administered orally, the active ingredient can be suspended or dissolved in an oily phase combined with
emulsifying or suspending agents.
[073]    The carrier in the pharmaceutical composition must be "acceptable" in the sense of being
compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation (and preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and
not deleterious to the subject to be treated. For example, one or more solubilizing agents, which form
more soluble complexes with the fused bicyclic or tricyclic compounds, or more solubilizing agents, can
be utilized as pharmaceutical carriers for delivery of the active compounds. Examples of other carriers
include colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and D&C Yellow #10.

[074]    Authentication of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. T. wilfordii roots were purchased from Sanyuan
Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Jilin, Peoples Republic of China) and authentified at the Macau Institute of
Applied Researchfor Medicine and Health of Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, as
follows. T. wilfordii root bark and root xylem were authenticated according to the same protocol. Thus,
root bark and root xylem tissue, were each ground to a powder and passed through a 60 mesh sieve.
For each root or xylem preparation, 0.2 g of the ground powder was precisely weighed and 20 mL of
ethyl acetate was added. The sample was extracted using bath sonication for 1 hour at 450 C. The mix

was filtered, and the residue was resuspended using 20 mL of methanol, followed by bath sonication for
another 1 hour at 450 C. The ethyl acetate extract and methanol extracts were combined and
evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator. The solid extract was reconstituted using 2 ml of
methanol and filtered through a 0.45 lpg filter. The HPLC-DAS
[075]    High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatography was performed with an Agilent
1200 Series LC System and Modules (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Chromatography was
carried out using a Symmetry C18 (250x4.6 mm, 5 pm) column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The
temperature of analytical column was set at 200 C, and the detection wave length was 210 nm. A linear
gradient elution was carried out using a mobile phase containing acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% phosphoric
acid (v/v) (B) with the flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient began with 40% eluent A and 60% eluent B.
The gradient was changed linearly to 50% eluent B in 20 min, 25% eluent B in 20 min, and 20% eluent B
in 10 min. The gradient was then further changed back to 80% of eluent B in 10 min and kept at this
percentage. The HPLC-diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) chromatograph finger prints for T. Wilfordii
root bark and xylem tissue are shown in Figure 1A and 1B, respectively.
[076]    Preparation of T. Wilfordii extract. T. Wilfordii root xylem tissue (390.61 g) was placed into a
blender and blended into small pieces. The blended root material was added to 2 L of 95% ethanol,
sonicated for one hour, and then macerated overnight in the 95% ethanol overnight. Afterwards, the
material was pressured filtered using a vacuum, and the ethanol was collected. The residue that
remained after pressure filtering was washed twice with 600 mL of 95% ethanol, and sonicated for
30 minutes with each wash cycle. The ethanol from the two washes was combined with initial 2 L of
ethanol, and the combined extractions were evaporated using a rotating evaporator, and then freeze
dried. The total yield of the foregoing extraction procedure yielded 16.16 g of ethanol-extracted
material, which was further fractionated by adsorbing the evaporated product on silica gel 60 and
subjecting the adsorbed material to sequential extractions in the following order of solvents: 95%
ethanol and chloroform. The chemosensitizing effect of the ethanol and chloroform extracts were
quantitated. An aqueous extract was also prepared and its CE was determined to compare with the
ethanol and choloroform extracts. The T. Wilfordii aqueous extract was sourced from Yunnan, China,
and was obtained from Jiangyin Tianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China), and is commercially
available through ACE Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Hong Kong).
[077]    Assessing chemosensitivity of extracts
[078]    A chemosensitizing effect (CE) is a measure of the degree to which a compound can lower, (i.e.,
chemosensitize), the required concentration of a chemotherapeutic drug's half maximal inhibitory
                                                      11

      WO 2014/031543                                                                       PCT/US2013/055602
concentration (IC5 0 ) when the compound and the chemotherapeutic drug are coadministered. Here, IC5 0
isthe concentration of a chemotherapeutic drug that inhibits cell proliferation by 50%. The CE is
expressed as: CE   =IC50D/IC50E+D- IC50D    is theIC50 of the chemotherapeutic drug against which an test
extract (or other compound suspected of having a CE) is evaluated. IC50E+D is the IC50 of the combination
of the test extract and chemotherapeutic drug. The CE of a test extract or compound can vary
depending on the type of cell and the specific chemotherapeutic or class or combination of therapeutics
that are being evaluated.
[079]    Frequently, a test extract or compound may also be non-specifically cytotoxic (as opposed to a
chemotherapeutic drug that targets tumor cells) when it is administered at concentrations greater than
that required to produce a CE. Ideally, the concentration of test compound that is required to produce a
CE is significantly lower than its IC5 0 . The variance between those concentrations can be quantitated by
calculating the Chemosensitizing Utility Index (CUI) value for a test extract or compound. The CUI is
expressed as: CUI=CEx(IC50E/ConE)-        IC50E  is the concentration of an extract, e.g., an extract or extracted
compound of Tripterygium wilfordii, that inhibits cell proliferation by 50%. ConE is the concentration of
an extract or compound that is required to produce desirable CE. Extracts and compounds that are
found to have desirable CE and CUI values are then tested for their potential as chemosensitizing agents
in an in vivo context.
[080]    CE and CUI values were obtained individually for the aqueous, ethanol, and chloroform extracts
that are described above. These analyses were performed using the chemotherapeutic, docetaxel, in
conjuntion with docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer line, PC3-TxR (University of Michigan), using the
sulforhodamine B (SRB)-based proliferation assay that is described in Example 5, below. All of the
foregoing extracts were associated with desireable CE and CUI values. The IC50E+D concentrations of the
aqueous, ethanol, and chloroform extracts were 9.3, 3.97, and 3.8 nM, respectively, and the CUI values
were 17.74, 27.39, and 17.37, respectively. Based on its relatively high CUI value, the ethanol was
selected for further study, as chronicled in the Examples, below. In the Examples, the ethanol, is
referred to as Lei Gong Teng extract (LGT-E).
[081]    Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of LGT-E. A 500 mg/ml stock
solution of the LGT-E extract product, prepared as described above, was made by dissolving 500 mg of
LGT-E extract in ethanol. The stock was further diluted to 500 pg/ml in 80% acetonitrile. An aliquot of
10 Ip was used for LC-MS/MS analysis using an API 3200 LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and two Shimadzu LC-20AD Prominence Liquid Chromatograph pumps equipped with an
SIL-20A Prominence autosampler (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA). Chromatography was carried out

[082]     A linear gradient elution was carried out using a mobile phase containing acetonitrile (A) and
0.2% formic acid containing 2 mM ammonia acetate (B) with the flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. The gradient
began with 30% eluent A and 70% eluent B for 3min and was changed linearly to 40% eluent B in 2 min
and remained for 2 min. The gradient was then changed back to 95% eluent B in 1 min and kept at this
percentage for 6 min. The temperatures of analytical column and autosampler were both set at room
temperature. All the liquid chromatographic eluent was then introduced into the atmospheric-pressure
chemical ionization (APCI) source. Mass spectrometric conditions were: gas 1, nitrogen (30 psi); gas 2,
nitrogen (30 psi); nebulizer current (5.0 v); source temperature, 400C; curtain gas, nitrogen (25 psi).

[084]     Dosage-dependent effect of LGT-E on the sensitization of the docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer
cell line, PC3-TrX, to docetaxel. PC3-TxR cells were plated into sterile, F-bottom Cellstar* 96 well cell
culture plates with lids (Cat# 655180, Purchased from Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC) by placing into each
well, 100 pl of medium containing 3000 cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT ) and a solution of penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 pg/ml) (Life
Technologies Grand Island, NY). The cells were at passage 52 at the time of plating. Triplicate wells
were assigned to each experimental condition tested, and a 24 hour recovery period for the cells
following the seeding of the wells was allowed. During the recovery period, the cells were incubated at
370 C and 5% C02.

[085]     The LGT-E was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of LGT-E powder to DMSO to form a
500 mg/ml stock solution. The stock solution was alternately vortexed and sonicated until the LGT-E
powder went into solution. The stock solution was diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech,
Manassas, VA, or Life Technologies Grand Island, NY) to reach the desired concentrations of LGT-E (e.g.,
12, 25, or 60 pg/ml).
[086]     Pretreatment of the cells with LGT-E was carried out by aspirating the media from the wells,
followed by adding 50 I of LGT-E solution containing concentrations of either 12 or 25 pg/ml of LGT-E
solution and incubation of the cells for two hours under conditions of 370 C and 5% CO2 . At the end of
the two hour pre-treatment period, 1:3 serially-diluted, 50 Ip aliquots of docetaxel that contained from
1 x 102 to 1 x 10-3 nM of docetaxel in RPMI 1640 medium (i.e., 100, 33.3, 10.0, 3.33, 1.0, 0.333, 0.1, and
0.001 nM) were added to the pretreated cells in the presence of the LGT-E media. The docetaxel was
diluted from a stock solution (105 ptM docetaxel in DMSO, Cat #: 01885, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) immediately before being added to the cells. After adding docetaxel, the cells were
incubated for an additional 72 hours under the same temperature and atmospheric conditions used for
the pre-treatment step.
[087]     Following the 72 hour docetaxel treatment period, the the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was
used to quantitate living cells. Media was aspirated from each well, and replaced with a 10% solution of
cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (Cat #: T6399, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated for one hour
at 40 C. After the TCA incubation, the TCA solution was aspirated, and the cells were washed five times
with tap water. After removing the last wash, the plates were left with lids off at room temperature
until the surfaces were dry, which took one to two hours. Then 50 I of a 0.4% solution of sul
forhodamine B (SRB) sodium salt (Cat #: S9012, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well
and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. Afterwards, the wells were
washed five times with a 1% acetic acid solution in 10 mM TRIS base (Cat#: 161-0719, purchased from
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The plates were subsequently left to dry for several hours or
overnight. SRB that remained in the dried wells was solubilized by adding 100 I of SRB solubilization
solution (10 mM TRIS base) to each well, and placing the plates either on a gently-moving shaker or
letting the plates remain stationary at room temperature until the SRB dissolves, which takes about five
to ten minutes. The amount of SRB in each well, which correlated directly to the number of living cells
at fixation, was determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 565 nm by a microplate reader.
Increases or decreases in cell viability were determined by comparing LGT-E pretreated cells with cells
that had also been treated with docetaxel, but were not treated with LGT-E.

Example 3
Dosage-dependent effect of LGT-E on the sensitization of the docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell line,
DU145-TrX, to docetaxel. Using the methods described in Example 2, the chemosensitizing effect of
LGT-E pretreatment on docetaxel-treated DU145-TrX cells was studied. In this study, cells were pre
treated with either 50, 25, or 12.5 pg/ml of LGT-E before treating the cells with 1:3 serially-diluted, 50 Ip
aliquots of docetaxel that contained from 1 x 102 to 1 x 10-3 nM of docetaxel. The DU145-TxR cells were
plated at passage 38. Tables 5, 7 and 9 report the cell viability data relating to pre-treatment with 50,
25, and 12.5 pg/ml LGT-E, respectively. Tables 6, 8, and 10 report control data obtained from DU145
TxR cells that were not pre-treated with LGT-E. Figure 4 summarizes the data of Tables 5-10 in a
graphical format.

Example 4
A comparison of the docetaxel sensitivity of docetaxel-senstive prostate cancer cells to that of docetaxel
resistant prostate cancer cells. To determine the degree to which the docetaxel-resistant cell lines were
more resistant to docetaxel than their respective parental docetaxel-sensitive cell lines, cell viabilities of
the docetaxel-resistant PC3-TxR cell line and the docetaxel-sensitive cell line from which PC3-TxR was
derived, PC3, were compared following docetaxel treatment in the absence of LGT-E pre-treatment. Cell
culture conditions, docetaxel treatment, and cell viability analysis were performed as described in
Example 2. As in Example 2, cells were treated with 1:3 serially-diluted, 50 l aliquots of docetaxel that
contained from 1 x 102 to 1 x 10-3 nM of docetaxel. The PC3-TrX and PC3 cells were plated at passages
52 and 11, respectively. Tables 11 and 12 show the data obtained from docetaxel treatment of
docetaxel-resistant PC3-TxR cells, and docetaxel-sensitive PC3 cells, respectively. Figure 5 summarizes
the data of Tables 11 and 12 in a graphical format.

[0101]             Determination of the LGT-E IC50 for docetaxel-senstive and docetaxel-resistant prostate
cancer cells. LGT-E IC50 concentrations were determined for the docetaxel-sensitive cell lines, PC3 and
DU145, as well as for their docetaxel-resistant sub-lines. Cell culture conditions and cell viability analysis
were performed as described in Example 2. Unlike in Example 2, however, the cells were subjected to a
72 hour incubation under standard culture conditions in the presence of either 100.0, 33.3, 10.0, 3.33,
1.0, 0.333, 0.1, or 0.001 pg/ml of LGT-E, and the cells were not treated with docetaxel. PC3 and PC3-TrX
cells were plated at passages 15 and 38, respectively, and DU145 and DU145-TrX cells were each plated
at passage 46. Tables 13 and 14 report cell viability data that was obtained from PC3 and PC3-TxR cells,
respectively. Tables 15 and 16 report cell viability data that was obtained from DU145-Txr and DU145
cells, respectively. Figure 6 summarizes the data of Tables 13-16 in a graphical format.

paired with the docetaxel-sensitive cell lines, PC3 and DU145, as well as for their docetaxel-resistant
sub-lines; (ii) Doxorubicin paired with the doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant myelogenous leukemia

carcinoma line, BT474; and (iv) The Herceptin*-resistant, HER2-positive breast adenocarcinoma line,
SkBr3. Cell culture of the above cell lines was performed as described in Example 2, except that 5,000,
rather than 3,000 cells were plated per well for the K562, K562/Dox, BT474, SkBr3 lines.
[0107]             The chemotherapeutic drugs that were tested for chemosensitization in combination
with LTG-E were docetaxel, daunorubicin, Herceptin*, and lapatinib. To determine IC50 for each of those
drugs, as well as verify the known drug sensitivities of the cell lines used in these studies, cell lines were
plated as detailed above, and cultured in the presence of the aforementioned chemotherapeutic drugs,
as shown in Table 17, for 72 hours, followed by SRB analysis of cell viabilities. Table 17 also contains the
serially-diluted concentrations of drugs that each cell line was tested against.

Example 17.
[0142]              LGT-E is an effective chemosensitizorfor docetaxel in vivo. Based on the results that
showed LGT-E to be a chemosensitizer for docetaxel, in vivo studies were designed to assess the
effectiveness of orally-administered LGT-E on the chemotherapeutic effect of Docetaxel. With that goal
in mind, the oral maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories International,
Inc. Wilmington, MA) was determined by administering escalating single, once-only, oral doses of 100,
250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg/kg, as well as daily doses of 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg over the course of
7 days. Specifically, the MTD was defined as the dose that: (i) was nonfatal; (ii) caused no more than a
10% retardation of body weight gain as compared to control animals; and (iii) did not cause overt organ
dysfunction or side effects. In the cases of both the single and multiple dose approaches, the MTD was
around 500 mg/kg.
[0143]              Subsequent to identifying the MTD for LTG-E, the antitumor effect of LGT-E (500 mg/kg,
oral gavage) administered in combination with docetaxel (20 mg/kg, i.v.) was compared to docetaxel
treatment alone. More particularly, these studies involved the use of six severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) male mice (Taconic Farms, Inc. Oxnard, CA) that weighed from 15 to 20 g, were
between 4-6 weeks old, and that had been housed in cages with HEPA-filtered air (12-hr light/dark
cycle). Tumors were caused to form in the mice by subcutaneously injecting PC3 and PC3-TxR cells into
the mice. To perform the cell injections, PC3 and PC3-TxR cells were first separately suspended in a 1:1
mixture of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) and RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Manassas,
VA, or Life Technologies Grand Island, NY). Then the cells were subcutaneously implanted into flanks of
mice via injection. Mice that had consistently shown tumor growth for 19 days following the injection of
the cells were used in the tumor studies. More specifically, these studies were initiated when the
                                                       32

xenograft tumors reached a volume of about 120 mm 3, calculated by using the formula for a
semiellipoid, i.e., Volume = Width2 x (Length/2).
[0144]            A tumor study was performed in accordance with the basic methodologies described
above to measure changes in the tumor sizes of each mouse over a 15 day time course, beginning on
the first day of treatment. The tumor-containing mice in the study were randomized into six groups:
Group (1) mice had PC3 cell tumor xenografts, and were treated only with Docetaxel (20 mg/kg,
intravenously (IV), once per week, n = 9) and Group (2) mice had PC3-TxR cell tumor xenografts, and
were not treated at all (n = 7). Changes in the tumor sizes of Groups (1) and (2) over the course of the
study are shown in Fig. 9A. Group (3) mice had PC3-TxR cell tumor xenografts, and were treated with
Docetaxel (20 mg/kg, IV, once per week, n = 8); Group (4) mice had PC3-TxR cell tumor xenografts, and
were treated with LTG-E (500 mg/kg, via oral gavage (P0), daily, n = 8); Group (5) mice had PC3-TxR cell
tumor xenografts, and were treated with Docetaxel (20 mg/kg, IV, once per week) and LTG-E (250
mg/kg, PO, daily) (n = 8); and Group (6) mice had PC3-TxR cell tumor xenografts, and were treated with
Docetaxel 20 mg/kg (IV, once per week) and LTG-E (500 mg/kg, PO, daily) (n = 9). Changes in the tumor
sizes of Groups (3-6) over the course of the study are shown in Fig. 23.
[0145]            Changes in the tumor sizes of Group (1) and Group (2) over the course of the study are
shown in Fig. 23, which indicated that both PC3 and PC3-TxR cells were successfully grown in the SCID
mice. Changes in tumor size of Group (3-6) over the time course of the study are shown in Fig. []. LGT-E
alone did not show any anti-tumor effect, but significantly enhanced the docetaxel's anti-tumor effect as
compared to the docetaxel-only group.
