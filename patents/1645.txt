                                                Abstract
   An apparatus is described that                      comprises an electrode, a
   waveform generator                     connected to the electrode, and a
 5 controller.                      The controller is configured to control the
   waveform generator to deliver a high                      frequency alternating
   current                (HFAC) waveform to a nerve for nerve conduction
   block.                The HFAC waveform comprises a non-zero amplitude
   nrloe           s block threshold for a time period, after the time
10 period, the amplitude is ramped to an amplitude value that
   is above the block threshold, and after the amplitude is
   ramped up, the HFAC waveform continues with the                      amplitude
   value that is above the block threshold.                       The ramped
   amplitude of the HFAC waveform prevents a                      secondary onset
15 response reaction.

   BACKGROUND
15              Unwanted                and/or         uncoordinated               generation              of    nerve
   impulses                   may       be     a      disabling           factor          in      some        medical
   conditions.                       For     example,          uncoordinated             motor        signals       may
   produce                 spasticity              in      stroke,        cerebral          palsy,          multiple
   sclerosis,                       and      other         conditions.                  The       uncoordinated
20 signals                 may        result         in      the      inability           to      make        desired
   functional                       movements.                 Involuntary              motor         signals          in
   conditions                    including tics,               choreas, and             so on, may            produce
   unwanted                    movements.                   Additionally,                unwanted             sensory
   signals                 can        cause       pain.            Conventional             approaches             have
25 attempted                    to      intercept           unwanted         or      uncoordinated               nerve
   impulses                 along        the    nerves        on     which     they      travel         to    attempt
   to reduce and/or eliminate the disabling condition.
                Conventional                    approaches              associated             with         treating
   these             conditions               have         produced         unsatisfactory                  results.
30 For         example,               drug      treatments             may    have       produced           unwanted

   side-effects,                    may    have     acted      globally         on    the   body    rather
   than       specifically                 on   a   specific         nerve,        and may     have     been
   neither              quick           acting      nor      quickly         reversible.              While
   chemical              treatments            (e.g.,      Botox,      phenol         blocks),      may    be
 5 applied more                    specifically,          they may have              been   destructive
   to the nerve, may have required reapplication, and may not
   have          been             quickly         reversible.                 Other        conventional
   treatments                 for pain        (e.g., transcutaneous electrical nerve
   stimulation                    (TENS),       implantable           pain         stimulators)         have
10 also produced sub-optimal results.
             Both alternating                   current         (AC)   and direct current               (DC)
   nerve         stimulation               are    known       in   the     art.         The   inhibitory
   effect            of        high-frequency            alternating              current      (HFAC)      on
   nerves              has         been       reported           since       the       early       1900's.
15 Additionally,                     DC    electrical          nerve      stimulation           has     been
   illustrated                   to   produce       a    nearly       complete         block     of   nerve
   activity.                       However,        conventional             DC       stimulation         has
   damaged both body tissues and/or electrodes when delivered
   over       prolonged                 periods       of   time.          Thus        conventional         DC
20 stimulation                   has    been    unsuitable          for    certain        applications.
   The damage caused by a DC                             nerve block           is    due,   at least       in
   part,         to       unbalanced           charge      applied        to      the   nerve.        HFAC,
   which        delivers              a   zero    net     charge      to the        tissue     is   likely
   to     be      safer           as    a  method      for     nerve     block.          However,       when
25 HFAC        is         delivered           to    a    nerve,        it      causes      a    burst      of
   activity in the nerve that is undesirable and likely to be
   painful.                    The      burst      of    activity         produced         by     HFAC     is
   referred to as the onset activity.

                 generator to alter the DC over a third period of time
 5              by changing the second DC amplitude to a third DC
                 amplitude, the DC having the third DC amplitude not
                being           sufficient to produce a conduction block in the
                nerve;
                              wherein the combination of the DC and the                                     HFAC
10               and the order in which the DC and the HFAC are
                 applied reduce an onset                        activity in the nerve
                 associated with producing a conduction nerve block
                when compared to the onset activity                                    in the nerve if

                 enough so that the DC does not                              cause damage to the
                 electrode or surrounding tissue.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                Example                 systems,             methods,             and       apparatus             produce         a
   nerve           block             using           HFAC      waveforms.                The       block produced               by
10 HFAC         waveforms                  is      a    conduction            block       in     the     nerve,          and not
   simply a                 fatigue block.                        The block may be                   referred to as               a
   "nerve              conduction                   block".             The      block        is     not      a     result      of
   the         nerve            being             stimulated             until        it      is     too       fatigued         to
   respond                and        can        no     longer         recover          before         the      next        pulse.
15 The         HFAC         waveforms                 block        conduction            through          the       nerves      by
   blocking                 signal             transmission                through          the       axon.           Unlike      a
   chemical                  block,              which        interrupts              the        transmission               of    a
   chemical                 signal            from the            ends       of    one     nerve        to     the      ends    of
   another,                 an       HFAC         nerve       conduction             block         prevents           the    axon
20 of       the         nerve           from         transmitting               any      signals          past        the    area
   of         the         block.                   The      block          is     based          on     how       electrical
   currents                   produce                activation              or      block          nerve         conduction
   through               their           influence               on    the      voltage-gated                ion       channels
   in the nerve membrane.
25              HFAC           waveforms                depolarize             the     nerve         membrane            causing
   the           inactivation                         gates          to        close.                The        biophysical
   mechanism that produces the onset response                                                          is based on the
   effect             of       the       depolarizing                  current         on     the      nerve         membrane.
   In        general,                 depolarizing                 the      nerve        membrane           triggers          the
30 opening                of        the         fast       sodium          ion       channels,            initiating            an
   action               potential.                      Placing           the      nerve         in     an      alternating
   current                depolarizing                    field,          however,           actually            results        in
   conduction                      failure,               because           it      forces          the       inactivation
   9736045_1 (GHMatters)P83987.AU.4

                                                                     10
   sodium                  ion            gate           to       remain           closed.           Therefore,
   depolarization is involved in both activating and blocking
   nerve            conduction.                       It    is     this       dichotomy      of    action     that
   produces the onset response.
 5              There             are       two       phases         of     the     onset    response.         The
   first           phase             is     a    summated          twitch        response     that    occurs    in
   those nerve                      fibers to which an AC near or above                               the block
   threshold                    is       being         applied.              The     "block     threshold"      is
   defined as the voltage below which a complete block is not
10 obtained.                       The      block         threshold           increases      with    frequency.
   The         block            threshold              generally           varies      inversely      with    axon
   diameter.                            In      addition,            the        block     threshold         varies
   approximately                         as    the       square      of     the perpendicular           distance
   to        the         axon          from        the     electrode.              When    the    electrode     is
15 closer               than           one       millimeter             to     the    axon,     the    electrode
   position                 along           the       length        of     the     axon    also    affects     the
   amplitude of the block threshold.
                Once            the        initial           firing         is     over,    which     generally
   occurs              in       approximately                  20    milliseconds,          these     axons    are
20 blocked.                       The       second          phase         is    a   period      of   repetitive
   firing             that           can      last       many      seconds.           This   second phase is
   not         always             present            and tends           to     be   significantly        reduced
   with higher amplitudes of HFAC.                                              This    second phase may be
   due         to        the         repetitive             firing         of     axons    that    are     on  the
25 fringes                  of          the        current           spread         from     the     electrode.
   Eventually,                      the       firing        in     these        fibers    comes     to   a   stop.
   The          amplitude                  of       the     electrical             signal     decreases       with
   distance                  from         the       electrode.              A    decrease      in   the     second
   phase             at         higher             amplitudes            may       be   related      to     higher
30 amplitudes                     placing             more       of      the     nerve     fiber     completely
   within               the         region          that      provides           sufficient       amplitude     to
   produce                 the          block.              Since         the      current     gradients       are
   sharper, fewer fibers are within the amplitude region that
   produces repetitive firing.

   repetitive phase                           can be          reduced by adjusting                         amplitude and
   frequency.                       For example,               a 30       kilohertz,               10    volts peak-to
 5 peak           sinusoidal                   waveform             may        eliminate                the      repetitive
   phase.                   Generally               it      is     not       possible             to      eliminate          the
   entire              onset           response           by     changing           frequency              and     amplitude

10 due          to          the          charge           imbalance              applied               to      the      nerve.
   Therefore,                    example           systems, methods,                     and apparatus                balance
   charge               using           AC.          Balancing             the      charge            prevents          and/or
   minimizes                   damage         caused by             unbalanced charges.                           A   pure AC
   nerve           block             typically            produces           an    onset          response           from    the
15 nerve             on         start-up.                   Thus        some       examples               described          and
   claimed                 herein             first          apply          DC      to       a       nerve         and     then
   subsequently                       apply        an      HFAC       nerve       block.               The     combination
   of DC and HFAC                         is crafted to prevent the occurrence of the
   onset            response               in    the       nerve        to     be     blocked.               Conventional

   hiccups.                      Indicia        (e.g.,     biological           signals)      associated
   with         an        impending hiccup may be recorded                           via a    sensor      42.
 5 In       one         example,          the     indicia     may     appear       as   a  large   signal
   on the phrenic nerve.                              This    signal may control triggering
   a      controller                  44    to    apply    an     HFAC       block     to   the   phrenic
   nerve.                 The       block     may be      administered            using    an   electrode
   46 adjacent to the phrenic nerve.                                      The HFAC block prevents
10 diaphragm contraction for a brief period, which interrupts
   and/or                preempts            signals      that        cause       the     diaphragm        to
   hiccup.
                Signals              associated          with       moving        a   muscle      may      be
   recorded                 when       a   user      intends     to      move     that    muscle.         The
15 signals                may       be   propagated        along       a   nerve.         These   signals
   may          facilitate                 controlling          spastic         muscles       in   stroke

   may be recorded                        from both       spastic         muscles     and    non-spastic
20 muscles.                    Therefore,          figure    4   illustrates          an   apparatus       50
   that         includes a controller 52.                            Controller 52           comprises       a
   recorder for recording and processing signals                                           from sensors

   The controller                       52   controls      a   signal        generator      58 to apply
25 an HFAC waveform to an electrode                                     60 adjacent        a nerve     that
   controls muscles 56.
                Spasticity                reduces       function          in    muscles.         However,
   improved                 function         may be      achieved         by producing         a  partial
   block               of         undesired          motor      activity.               Thus,     example
30 apparatus,                      methods,        and    so    on,       may      be    configured        to
   quickly                reverse        an    HFAC block.             In    one    example,     improved
   function                 may      be achieved         by   combining          an HFAC      block    with
   an       intelligent                 control       system that varies              the   nerve    block
   based             on        sensed       activity       including,            for    example,     nerve

   510     and an HFAC waveform 520                                   to produce an HFAC block.                                 In
   one example, the DC waveform 510                                           and the           HFAC waveform 520
   are      provided                using          separate           electrodes.                   In      one    example,
15 DC     waveforms                  and         HFAC      waveforms              are      provided             through          a
   single           set        of     electrodes.                   The      charge         in      the      DC    waveform
   510      is       ramped            up       in    region          512     before          the         HFAC     waveform
   520      is      turned            on.          The     DC      waveform 510                in      region        514     has
   amplitude                 sufficient                to     provide           a    DC      block,           which        will
20 block        the         onset          response           from the HFAC                 waveform            520.         The
   DC     waveform                 510        is     ramped          down       in      region             514    once       the
   onset        activity                is       complete.              Unlike         the       charge-imbalanced
   waveforms                 discussed               below,          this        ramped           DC       waveform          510
   allows          the        onset           activity          caused by             the      HFAC         waveform         520
25 to        occur,                but           prevents              that         onset             activity             from
   propagating.                       Although             continuous             delivery             of     DC    at     this
   level         can         damage            the      electrodes             that        deliver            the     DC     and
   nearby            tissue,                infrequent              brief         application                 of      the       DC
   block        may         not       cause          such      damage.             In     one       example,           the      DC
30 block             is          delivered                 for         approximately                      100       to       200
   milliseconds                    each        time the HFAC block is turned on.                                          Since
   a DC block                 can be produced by monopolar electrodes,                                                  in one
   example             the       DC       electrodes             and      the      HFAC        electrodes             may      be
   combined               into          a      single         five-pole             nerve           cuff       electrode.
35 This       five-pole                 nerve         cuff      electrode             may      include           two      outer

                Figure              6   illustrates                a      method          associated              with       onset

   second               transitory                 wave        to       the         nerve.            Method          600         also
   includes,                   at      630,        applying              a     third         steady         state        wave          to

                Figure              7   illustrates                 a      charge-balanced                   approach             that
   includes                  applying              a      rapid           onset          block        above         the        block
   threshold                   and       accepting               the        initial           onset         response.                  In
   this           approach,                 the       amplitude                 is      then       lowered           below          the
15 block            threshold                 but      maintained                   high      enough          to     avoid          the
   zone          of        repetitive               firing.                 The       previously             blocked           nerve
   can         conduct               normally             through             the       region        of     HFAC       delivery
   at        this          amplitude.                    Then,          when          a   block        is      desired,             the
   amplitude                   is      ramped          up     to       the        block        threshold.                 In      this
20 example,                 the       block        can       be      achieved             without          further           firing
   and         thus          with        no     additional                 onset         response.                This       method
   maintains                  a     zero      net       charge but                 requires          that the           waveform
   be        delivered                 even        when        a     block           is     not     needed.               In      this
   example,                 the        onset        still          occurs            when      the      system         is       first
25 turned             on.            This       method           may       be       employed,           for       example,             in
   stroke               applications.                        In      this           environment              there         may         be
   periods of                    rapid modulation of the block during functional
   tasks.                  This         amplitude-modulation                             method        may       be     suitable
   in         this             environment                  because                it      can      produce             a       quick
30 transition                    between           block         and        no-block            conditions.                  During
   periods                 of         inactivity,                 the          block          can      be       turned            off.
   However                the        block         can       be       re-initiated                 prior         to     activity

   interpreted                       as    requiring           a     linear     increase        up     to    some
   level.                 An       HFAC waveform             is      started after       a   period where
   the         ramped             direct        current        is     applied.       The    HFAC      waveform
 5 has          its          amplitude            increased            until     it   reaches         a    block
   threshold.                        At   this      point,        the     DC  offset     is     ramped       down
   until the whole waveform is                                    charge-balanced, thus allowing
   the         HFAC            block        to     be     established          without       onset       action
   potentials.                        In   one example,              the DC    offset    peak is         in    the
10 range           of approximately                      ten percent          of the    HFAC      amplitude.
   In        one         example,            the      total        time     during    which      the      DC    is
   applied is about 80 milliseconds.                                         The total time includes
   the DC ramp-up, the DC plateau, and the DC ramp down.
                Some            portions            of      the       detailed      descriptions             that
15 follow                are         presented           in     terms       of    algorithms.               These
   algorithmic                      descriptions            and       representations         are      used     by
   those           skilled in               the      art    to convey the           substance        of their
   work          to         others.              An     algorithm,          here    and     generally,          is
   conceived                   to      be   a    sequence          of    operations      that      produce         a
20 result.                  The operations may include physical manipulations
   of physical quantities.                                  The physical manipulations create
   a concrete, tangible, useful, real-world result.
                Example                 methods          may      be      better     appreciated             with
   reference to flow diagrams.                                      For purposes of simplicity of

   described                   as      a   series        of    blocks.         However,      it     is    to    be
   appreciated                      that    the methodologies                are not      limited by the
   order of the blocks, as                                some blocks can occur in different
   orders               and/or           concurrently              with     other    blocks       from       that
30 shown               and          described.                Moreover,          less    than        all       the
   illustrated blocks may be required to implement an example
   methodology.                          Blocks        may     be      combined     or   separated           into

                Figure              11      illustrates                  a     method          1100         associated              with
   an HFAC                nerve           conduction block.                          Method             1100       includes,            at

   first           HFAC will                  have a           first        amplitude, a                  first        frequency,

   over time while the charge                                       is being balanced.
                 Figure             12     illustrates                a      method         1200        associated              with
   an HFAC                nerve         conduction block.                           Method         1200        includes,            at

                                                              20
   1210,       first            applying a            direct current             (DC)       to an axon of a
   nerve.            This DC will have a first DC amplitude that is not
   sufficient                to produce              a   nerve     block       in      the       axon.         Method
   1200       then           proceeds,            at      1220,      to     increase             the     first     DC
 5 amplitude               over      a    period         of   time.         The      first         DC    amplitude
   is   increased                 to a       second        DC    amplitude           that        is    sufficient
   to produce a nerve block in the axon.
            Method              1200 then proceeds,                   at    1230,        to apply           an HFAC
   to   the          axon.            The      HFAC       has     an    HFAC       amplitude,              an    HFAC
10 frequency,                  and      an      HFAC        current.             The         combination           of
   frequency,               amplitude,             and current           is    designed to produce                    a
   nerve conduction block in the axon.                                         Note that the HFAC is
   applied            after          the      DC       has    been      ramped          up       to    a     desired
   level.              Method          1200       then      proceeds,          at      1240,         to   decrease
15 the     second              DC    amplitude            to    a   third       DC      amplitude             over    a
   period          of time.                The DC having              the     third         DC      amplitude      is
   not      sufficient                 to      produce         a   nerve         block           in    the      axon.
   Thus, method 1200 provides a combination of the DC and the
   HFAC      in        an       order       that       reduces       an     onset        activity           that   is
20 observed in the nerve either proximally or distally to the
   blocking electrode or electrodes.
            In        one        example,          the     DC     offset       peak        is      between       five
   percent and fifteen percent of the HFAC amplitude.                                                          In one
   example, the first period of time and the second period of
25 time during which the DC is ramped up and then ramped down
   collectively                    comprise            less      than       80     milliseconds.                   In
   another            example,            the      first     period         of   time         is     between      100
   milliseconds                   and      200     milliseconds,             and       the       second        period
   of time is between 100 milliseconds and 200 milliseconds.
