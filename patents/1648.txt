                    ALGINATE COATING FOR SEED TREATMENT
   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
           This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S.
   Provisional Application Serial No. 61/898,219, filed October 31, 2013, the disclosure
 5 of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to the field of agrochemical coatings for seeds.
   The invention provides a method of seed coating using alginates, optionally
10 containing insecticidal, nematocidal or fungicidal active ingredients, and/or nutrients.
   BACKGROUND) OFTHE INVENTION
           The global demand of seed treatment has been primarily driven by the
   growth of the commercial seeds market. Increasing global farming and
15 reduction in arable land has generated the need for high yield productivity,
   further boosting the market for seed treatment.
           Production of alginate beads/pellets is usually accomplished by dropping a
   sodium alginate solution including the viable structures into a CaCl2 solution,
   allowing the outside-to-inside growth of beads. However, the complete coating of
20 larger structures such as plant seeds using this technique is not practical.
           The commercially existing alginate seed coating process is either not
   crosslinked, thereby precluding slow release of the active ingredient (AI), or uses a
   soaking/dipping approach that is not amenable to seed coating and handling.
25 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           The alginate coating technology described herein enables us to introduce
   the controlled release function to the pre-existing or newly-applied
   biological/chemical active ingredients on the seed surface. One aspect of the
   present invention is directed to a spray-based alginate seed coating process that uses
30 two separate spray steps to introduce the alginate based seed coating onto the seed
   surface followed by the cross linking of the coating.
           One aspect of the invention is directed to a method of seed treatment
   comprising (a) applying to seeds a coating of an alginate, optionally containing one or
                                               1

   more crop protection agents selected from the group consisting of insecticides,
   nematocides and fungicides, and/or one or more nutrients; and (b) crosslinking the
   alginate with a divalent metal ion. In one embodiment, the seeds are a pretreated
   seeds. In one embodiment the divalent metal ion is selected from the group consisting
 5 of Ca 2 , Ba +2and Zn' 2 . In one embodiment the crosslinking is effected by applying a
   divalent metal ion solution. In one embodiment the divalent metal ion solution
   comprises an aqueous solution of a divalent metal salt. Preferably the divalent metal
   salt is a calcium salt, selected from the group consisting of calcium chloride, calcium
   carbonate and calcium sulfate. In one embodiment the divalent metal ion solution is
10 applied by spraying. In one embodiment the application of the alginate coating is also
   applied via spraying.
            Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method of seed treatment
   including (a) spraying seeds with a solution of a soluble alginate containing one or
   more crop protection agents selected from the group consisting of insecticides,
15 nematocides and fungicides, and/or one or more nutrients, to forn coated seeds; and
   (b) spraying the coated seeds with an aqueous solution of a calcium salt in order to
   crosslink the alginate. In one embodiment the seeds are pretreated seeds. In another

10          Sodium alginate is the sodium salt of alginic acid, which is obtained by
   extraction from various species of deep-sea weed like Phaeophyceae. Sodium
   alginate is a polysaccharide, as are starch and cellulose. Sodium alginate has been
   used as both a binder and a disintegrant in a variety of oral and topical
   pharmaceutical formulations. In agriculture applications, alginate has been
15 exploited to encapsulate viable structures for different purposes. Naked embryos
   have been entrapped in calcium alginate to produce synthetic seeds (Patel et aL,
   2000) or viable cells of microorganisms have been entrapped in calcium alginate to
   produce alginate pellets or to coat plant seeds for biological seed treatment (Russo
   et aL, 2001; Haverson and Kimbrough, 2002). Production of alginate beads is
20 usually accomplished by dropping sodium alginate solution including viable
   structures into a CaC 2 solution, allowing the outside-to-inside growth of beads.
   However, the procedure of inclusion of large structures such as plant seeds with
   this technique is impractical.
            Alginate salts have been used for compositions in the treatment of plants for
25 protection thereof. W0201 1tJS48748, CN103392737 (A), and US201202191 1 (A1)
   describe plant treatment compositions comprising metal alginate salts and at least one
   amine compound useful in the treatment of plants, particularly food crops.
   US5,977,023 provides a pesticidal composition containing a water-insoluble alginate,
   which is prepared by treating a solid composition containing (a) a pesticidally active
30 ingredient which is a pest-controlling active ingredient or a plant growth-regulating
   active ingredient and (b) an alginic acid or a water-soluble alginate with an aqueous
   solution containing a divalent or polyvalent cation which can convert said alginic acid
   or water-soluble alginate into a water-insoluble alginate.
                                               5

           One aspect of the present invention is directed to a spray-based alginate seed
   coating process that uses two alternative spray steps to introduce the alginate based
   seed coating onto the seed surface and the cross linking of the coating, respectively. In
   one embodiment, the seed coating formulations can be prepared by first milling
 5 pesticide particles and then mixing milled pesticide particles directly into a sodium
   alginate solution, or adding sodium alginate to the existing SC formulations of the
   pesticides. This seed coating formulation can be then applied to the seed surface via
   spray.
           In another embodiment, the AIls are in a suitable liquid formulation that may
10 be sprayed on the seed surface. In at least such embodiment, the liquid formulation
   must contain other excipients such as surfactants, viscosity adjustors, pH adjustors
   and any other suitable ingredinets. In this embodiment, suitable surfactant may be a
   nonionic surfactant, cationic, anionic, amphoteric compound. By the way of eamples
   suitable nonionic surfactants may include alkanolamides (such as cocamide
15 diethanolamide, lauric acid monoisopropanolamide, and ethoxylated myristamide),
   xyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers (such as alkylaryl
   polyglycol ethers) and fluorocarbons (such as ethoxylated polyfluorinated alcohol);
   anionic surfactants including alkyl-, alkylaryl- and arylsulfonates (such as sodium
   lauryl sarcosinate and such as sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate), alkyl-, alkylaryl- and
20 arylsulfates, protein hydrolysates, derivatives of polycarboxylic acid (such as
   ammonium lauryl ether carboxylate), olefin sulfonates (such as sodium alpha olefin
   sulfonate), sarcosinates (such as ammonium cyclohexyl palmitoyl taurinate),
   succinates (such as disodium N-octadecyl sulfosuccinamate), phosphorus derivatives
   (such as phosphoric acid esters and their equivalent salts); cationic surfactants
25 including alkylbenzyltrimethylammoniuni chloride; and amphoteric surfactants
   including betaine. The total concentration of selected agents in the formulation will be
   dependent on the type of formulatoin, active ingredients employed and may comprise
   between about 0.1 % and about 50% of the final formulation, preferably between
   about 0.3% and about 50%.
30         In one aspect of the invention, the seeds that can be treated with the presently
   descirbed process include but are not limited to genetically modified or non-modified
   corn, wheat, oat, rye, soybean, cotton, flax, jute, rape, canola, linseed, sesame,
   safflower, sunflower, clover, beet, sugar beet, sorghum, millet, rice, peanut pea,
   beans, cucumber, pepper, melon, cabbage, onion, squash, lettuce, asparagus, cabbage,
                                                6

   eggplant, tomato, tobacco, flower seed and trufgrass. In at least a preferred
   embodiment, the seeds are any one of corn, wheat, oat, rye, soybean and cotton.
            Any apparatus capable of coating/spraying seeds can be used to realize this
    process. One such commercial seed treater is the "Wintersteiger Hege 11 Seed
 5  Treater". After spray application of the pesticide/alginate seed coating, a water
    solution of CaC12 is then sprayed onto the seed coating surface to introduce the
    crosslinking of the coating. In additiona, different concentrations of the alginate
    and CaC 12 can be used in the coating process to adjust the release rate of the
    resultant seed coating. In at least one embodiment, the coating may contain two
10  or more active ingredients.
            In one embodiment, commercially pre-treated seeds can be coated with a
    layer of alginate coating to introduce the controlled release property to the Als of
    the pre-treatment. In this process, only sodium alginate solution (i.e., without the
    Al mixed) is sprayed onto the seed surface and followed by the cross linking via
15  CaC12 spray. In this way the introduction of a controlled release property to the
    Al on the pre-treated seeds can be achieved using the crosslinked alginate
    resulting from the two-step spray process.ln an alternative embodiment, the
    alginate solution may contain one or more Ais which are then applied on to the
    surface of the pretreated seed, thereby facilitating continous release for all
20  respective As employed on th seed itself.
            For the two steps of applying the alginate coating solution and the
    crosslinking agent CaC 2, the procedures can be altered as well, i.e., first apply the
    CaC12 material on the seed surface followed by applying of the alginale coating
    solution.
25          Addition of other functional agents such as nutrients to the alginate solution
    can also be employed in the alginate coating formulations. Further, the coating
    thickness and the concentrations of the Al in the formulations can easily be adjusted.
            In another embodiment, the controlled release coating may contain additional
    crop protection agents such as an insecticide, a nematocide, a fungicide, and/or one
30  or more growth enhancing nutrients, and combinatins thereof. Suitable crop

           In another aspect of the present invention, suitable combination of any one of
25  insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, nematicides and plant growth promoters are
    provided to expand and provide better coverage in the furrow.
           One aspect of the invention is directed to a method of seed treatment
   comprising (a) applying to seeds a coating of an alginate, optionally containing one or
   more crop protection agents selected from the group consisting of insecticides,
30 nematocides, stress-reducing agents and fungicides, and/or one or more nutrients for
   seedling and plant growth; and (b) crosslinking the alginate coating with a divalent
   metal ion. The alginate is preferably a soluble alginate, such as sodium or potassium
   alginate. In one embodiment, the seeds are a pretreated seeds. Seeds can be
   pretreated with fungicides, insecticides, nematocides, and the like. Pretreated seeds
                                               14

   can be commercial products, or can be treated immediately before coating with the
   alginate. In one embodiment, the insecticide is acetamiprid.
           In one embodiment the divalent metal ion is selected from the group
   consisting of Ca+2 , Ba  +2and  Zn*. Preferably the divalent metal ion is Ca+  2
                                                                                    . In one
 5 embodiment the crosslinking is effected by applying a divalent metal ion solution. In
   one embodiment the divalent metal ion solution comprises an aqueous solution of a
   divalent metal salt, preferably a calcium salt selected from the group consisting of
   calcium chloride, calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate. In one embodiment the
   divalent metal ion solution is applied by spraying. In one embodiment the application
10 of the alginate coating is also applied via spraying.
           Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method of seed treatment
   comprising (a) spraying seeds with a solution of a soluble alginate containing one or
   more crop protection agents selected from the group consisting of insecticides,
   nematocides, stress-reducing agents and fungicides, and/or one or more nutrients, to
15 form coated seeds; and (b) spraying the coated seeds with an aqueous solution of a
   calcium salt in order to crosslink the alginate. In one embodiment the seeds are
   pretreated seeds. Seeds can be pretreated with fungicides, insecticides, nematocides,
   and the like. Pretreated seeds can be commercial products, or can be treated
   immediately before coating with the alginate.
20         In at least one aspect, the presently described controlled release seed treatment
   provides numerically and statistically significant improvement for controlling
   undesirable pests, insects, fungus and/or nematodes as compared to non-controlled
   release products of the same active ingredient. In more prefered embodiment, the
   improvement is particulaly significant at later residual dates such as 35, 42, 52, 59, 66,
25 81 or 88 days after planting the presently described seeds. In at least one embodiment,
   the control of cotton aphid was statistically significant compared to non-controlled
   formualtion of the same or comparable active ingredient; at least at 50 days after
   treatment and further remained its statistically significant impat for at least 88 days
   after plantation of the treated seeds.
30         Another aspect of the invention is directed to a coated seed including a plant
   seed core and a controlled release coating that includes crosslinked alginate and a
   crop protection agent selected from the group consisting of insecticides, nematocides
   and fungicides, and/or one or more nutrients, and combinations thereof. In one
   embodiment, the plant seed core is a seed selected from the group consisting of

   EXAMPLES
   Example 1. Controlled Release Acetamiprid Residual Study
           The residual activity of a controlled release ("CR") acetamiprid cotton seed
   treatment ("ST"'), a non-controlled release ("NCR") acetamiiprid ("ST"), and Cruiser
 5 ST cotton (thiamethoxam) was tested against cotton aphid ("CA") in a microbially
   active soil/sand mixture.

   to CA through 28 DAP, and statistically improved control with CR acetamiprid
   compared to NCR acetamiprid at evaluation dates between 35 DAP and 88 DAP.
