[0059]    It is to be appreciated that certain aspects, modes, embodiments, variations and
features of the invention are described below in various levels of detail in order to provide a
substantial understanding of the present invention. The definitions of certain terms as used
in this specification are provided below. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and
scientific terms used herein generally have the same meaning as commonly understood by
one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
[0060]    In practicing the present disclosure, many conventional techniques of cell biology,
molecular biology, protein biochemistry, immunology, and bacteriology are used. These
techniques are well-known in the art and are provided in any number of available
publications, including CurrentProtocolsin MolecularBiology, Vols. I-III, Ausubel, Ed.
(1997); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Second Ed. (Cold

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
[0061]     As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an"
and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. For example,
reference to "a cell" includes a combination of two or more cells, and the like.
[0062]     As used herein, the "administration" of an agent, drug, or peptide to a subject
includes any route of introducing or delivering to a subject a compound to perform its
intended function. Administration can be carried out by any suitable route, including orally,
intranasally, parenterally (intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or
subcutaneously), or topically. Administration includes self-administration and the
administration by another.
As used herein, the term "amino acid" includes naturally-occurring amino acids and
synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function
in a manner similar to the naturally-occurring amino acids. Naturally-occurring amino acids
are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified,
e.g., hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers
to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino
acid, i.e., an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an
R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium.
Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but
retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acid
mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the
general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a
naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acids can be referred to herein by either their
commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the
IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.
[0063]     As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to
achieve a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect. In the context of therapeutic or
prophylactic applications, the amount of a composition administered to the subject will
depend on the type and severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the individual,
such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on
the degree, severity and type of disease. The skilled artisan will be able to determine
appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. The compositions can also be
administered in combination with one or more additional therapeutic compounds. In some
                                                In

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
embodiments the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to achieve a desired
electronic or conductance effect, e.g., to facilitate or enhance electron transfer. .
[0064]     As used herein, "exogenous nucleic acid" refers to nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RNA)
that is not naturally present within a host cell but is introduced from an outside source. As
used herein, exogenous nucleic acid refers to nucleic acid that has not integrated in to the
genome of the host cell but remains separate, such as a bacterial plasmid nucleic acid. As
used herein, "bacterial plasmid" refers to a circular DNA of bacterial origin which serves as
a carrier of a sequence of interest and a means for expressing that sequence in a bacterial
host cell.
[0065]     An "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide or peptide is substantially free of cellular
material or other contaminating polypeptides from the cell or tissue source from which the
agent is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when
chemically synthesized. For example, an isolated aromatic-cationic peptide or an isolated
cytochrome c protein would be free of materials that would interfere with diagnostic or
therapeutic uses of the agent or would interfere with conductance, or electric properties of
the peptide. Such interfering materials may include enzymes, hormones and other
proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous solutes.
[0066]     As used herein, "inducible promoter" refers to a promoter that is influenced by
certain conditions, such as temperature or the presence of specific molecules, and promotes
the expression of operably linked nucleic acid sequences of interest only when those
conditions are met.
[0067]     As used herein, "constitutive promoter" refers to a promoter that facilitates
expression of operably linked nucleic acid sequences of interest under all or most
environmental conditions.
[0068]     As used herein, the terms "polypeptide", "peptide", and "protein" are used
interchangeably herein to mean a polymer comprising two or more amino acids joined to
each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres. Polypeptide
refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, glycopeptides or oligomers,
and to longer chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino
acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. Polypeptides include amino acid
                                                ')1

sequences modified either by natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by
chemical modification techniques that are well known in the art.
[0069]    As used herein, "recombinant bacteria" refers to bacteria that have been
engineered to carry and /or express one or more exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., DNA)
sequences.
[0070]    As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" or "alleviation" refers to both
therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to
prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. It is also to be
appreciated that the various modes of treatment or prevention of medical conditions as
described are intended to mean "substantial", which includes total but also less than total
treatment or prevention, and wherein some biologically or medically relevant result is
achieved.
[0071]    As used herein, "prevention" or "preventing" of a disorder or condition refers to a
compound that reduces the occurrence of the disorder or condition in the treated sample
relative to an untreated control sample, or delays the onset or reduces the severity of one or
more symptoms of the disorder or condition relative to the untreated control sample.
Aromatic-cationic peptides
[0072]    The present technology relates to the use of aromatic-cationic peptides. In some
embodiments, the peptides are useful in aspects related to conductance.
[0073]    The aromatic-cationic peptides are water-soluble and highly polar. Despite these
properties, the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes. The aromatic-cationic
peptides typically include a minimum of three amino acids or a minimum of four amino
acids, covalently joined by peptide bonds. The maximum number of amino acids present in
the aromatic-cationic peptides is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide
bonds. Suitably, the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve, about nine, or about
six.
[0074]    The amino acids of the aromatic-cationic peptides can be any amino acid. As used
herein, the term "amino acid" is used to refer to any organic molecule that contains at least
one amino group and at least one carboxyl group. Typically, at least one amino group is at
the a position relative to a carboxyl group. The amino acids may be naturally occurring.

  WO 2013/059071                                                             PCT/US2012/059790
Naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, the twenty most common
levorotatory (L) amino acids normally found in mammalian proteins, i.e., alanine (Ala),
arginine (Arg), asparagine (Asn), aspartic acid (Asp), cysteine (Cys), glutamine (Gln),
glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine (His), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), lysine
(Lys), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr),
tryptophan, (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val). Other naturally occurring amino acids
include, for example, amino acids that are synthesized in metabolic processes not associated
with protein synthesis. For example, the amino acids ornithine and citrulline are synthesized
in mammalian metabolism during the production of urea. Another example of a naturally
occurring amino acid includes hydroxyproline (Hyp).
[0075]      The peptides optionally contain one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids.
Optimally, the peptide has no amino acids that are naturally occurring. The non-naturally
occurring amino acids may be levorotary (L-), dextrorotatory (D-), or mixtures thereof. Non
naturally occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically are not synthesized in
normal metabolic processes in living organisms, and do not naturally occur in proteins. In
addition, the non-naturally occurring amino acids suitably are also not recognized by
common proteases. The non-naturally occurring amino acid can be present at any position
in the peptide. For example, the non-naturally occurring amino acid can be at the N
terminus, the C-terminus, or at any position between the N-terminus and the C-terminus.
[0076]      The non-natural amino acids may, for example, comprise alkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl
groups not found in natural amino acids. Some examples of non-natural alkyl amino acids
include a-aminobutyric acid, 0-aminobutyric acid, y-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminovaleric
acid, and r-aminocaproic acid. Some examples of non-natural aryl amino acids include
ortho-, meta, and para-aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of non-natural alkylaryl amino
acids include ortho-, meta-, and para-aminophenylacetic acid, and y-phenyl-3-aminobutyric
acid. Non-naturally occurring amino acids include derivatives of naturally occurring amino
acids. The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may, for example, include the
addition of one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.
[0077]      For example, one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of the 2',
3', 4', 5', or 6' position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue, or the 4',
5', 6', or 7' position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any
chemical group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups

  WO 2013/059071                                                             PCT/US2012/059790
include branched or unbranched C1 -C4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl,
butyl, isobutyl, or t-butyl, CI-C 4 alkyloxy (i.e., alkoxy), amino, C 1-C 4 alkylamino and C1 -C 4
dialkylamino (e.g., methylamino, dimethylamino), nitro, hydroxyl, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro,
bromo, or iodo). Some specific examples of non-naturally occurring derivatives of naturally
occurring amino acids include norvaline (Nva) and norleucine (Nle).
[0078]    Another example of a modification of an amino acid in a peptide is the
derivatization of a carboxyl group of an aspartic acid or a glutamic acid residue of the
peptide. One example of derivatization is amidation with ammonia or with a primary or
secondary amine, e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another
example of derivatization includes esterification with, for example, methyl or ethyl alcohol.
Another such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a lysine, arginine,
or histidine residue. For example, such amino groups can be acylated. Some suitable acyl
groups include, for example, a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising any of the
C1 -C4 alkyl groups mentioned above, such as an acetyl or propionyl group.
[0079]    The non-naturally occurring amino acids are suitably resistant or insensitive, to
common proteases. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids that are resistant or
insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory (D-) form of any of the above-mentioned
naturally occurring L-amino acids, as well as L-and/or D- non-naturally occurring amino
acids. The D-amino acids do not normally occur in proteins, although they are found in
certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than the normal ribosomal
protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein, the D-amino acids are considered to
be non-naturally occurring amino acids.
[0080]     In order to minimize protease sensitivity, the peptides should have less than five,
less than four, less than three, or less than two contiguous L-amino acids recognized by
common proteases, irrespective of whether the amino acids are naturally or non-naturally
occurring. In one embodiment, the peptide has only D-amino acids, and no L-amino acids. If
the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of amino acids, at least one of the amino
acids is preferably a non-naturally-occurring D-amino acid, thereby conferring protease
resistance. An example of a protease sensitive sequence includes two or more contiguous
basic amino acids that are readily cleaved by common proteases, such as endopeptidases
and trypsin. Examples of basic amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine.

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
[0081]    The aromatic-cationic peptides should have a minimum number of net positive
charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid residues in the
peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH will be referred
to below as (pm). The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will be referred to
below as (r). The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below are all at
physiological pH. The term "physiological pH" as used herein refers to the normal pH in the
cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance, the physiological pH of
a human is normally approximately 7.4, but normal physiological pH in mammals may be
any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.
[0082]      "Net charge" as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive
charges and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the
peptide. In this specification, it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological
pH. The naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH
include L-lysine, L-arginine, and L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are
negatively charged at physiological pH include L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid.
[0083]    Typically, a peptide has a positively charged N-terminal amino group and a
negatively charged C-terminal carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at
physiological pH. As an example of calculating net charge, the peptide Tyr-Arg-Phe-Lys
Glu-His-Trp-D-Arg has one negatively charged amino acid (i.e., Glu) and four positively
charged amino acids (i.e., two Arg residues, one Lys, and one His). Therefore, the above
peptide has a net positive charge of three.
[0084]     In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between the
minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH (pm) and the total number of
amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1.
In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges
(pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790

[0085]    In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid
residues (r) wherein 2 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1. In this
embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm)
and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

      (r)     3   4   5  6   7   8    9  10  11    12   13   14  15   16    17   18   19    20
     (pm)    2    2   3  3   4   4    5   5   6    6    7    7    8    8    9    9    10    10
[0086]    In one embodiment, the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total
number of amino acid residues (r) are equal. In another embodiment, the peptides have three
or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge, suitably, a minimum
of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive charges.
[0087]    It is also important that the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number of
aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges (pt). The
minimum number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as (a). Naturally occurring
amino acids that have an aromatic group include the amino acids histidine, tryptophan,
tyrosine, and phenylalanine. For example, the hexapeptide Lys-Gln-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Trp has
a net positive charge of two (contributed by the lysine and arginine residues) and three
aromatic groups (contributed by tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan residues).
[0088]    The aromatic-cationic peptides should also have a relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges at
physiological pH (pt) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1,
except that when pt is 1, a may also be 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is
as follows:

[0091]     Carboxyl groups, especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C-terminal amino
acid, are suitably amidated with, for example, ammonia to form the C-terminal amide.
Alternatively, the terminal carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid may be amidated
with any primary or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may, for example,
be an alkyl, especially a branched or unbranched C1 -C4 alkyl, or an aryl amine.
Accordingly, the amino acid at the C-terminus of the peptide may be converted to an amido,
N-methylamido, N-ethylamido, N,N-dimethylamido, N,N-diethylamido, N-methyl-N
ethylamido, N-phenylamido or N-phenyl-N-ethylamido group. The free carboxylate groups
of the asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues not occurring at the
C-terminus of the aromatic-cationic peptides may also be amidated wherever they occur
within the peptide. The amidation at these internal positions may be with ammonia or any of
the primary or secondary amines described above.

[0097]    In some embodiments, peptides useful in the methods of the present invention are
those peptides which have a tyrosine residue or a tyrosine derivative. In some
embodiments, derivatives of tyrosine include 2'-methyltyrosine (Mmt); 2',6'
dimethyltyrosine (2'6'Dmt); 3',5'-dimethyltyrosine (3'5'Dmt); N,2',6'-trimethyltyrosine
(Tmt); and 2'-hydroxy-6'-methyltryosine (Hmt).
[0098]    In one embodiment, the peptide has the formula Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (referred
to herein as SS-01). SS-01 has a net positive charge of three, contributed by the amino
acids tyrosine, arginine, and lysine and has two aromatic groups contributed by the amino
acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. The tyrosine of SS-01 can be a modified derivative of
tyrosine such as in 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine to produce the compound having the formula
2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH      2 (referred to herein as SS-02).
[0099]    In a suitable embodiment, the amino acid residue at the N-terminus is arginine. An
example of such a peptide is D-Arg-2'6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (referred to herein as SS-3 1).
[0100]    In another embodiment, the amino acid at the N-terminus is phenylalanine or its
derivative. In some embodiments, derivatives of phenylalanine include 2'
methylphenylalanine (Mmp), 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine (Dmp), N,2',6'
trimethylphenylalanine (Tmp), and 2'-hydroxy-6'-methylphenylalanine (Hmp). An example
of such a peptide is Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (referred to herein as SS-20). In one

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
embodiment, the amino acid sequence of SS-02 is rearranged such that Dmt is not at the N
terminus. An example of such an aromatic-cationic peptide has the formula D-Arg
2'6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1).
[0101]     In yet another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide has the formula Phe-D
Arg-Dmt-Lys-NH 2 (referred to herein as SS-30). Alternatively, the N-terminal
phenylalanine can be a derivative of phenylalanine such as 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine
(2'6'Dmp). SS-01 containing 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine at amino acid position one has
the formula 2',6'-Dmp-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-NH 2.
In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap
NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is -anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg
Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D
Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine,
D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is
P-dansyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0102]     The peptides mentioned herein and their derivatives can further include functional
analogs. A peptide is considered a functional analog if the analog has the same function as
the stated peptide. The analog may, for example, be a substitution variant of a peptide,
wherein one or more amino acids are substituted by another amino acid. Suitable
substitution variants of the peptides include conservative amino acid substitutions. Amino
acids may be grouped according to their physicochemical characteristics as follows:
         (a)     Non-polar amino acids: Ala(A) Ser(S) Thr(T) Pro(P) Gly(G) Cys (C);
         (b)     Acidic amino acids: Asn(N) Asp(D) Glu(E) Gln(Q);
         (c)     Basic amino acids: His(H) Arg(R) Lys(K);
         (d)     Hydrophobic amino acids: Met(M) Leu(L) Ile(I) Val(V); and
         (e)     Aromatic amino acids: Phe(F) Tyr(Y) Trp(W) His (H).
[0103]     Substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in the same
group is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the physicochemical
characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast, substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide
by another amino acid in a different group is generally more likely to alter the
characteristics of the original peptide. Non-limiting examples of analogs useful in the

[0109]    In some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides include at least one arginine
and/or at least one lysine residue. In some embodiments, the arginine and/or lysine residue
serves as an electron acceptor and participates in proton coupled electron transport.
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptide
comprises a sequence resulting in a "charge-ring-charge-ring" configuration such as exists
in SS-3 1. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments the aromatic-cationic
peptides include thiol-containing residues, such as cysteine and methionine. In some
embodiments, peptides including thiol-containing residues directly donate electrons and
reduce cyt c. In some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides include a vysteine at the
N- and/or at the C-terminus of the peptide.
[0110]    In some embodiments, peptide multimers are provided. For example in some
embodiments, dimers are provided, such as an SS-20 dimer: Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Phe-D
Arg-Phe-Lys. In some embodiments, the dimer is an SS-31 dimer: D-Arg-2'6'Dmt-Lys
Phe-D-Arg-2'6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2. In some embodiments, the multimers are trimers,
tetramers and/or pentamers. In some embodiments, the multimers include combinations of
different monomer peptides (e.g., an SS-20 peptide linked to an SS-31 peptide). In some
embodiments, these longer analogs are useful as therapeutic molecules and/or are useful in
the sensors, switches and conductors disclosed herein.

Peptide Synthesis

  WO 2013/059071                                                        PCT/US2012/059790
[0112]    The peptides may be synthesized by any of the methods well known in the art.
Suitable methods for chemically synthesizing the protein include, for example, those
described by Stuart and Young in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Second Edition, Pierce
Chemical Company (1984), and in Methods Enzymol., 289, Academic Press, Inc, New York
(1997).
[0113]    One way of stabilizing peptides against enzymatic degradation is the replacement
of an L-amino acid with a D-amino acid at the peptide bond undergoing cleavage. Aromatic
cationic peptide analogs are prepared containing one or more D-amino acid residues in
addition to the D-Arg residue already present. Another way to prevent enzymatic
degradation is N-methylation of the a-amino group at one or more amino acid residues of
the peptides. This will prevent peptide bond cleavage by any peptidase. Examples include:
H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys(N"Me)-Phe-NH2; H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe(NMe)-NH 2 ; H-D-Arg-Dmt
Lys(N"Me)-Phe(NMe)-NH 2; and H-D-Arg(NMe)-Dmt(NMe)-Lys(N"Me)-Phe(NMe)-NH2
N"-methylated analogues have lower hydrogen bonding capacity and can be expected to
have improved intestinal permeability.
[0114]    An alternative way to stabilize a peptide amide bond (-CO-NH-) against enzymatic
degradation is its replacement with a reduced amide bond (W[CH 2-NH]). This can be
achieved with a reductive alkylation reaction between a Boc-amino acid-aldehyde and the
amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue of the growing peptide chain in solid
phase peptide synthesis. The reduced peptide bond is predicted to result in improved
cellular permeability because of reduced hydrogen-bonding capacity. Examples include: H
D-Arg-W[CH 2 -NH]Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2, H-D-Arg-Dmt-W[CH 2 -NH]Lys-Phe-NH 2, H-D-Arg
Dmt-LysT[CH 2 -NH]Phe-NH 2 , H-D-Arg-Dmt-T[CH 2-NH]Lys-W[CH 2-NH]Phe-NH 2 , etc.
Lipids
[0115]    Cardiolipin is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane,
where it constitutes about 20% of the total lipid composition. In mammalian cells,
cardiolipin is found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is
essential for the optimal function of enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism.

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
[0116]    Cardiolipin is a species of diphosphatidylglycerol lipid comprising two
phosphatidylglycerols connected with a glycerol backbone to form a dimeric structure. It
has four alkyl groups and potentially carries two negative charges. As there are four distinct
alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the potential for complexity of this molecule species is
enormous. However, in most animal tissues, cardiolipin contains 18-carbon fatty alkyl
chains with 2 unsaturated bonds on each of them. It has been proposed that the (18:2)4 acyl
chain configuration is an important structural requirement for the high affinity of cardiolipin
to inner membrane proteins in mammalian mitochondria. However, studies with isolated
enzyme preparations indicate that its importance may vary depending on the protein
examined.
[0117]    Each of the two phosphates in the molecule can catch one proton. Although it has
a symmetric structure, ionization of one phosphate happens at different levels of acidity
than ionizing both, with pK1 =3 and pK2 > 7.5. Hence, under normal physiological
conditions (a pH of approximately 7.0), the molecule may carry only one negative charge.
Hydroxyl groups (-OH and -0-) on the phosphate form a stable intramolecular hydrogen
bonds, forming a bicyclic resonance structure. This structure traps one proton, which is
conducive to oxidative phosphorylation.
[0118]    During the oxidative phosphorylation process catalyzed by Complex IV, large
quantities of protons are transferred from one side of the membrane to another side causing
a large pH change. It has been suggested that cardiolipin functions as a proton trap within
the mitochondrial membranes, strictly localizing the proton pool and minimizing pH in the
mitochondrial intermembrane space. This function is thought to be due to the unique
structure of cardiolipin, which, as described above, can trap a proton within the bicyclic
structure while carrying a negative charge. Thus, cardiolipin can serve as an electron buffer
pool to release or absorb protons to maintain the pH near the mitochondrial membranes.
[0119]    In addition, cardiolipin has been shown to play a role in apoptosis. An early event
in the apoptosis cascade involves cardiolipin. As discussed in more detail below, a
cardiolipin-specific oxygenase produces cardiolipin-hydroperoxides which causes the lipid
to undergo a conformational change. The oxidized cardiolipin then translocates from the
inner mitochondrial membrane to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it is thought to
form a pore through which cytochrome c is released into the cytosol. Cytochrome c can
bind to the IP3 receptor stimulating calcium release, which further promotes the release of

cytochrome c. When the cytoplasmic calcium concentration reaches a toxic level, the cell
dies. In addition, extra-mitochondrial cytochrome c interacts with apoptotic activating
factors, causing the formation of apoptosomal complexes and activation of the proteolytic
caspase cascade.
[0120]    Another consequence is that cytochrome c interacts with cardiolipin on the inner
mitochondrial membrane with high affinity and forms a complex with cardiolipin that is
non-productive in transporting electrons, but which acts as a cardiolipin-specific
oxygenase/peroxidase. Indeed, interaction of cardiolipin with cytochrome c yields a
complex whose normal redox potential is about minus (-) 400 mV more negative than that
of intact cytochrome c. As a result, the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex cannot accept
electrons from mitochondrial complex III, leading to enhanced production of superoxide
whose dismutation yields H 2 0 2 . The cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex also cannot accept
electrons from superoxide. In addition, the high affinity interaction of cardiolipin with
cytochrome c results in the activation of cytochrome c into a a cardiolipin-specific
peroxidase with selective catalytic activity toward peroxidation of polyunsaturated
molecular cardiolipin. The peroxidase reaction of the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex is
driven by H 2 0 2 as a source of oxidizing equivalents. Ultimately, this activity results in the
accumulation of cardiolipin oxidation products, mainly cardiolipin-OOH and their reduction
products, cardiolipin-OH. As noted above, it been shown that oxygenated cardiolipin
species play a role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of pro
apoptotic factors (including cytochrome c itself) into the cytosol. See e.g., Kagan et al.,
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 61 (2009) 1375-1385; Kagan et al., Mol. Nutr. Food Res.
2009 January; 53(1): 104-114, both of which are incoproated herein by reference.
Regarding cytochrome c, cytochrome c is a globular protein whose major function is to
serve as electron carrier from complex III (cytochrome c reductase) to complex IV
cytochromec c oxidase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The prosthetic heme
group is attached to the cytochrome c at Cys14 and Cys17, and is additionally bound by two
coordinate axial ligands, His 18 and Met8O. The 6 th coordinate binding to Met8O prevents
the interaction of the Fe with other ligands such as 02, H 2 0 2 , NO, etc.
A pool of cytochrome c is distributed in the intermembrane space, with the rest being
associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) via both electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions. Cytochrome c is a highly cationic protein (8+ net charge at

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
neutral pH) that can bind loosely to the anionic phospholipid cardiolipin on the IMM via
electrostatic interaction. And, as noted above, cytochrome c can also bind tightly to
cardiolipin via hydrophobic interaction. This tight binding of cytochrome c tocardiolipin
results from the extension of an acyl chain of cardiolipin out of the lipid membrane and
extending into a hydrophobic channel in the interior of cytochrome c (Tuominen et al.,
2001; Kalanxhi & Wallace, 2007; Sinabaldi et al., 2010). This leads to the rupture of the
Fe-Met8O bond in the cytochrome c heme pocket and results in a change in the heme
environment, as shown by the loss of the negative Cotton peak in the Soret band region
(Sinabaldi et al., 2008). It also leads to exposure of the heme Fe to H2 0 2and NO.
Native cytochrome c has poor peroxidase activity because of its 6th coordination. However,
upon hydrophobic binding to cardiolipin, cytochrome c undergoes structural changes that
breaks the Fe-Met8O coordination and increases the exposure of the heme Fe to H 2 0 2 , and
cyt C switches from an electron carrier to a peroxidase, with cardiolipin being the primary
substrate (Vladimirov et al., 2006; Basova et al., 2007). As described above, cardiolipin
peroxidation results in altered mitochondrial membrane structure, and the release of
cytochrome c from the IMM to initiate caspase-mediated cell death.
[0121]    Thus, in some embodiments, aromatic-cationic peptides as disclosed herein (such
as D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 ,Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 ,Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)DapNH 2,
where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 ,
where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 ,
where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2, Dmt-D
Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as acetate or trifluoroacetate salt) are
administered to a subject in need thereof. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is
thought that the peptides contact (e.g., target) cytochrome c, cardiolipin or both, hinder the
cardiolipin - cytochrome c interaction, inhibit the oxygenase/peroxidase activity of the
cardiolipin/cytochrome c complex, inhibit cardiolipin-hydroperoxide formation, inhibit the
translocation of cardiolipin to the outer membrane and/or inhibit the release of cytochrome c
from the IMM. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic
peptides disclosed herein include one or more of the following characteristics or functions:
(1) are cell permeable and target the inner mitochrondrial membrane; (2) selectively bind to
cardiolipin via electrostatic interactions which facilitates the interaction of the peptide with
                                                AA

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
cytochrome c; (3) interact with cytochrome c that is free and either loosely-bound or tightly
bound to cardiolipin; (4) protect the hydrophobic heme pocket of cytochrome c and/or
inhibit cardiolipin from disrupting the Fe-Met8O bond; (5) promote       7-n* interactions with
the heme porphorin; (6) inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity; (7) promote kinetics of
cytochrome c reduction; (8) prevent inhibition of cytochrome c reduction caused by
cardiolipin; (9) promote electron flux in the mitochrondrial electron transport chain and
ATP synthesis. In some embodiments, the ability of the peptide to promote electron
transport is not correlated with the ability of the peptide to inhibit peroxidase activity of the
cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex. Thus, in some embodiments, the administered peptides
inhibit, delay or reduce the interaction between cardiolipin and cytochrome c. Additionally
or alternatively, in some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce
the formation of cytochrome c/cardiolipin complexes. Additionally or alternatively, in
some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce the
oxygenase/peroxidase activity of the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complexes. Additionally or
alternatively, in some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce
apoptosis.
 Prophylactic and Therapeutic Uses of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides
[0122]    The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein are useful to prevent or treat
disease. Specifically, the disclosure provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods
of treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) disease by administering the aromatic
cationic peptides described herein. Accordingly, the present methods provide for the
prevention and/or treatment of disease in a subject by administering an effective amount of
an aromatic-cationic peptide to a subject in need thereof.
[0123]    In one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of reducing the number of
mitochondria undergoing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), or preventing
mitochondrial permeability transitioning in a mammal in need thereof, the method
comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of one or more aromatic
cationic peptides described herein. In another aspect, the disclosure provides a method for
increasing the ATP synthesis rate in a mammal in need thereof, the method comprising
administering to the mammal an effective amount of one or more aromatic-cationic peptides
described herein. In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides a method for reducing

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
oxidative damage in a mammal in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the
mammal an effective amount of one or more aromatic-cationic peptides described herein.
[0124]     Oxidative Damage. The peptides described above are useful in reducing oxidative
damage in a mammal in need thereof. Mammals in need of reducing oxidative damage are
those mammals suffering from a disease, condition or treatment associated with oxidative
damage. Typically, the oxidative damage is caused by free radicals, such as reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Examples of ROS and RNS include
hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion radical, nitric oxide, hydrogen, hypochlorous acid
(HOCl) and peroxynitrite anion. Oxidative damage is considered to be "reduced" if the
amount of oxidative damage in a mammal, a removed organ, or a cell is decreased after
administration of an effective amount of the aromatic cationic peptides described above.
Typically, the oxidative damage is considered to be reduced if the oxidative damage is
decreased by at least about 10%, at least about 250%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%,
or at least about 90%, compared to a control subject not treated with the peptide.
[0125]     In some embodiments, a mammal to be treated can be a mammal with a disease or
condition associated with oxidative damage. The oxidative damage can occur in any cell,
tissue or organ of the mammal. In humans, oxidative stress is involved in many diseases.
Examples include atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction,
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome and chronic
fatigue syndrome.
[0126]     In one embodiment, a mammal may be undergoing a treatment associated with
oxidative damage. For example, the mammal may be undergoing reperfusion. Reperfusion
refers to the restoration of blood flow to any organ or tissue in which the flow of blood is
decreased or blocked. The restoration of blood flow during reperfusion leads to respiratory
burst and formation of free radicals.
[0127]     In one embodiment, the mammal may have decreased or blocked blood flow due
to hypoxia or ischemia. The loss or severe reduction in blood supply during hypoxia or
ischemia may, for example, be due to thromboembolic stroke, coronary atherosclerosis, or
peripheral vascular disease. Numerous organs and tissues are subject to ischemia or
hypoxia. Examples of such organs include brain, heart, kidney, intestine and prostate. The
tissue affected is typically muscle, such as cardiac, skeletal, or smooth muscle. For instance,

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
cardiac muscle ischemia or hypoxia is commonly caused by atherosclerotic or thrombotic
blockages which lead to the reduction or loss of oxygen delivery to the cardiac tissues by
the cardiac arterial and capillary blood supply. Such cardiac ischemia or hypoxia may cause
pain and necrosis of the affected cardiac muscle, and ultimately may lead to cardiac failure.
[0128]    The methods can also be used in reducing oxidative damage associated with any
neurodegenerative disease or condition. The neurodegenerative disease can affect any cell,
tissue or organ of the central and peripheral nervous system. Examples of such cells, tissues
and organs include, the brain, spinal cord, neurons, ganglia, Schwann cells, astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes and microglia. The neurodegenerative condition can be an acute
condition, such as a stroke or a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. In another
embodiment, the neurodegenerative disease or condition can be a chronic neurodegenerative
condition. In a chronic neurodegenerative condition, the free radicals can, for example,
cause damage to a protein. An example of such a protein is amyloid P-protein. Examples of
chronic neurodegenerative diseases associated with damage by free radicals include
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (also known as Lou Gherig's disease).
[0129]    Other conditions which can be treated include preeclampsia, diabetes, and
symptoms of and conditions associated with aging, such as macular degeneration, wrinkles.
[0130]    MitochondrialPermeability Transitioning. The peptides described above are
useful in treating any disease or condition that is associated with mitochondria permeability
transitioning (MPT). Such diseases and conditions include, but are not limited to, ischemia
and/or reperfusion of a tissue or organ, hypoxia and any of a number of neurodegenerative
diseases. Mammals in need of inhibiting or preventing of MPT are those mammals suffering
from these diseases or conditions.
[0131]    Apoptosis. The peptides described above are useful in treating diseases or
conditions that are associated with apoptosis. Exemplary diseases or conditions include, but
are not limited to, cancers such as colorectal, glioma, hepatic, neuroblastoma, leukaemias
and lymphomata, and prostate; autoimmune diseases such as myastenia gravis, systemic
lupus erythematosus, inflammatory diseases, bronchial asthma, inflammatory intestinal
disease, pulmonary inflammation; viral infections such as adenovirus and baculovirus and
HIV-AIDS; neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral
                                                Ao

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, retinitis pigmentosa and epilepsy; haematologic diseases such
as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, T CD4+ lymphocytopenia, and G6PD
deficiency; tissue damage such as caused by myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular
accident, ischaemic renal damage and polycystic kidney. Thus, in some embodiments,
aromatic-cationic peptides as dislosed herein (such as D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2, Phe-D
Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 , Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 , where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,3
diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2, where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'
naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 , where Ald is 0-(6'-dimethylamino-2'
naphthoyl)alanine and D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 , Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where
(dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,j-diaminopropionic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof, such as acetate or trifluoroacetate salt) are administered to a subject (e.g., a
mammal such as a human) in need thereof. As noted above, it is thought that the peptides
contact (e.g., target) cytochrome c, cardiolipin or both, hinder the cardiolipin - cytochrome c
interaction, inhibit cardiolipin-hydroperoxide formation, inhibit the translocation of
cardiolipin to the outer membrane, and/or inhibit the oxygenase/peroxidase activity. Thus,
in some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce the interaction
between cardiolipin and cytochrome c. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce the formation of cytochrome c/cardiolipin
complexes. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the administered peptides
inhibit, delay or reduce the oxygenase/peroxidase activity of the cytochrome c/cardiolipin
complexes. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the administered peptides
inhibit, delay or reduce apoptosis.
[0132     Determination of the BiologicalEffect of the Aromatic-CationicPeptide-Based
Therapeutic. In various embodiments, suitable in vitro or in vivo assays are performed to
determine the effect of a specific aromatic-cationic peptide-based therapeutic and whether
its administration is indicated for treatment. In various embodiments, in vitro assays can be
performed with representative animal models, to determine if a given aromatic-cationic
peptide-based therapeutic exerts the desired effect in preventing or treating disease.
Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems including, but
not limited to rats, mice, chicken, pigs, cows, monkeys, rabbits, and the like, prior to testing
in human subjects. Similarly, for in vivo testing, any of the animal model systems known in
the art can be used prior to administration to human subjects.

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
[0133]    ProphylacticMethods. In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
preventing, in a subject, disease by administering to the subject an aromatic-cationic peptide
that prevents the initiation or progression of the condition. In prophylactic applications,
pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments of aromatic-cationic peptides are
administered to a subject susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of a disease or condition in an
amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of
the disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its
complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of
the disease. Administration of a prophylactic aromatic-cationic can occur prior to the
manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the aberrancy, such that a disease or disorder is
prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression. The appropriate compound can be
determined based on screening assays described above.
[0134]    Therapeutic Methods. Another aspect of the technology includes methods of
treating disease in a subject for therapeutic purposes. In therapeutic applications,
compositions or medicaments are administered to a subject suspected of, or already
suffering from such a disease in an amount sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the
symptoms of the disease, including its complications and intermediate pathological
phenotypes in development of the disease.
Modes of Administration and Effective Dosages
[0135]    Any method known to those in the art for contacting a cell, organ or tissue with a
peptide may be employed. Suitable methods include in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo methods.
In vivo methods typically include the administration of an aromatic-cationic peptide, such as
those described above, to a mammal, suitably a human. When used in vivo for therapy, the
aromatic-cationic peptides are administered to the subject in effective amounts (i.e.,
amounts that have desired therapeutic effect). The dose and dosage regimen will depend
upon the degree of the injury in the subject, the characteristics of the particular aromatic
cationic peptide used, e.g., its therapeutic index, the subject, and the subject's history.
[0136]    The effective amount may be determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical
trials by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians. An effective amount of a peptide
useful in the methods may be administered to a mammal in need thereof by any of a number

  WO 2013/059071                                                              PCT/US2012/059790
of well-known methods for administering pharmaceutical compounds. The peptide may be
administered systemically or locally.
[0137]     The peptide may be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is
acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (e.g., salts having acceptable
mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts are
not required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate
compounds that are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically
acceptable salts can be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases
and from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a
peptide contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic
moiety such as a carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included
within the term "salt" as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable
inorganic bases include ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium,
manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from
pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary
amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the
like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine,
diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine,
ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine,
hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine,
polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine,
tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable
inorganic acids include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric,
hydrofluoric or hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived
from pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids
(e.g., citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic
monocarboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids),
amino acids (e.g., aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., benzoic, p
chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic
hydroxyl acids (e.g., o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2
carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids
(e.g., fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic,

disulfonic, naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, and the
like. In some embodiments, the salt is an acetate salt. Additionally or alternatively, in other
embodiments, the salt is a trifluoroacetate salt.
[0138]     The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein can be incorporated into
pharmaceutical compositions for administration, singly or in combination, to a subject for
the treatment or prevention of a disorder described herein. Such compositions typically
include the active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the term
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings,
antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like,
compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also
be incorporated into the compositions.
[0139]     Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral
(e.g., intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous), oral, inhalation,
transdermal (topical), intraocular, iontophoretic, and transmucosal administration.
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can
include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline
solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic
solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such
as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of
tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such
as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in
ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. For
convenience of the patient or treating physician, the dosing formulation can be provided in a
kit containing all necessary equipment (e.g., vials of drug, vials of diluent, syringes and
needles) for a treatment course (e.g., 7 days of treatment).
[0140]     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF,
Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, a composition for
parenteral administration must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy
syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and
must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and
fungi.
[0141]    The aromatic-cationic peptide compositions can include a carrier, which can be a
solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example,
glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable
mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a
coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of
dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be
achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,
chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thiomerasol, and the like. Glutathione and other
antioxidants can be included to prevent oxidation. In many cases, it will be preferable to
include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or
sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions
can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for
example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.
[0142]    Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound
in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the
case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, typical methods of
preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying, which can yield a powder of the
active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered
solution thereof.
[0143]    Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the
purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with
excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral
compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash.

Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as
part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of
the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as
microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose,
a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as
magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening
agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl
salicylate, or orange flavoring.
[0144]    For administration by inhalation, the compounds can be delivered in the form of an
aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,
e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Such methods include those described in
U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,798.
[0145]     Systemic administration of a therapeutic compound as described herein can also be
by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration,
penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such
penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal
administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal
administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays. For transdermal
administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams
as generally known in the art. In one embodiment, transdermal administration may be
performed my iontophoresis.
[0146]    A therapeutic protein or peptide can be formulated in a carrier system. The carrier
can be a colloidal system. The colloidal system can be a liposome, a phospholipid bilayer
vehicle. In one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide is encapsulated in a liposome while
maintaining peptide integrity. As one skilled in the art would appreciate, there are a variety
of methods to prepare liposomes. (See Lichtenberg et al., Methods Biochem. Anal., 33:337
462 (1988); Anselem et al., Liposome Technology, CRC Press (1993)). Liposomal
formulations can delay clearance and increase cellular uptake (See Reddy, Ann.
Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). An active agent can also be loaded into a particle
prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients including, but not limited to,
soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable, biodegradable or gastroretentive polymers or
liposomes. Such particles include, but are not limited to, nanoparticles, biodegradable

nanoparticles, microparticles, biodegradable microparticles, nanospheres, biodegradable
nanospheres, microspheres, biodegradable microspheres, capsules, emulsions, liposomes,
micelles and viral vector systems.
[0147]    The carrier can also be a polymer, e.g., a biodegradable, biocompatible polymer
matrix. In one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide can be embedded in the polymer matrix,
while maintaining protein integrity. The polymer may be natural, such as polypeptides,
proteins or polysaccharides, or synthetic, such as poly a-hydroxy acids. Examples include
carriers made of, e.g., collagen, fibronectin, elastin, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate,
polysaccharide, fibrin, gelatin, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymer
is poly-lactic acid (PLA) or copoly lactic/glycolic acid (PGLA). The polymeric matrices can
be prepared and isolated in a variety of forms and sizes, including microspheres and
nanospheres. Polymer formulations can lead to prolonged duration of therapeutic effect.
(See Reddy, Ann. Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). A polymer formulation for
human growth hormone (hGH) has been used in clinical trials. (See Kozarich and Rich,
Chemical Biology, 2:548-552 (1998)).
[0148]    Examples of polymer microsphere sustained release formulations are described in
PCT publication WO 99/15154 (Tracy et al.), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 (both
to Zale et al.), PCT publication WO 96/40073 (Zale et al.), and PCT publication WO
00/38651 (Shah et al.). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 and PCT publication WO
96/40073 describe a polymeric matrix containing particles of erythropoietin that are
stabilized against aggregation with a salt.
[0149]    In some embodiments, the therapeutic compounds are prepared with carriers that
will protect the therapeutic compounds against rapid elimination from the body, such as a
controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.
Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylacetic acid. Such
formulations can be prepared using known techniques. The materials can also be obtained
commercially, e.g., from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal
suspensions (including liposomes targeted to specific cells with monoclonal antibodies to
cell-specific antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can
be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as
described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
[0150]     The therapeutic compounds can also be formulated to enhance intracellular
delivery. For example, liposomal delivery systems are known in the art, see, e.g., Chonn and
Cullis, "Recent Advances in Liposome Drug Delivery Systems," Current Opinion in
Biotechnology 6:698-708 (1995); Weiner, "Liposomes for Protein Delivery: Selecting
Manufacture and Development Processes," Immunomethods, 4(3):201-9 (1994); and
Gregoriadis, "Engineering Liposomes for Drug Delivery: Progress and Problems," Trends
Biotechnol., 13(12):527-37 (1995). Mizguchi et al., Cancer Lett., 100:63-69 (1996),
describes the use of fusogenic liposomes to deliver a protein to cells both in vivo and in
vitro.
[0151]     Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic agents can be
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,
e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50.
Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that
exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that
targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage
to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.
[0152]     The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies
preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or
no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form
employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods,
the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose
can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that
includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half
maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be
used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be
measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.
[0153]     Typically, an effective amount of the aromatic-cationic peptides, sufficient for
achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, range from about 0.00000 1 mg per kilogram
body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. Suitably, the

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
dosage ranges are from about 0.000 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 100 mg
per kilogram body weight per day. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10
mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days or within the range of 1
 10 mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every three weeks. In one embodiment, a single
dosage of peptide ranges from 0.1-10,000 micrograms per kg body weight. In one
embodiment, aromatic-cationic peptide concentrations in a carrier range from 0.2 to 2000
micrograms per delivered milliliter. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration
once per day or once a week. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at
relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or
terminated, and preferably until the subject shows partial or complete amelioration of
symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.
[0154]     In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of an aromatic-cationic
peptide may be defined as a concentration of peptide at the target tissue of 10-12 to 10-6
molar, e.g., approximately 10-7 molar. This concentration may be delivered by systemic
doses of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg or equivalent dose by body surface area. The schedule of doses
would be optimized to maintain the therapeutic concentration at the target tissue, most
preferably by single daily or weekly administration, but also including continuous
administration (e.g., parenteral infusion or transdermal application).
[0155]     In some embodiments, the dosage of the aromatic-cationic peptide is provided at
about 0.001 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 mg/kg/h. In one
embodiment, the is provided from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.1
to about 0.5 mg/kg/h. In one embodiment, the dose is provided from about 0.5 to about 10
mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.5 to about 2 mg/kg/h.
[0156]    The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage
and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to, the severity of
the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and
other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective
amount of the therapeutic compositions described herein can include a single treatment or a
series of treatments.
[0157]    The mammal treated in accordance present methods can be any mammal,
including, for example, farm animals, such as sheep, pigs, cows, and horses; pet animals,

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits. In a preferred
embodiment, the mammal is a human.
Aromatic-cationic peptides in electron transfer
[0158]    Mitochondrial ATP synthesis is driven by electron flow through the electron
transport chain (ETC) of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Electron flow through
the chain can be described as a series of oxidation-reduction processes. Electrons pass from
electron donors (NADH or QH2), through a series of electron acceptors (Complexes I-IV),
and ultimately to the terminal electron acceptor, molecular oxygen. Cytochrome c (cyt c),
which is loosely associated with the IMM, transfers electrons between Complexes III and
IV.
[0159]    Rapid shunting of electrons through the ETC is important for preventing short
circuiting that would lead to electron escape and generation of free radical intermediates.
The rate of electron transfer (ET) between an electron donor and electron acceptor decreases
exponentially with the distance between them, and superexchange ET is limited to 20A.
Long-range ET can be achieved in a multi-step electron hopping process, where the overall
distance between donor and acceptor is split into a series of shorter, and therefore faster, ET
steps. In the ETC, efficient ET over long distances is assisted by cofactors that are
strategically localized along the IMM, including FMN, FeS clusters, and hemes. Aromatic
amino acids such as Phe, Tyr and Trp can also facilitate electron transfer to heme through
overlapping r clouds, and this was specifically shown (see experimental examples) for cyt
c. Amino acids with suitable oxidation potential (Tyr, Trp, Cys, Met) can act as stepping
stones by serving as intermediate electron carriers. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Tyr
can lose a proton when it conveys an electron, and the presence of a basic group nearby,
such as Lys, can result in proton-coupled ET which is even more efficient.
[0160]     Overexpression of catalase targeted to mitochondria (mCAT) has been shown to
improve aging (e.g., reduce the symptoms) and prolong lifespan in mice. These examples
identify "druggable" chemical compounds that can reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress
and protect mitochondrial function. As mitochondria are the major source of intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS), the antioxidant must be delivered to mitochondria in order
to limit oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, proteins of the electron transport chain
(ETC), and the mitochondrial lipid membranes. We discovered a family of synthetic

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
aromatic-cationic tetrapeptides that selectively target and concentrate in the inner
mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Some of these peptides contain redox-active amino acids
that can undergo one-electron oxidation and behave as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants.
The peptides disclosed herein, such as the peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2
reduces mitochondrial ROS and protect mitochondrial function in cellular and animal
studies. Recent studies show that this peptide can confer protection against mitochondrial
oxidative stress comparable to that observed with mitochondrial catalase overexpression.
Although radical scavenging is the most commonly used approach to reduce oxidative
stress, there are other potential mechanisms that can be used, including facilitation of
electron transfer to reduce electron leak and improved mitochondrial reduction potential.
[0161]    Abundant circumstantial evidence indicates that oxidative stress contributes to
many consequences of normal aging and several major diseases, including cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Oxidative stress is generally
defined as an imbalance of prooxidants and antioxidants. However, despite a wealth of
scientific evidence to support increased oxidative tissue damage, large-scale clinical studies
with antioxidants have not demonstrated significant health benefits in these diseases. One of
the reasons may be due to the inability of the available antioxidants to reach the site of
prooxidant production.
[0162]    The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is the primary intracellular
producer of ROS, and mitochondria themselves are most vulnerable to oxidative stress.
Protecting mitochondrial function would therefore be a prerequisite to preventing cell death
caused by mitochondrial oxidative stress. The benefits of overexpressing catalase targeted
to mitochondria (mCAT), but not peroxisomes (pCAT), provided proof-of-concept that
mitochondria-targeted antioxidants would be necessary to overcome the detrimental effects
of aging. However, adequate delivery of chemical antioxidants to the IMM remains a
challenge.
[0163]     One peptide analog, D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 , possesses intrinsic
antioxidant ability because the modified tyrosine residue is redox-active and can undergo
one-electron oxidation. We have shown that this peptide can neutralize H2 0 2 , hydroxyl
radical, and peroxynitrite, and inhibit lipid peroxidation. The peptide has demonstrated
remarkable efficacy in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative
diseases, and metabolic syndrome.

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
[0164]    The design of the mitochondria-targeted peptides incorporates and enhances one or
more of the following modes of action: (i) scavenging excess ROS, (ii) reducing ROS
production by facilitating electron transfer, or (iii) increasing mitochondrial reductive
capacity. The advantage of peptide molecules is that it is possible to incorporate natural or
unnatural amino acids that can serve as redox centers, facilitate electron transfer, or increase
sulfydryl groups while retaining the aromatic-cationic motif required for mitochondria
targeting.
Aromatic-cationic peptides for electronic and optical sensing
[0165]    As illustrated by the examples, changing the concentration of aromatic-cationic
peptides disclosed herein, including peptides that comprise the amino acid sequence Tyr-D
Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1), in a sample alters the electrical and
photoluminescent properties of cyt c. Specifically, increasing the aromatic-cationic peptide
concentration relative to cyt c causes the conductivity and photoluminescent efficiency of
cyt c to increase. Suitable ranges of aromatic-cationic peptide concentration include, but are
not limited to, 0-500 mM; 0-100 mM; 0-500 gm; 0-250 gm; and 0-100 gm. In some
embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS
 19), where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys
NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe
Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr
Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH           2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl
L-a, -diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0166]    These changes in conductivity and photoluminescent efficiency can be exploited
for conducting, sensing, switching, and/or enhancing the emission of light from cyt c as
described below. For example, cyt c, lipids, aromatic-cationic peptides, and/or peptide- or
lipid-doped cyt c can be used to make and/or enhance sensors; pressure/temperature/pH-to
current transducers; field-effect transistors, including light-emitting transistors; light
emitting devices, such as diodes and displays; batteries; and solar cells. The aromatic
cationic peptide concentration level (e.g, in cyt c) can also be spatially varied to create
regions with different band gaps; these variations in band gap can be used to make
heterojunctions, quantum wells, graded band gap regions, etc., that can be incorporated into
                                                 Al1

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
the aforementioned sensors, transistors, diodes, and solar cells to enhance their
performance.
Cyt C Sensors Doped with Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Both
[0167]     FIG. 8 shows an example sensor 100 that detects changes in pH and/or temperature
of a test substrate 130 by measuring the change in conductivity (resistance) of a layer 110 of
cyt c doped with any of the peptides disclosed herein, for example Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2
(SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D
Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) alone or with caridolipin. In some embodiments, the cyt c
layer is doped with cardiolipin. As the temperature and/or pH of the substrate 130 changes,
the aromatic-cationic peptide, cardiolipin, or peptide and cardiolipin diffuses into or out of
the doped cyt c layer 110, which in turn causes the conductivity of the doped cyt c layer 110
to change. A meter 120 measures the variation in conductivity by applying an electrical
potential (voltage) to the cyt c layer 110 via an anode 122 and a cathode 124. When the
conductivity goes up, the current flowing between the anode 122 and the cathode 124
increases. When the conductivity goes down, the current flowing between the anode 122
and the cathode 124 decreases. Alternative sensors may include additional electrical
terminals (i.e., anodes and cathodes) for more sensitive resistance measurements. For
example, alternative sensors may include four electrical terminals for Kelvin sensing
measurements of resistance. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,P
diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is
j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt
D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is j-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS
 17).
[0168]     FIG. 9 shows an alternative sensor 101 that detects changes in pH and/or
temperature of the test substrate 130 by measuring the change in photoluminescence of the
peptide-doped or peptide/cardiolipin-doped or cardiolipin-doped cyt c layer 110. A light
source 140, such as a laser or light-emitting diode (LED), illuminates the doped cyt c layer
 110 at an excitation wavelength, such as 532.8 nm. As shown in FIG. 3A, illumination of
the doped cyt c layer 110 at the excitation wavelength excites an electron from a valence
band to an excited state. (As understood by those skilled in the art, the gap between the
                                                A 1)

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
valence band and the excited state is proportional to the excitation wavelength.) After a
short relaxation time, the electron decays from the excited state to a conduction band. When
the electron relaxes to valence band from the conduction band , the doped cyt c layer 110
emits a photon at a luminescence wavelength, such as 650 nm, fixed by the gap between the
valence and conduction bands.
[0169]    As shown in FIG. 3B, the intensity of light emitted by cyt c for a constant
excitation intensity (from the source 140) varies nonlinearly with the aromatic-cationic
peptide concentration: increasing the aromatic-cationic peptide concentration from 0 gM to
50 gM increases the emitted intensity at the luminescence wavelength from about 4200 CPS
to about 4900 CPS, whereas doubling the aromatic-cationic peptide concentration from 50
gM to 100 gM increases the emitted intensity at the luminescence wavelength from about
4900 CPS to about 7000 CPS. Thus, as the aromatic-cationic peptide or aromatic-cationic
peptide/cardiolipin or cardiolipin concentration in the doped cyt c layer 110 varies due to
changes in the pH and/or temperature of the test substrate 130, the intensity at the
luminescence wavelength varies as well. Detecting this change in intensity with a
photodetector 150 yields an indication of the pH and/or temperature of the test substrate
 130.
[0170]    In some cases, changes in peptide, cardiolipin, or cardiolipin and
pepetideconcentration may cause changes in the wavelength of the luminescent emission
instead of or in addition to changes in the intensity of the luminescent emission. These
changes in emission wavelength can be detected by filtering emitted light with a filter 152
disposed between the doped layer 110 and the detector 150. The filter 152 transmits light
within a passband and reflects and/or absorbs light outside the passband. If the emission
wavelength falls outside the passband due to pH- and/or temperature-induced changes in
peptide, cardiolipin or peptide and cardiolipin concentration, then the detector 150 does not
detect any light, an effect that can be exploited to determine changes in peptide and/or
cardiolipin concentration. Alternatively, peptide-induced and/or cardiolipin-induced
changes in luminescence wavelength can be measured by analyzing the spectrum of the
unfiltered emission, e.g., with an optical spectrum analyzer (not shown) instead of a
photodetector 150.
[0171]    Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that one or more of cardiolipin and
the aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein, such as peptide Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
(SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D
Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1), can also be used to enhance and/or tune the wavelength of
light emitted from optically and/or electrically stimulated cyt c. For example, doping cyt c
at a peptide concentration of 100 gM nearly doubles the intensity of light emitted at 650 nm
as shown by FIG. 3B. Thus, the sensor 101 of FIG. 9 can also be used as an enhanced light
emitting element. Unlike semiconductor LEDs and displays, an enhanced light-emitting
element based on doped cyt c could be made in arbitrary shapes and on flexible substrates.
In addition, the peptide and cardiolipin concentration can be set to provide a desired level
and/or wavelength of illumination. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide
comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH          2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,3
diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is
j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt
D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is j-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS
 17).
[0172]    Sensors made using cyt c, cardiolipin-doped, aromatic-cationic peptide-doped, or
cardiolipin/peptide -doped cyt c can be used to detect changes in pressure, temperature, pH,
applied field, and/or other properties that affect conductivity. For example, sensors 100 and
 101 can be used to detect changes in pressure that affect the concentration of one or more of
cardiolipin and aromatic-cationic peptide in the cyt c; as pressure changes cause aromatic
cationic peptide to diffuse into the cyt c, the conductivity and/or emission intensity
increases, and vice versa. Changes in temperature and pH that affect the peptide and/or
cardiolipin concentration in the cyt c produce similar results. Applied fields, such as
electromagnetic fields, that change the peptide and/or cardiolipin concentration in the cyt c
also cause the measured conductivity, emission intensity, and emission wavelength to
change.
[0173]    Cyt c sensors doped with cardiolipin, cardiolipin and aromatic-cationic peptide or
aromatic-cationic peptides can also be used to sense biological and/or chemical activity as
disclosed herein. For example, exemplary sensors may be used to identify other molecules

properties of the fluids can be precisely and flexibly controlled to realize reconfigurable
optical components which are otherwise difficult or impossible to implement with solid
state technology. In addition, the unique behavior of fluids on micro/nano scale has given
rise to the possibility to manipulate the fluid using light. Applications of optofluidic devices
based on cyt c doped with aromatic-cationic peptide(s), cardiolipin, or peptide(s) and
cardiolipin include, but are not limited to: adaptive optical elements; detection using
microresonators; fluidic waveguides; fluorescent microfluidic light sources; integrating
nanophotonics and microfluidics; micro-spectroscopy; microfluidic quantum dot bar-codes;
microfludics for nonlinear optics applications; optofluidic microscopy; optofluidic quantum
cascade lasers for reconfigurable photonics and on-chip molecular detectors; optical
memories using nanoparticle cocktails; and test tube microcavity lasers for integrated opto
fluidic applications.
[0176]     Sensors comprising cyt c doped with aromatic-cationic peptide(s) and cardiolipin
or aromatic-cationic peptide(s), or cardiolipin can be used in microfluidic processors to
transduce pressure variations due to changes in fluid flow into variations in electrical and/or
optical signals that can be readily detected using conventional electrical detectors and
photodetectors as described above. Cardiolipin/peptide-doped or peptide-doped, or
cardiolipin-doped cyt c transducers can be used to control microfluidic pumps, processors,
and other devices, including tunable microlens arrays. In some embodiments, the aromatic
cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH          2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0

[0177]     Cyt c doped with aromatic-cationic peptide(s) and cardiolipin or aromatic-cationic
peptide(s) or cardiolipin can also be used as, or in an electrical or optical switch, e.g., switch
201 shown in FIG. 10. The switch 201 includes a reservoir 220, which holds cardiolipin, an
aromatic-cationic peptide 200 and cardiolipin, or an aromatic-cationic peptide 200, such as

Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1), in fluid communication with cyt c
or doped cyt c 110 via a conduit 221 and a channel 210. In operation, the conduit 221 is
opened to allow the cardiolipin or peptide 200 or peptide and cardiolipin to flow in direction
212 into the channel 210. The switch 201 is actuated by creating a temperature and/or pH
gradient across the boundary between the channel 210 and the cyt c 130. Depending on the
direction of the gradient, cardiolipin or peptide 200 or peptide and cardiolipin diffuses into
or out of the cyt c 130, which causes the conductivity and photoluminescent qualities to
change as described above. Changes in conductivity due to fluctuations in peptide or
cardiolipin concentration can be used to regulate current flow between an anode 222 and a
cathode 224. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid,
Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH       2 (SS-36), where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'

dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,j-diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0178]     The switch 201 shown in FIG. 10 acts as an organic field-effect transistor (OFET):
it regulates current flow in response to changes in a "field" corresponding to the
temperature and/or pH gradient across the boundary between the channel 210 and the cyt c
 130. Each transistor includes a cyt c channel layer or a cyt c channel layer doped with an
aromatic-cationic peptide and cardiolipin or an aromatic-cationic peptide or cardiolipin, a
gate, a source and a drain. The channel layer is disposed above a lower substrate. The
source and the drain are disposed above the channel layer and respectively contact with the
two opposite sides of the channel layer. The gate is disposed above the channel layer and
positioned between the source and the drain. The above organic electroluminescent device
is electrically connected to the drain for receiving the current outputted from the source via
the channel layer and emitting according to the magnitude of the current.
[0179]     Compared to conventional transistors, transistors of the present invention, such as
peptide/cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin-doped cyt c OFETs may be
simple to manufacture. Conventional inorganic transistors require high temperatures (e.g.,
500-1,000'C), but OFETs can be made between room temperature and 200'C. OFETs can
even be formed even on a plastic substrate, which is vulnerable to heat. OFETs can be used

to realize light, thin, and flexible device elements, allowing them to be used in a variety of
unique devices, such as flexible displays and sensors.
[0180]     OFETs can be used to implement the fundamental logic operations necessary for
digital signal processing. For example, transistors can be used to create (nonlinear) logic
gates, such as NOT and NOR gates, that can be coupled together for processing digital
signals. Peptide/cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin-doped cyt c transistors
can be used in applications including but not limited to emitter followers (e.g., for voltage
regulation), current sources, counters, analog-to-digital conversion, etc., and in both
general-purpose computing and application-specific processing, such as processing for
computer networking, wireless communication (e.g., software-defined radio), etc. See P.
Horowitz and W. Hill's "The Art of Electronics," which is incorporated herein by reference
in its entirety, for more applications of transistors.
[0181]     Transistors can also be used to amplify signals by translating a small change in one
property, e.g., pH, into a large change in another property, e.g., conductivity; as well
understood, amplification can be used for a variety of applications, including wireless
(radio) transmission, sound reproduction, and (analog) signal processing.
Peptide/cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin-doped cyt c transistors can also
be used to make operational amplifiers (op amps), which are used in inverting amplifiers,
non-inverting amplifiers, feedback loops, oscillators, etc. For more on organic transistors,

such as static or dynamic random access memory (RAM), that stores information for use in
digital computing. As well understood, six transistors can coupled together to form a static
RAM (SRAM) cell that stores one bit of information without the need for periodic
refreshing. Transistors based on cyt c and/or cyt c doped with cardiolipin or aromatic
cationic peptides or cardiolipin and peptides can also be used to implement other types of

well understood, RAM can be used to implement digital computing for applications such as
those described above. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH        2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,P

D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is j-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS

[0183]     Cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c transistors
may be formed in programmable or pre-programmed biological arrays much like
conventional transistors are formed in integrated circuits. If the change in conductivity
(resistivity) of cyt c due to peptide or cardiolipin activity is high enough, an example
transistor (switch) can be made of a single cyt c molecule doped with a single peptide
molecule, a single cardiolipin molecule or a single peptide molecule and a single cardiolipin
molecule. Arrays of single-molecule cyt c transistors can be formed to create incredibly
small, densely packed logic circuits.
Cyt C Doped with Inventive Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Both for Light
Emitting Transistors
[0184]     Cyt c and/or cyt c doped with with cardiolipin or an aromatic-cationic peptide as
disclosed herein, such as Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH          2
(SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) or
cardiolipin and peptide(s) can also be used to make organic light-emitting transistors
(OLETs) that could lead to cheaper digital displays and fast-switching light sources on
computer chips. An OLET -based light source switches much faster than a diode, and
because of its planar design it could be more easily integrated onto computer chips,
providing faster data transmission across chips than copper wire. The key to higher
efficiency is a three-layer structure, with thin films stacked on top of one another. Current
flows horizontally through the top and bottom layers-one carrying electrons and the other
holes-while carriers that wander into the central layer recombine and emit photons. As the
location of the joint region in the channel is dependent on the gate and drain voltages, the
emission region can be tuned. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide

comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH         2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,3
diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is 0-(6'

D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS
 17).
[0185]     An example OLET, such as the OLET shown in FIG. 16, may be constructed on a
transparent (e.g., glass) substrates coated with a indium tin oxide layer, which serves as the
transistor's gate, coated with a layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a common
dielectric material. A multi-layer organic structure, which may include a film of an electron
transporting material (e.g., cardiolipin-doped, or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped
cyt c), a film of emissive material, and a hole-transporting material is deposited onto the
PMMA. Finally, metal contacts are deposited on top of the organic structure to provide a
source and a drain. The light in the OLET is emitted as a stripe along the emissive layer,
rather than up through the contacts as in an OLED. The shape of the emissive layer can be
varied to make it easier to couple the emitted light into optical fibers, waveguides, and other
structures.
[0186]     The organic light-emitting transistor (OLET) developed by Hepp et al. in 2003
operates in unipolar p-type mode and produces green electroluminescence close to the gold
drain electrode (electron injection). The emission region of the Hepp device, however, could
not be modulated due to the unipolar operation mode. Balanced ambipolar transport is
highly desirable for improving the quantum efficiency of OLETs, and is important to both
single-component and heterostructure transistors.
[0187]     Ambipolar OLETs may be based on a heterostructure of hole-transport material
and electron-transport material, such as cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or
cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c. The light intensity of an ambipolar OLET can be controlled
by both the drain-source voltage and the gate voltage. The carrier mobility and
electroluminescent properties of OLETs based on the same materials (e.g., cardiolipin
doped or peptide-doped or peptide/cardiolipin-doped cyt c) can be tuned by changing the
ratio of the two components . Higher concentration of hole-transport material may result in
non-light-emitting ambipolar FETs, whereas a higher concentrations of cardiolipin-doped,

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c (or of peptide or cardiolipin
concentrations in cyt c) can result in light-emitting unipolar n-channel FETs.
[0188]     OLETs based on two-component layered structures can be realized by sequentially
depositing hole-transport material and electron-transport material. Morphological analysis
indicates a continuous interface between the two organic films, which is crucial for
controlling the quality of the interface and the resulting optoelectronic properties of the
OLETs. An overlapping p-n heterostructure can be confined inside the transistor channel by
changing the tilt angle of the substrate during the sequential deposition process. The
emission region (i.e., the overlapping region) is kept away from the hole and electron source
electrodes, avoiding exciton and photon quenching at the metal electrodes. OLETs can also
be realized in alternative heterostructures, including a vertical combination static induction
transistor with an OLED, top-gate-type OLETs similar to a top-gate static induction
transistor or triode, and OLETs having a laterally arranged heterojunction structure and
diode/FET hybrid. Further details of organic light-emitting transistors can be found in U.S.

which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0189]    Alternatively, or in addition, the aromatic-cationic peptide or cardiolipin or
peptide/cardiolipin concentration can be used to regulate the intensity and/or wavelength of
light emitted by the cyt c 110. Suitable ranges of aromatic-cationic peptide concentration
include, but are not limited to, 0-500 mM; 0-100 mM; 0-500 gm; 0-250 gm; and 0-100
gm. Suitable ranges of cardiolipin concentration include, but are not limited to, 0-500 mM;
0-100 mM; 0-500 gm; 0-250 gm; and 0-100 gm. In fact, the nonlinear change in emitted
intensity shown in FIG. 3B indicates that peptide-doped cyt c 110 is well-suited for binary
(digital) switching: when the peptide concentration is below a predetermined threshold, e.g.,
50 gM, the emitted intensity is below a given level, e.g., 5000 CPS. At aromatic-cationic
peptide concentrations above the threshold, e.g., 100 gM, the emitted intensity jumps, e.g.,
to about 7000 CPS. This nonlinear behavior can be exploited to detect or respond to a
corresponding change in pH or temperature of the cyt c 110 and/or any layers or substances
in thermal and/or fluid communication with the cyt c 110. Cardiolipin or a combination of
peptide and cardiolipin is expected to provide comparable behavior.

(SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) or
cardiolipin and peptide(s) can be used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and
electroluminescent displays. OLEDs are useful in a variety of consumer products, such as
watches, telephones, lap-top computers, pagers, cellular phones, digital video cameras,
DVD players, and calculators. Displays containing OLEDs have numerous advantages over
conventional liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). Because OLED-based display do not require
backlights, they can display deep black levels and achieve relatively high contrast ratios,
even at wide viewing angles. They can also be thinner, more efficient, and brighter than
LCDs, which require heavy, power-hungry backlights. As a result of these combined
features, OLED displays are lighter in weight and take up less space than LCD displays. In
some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH            2
(SS-19), where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald

dansyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0191]    OLEDs typically comprise a light-emitting element interposed between two
electrodes - an anode and a cathode - as shown in FIG. 17. The light-emitting element
typically comprises a stack of thin organic layers comprising a hole-transport layer, an
emissive layer, and an electron-transport layer. OLEDs can also contain additional layers,
such as a hole-injection layer and an electron-injection layer. Doping a cyt c emissive layer
with an aromatic-cationic peptide (and possibly other dopants as well, e.g., cardiolipin) can
enhance the electroluminscent efficiency of the OLED and control color output.
Cardiolipin-doped, or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide doped cyt c can also be used as
the electron-transport layer.

polycarbonates; polysulfones; and polyether sulfones. In some embodiments, the aromatic
cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH          2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0

[0193]    Typically, at least one surface of the substrate is coated with a first electrode,
which may be a transparent material, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or any other suitable
material. The first electrode layer can function as an anode or cathode in the OLED. The
anode is typically selected from a high work-function (>4 eV) metal, alloy, or metal oxide
such as indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide,
aluminum-doped zinc oxide, nickel, and gold. The cathode can be a low work-function (<4
eV) metal such as Ca, Mg, and Al; a high work-function (>4 eV) metal, alloy, or metal
oxide, as described above; or an alloy of a low-work function metal and at least one other
metal having a high or low work-function, such as Mg-Al, Ag-Mg, Al-Li, In-Mg, and
Al-Ca. Methods of depositing anode and cathode layers in the fabrication of OLEDs, such
as evaporation, co-evaporation, DC magnetron sputtering ,or RF sputtering, are well known
in the art.

[0194]    The active layers, including the cyt c and/or cyt c layers doped with cardiolipin or
aromatic-cationic peptides or cardiolipin and aromatic-cationic peptides, are coated onto the
transparent electrode to form a light-emitting element. The light-emitting element comprises
a hole-transport layer and an emissiveve/electron-transport layer, wherein the hole-transport
layer and the emissive/electron-transport layer lie directly on one another, and the hole
transport layer comprises a cured polysiloxane, described below. The orientation of the
light-emitting element depends on the relative positions of the anode and cathode in the
OLED. The hole-transport layer is located between the anode and the emissive/electron
transport layer and the emissive/electron-transport layer is located between the hole
transport layer and the cathode. The thickness of the hole-transport layer can be from 2 to
 100 nm, alternatively from 30 to 50 nm. The thickness of the emissive/electron-transport
layer can be from 20 to 100 nm, alternatively from 30 to 70 nm.
[0195]     OLED displays can be driven with either passive-matrix or active-matrix
addressing schemes, both of which are well known. For example, an OLED display panel
may include an active matrix pixel array and several thin film transistors (TFTs), each of
which may be implemented as a cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin-peptide
doped cyt c transistor (as described above). The active matrix pixel array is disposed
between the substrates that contain the active layers. The active matrix pixel array includes
several pixels. Each pixel is defined by a first scan line and its adjacent second scan line as
well as a first data line and its adjacent second data line both of which are disposed on the
lower substrate. TFTs disposed inside the non-display regions of the pixels are electrically
connected to the corresponding scan and data lines. Switching the TFTs in the pixels with
the scan and data lines causes the corresponding pixels to turn on (i.e., to emit light).
[0196]     In addition, the active layer (e.g., the cyt c and/or cardiolipin-doped or peptide
doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c) can be arranged in nearly arbitrary shapes and
sizes, and can be patterned into arbitrary shapes. They may also be further doped to generate
light at specific wavelengths. Further details of organic light-emitting diodes and organic
light-emitting displays can be found in U.S Patent No. 7,358,663; U.S Patent No.

Cyt C Doped with Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Bothfor Heterojunctions

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
[0197]    The concentration level of aromatic-cationic peptide, cardiolipin or peptide and
cardiolipin in the cyt c active layer(s) may also be varied as a function of space and/or time
to provide a heterojunction, which is an interface between two semiconductor materials of
differing energy gap, as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,897,429, which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety, and illustrated in the photovoltaic cells of FIGS. 18 and
 19. Suitable ranges of aromatic-cationic peptide concentration include, but are not limited
to, 0-500 mM; 0-100 mM; 0-500 gM; 0-250 gM; and 0-100 gM. Suitable ranges of
cardiolipin concentration include, but are not limited to, 0-500 mM; 0-100 mM; 0-500 gM;
0-250 gM; and 0-100 gM. For example, heterojunctions can be used to create multiple
quantum well structure for enhanced emission in OLEDs and other devices. Organic
heterojunctions have been drawing increasing attention following the discovery of high
conductivity in organic heterojunction transistors constructed with active layers of p-type
and n-type thin crystalline films. In contrast with the depletion layers that form in inorganic
heterojunctions, electron- and hole-accumulation layers can be observed on both sides of
organic heterojunction interfaces. Heterojunction films with high conductivity can be used
as charge injection buffer layers and as a connecting unit for tandem diodes. Ambipolar
transistors and light-emitting transistors (described above) can be realized using organic
heterojunction films as active layers.
[0198]    Organic heterostructures can be used in OLEDs (discussed above), OFETs
(discussed above), and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells (discussed below) to improve
device performance. In a typical double-layer OLED structure, the organic heterojunction
reduces the onset voltage and improves the illumination efficiency. Organic heterojunctions
can also be used to improve the power conversion efficiency of OPV cells by an order of
magnitude over single-layer cells Ambipolar OFETs (discussed above), which require that
both electrons and holes be accumulated and transported in the device channel depending on
the applied voltage, can be realized by introducing organic heterostructures, including
cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c, as active layers.
Organic heterostructures have an important role in the continued development of organic
electronic devices.
[0199]    Organic heterostructures can also be used as buffer layers in OFETs to improve the
contact between the electrodes and the organic layers. For example, a thin layer of cyt c
and/or cardiolipin or peptide or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c can be inserted between the

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
electrodes and the semiconducting layer, resulting in better carrier injection and improved
mobility. Organic heterojunctions with high conductivity (e.g., due to the use of cyt c doped
with cardiolipin or aromatic-cationic peptide or cardiolipin/peptide) can also be used as a
buffer layer in OFETs to improve the contact between metal and organic semiconductors,
thereby improving the electron field-effect mobility. Other heterostructures based on
cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c can be used to
improve the electrical contact in OFETs, in OPV cells, and as connecting units in stacked
OPV cells and OLEDs.
[0200]    The introduction of organic heterostructures has significantly improved device
performance and allowed new functions in many applications. For example, the observation
of electron- and hole-accumulation layers on both sides of an organic heterojunction
suggests that interactions at the heterojunction interface could lead to carrier redistribution
and band bending. This ambipolar transport behavior of organic heterojunctions presents the
possibility of fabricating OLED FETs with high quantum efficiency. The application of
organic heterostructures, including heterostructures formed of cardiolipin-doped or peptide
doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c, as a buffer layer improve the contact between
organic layers and metal electrodes is also discussed. Charge transport in organic
semiconductors is influenced by many factors -      the present review emphasizes the use of
intentionally doped n- and p-type organic semiconductors, and primarily considers organic
heterojunctions composed of crystalline organic films displaying band transport behavior.
[0201]    In general, OFETs operate in accumulation mode. In hole-accumulation mode
OFETs, for example, when a negative voltage is applied to the gate relative to the source
electrode (which is grounded), the formation of positive charges (holes) is induced in the
organic layer near the insulator layer. When the applied gate voltage exceeds the threshold
voltage (VT), the induced holes form a conducting channel and allow current to flow from
the drain to the source under a potential bias (VDs) applied to the drain electrode relative to
the source electrode. The channel in OFETs contains mobile free holes, and the threshold
voltage is the minimum gate voltage required to induce formation of the conducting
channel. Therefore, OFETs operate in accumulation mode, or as a 'normally-off device.
However, in some case, OFETs can have an open channel under zero gate voltage, meaning
that an opposite gate voltage is required to turn the device off. These devices are therefore
called 'normally-on' or 'depletion-mode' transistors.

  WO 2013/059071                                                             PCT/US2012/059790
[0202]    The charge-carrier type in the conducting channel for the normally-on
CuPc/F1 6 CuPc heterojunction transistor is dependent on the bottom-layer semiconductor
(organic layer near the insulator). Charge accumulation can lead to upward band bending in
the p-type material and downward band bending in n-type material from the bulk to the
interface, which is different to the case for a conventional inorganic p-n junction. As free
electrons and holes can co-exist in organic heterojunction films, it is possible that organic
heterojunction films can transport either electrons or holes, depending on the gate voltage.
In fact, after optimizing the film thickness and device configuration, ambipolar transport
behavior has been observed.
[0203]    Carrier transport in planar heterojunction is parallel to the heterojunction interface,
similar to the case for OFETs and directly reflecting the conductivity of the heterojunction
film. The conductivity of diodes with a double-layer structure can be about one order of
magnitude higher than that of single-layer devices, and may be further enhanced by
changing the concentration of aromatic-cationic peptide in cyt c layers used to form the
heterojunction. Suitable ranges of aromatic-cationic peptide concentration include, but are
not limited to, 0-500 mM; 0-100 mM; 0-500 gm; 0-250 gm; and 0-100 gm. For the
normally-on OFETs, the induced electrons and holes form a conducting channel in the
films, leading to high conductivity. Decreased conductivity due the higher roughness of the
interface can be compensated by changing the peptide doping concentration as described
above.
[0204]    The induced electrons and holes in n- and p-type semiconductors form a space
charge region at the heterojunction interface, which can result in a built-in electric field
from the p- to the n-type semiconductor. Such a build up is revealed in the electronic
properties of diodes with vertical structures. A vertical heterojunction diode produces a
small current under a positive potential bias and a large current under a negative bias. In
contrast with an inorganic p-n diode, an organic heterojunction diode may show a reverse
rectifying characteristic. The positive bias strengthens band bending and restricts carrier
flow, whereas under negative bias, the applied electric field opposes the built-in field,
resulting in a lowering of the potential barrier. Band bending is therefore weakened under
negative bias, and current flow through the junction is assisted.
[0205]    Charge carrier accumulation on both sides of the organic heterojunction interface
creates a built-in field that can be used to shift the threshold voltage of in an OFET. In n-

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
channel organic heterojunction transistors, for example, the threshold voltage is correlated
with the trap density in the n-type layer. The induced electrons can fill the traps; therefore,
under the conditions of constant n-type layer thickness, the threshold voltage decreases with
increasing electron density. Under neutral conditions, the number of induced holes in the p
type layer is equal to that in the n-type layer, and increases with p-type layer thickness
tending toward saturation. Therefore, the threshold voltage of organic heterojunction
transistors can be reduced by increasing the thickness of the p-type layer. The charge
accumulation thickness can be estimated from the point at which the threshold voltage no
longer changes with increasing p-type layer thickness.
[0206]    The difference between the work functions of the two semiconductors constituting
a heterojunction leads to various electron states in the space-charge region. The
semiconductor heterojunction is also classified by the conductivity type of the two
semiconductors forming the heterojunction. If the two semiconductors have the same type
of conductivity, then the junction is called an isotype heterojunction; otherwise it is known
as anisotype heterojunction. Electrons and holes can be simultaneously accumulated and
depleted on both sides of anisotype heterojunctions due to the difference in the Fermi levels
of the two components. If the work function of the p-type semiconductor is greater than that
of the n-type semiconductor (p > p), depletion layers of electrons and holes are present on
either side of the heterojunction, and the space-charge region is composed of immobile
negative and positive ions. This type of heterojunction is known as a depletion
heterojunction, and most inorganic heterojunctions belong to this class of heterojunction,
including the conventional p-n homojunction.
Cyt C Doped with Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Both for Batteries
[0207]    Cyt c and/or cyt c doped with cardiolipin or aromatic-cationic peptide, such as
Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe
Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) or peptide and cardiolipin, can also
be used to reduce the internal resistance of batteries, which makes it possible to maintain the
battery at nearly constant voltage during discharge. As understood in the art, a battery is a
device that converts chemical energy directly to electrical energy. It includes a number of
voltaic cells, each of which in turn includes two half cells connected in series by a
conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and
the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate, i.e., the anode or negative

  WO 2013/059071                                                            PCT/US2012/059790
electrode; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the electrode to which cations
(positively charged ions) migrate, i.e., the cathode or positive electrode. In the redox
reaction that powers the battery, cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode,
while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode. The electrodes do not touch
each other but are electrically connected by the electrolyte. Some cells use two half-cells
with different electrolytes. A separator between half cells allows ions to flow, but prevents
mixing of the electrolytes. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,P
diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is
j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt
D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is j-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS
 17).
[0208]     Each half cell has an electromotive force (or emf), determined by its ability to
drive electric current from the interior to the exterior of the cell. The net emf of the cell is
the difference between the emfs of its half-cells. Therefore, if the electrodes have emfs the
difference between the reduction potentials of the half-reactions. Cardiolipin-doped or
peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c can be used to transmit current from
interior to the exterior of the cell with a variable or preset conductivity to increase (or
decrease) the emf and/or the charging time depending on the application.
[0209]     The electrical driving force across the terminals of a cell is known as the terminal
voltage (difference) and is measured in volts. The terminal voltage of a cell that is neither
charging nor discharging is called the open-circuit voltage and equals the emf of the cell.
Because of internal resistance, the terminal voltage of a cell that is discharging is smaller in
magnitude than the open-circuit voltage and the terminal voltage of a cell that is charging
exceeds the open-circuit voltage. An ideal cell has negligible internal resistance, so it would
maintain a constant terminal voltage of until exhausted, then dropping to zero. In actual
cells, the internal resistance increases under discharge, and the open circuit voltage also
decreases under discharge. If the voltage and resistance are plotted against time, the
resulting graphs typically are a curve; the shape of the curve varies according to the
chemistry and internal arrangement employed. Cyt c and/or cyt c doped with cardiolipin or
aromatic-cationic peptide(s) or cardiolipin and peptide(s) can be used to reduce the internal

Single-Molecule Peptide-orCardiolipin-DopedCyt C Batteries
[0210]     Single molecules of cyt c can also be used as molecular batteries whose charging
and/or discharging time can be regulated by one or more aromatic-cationic peptides, such
as Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg
Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), cardiolipin or cardiolipin and
peptide(s). As described herein, cyt c is a membrane protein with carbon and sulfur on
opposite sides of the membrane from charged oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The regions
coated with charged oxygen and nitrogen, which prefer a watery environment, stick out on
opposite faces of the membrane. This arrangement is perfect for the job performed by cyt c,
which uses the reaction of oxygen to water to power a molecular pump. As oxygen is
consumed, the energy is stored by pumping hydrogen ions from one side of the membrane
to the other. Later, the energy can be used to build ATP or power a motor by letting the
hydrogen ions seep back across the membrane. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic
peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH         2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0
anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is
j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where
Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH         2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,j-diaminopropionic acid
(SS-17).
Cyt C Doped with Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Bothfor Photovoltaic
(Solar) Cells
[0211]     Organic photovoltaics (OPV) offers the promise of significant disruption in pricing
and aesthetics, as well as impressive efficiencies in low light conditions. OPV materials are
also flexible and form-fitting. OPVs can potentially be wrapped around or even painted onto
various materials. Current OPV efficiencies are between 5% and 6.25%. Although these
efficiencies may not be sufficient to replace conventional forms of power generation, OPV
is suitable for applications which do not require significant efficiencies, especially given the
high cost of semiconductor solar cells. For example, OPV cells could be used to power cell

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
phones under low light conditions, like those in an office, home or conference room setting,
on a continuous trickle-charge setting.
[0212]     OPV cells, such as those shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, are also cheaper and easier to
build than inorganic cells because of simpler processing at much lower temperatures (20
200 0C). For example, electro-chemical solar cells using titanium dioxide in conjunction
with an organic dye and a liquid electrolyte already exceeded 6% power conversion
efficiencies and are about to enter the commercial market thanks to their relatively low
production costs. OPVs can also be processed from solution at room-temperature onto
flexible substrates using simple and therefore cheaper deposition methods like spin or blade
coating. Possible applications may range from small disposable solar cells to power smart
plastic (credit, debit, phone or other) cards which can display for example, the remaining
amount, to photo-detectors in large area scanners or medical imaging and solar power
applications on uneven surfaces.
[0213]    An OPV cell (OPVC) is a photovoltaic cell that uses organic electronics, such as
cyt c and/or cyt c doped with cardiolipin or an aromatic-cationic peptide, such as Tyr-D
Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) or cardiolipin and peptide(s), for light
absorption and charge transport. OPVCs convert visible light into direct current (DC)
electricity. Some photovoltaic cells can also convert infrared (IR) or ultraviolet (UV)
radiation into DC. The band gap of the active layer (e.g., cardiolipin-doped or peptide
doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c) determines the absorption band of the OPVC. In
some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH            2
(SS-19), where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald
Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D
Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH          2 where (dns)Dap is
dansyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0214]    When these organic band-gap materials absorb a photon, an excited state is created
and confined to a molecule or a region of the molecule that absorbs the photon. The excited
state can be regarded as an electron hole pair bound together by electrostatic interactions. In
photovoltaic cells, excitons are broken up into free electrons-hole pairs by effective fields.
The effective field are set up by creating a heterojunction between two dissimilar materials.
                                               S21

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
Effective fields break up excitons by causing the electron to fall from the conduction band
of the absorber to the conduction band of the acceptor molecule. It is necessary that the
acceptor material has a conduction band edge that is lower than that of the absorber
material.
[0215]     Single-layer OPVCs can be made by sandwiching a layer of organic electronic
material (e.g., cyt c and/or cyt c doped with cardiolipin or aromatic-cationic peptide(s)) or
cardiolipin and peptide(s) between two metallic conductors, typically a layer of indium tin
oxide (ITO) with high work function and a layer of low work function metal such as Al,
Mg, or Ca. The difference of work function between the two conductors sets up an electric
field in the organic layer. When the organic layer absorbs light, electrons will be excited to
the conduction band and leave holes in the valence band, forming excitons. The potential
created by the different work functions helps to separate the exciton pairs, pulling electrons
to the cathode and holes to the anode. The current and voltage resulting from this process
can be used to do work.
[0216]     In practice, single-layer OPVCs have low quantum efficiencies (<1%) and low
power conversion efficiencies (<0.1 %). A major problem with them is the electric field
resulting from the difference between the two conductive electrodes is seldom sufficient to
break up the photo-generated excitons. Often the electrons recombine with the holes rather
than reach the electrode.
[0217]     Organic heterojunctions can be used to make built-in fields for enhancing OPVC
performance. Heterojunctions are implemented by incorporating two or more different
layers in between the conductive electrodes. These two or more layers of materials have
differences in electron affinity and ionization energy, e.g., due to peptide concentration,
cardiolipin concentration or peptide and cardiolipin concentration, that induce electrostatic
forces at the interface between the two layers. The materials are chosen properly to make
the differences large enough, so these local electric fields are strong, which may break up
the excitons much more efficiently than the single layer photovoltaic cells do. The layer
with higher electron affinity (e.g., higher peptide doping concentration) and ionization
potential is the electron acceptor, and the other layer is the electron donor. This structure is
also called planar donor-acceptor heterojunctions.

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
[0218]     The electron donor and acceptor can be mixed together to form a bulk
heterojunction OPVC. If the length scale of the blended donor and acceptor is similar with
the exciton diffusion length, most of the excitons generated in either material may reach the
interface, where excitons break efficiently. Electrons move to the acceptor domains then
were carried through the device and collected by one electrode, and holes were pulled in the
opposite direction and collected at the other side.
[0219]     Difficulties associated with organic photovoltaic cells include their low quantum
efficiency (~3%) in comparison with inorganic photovoltaic devices; due largely to the
large band gap of organic materials. Instabilities against oxidation and reduction,
recrystallization and temperature variations can also lead to device degradation and
decreased performance over time. This occurs to different extents for devices with different
compositions, and is an area into which active research is taking place. Other important
factors include the exciton diffusion length; charge separation and charge collection; and
charge transport and mobility, which are affected by the presence of impurities. For more
details on organic photovoltaics, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,657,378; U.S. Patent No.
7,601,910; and U.S. Patent No. 7,781,670, each of which is herein incorporated by reference

Thin-Film Applications of Cyt C Doped with Exemplary Aromatic-CationicPeptides or
Cardiolipinor Both
[0220]     As well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art of electronic, any of the
aforementioned devices can be made by depositing, growing, or otherwise providing thin
layers of material to form an appropriate structure. For example, heterojunctions for
transistors, diodes, and photovoltaic cells can be formed by depositing layers of material
with different band gap energies adjacent to each other or in layered fashion. In addition to
forming layered thin-film structures, organic materials with different band gaps can be
mixed to form heterojunctions with varied spatial arrangements, as shown in FIGS. 19(a)
and 19(b), by depositing heterogeneous mixtures of material. Such heterogeneous mixtures
may include, but are not limited to, mixtures of cyt c, aromatic-cationic peptides and cyt c
doped with varying levels of cardiolipin or aromatic-cationic peptides, including, but not
limited to such as Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS
02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1). Illustrative
aromatic-cationic peptide levels may include, but are not limited to, 0-500 mM; 0-100 mM;

0-500 gM; 0-250 gM; and 0-100 gM. These thin films may also be used to enhance
performance of conventional electronic devices, e.g., by increasing conductivity and/or
reducing heat dissipation at electrodes. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide
comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,3
diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is
j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt
D-Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is j-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS
 17).
[0221]    As described above, dispersed hetero-junction of donor-acceptor organic materials
have high quantum efficiency compared to the planar hetero-junction, because it is more
likely for an exciton to find an interface within its diffusion length. Film morphology can
also have a drastic effect on the quantum efficiency of the device. Rough surfaces and
presence of voids can increase the series resistance and also the chance of short circuiting.
Film morphology and quantum efficiency can be improved by annealing of a device after
covering it by with a metal cathode having a thickness of about 1000 A. Metal film on top
of the organic film applies stresses on the organic film, which helps to prevent the
morphological relaxation in the organic film. This gives more densely packed films while at
the same time allows the formation of phase-separated interpenetrating donor-acceptor
interface inside the bulk of organic thin film.
[0222]    Controlled growth of the heterojunction provides better control over positions of
the donor-acceptor materials, resulting in much greater power efficiency (ratio of output
power to input power) than that of planar and highly disoriented hetero-junctions. This is
because charge separation occurs at the donor acceptor interface: as the charge travels to the
electrode, it can become trapped and/or recombine in a disordered interpenetrating organic
material, resulting in decreased device efficiency. Choosing suitable processing parameters
to better control the structure and film morphology mitigates undesired premature trapping
and/or recombination.
Depositing Cyt C Doped with Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Both
[0223]    Organic films including cyt c, an aromatic-cationic peptide, or cyt c doped with
cardiolipin or aromatic-cationic peptide, such as Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-

Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) or cardiolipin and peptide(s), for photovoltaic and other applications may
be deposited by spin coating, vapor-phase deposition, and method described in U.S. Patent
No. 6,734,038; U.S. Patent No. 7,662,427; and U.S. Patent No. 7,799,377, each of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Spin-coating techniques can be used to coat
larger surface areas with high speed but the use of solvent for one layer can degrade the any
already existing polymer layers. Spin-coated materials must be patterned in a separate
patterning step. In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D
Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is -anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic
acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'
naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,j-diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0224]    Vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE), as shown in FIG. 20(a), is a deposition
technique that involves heating the organic material in vacuum. The substrate is placed
several centimeters away from the source so that evaporated material may be directly
deposited onto the substrate. VTE is useful for depositing many layers of different materials
without chemical interaction between different layers.
[0225]    Organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD), as shown in FIG. 20(b), gives better
control on the structure and morphology of the film than vacuum thermal evaporation.
OPVD involves evaporation of the organic material over a substrate in the presence of an
inert carrier gas. The morphology of the resulting film can be changed by changing the gas
flow rate and the source temperature. A uniform film can be grown by reducing the carrier
gas pressure, which increases the velocity and mean free path of the gas, which results in a
decrease of the boundary layer thickness. Cells produced by OVPD do not have issues
related with contaminations from the flakes coming out of the walls of the chamber, as the
walls are warm and do not allow molecules to stick to and produce a film upon them.
Depending on the growth parameters (e.g., temperature of the source, base pressure and flux
of the carrier gas, etc.) the deposited film can be crystalline or amorphous in nature. Devices
fabricated using OVPD show a higher short-circuit current density than that of devices
made using VTE. An extra layer of donor-acceptor hetero-junction at the top of the cell may
block excitons, while allowing conduction of electron, resulting in improved cell efficiency.

Cyt C Doped with Exemplary Aromatic-CationicPeptides or Cardiolipinor Both for
IncreasingEfficiency
[0226]    As described above, cardiolipin, or the exemplary aromatic-cationic peptides, such
as Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-01), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg
Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) or D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1), can be used alone or in
conjunction with cardiolipin to increase conductivity. As a result, exemplary aromatic
cationic peptides and cardiolipin can be used to conduct electric current with lower loss
through the production of (waste) heat energy. This effect can be exploited to extend the
operating life of battery-powered devices, such as consumer electronics, and in large power
systems, such as in power transmission applications. The reduction of waste heat production
also lowers cooling requirements, further increasing efficiency, and extends the lifetime of
electronic devices powered by conductive materials, such as cyt c, doped with cardiolipin or
aromatic-cationic peptides or cardiolipin and peptide(s) of the invention. In some
embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS
 19), where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys

L-a, -diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
Aromatic-cationic peptides for cyt c biosensor applications
[0227]    The aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein may be used to enhance electron
flow in cyt c biosensors and to increase their levels of sensitivity. As illustrated by the
examples, the peptides disclosed herein, such as the peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 ,
promote the reduction of cyt c (FIG. 1) and increase electron flow through cyt c (FIG. 2).
[0228]    Cyt c is a promising biosensor candidate from an electrochemical viewpoint.
However, electron transfer between heme and a bare electrode is usually slow.
Alternatively, small mediators may be used to facilitate electron transfer between the redox
active center and the electrode indirectly. Additionally or alternatively, direct electron
transfer methods may be used whereby redox-active enzyme are immobilized directly onto
the electrode surface. For example, cyt c, which is positively charged at pH 7 and contains a
large number of Lys residues surrounding the heme edge, adsorbs on negatively charged
surfaces created, for example, by self-assembling carboxy terminated alkanethiols. In some

includes one or more of the aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein. In some
embodiments, cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c serves
as a mediator between a redox-active enzyme and an electrode within the biosensor. In
some embodiments, cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c
is immobilized directly on the electrode of the biosensor. In some embodiments, one or
more of the peptide and cardiolipin is linked to cyt c within the biosensor. In other
embodiments, the one or more of the peptide and cardiolipin is not linked to cyt c. In some
embodiments, one or more of the peptide, cardiolipin and/or cyt c are immobilized on a
surface within the biosensor. In other embodiments, the one or more of the peptide,
cardiolipin and/or cyt c are freely diffusible within the biosensor. In some embodiments, the
biosensor includes the peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 and/or Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2.
In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap
NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is -anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid, Dmt-D-Arg
Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, Dmt-D

peptides and cyt c serve as mediators of electron flow from a redox-active enzyme to an
electrode. In some embodiments, the biosensor include cardiolipin. In serial redox
reactions, electrons are transferred from a substrate 300 to a redox-active enzyme 310, from
the enzyme 310 to cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or peptide/cardiolipin-doped cyt c
320, and from cardiolipin-doped or peptide-doped or peptide/cardiolipin-doped cyt c 320 to
an electrode 330.

Aromatic-cationic Peptides in Bioremediation of Environmental Contaminants
[0232]    The aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein are useful for the bioremediation
of environmental contaminants. In particular, the peptides are useful for increasing the rate
and/or efficiency of bioremediation reactions in which bacterial c cytochromes mediate the
transfer of electrons to an environmental contaminant, thereby altering the valence of the
substance and reducing its relative toxicity. In the methods disclosed herein, aromatic
cationic peptides interact with bacterial c cytochromes and facilitate electron transport. In
one aspect, the aromatic-cationic peptides facilitate reduction of bacterial c cytochromes. In
another aspect, the peptides enhance electron diffusion through bacterial c cytochromes. In
another aspect, the peptides enhance electron capacity in bacterial c cytochromes. In another
aspect, the peptides induce novel 7t-7t interactions around the heme groups of bacterial
cytochromes that favor electron diffusion. Ultimately, interaction of the aromatic-cationic
peptides with bacterial c cytochromes promotes and/or enhances the dissimilatory reduction
of the environmental contaminant.

bioremediation of environmental contaminants. In general, the methods comprise contacting

Aromatic-cationic Peptides, cardiolipin and cytochrome c in nanowire applications
[0255]    The aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein, cytochrome c, and/or cardiolipin
doped or peptidedoped or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c are useful in nonowire
applications. Typically, a nanowire is a nanostructure, with the diameter of the order of a
nanometer (10-9 meters). Alternatively, nanowires can be defined as structures that have a
thickness or diameter constrained to tens of nanometers or less and an unconstrained length.
At these scales, quantum mechanical effects come into play. Many different types of
nanowires exist, including metallic (e.g., Ni, Pt, Au), semiconducting (e.g., Si, InP, GaN,
etc.), and insulating (e.g., SiO2, TiO2). Molecular nanowires are composed of repeating
molecular units either organic (e.g. DNA, aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein,
cytochrome c, and/or cardiolipin or peptide or peptide/cardiolipin-doped cyt c, etc.) or
inorganic (e.g. Mo6S9-xlx). The nanowires disclosed herein are useful, for example, to link
components into extremely small circuits. Using nanotechnology, the components are
created out of chemical compounds.
Nanowire synthesis
[0256]    There are two basic approaches of synthesizing nanowires: top-down and bottom
up approach. In a top-down approach a large piece of material is cut down to small pieces
through different means such as lithography and electrophoresis. Whereas in a bottom-up
approach the nanowire is synthesized by the combination of constituent ad-atoms. Most of
the synthesis techniques are based on bottom-up approach.
[0257]    Nanowire structures are grown through several common laboratory techniques
including suspension, deposition (electrochemical or otherwise), and VLS growth.
[0258]    A suspended nanowire is a wire produced in a high-vacuum chamber held at the
longitudinal extremities. Suspended nanowires can be produced by: the chemical etching, or
bombardment (typically with highly energetic ions) of a larger wire; indenting the tip of a
STM in the surface of a metal near its melting point, and then retracting it.
[0259]    Another common technique for creating a nanowire is the Vapor-Liquid-Solid
(VLS) synthesis method. This technique uses as source material either laser ablated
                                               aor

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
particles or a feed gas (such as silane). The source is then exposed to a catalyst. For
nanowires, the best catalysts are liquid metal (such as gold) nanoclusters, which can either
be purchased in colloidal form and deposited on a substrate or self-assembled from a thin
film by dewetting. This process can often produce crystalline nanowires in the case of
semiconductor materials. The source enters these nanoclusters and begins to saturate it.
Once supersaturation is reached, the source solidifies and grows outward from the
nanocluster. The final product's length can be adjusted by simply turning off the source.
Compound nanowires with super-lattices of alternating materials can be created by
switching sources while still in the growth phase. In some embodoments, source material
such as aromatic-cationic peptides, cyt c and/or cardiolipin- or peptide- or
cardiolipin/peptide- doped cyt c may be used. Inorganic nanowires such as Mo6S9-xlx
(which are alternatively viewed as cluster polymers) are synthesised in a single-step vapour
phase reaction at elevated temperature.
[0260]    In addition, nanowires of many types of materials, such as aromatic-cationic
peptides, cytochrome c and/or cardiolipin- or peptide- or cardiolipin/peptide-doped cyt c,
can be grown in solution. Solution-phase synthesis has the advantage that it can be scaled
up to produce very large quantities of nanowires as compared to methods that produce
nanowires on a surface. The polyol synthesis, in which ethylene glycol is both solvent and
reducing agent, has proven particularly versatile at producing nanowires of Pb, Pt, and
silver.
General Methods
[0261]    Cytochrome c reduction: increasing amounts of aromatic-cationic peptides were
added to a solution of oxidized cyt c. The formation of reduced cyt c was monitored by
absorbance at 500 nm. The rate of cyt c reduction was determined by non-linear analysis
(Prizm software).
[0262]    Time-resolved UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy was used to study the electron
transport process of cyt c in the presence of peptides. Reduced cyt c was monitored by
absorbance at a broad-band spectral range (200- 1100 nm). The absorption changes were
recorded with a UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3300 pro, GE) in quartz cells
with path lengths of 1 or 2 mm. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione were used as
electron donors to reduce oxidized cyt c. The rate constant of cyt c reduction was estimated
                                               oA

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
by adding various concentrations of peptides. The dose dependence of the peptides was
correlated to the cyt c reduction kinetics.
[0263]    Mitochondrial02 consumption and A TPproduction: Fresh mitochondria were
isolated from rat kidney as described previously. Electron flux was measured by 02
consumption (Oxygraph Clark electrode) as previously described using different substrates
for C1 (glutamate/malate), C2 (succinate), and C3 (TMPD/ascorbate). Assays were carried
out under low substrate conditions in order to avoid saturating the enzyme reactions. ATP
production in isolated mitochondria was determined kinetically using the luciferase method
(Biotherma) in a 96-well luminescence plate reader (Molecular Devices). The initial
maximal rate for ATP synthesis was determined over the first minute.
[0264]    Cyclic voltammetry: Cyclic voltammetry was performed using the Bioanalytical
System CV-50W Voltammetric Analyzer using an Ag/AgCl/1 M KCl reference electrode
with a potential of +0.237 V versus NHE (Biometra, G6ttingen, Germany), and a platinum
counter electrode. Gold wire electrodes were cleaned following an established protocols.
Electrochemical studies of cyt c in solution were performed using mercaptopropanol
modified electrodes (incubation 24 h in 20 mM mercaptopropanol). Cyclic voltammograms
with 20 gM cyt c in 1 M KCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 /7.8 were
recorded. The formal potential was calculated as the midpoint between the anodic and
cathodic peak potentials at different scan rates (100-400 mV/s) and diffusion coefficients
from the peak currents at different scan rates according the Randles-Sevcik equation.
                                          EXAMPLES
[0265]    The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which
should not be construed as limiting in any way.
Example 1. Synthesis of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides.
[0266]    Solid-phase peptide synthesis is used and all amino acids derivatives are
commercially available. After completion of peptide assembly, peptides are cleaved from
the resin in the usual manner. Crude peptides are purified by preparative reversed-phase
chromatography. The structural identity of the peptides is confirmed by FAB mass
spectrometry and their purity is assessed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC and by thin
                                                07

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
layer chromatography in three different systems. Purity of >98% will be achieved.
Typically, a synthetic run using 5 g of resin yields about 2.0-2.3 g of pure peptides.
Example 2. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) facilitates cytochrome c
reduction.
[0267]    Absorption spectroscopy (UltroSpec 3300 Pro; 220-1100 nm) was used to
determine if SS-31 modulates cyt c reduction (FIG. 1). Reduction of cyt c with glutathione
is associated with multiple shifts in the Q band (450-650  nm), with a prominent shift at 550
nm. Addition of SS-31 produced significant spectral weight shift at 550 nm (FIG. 1A).
Time-dependent spectroscopy show that SS-31 increased the rate of cyt c reduction (FIG.
 1B). These data suggest that SS-31 altered the electronic structure of cyt c and enhanced the
reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ heme.
Example 3. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances electron diffusion
through cytochrome c.
[0268]    Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to determine if SS-31 altered electron
flow and/or reduction/oxidation potentials of cyt c (FIG. 2, upper panel). CV was done
using an Au working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and Pt auxiliary electrode.
SS-31 increased current for both reduction and oxidation processes of cyt c (FIG. 2, upper
panel). SS-31 does not alter reduction/oxidation potentials (FIG. 2, upper panel), but rather
increases electron flow through cyt c, suggesting that SS-31 decreases resistance between
complexes III to IV. For FIG 2 (lower panel) all voltammetric measurements were
performed using the BASi-50W Voltammetric Analyzer coupled to a BASi C3 Cell Stand.
An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as reference and glassy carbon and platinum electrodes
were use for standard measurements. Prior to each measurement solutions were fully de
gassed with nitrogen to avoid electrode fouling. Cyclic voltammograms were taken for Tris
borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, buffer plus cyt c, and buffer plus cyt c plus two different SS31
doses as shown in FIG 2 (lower panel). The current (electron diffusion rate) increases
almost 200%, as the SS31 dose is doubled with respect to cyt c (cyt c:SS3 1=1:2). The result
indicates that SS31 promotes the electron diffusion in cyt c, making the peptide useful for
designing more sensitive bio-detectors.
Example 4. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances electron capacity in
cytochrome c.
                                               oQ

  WO 2013/059071                                                          PCT/US2012/059790
[0269]    Photoluminescence (PL) was carried out to examine the effects of SS-31 on the
electronic structure of conduction band of the heme of cyt c, an energy state responsible for
electronic transport (FIG. 3). A Nd:YDO4 laser (532.8 nm) was used to excite electrons in
cyt c (FIG. 2A). Strong PL emission in cyt c state can be clearly identified at 650 nm (FIG.
2B). The PL intensity increased dose-dependently with the addition of SS-31, implying an
increase of available electronic states in conduction band in cyt c (FIG. 2B). This suggests
that SS-31 increases electron capacity of conduction band of cyt c, concurring with SS-31
mediated increase in current through cyt c.
Example 5. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) induces novel R-R interactions
around cytochrome c heme.
[0270]    Circular dichroism (Olis spectropolarimeter, DSM20) was carried out to monitor
Soret band (negative peak at 415 nm), as a probe for the   7-n*  heme environment in cyt c
(FIG. 4). SS-31 promoted a "red" shift of this peak to 440 nm, suggesting that SS-31
induced a novel heme-tyrosine    7-n* transition within cyt c, without denaturing (FIG. 4).
These results suggest that SS-31 must modify the immediate environment of the heme,
either by providing an additional Tyr for electron tunneling to the heme, or by reducing the
distance between endogenous Tyr residues and the heme. The increase in R - n* interaction
around the heme would enhance electron tunneling which would be favorable for electron
diffusion.
Example 6. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) increases mitochondrial 02
consumption.
[0271]    Oxygen consumption of isolated rat kidney mitochondria was determined using the
Oxygraph (FIG. 5). Rates of respiration were measured in the presence of different
concentrations of SS-31 in state 2 (400 iM ADP only), state 3 (400 iM ADP and 500 iM
substrates) and state 4 (substrates only). All experiments were done in triplicate with n = 4
7. The results show that SS-31 promoted electron transfer to oxygen without uncoupling
mitochondria (FIG. 5).
Example 7. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) increases ATP synthesis in
isolated mitochondria.
[0272]    The rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis was determined by measuring ATP in
respiration buffer collected from isolated mitochondria 1 min after addition of 400 mM
ADP (FIG. 6). ATP was assayed by HPLC. All experiments were carried out in triplicate,
                                                00

  WO 2013/059071                                                         PCT/US2012/059790
with n=3. Addition of SS-31 to isolated mitochondria dose-dependently increased the rate
of ATP synthesis (FIG. 6). These results show that the enhancement of electron transfer by
SS-31 is coupled to ATP synthesis.
Example 8. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2 (SS-3 1) enhances respiration in
cytochrome c-depleted mitoplasts.
[0273]    To demonstrate the role of cyt c in the action of SS-31 on mitochondrial
respiration, the effect of SS-31 on mitochondrial 02 consumption was determined in cyt c
depleted mitoplasts made from once-frozen rat kidney mitochondria (FIG. 7). Rates of
respiration were measured in the presence of 500 piM Succinate with or without 100 piM SS
31. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, with n=3. These data suggest that: 1) SS-31
works via IMM-tightly bound cyt c; 2) SS-31 can rescue a decline in functional cyt c.
Example 9. The peptides D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) and Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2
(SS-20) facilitate cytochrome c reduction.
[0274]    SS-31 and SS-20 can accelerate the kinetics of cyt c reduction induced by
glutathione (GSH) as a reducing agent (FIG. 13). Reduction of cyt c was monitored by
increase in absorbance at 550 nm. Addition of GSH resulted in a time-dependent increase
in absorbance at 550 nm (FIG. 13). Similar results were obtained using N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) as a reducing agent (not shown). The addition of SS-31 alone at 100 gM
concentrations did not reduce cyt c, but SS-31 dose-dependently increased the rate of NAC
induced cyt c reduction, suggesting that SS-31 does not donate an electron, but can speed up
electron transfer.
Example 10. The peptides D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) and Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2
(SS-20) increase mitochondrial electron flux and ATP synthesis.
[0275]    Both SS-20 and SS-31 can promote electron flux, as measured by 02 consumption
in isolated rat kidney mitochondria (FIG. 14). SS-20 or SS-31 was added at 100 gM
concentrations to isolated mitochondria in respiration buffer containing 0.5 mM succinate
(complex II substrate) and 400 gM ADP. Similar increases in 02 consumption were
observed when low concentrations of complex I substrates (glutamate/malate) were used
(data not shown). The increase in electron flux was correlated with a significant increase in
the rate of ATP production in isolated mitochondria energized with low concentrations of
succinate (FIG. 15). These data suggest that targeting SS-20 and SS-31 to the IMM can

Example 11. Cytochrome c isolation and purification
[0276]     Methods to isolate and purify cytochrome c are known in the art. One exemplary,
non-limiting method is provided. Cytochrome c has several positively charged groups,
giving it a pI of around 10. Thus, it is normally bound to the membrane of mitochondria by
ionic attraction to the negative charges of the phospholipids on the membrane. The tissue
and mitochondria are first broken up by homogenization in a blender at low pH, in an
aluminum sulfate solution. The positively charged aluminum ions can displace the
cytochrome c from the membrane by binding to the negatively charged phospholipids and
free the protein in solution. Excess aluminum sulfate is removed by raising the pH to 8.0,
where the aluminum precipitates in the form of aluminum hydroxide.
[0277]     After filtration to eliminate the precipitated aluminum hydroxide, ion-exchange
chromatography is used to separate proteins as a function of their charge. Cytochrome c has
several positively charged groups; typically, the column is made out of Amberlite CG-50, a
negatively charged or cation-exchange resin.
[0278]     Once the eluent has been collected, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to
selectively precipitate the remaining contaminant proteins in the cytochrome c preparation.
Most proteins precipitate at 80% saturation in ammonium sulfate, whereas cytochrome c
remains soluble. The excess of salts present in the solution are then removed by gel
filtration chromatography which separates protein on the basis of their size.
[0279]     To assess the purification, samples of the preparation are collected at each step of
the purification. These samples are then assayed for total protein content using the Bradford
method, and their cytochrome c concentration is measure by spectrophotometry.

[0280]     The bioremediation compositions and methods described herein will be further
illustrated by the following example. This example is provided for purposes of illustration
only and is not intended to be limiting. The chemicals and other components are presented

[0281]    Expression vector construction: Oligonucleotides encoding an aromatic-cationic
peptide will be chemically synthesized. The oligonucleotides will be designed to include
unique restriction sites at either end that will allow directional cloning into a bacterial
plasmid carrying a constitutive promoter upstream of the multiple cloning site. The plasmid
will be prepared by restriction digest with enzymes corresponding to the restriction sites on
the oligonucleotide ends. The oligonucleotides will be annealed and ligated into the
prepared plasmid using conventional techniques of molecular biology. The ligation product
will be transformed into E. coli grown on selective media. Several positive clones will be
screened for cDNA inserts by DNA sequencing using methods known in the art. Positive
clones will be amplified and a stock of the expression construct prepared.
[0282]    Transformation of D. desulfuricans: A 100 ml overnight culture (OD 6 00     =  0.6) of
D. desulfuricans will be centrifuged and the pellet washed three times with sterile water and
resuspended in a final volume of 200 gl sterile water. A 30 gl aliqote will be mixed with 4
gl of plasmid preparation (1 gg) and subjected to a 5,000 V/en electric pulse for 6 ms by an
electropulsator apparatus. Recombinant bacteria will be selected on the basis of antibiotic
resistance conferred by the recombinant plasmid.
[0283]    Determination of the sulfate reductase activities of recombirant D. desulfuricans:
wild type and recombinant D. desulfuricans strains will be tested for the capacity to reduce
soluble sulfates. Bacteria will be cultured in a media recommended by the Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), at 30'C under anaerobic conditions. An aqueous
solution of 1280 ppm sulfate will be inoculated with wild-type and recombinant D.
desulfuricans and cultured for 12 hours.
[0284]    Sulfate measurement: Sulfate concentrations will be measured using a
turbidometric technique (Icgen et al., 2006) Sulfate will be precipitated in hydrochloric acid
medium with barium chloride to form insoluble barium sulfate crystals. A modified
conditioning mixture containing glycerol (104.16 mL), concentrated hydrochloric acid
(60.25 mL), and 95% isopropyl alcohol (208.33 mL) will be prepared fresh. For each
reaction 2 mL of the cell free supernatant will be diluted 1:50 in Millipore water in a 250
                                                1()

mL conical flask and 5 mL of conditioning mixture added. The entire suspension will be
mixed well through stirring. Approximately 1 gm of Barium chloride crystals will be added
while stirring is continued for 1 min. The mixture will be allowed to settle for 2 min under
static conditions before the turbidity is measured spectrophotometrically at 420 nm. The
concentration of sulfate ion will be determined from a curve prepared using standards
ranging from 0-40 ppm of Na 2 SO 4 .
[0285]    Results: It is predicted that recombinant bacteria expressing aromatic-cationic
peptides will display an enhanced rate of dissimilatory sulfate reduction under these
conditions.
Example 13. The peptides Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), and Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) interact with hydrophobic domain
of cardiolipin (CL).
[0286]    The peptides Dmt-D-Arg-(atn)Dap-Lys-NH 2 (SS-19) and Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
Ald-NH 2 (SS-37)_cationic peptides carry net positive charge at neutral pH. They are
expected to associate with anionic phospholipid cardiolipin based on electrostatic
interaction. The interaction of small peptides with lipid membranes can been studied using
fluorescence spectroscopy (Surewicz and Epand, 1984). The fluorescence of intrinsic Trp
residues exhibits increased quantal yield upon binding to phospholipid vesicles, and this
was also accompanied by a blue shift of the maximum emission indicative of the
incorporation of the Trp residue in a more hydrophobic environment. Polarity-sensitive
fluorescent probes were incorporated into the peptides and fluorescence spectroscopy was
used to determine if SS-19, SS-37 and SS-36 interact with CL. Results are shown in FIG.
21.
[0287]    The peptide Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19) contains anthraniloyl
incorporated into diaminopropionic acid. Anthraniloyl derivatives fluoresce in the 410-420
nm range when excited at 320-330 nm (Hiratsuka T, 1983). The quantum yield of
anthraniloyl derivatives is strongly dependent on the local environment, and can increase 5
fold going from water to 80% ethanol, together with a blue shift in the emission maxima (k
max) of <10 nm (Hiratsuka T, 1983). Fluorescence emission spectrum of SS-19 (1 gM)
alone, and in the presence of increasing concentrations of CL (5 to 50 gg/ml), was
monitored following excitation at 320 nm using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Addition of CL (5-50 gg/ml) led to 2-fold increase in quantal yield of
                                               1(1

  WO 2013/059071                                                         PCT/US2012/059790
SS-19 with no significant shift in Xmax (FIG. 21A). These findings suggest that SS-19
interacts with the hydrophobic domain of CL.
[0288]    The peptide Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH       2 (SS-37) contains an additional amino
acid, aladan (Ald), which has been reported to be particularly sensitive to the polarity of its
environment and it has been used to probe the electrostatic character of proteins (Cohen et
al., 2002). When excited at 350 nm, Xmax shifts from 542 nm in water to 409 nm in
heptane, accompanied by a significant increase in quantal yield (Cohen et al., 2001).
Fluorescence emission spectrum of SS-37 (1 gM) alone, and in the presence of increasing
concentrations of CL, was monitored following excitation at 350 nm. Addition of CL (5 to
50 gg/ml) led to a 3-fold increase in quantal yield of SS-37 as well as a clear blue shift in k
max, from 525 nm without CL to 500 nm with 50 gg/ml CL (FIG. 21B). These results
provide evidence that SS-37 interact with hydrophobic domain of CL.
[0289]    The peptide Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) contains Ald in place Phe3 .
Fluorescence emission spectrum of SS-36 (1 gM) alone, and in the presence of increasing
concentrations of CL, was monitored following excitation at 350 nm. SS-36 was the most
sensitive to the addition of CL, with dramatic increase in quantal yield and blue shift
observed with much lower added amounts of CL (1.25 to 5 gg/ml). The Xmax shifted from
525 nm without CL to 500 nm with as little as 1.25 gg/ml CL, and quantal yield increased
by more than 100-fold with the addition of 5 gg/ml of CL (FIG. 21 C). These results provide
evidence that SS-36 interacts strongly with the hydrophobic domain of CL.
Example 14. Interaction of the peptide Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19) with
cytochrome c.
[0290]    Fluorescence quenching was used to demonstrate the interaction of the peptide
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH      2 (SS-19) with cyt C. Maximal fluorescence emission of SS
 19 was monitored at 420 nm following excitation at 320 nm using Hitachi F-4500
fluorescence spectrophotometer. Results are shown in FIG. 22.
[0291]    SS-19 fluorescence (10 gM) was quenched by sequential addition of 0.2 mg
isolated rat renal kidney mitochondria (FIG. 22A, M + arrows), suggesting uptake of SS-19
by mitochondria. Quenching of SS-19 was significantly reduced when cytochrome c
depleted mitoplasts (0.4 mg) were added, suggesting that cytochrome c plays a major role in
the quenching of SS-19 by mitochondria (FIG. 22B). SS-19 fluorescence (10 gM) was
                                              1 ()A

  WO 2013/059071                                                             PCT/US2012/059790
similarly quenched by sequential addition of 2 gM cytochrome c (FIG. 22C, C + arrows).
The quenching by cytochrome c was not displaced by sequential additions of bovine serum
albumin (FIG. 22C, A + arrows) (500 gg/ml). These data indicate that SS-19 is likely to
interact very deep in the interior of cytochrome c in the heme environment. The interaction
of SS-19 with cytochrome c is linearly dependent on the amount of cytochrome c added
(FIG. 22D).
Example 15. The peptides Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
Ald-NH 2 (SS-37) and Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) interact with cytochrome c and
CL.
[0292]    Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to demonstrate the interaction of the peptides
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH         2 (SS-19), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH       2 (SS-37), and Dmt
D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) interact with cytochrome c in the presence of CL. Results are
shown in FIG. 23
[0293]    Fluorescence emission of SS-19 (10 gM) was monitored in real time
(Ex/Em=320nm/420 nm) using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Addition
of cyt C (2 gM) led to immediate quenching of the fluorescence signal (FIG. 23A)
[0294]    Fluorescence emission of SS-19 (10 gM) was monitored in real time
(Ex/Em=320nm/420 nm) using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Addition
of CL (50 gg/ml) led to increase in SS-19 fluorescence. Subsequent addition of cytochrome
c (2 gM) led to larger extent of quenching of SS-19 fluorescence compared to addition of
cyt C without CL (FIG. 23B). These data indicate that the interaction of SS-19 with
cytochrome c is enhanced in the presence of CL. CL may potentiate the interaction between
SS-19 and cytochrome c by serving as an anionic platform for the two cationic molecules.
[0295]    SS-37 fluorescence (10 gM) was similarly quenched by sequential addition of 2
gM cytochrome c in the presence of CL (50 gg/ml) (FIG. 23C, C + arrows). The quenching
by cytochrome c was not displaced by sequential additions of bovine serum albumin (500
gg/ml) (FIG. 23C, A + arrows). Thus interaction of these peptides with CL does not
interfere with their ability to interact very deep in the interior of cytochrome c.
[0296]    SS-36 also contains the polarity-sensitive fluorescent amino acid aladan. Addition
of CL (2.5 gg/ml) led to increase in SS-36 fluorescence (FIG. 23D). After subsequent
addition of cytochrome c(2 gM) the emission spectrum of SS-36 shows dramatic quenching

of peptide's fluorescence with large blue shift of the emission maxima (510 nm to 450 nm)
(FIG. 23D). These data suggest that the peptide is interacting with a hydrophobic domain
deep in the interior of cytochrome c-CL complex.
Example 16. The peptides Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH2 (SS-20), D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) and D
Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-231) protect the heme environment of cytochrome c from the
acyl chain of CL.
[0297]    Circular dichroism (CD) was carried out to examine the effects of the peptides on
protecting the heme environment of cyt C from the acyl chain of CL. For heme proteins, the
Soret CD spectrum is strictly correlated with the heme pocket conformation. In particular,
the negative 416-420 nm Cotton effect is considered diagnostic of Fe(III)-Met8O
coordination in native cyt C (Santucci and Ascoli, 1997). Loss of the Cotton effect reveals
alterations of the heme pocket region which involve the displacement of Met8O from the
axial coordination to the heme iron. CD spectra were obtained using AVIV CD
Spectrometer Model 410. Results are shown in FIG. 24.
[0298]    Changes in the Soret CD spectrum of cyt C (10 gM) were recorded in the absence
(dotted line) and presence (dashed line) of 30 gg/ml CL, plus addition of different peptides
(10 gM) (solid line) (FIG. 24). CD measurements were carried out using 20 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, at 25 0 C and expressed as molar ellipticity (0) (m Deg). The addition of CL resulted
in the disappearance of the negative Cotton effect, and this was completely prevented by the
addition of these peptides. These results provide clear evidence that the peptides interact
with the heme pocket of cytochrome c and protect the Fe-Met8O coordination.
Example 17. The peptides D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2
(SS-20), and D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1) prevent the inhibition of cytochrome c
reduction caused by CL.
[0299]    Cytochrome c is a carrier of electrons between respiratory complex III and IV in
mitochondria. Cytochrome c is reduced (Fe 2 +) after it accepts an electron from cytochrome
c reductase, and it is then oxidized to Fe3 + by cytochrome c oxidase. The CL associated
cytochrome c has a redox potential which is significantly more negative than native
cytochrome c, and the reduction of cytochrome c is significantly inhibited in the presence of
CL (Basova et al., 2007).

  WO 2013/059071                                                           PCT/US2012/059790
[0300]    Reduction of cytochrome c (20 gM) was induced by the addition of glutathione
(500 gM) in the absence or presence of CL (100 gg/ml) (FIG. 25A). Reduction of
cytochrome c was monitored by absorbance at 550 nm using a 96-well UV-VIS plate reader
(Molecular Devices). Addition of CL decreased the rate of cytochrome c reduction by half.
Addition of SS-31 (20, 40 or 100 gM) dose-dependently prevented the inhibitory action of
CL (FIG. 25A).
[0301]    SS-31 dose-dependently overcame the inhibitory effect of CL on kinetics of
cytochrome c reduction induced by 500 gM GSH or 50 gM ascorbate (FIG. 25B). SS-20
and SP-231 also prevented CL inhibition of cyt C reduction elicited by 500 gM GSH (FIG.
25C).
Example 18. The peptides D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) and Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2
(SS-20) enhances 02 consumption in isolated mitochondria.
[0302]    Both SS-20 and SS-31 can promote electron flux, as measured by 02 consumption
in isolated rat kidney mitochondria. SS-20 or SS-31 was added at 10 gM or 100 gM
concentrations to isolated mitochondria in respiration buffer containing glutamate/malate
(complex I substrate), 0.5 mM succinate (complex II substrate) or 3 gM TMPD/1 mM
ascorbate (direct reductant of cyt C). 400 gM ADP was added to initate State 3 respiration.
Results are shown in FIG. 26.
[0303]    SS-31 increased 02 consumption in state 3 respiration with either complex I or
complex II substates, or when cytochrome c is directly reduced by TMPD/ascorbate (FIG.
26A). SS-20 also increases 02 consumption in state 3 respiration when these substrates
were used (FIG. 26B; data with glutamate/malate and TMPD/ascorbate not shown).
[0304]    These data suggest that SS-31 increases electron flux in the electron transport
chain, and that the site of action is between cytochrome c and complex IV (cytochrome c
oxidase).
Example 19. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) increases ATP synthesis in
isolated mitochondria.
[0305]    Increase in electron flux in the electron transport chain can either result in increase
in ATP synthesis or increase in electron leak and generation of free radicals. ATP synthesis
in isolated mitochondria was assayed by HPLC. SS-31 dose-dependently increased ATP
                                                1 (Y7

synthesis, suggesting that the increase in electron flux is coupled to oxidative
phosphorylation (FIG. 27).
Example 20. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances respiration in
cytochrome c -depleted mitoplasts.
[0306]     A model of cyt C tightly bound to mitochondrial cardiolipin was used to
investigate interaction of SS-31 with cytochrome c -CL conplex in mitochondria. After
removal of outer membrane with digitonin, mitoplasts were washed with 120 mM KCl to
remove all free and electrostatically associated cytochrome c , leaving only cytochrome c
tightly bound to CL. D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances complex II respiration in
mitoplasts with cytochrome c tightly bound to inner mitochondrial membrane in a dose
dependent manner (FIG. 28). These data suggests that SS-31 directly interacts with
cytochrome c -CL complex and promotes electron transfer from complex III to complex IV.
Example 21. The peptide D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) prevents CL from switching
cytochrome c from an electron carrier into a peroxidase activity.
[0307]     The six coordination of the heme in cytochrome c prevents direct interaction of
H 2 0 2 with the catalytic metal site, and native cytochrome c in solution is a poor peroxidase.
Upon interaction with CL, cytochrome c undergoes a structural change with rupture of the
Fe-Met8O coordination. This results in the exposure of the heme Fe3 to H 2 0 2 , and
peroxidase activity increases dramatically (Vladimirov et al., 2006; Sinibaldi et al., 2008).
The mechanism of action of cytochrome c peroxidase is similar to that of other peroxidases,
such as horse radish peroxidase (HRP). Thus it is possible to use the amplex red-HRP
reaction to investigate cytochrome c peroxidase activity. In the presence of peroxidase,
amplex red (AR) reacts with H 2 0 2 to form the red-fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin
(Ex/Em    = 571/585).
[0308]     Cytochrome c (2 gM) was mixed with CL (25 gg/ml) and 10 gM H 2 0 2 in 20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4. Amplex red (50 gM) was then added and fluorescence emission monitored
in real time using Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Addition of amplex red
elicited rapid increase in fluorescence signal due to resorufin formation, providing direct
evidence for peroxidase activity of cytochrome c /CL complex (FIG. 29A). Inclusion of SS
31 decreased the rate of amplex red peroxidation, suggesting that SS-31 interacts directly
with cytochrome c to prevent CL-induced peroxidase activity (FIG. 29A).

[0309]    Addition of SS-31 dose-dependently reduced the kinetics of cytochrome c
peroxidase activity (FIG. 29B) but had no effect on HRP activity (data not shown). FIG.
29C shows a comparison of various peptides on their ability to inhibit cytochrome c
peroxidase activity at a fixed concentration of 10 gM.
