             COMPONENT FOR ATTACHMENT TO A CONTAINER
   Technical Field
 5
   The present disclosure relates to a component for
   attachment to a container, such as, although not limited
   to, a paint can.
10 Background Art
   Paint cans usually have upper rims with grooves that
   facilitate attachment of a lid. The upper rims are
   commonly used by a painter to scrape the paint brush and
15 remove excess paint. As a consequence paint may accumulate
   in the grooves, eventually spill over the upper rims, and
   run down the sides of the paint can. Paint accumulated in
   the grooves may dry during storage, which prevents
   satisfactory sealing of the can when the lid attached.
20 Imperfect sealing of the can causes hardening of the
   paint.
   Summary of Disclosure

   In a first aspect of the present invention, there is
   provided a component for attachment to a container, the
   container having an opening at a top portion, and at least
   one side wall, the component comprising:
30      an attachment portion for attaching the component to
   the top portion of the container;
        a surface coupled to the attachment portion, the
   surface having a lower edge;
        wherein the component is arranged such that, when the
35 component is attached to the container, a lower portion of
   the surface with the lower edge is positioned over or
   within the container, and wherein the lower portion of the
                                            9919328_1 (GHMatters) P105124.AU.2 31/01/18

                                -  2
   surface with the lower edge is inclined relative to an
   adjacent  side wall portion by an angle of less than                    900
   between the adjacent side wall portion and a tangential
   line at the lower edge.
 5
   The  surface may further have an upper edge and may be
   arranged such that, when the component is attached to the
   container, the entire surface between the upper edge and
   the lower edge is inclined relative to an adjacent side
10 wall portion such that an angle between the adjacent side
   wall portion and the tangential line at the lower edge of
   the lower surface portion is less than 90'.
   The entire surface may be uniformly inclined.
15
   The angle between the adjacent side wall portion and the
   tangential line at the lower edge of the lower surface
   portion may be less   than 800,  between 30'   and 600,            or
   between 40'  and 500.
20
   In one embodiment, the angle between the adjacent                  side
   wall portion and the tangential line at the lower edge of
   the lower surface portion is substantially 45'.
25 In one embodiment, the entire surface between the upper
   edge and the lower edge is positioned over or within the
   container.
   The attachment component may be attachable to portion of
30 the container and may have a generally arc-like shape                       for
   attachment to a container having a generally round cross
   sectional shape. Alternatively, attachment component may
   be attachable to portion of the container and may have a
   generally round shape for attachment to a container having
35 a generally round cross-sectional shape. In this case the
   attachment component may surround the container. The
   attachment component may alternatively have any other
                                                9919328_1 (GHMatters) P105124.AU.2 31/01/18

                              - 3
   suitable shape for attachment to containers having any
   suitable shape.
   In one embodiment, the component comprises elastic
 5 material and may be elastically deformable to be
   attachable to containers of various shapes and diameters,
   such as cylindrical containers or cubic containers.
   The component may comprise or may be composed of a
10 polymeric material.
   The component may further comprise a spout member.
   The spout member may be removably attached to the
15 component.
   In one embodiment, the spout member is positioned between
   the upper edge and the lower edge of the surface, wherein,
   when the component is attached to the container, the
20 entire surface between the upper edge and the lower edge
   is positioned within the container.
   In one embodiment, the container is a paint can. The
   component presents several advantages when used for
25 attachment to a paint can. As in use at least the lower
   surface portion is inclined towards or into the opening of
   the paint can, the attachment allows scraping the paint
   brush and removing excess paint while substantially
   avoiding spilling the paint over the top portion of the
30 paint can, and over the side wall. Residual paint on the
   surface of the component is further allowed to flow back
   toward the inside of the container.

   Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments
   The present disclosure relates to a component for
   attachment to a container. The container may be a paint
30 can, however it is envisaged that the container may be any
   kind of container, containing any kind of content, and
   having any size or  shape.
   With reference to Figures la and 1b, there is shown a
35 component  10 for attachment to a container 12.         In this
   particular example, the container 12 is a paint can having
   an opening 13 at a top portion 14,  and a side wall 15.                     The
                                             9919328_1 (GHMatters) P105124.AU.2 31/01/18

                                     - 5
   component   10 comprises an attachment portion 16 for
   attaching the component      10 to the top portion 14 of the
   container 12,     and a surface 17     coupled to the attachment
   portion 16.     The surface 17 has a lower portion 18 that,
 5 when the component      10 is attached to the container 12,                         is
   positioned within the container 10.         The lower portion 18
   has a lower edge 19, and the lower portion 18 with the
   lower edge 19 is inclined relative to an adjacent                       side
   wall portion 20 by an angle 21 of less          than 900 between the
10 adjacent   side wall portion 20 and a tangential line 22 at
   the lower edge 19 of the lower portion 18.             In this
   particular example, the angle 21 is 45'.
   The surface 17      further has an upper edge 23 that is
15 positioned over the container 12.         The entire surface 17
   between the upper edge 23 and the lower edge 19 has a
   constant   slope, and is uniformly inclined relative to the
   adjacent   side wall portion 20 such that the angle 21
   between the adjacent side wall portion 20 and the
20 tangential line 22 at the lower edge 19 of the lower
   portion 18   is 450.
   It is however envisaged that the angle 21 between the
   adjacent   side wall portion 20 and the tangential line 22
25 at the lower edge 19 of the lower portion 18 may be any
   angle that   is   less  than 800,   between  300 and 600,            or
   between 40'   and 500.
   In this example, the component 10 is made out of elastic
30 material such that the component 10         can be stretched to
   fit onto containers having different diameters and shapes.
   The positioning of at least the lower portion 18 of the
   surface 17 of the component over or within the container
35 12 allows scraping of excess paint from a paint brush at
   the lower edge 19 while      substantially avoiding spilling
   paint over the top portion 14 of the paint can 12 and over
                                                     9919328_1 (GHMatters) P105124.AU.2 31/01/18

                                   -   6
   the side wall 15.   The inclination of the surface 17
   relative to the adjacent      side wall portion 20 further
   allows residual paint on the surface 17 to flow back
   toward the inside of the paint can 12.
 5
   In another example, with reference to Figures 2a and 2b,
   the surface 17 has a slope that is monotonically
   decreasing between the upper edge 23 and the lower edge
   18. The entire surface 17 between the upper edge 23 and
10 the lower edge 18 is positioned over the container 12,                              and
   is inclined relative to an adjacent side wall portion 20
   such that the angle 21 between the adjacent               side wall
   portion 20 and the tangential line 22         at the lower edge 19
   is less than 900.
15
   Figure 3 illustrates the component        10 further comprising a
   spout member 24.   The entire surface 17 is positioned
   within the container 12,     and is inclined relative to the
   adjacent side wall portion 20 such that the angle 21
20 between the adjacent side wall portion 20 and the
   tangential line 22 at the lower edge 19 is less than 90',
   in this example 45.     The   spout member 24      is positioned
   between the upper edge 23 and the lower edge 19 of the
   surface 17,  and is preferably positioned closest to the
25 upper edge 23 so as to minimise spills of paint on the
   surface 17,  which spills could further flow toward the
   side wall 15 or the top portion 14 of the container 12.
   It is further envisaged that the component 10                 comprises a
30 spout member 24   is removably attached to the component                            10.
