 1     Public Domain Work
Says p207 of Dickson's "Theory of Numbers" vol 1[2]:
       The congruence a * x 2+ b * x + c mod m - 0 is reduced (art. 152
       [of Gauss' work]) to y 2 mod 4 * a * m      b2 -4* a*c. For each
       root y, it remains to solve 2 * a * x + b = y mod 4 * a * m.
    Much of this innovation patent will work with the modular quadratic
equation, given above, of Gauss.
    The formula for the complex square root, taken from [3] is:
    The square roots of a + bi (with b! = 0) are +(7 + 6f), where
                2   _

2      Prior Work
Quoting from Australian Innovation Patent, written by this patent's author:
    (from Australian Innovation Patent: <removed-apn> "Using The Complex
Square Root Formula And Pythagorean Triples To Take Square Roots Of
Quaternions, Tessarines, Split Complex Numbers, and Modular Tessarines")
       The two Australian Innovation Patents, written by the author of
       this patent, which describe a means of populating the Complex
       Square Root formula with the parameters of Pythagorean Triples,
       are:
          1. #<removed-apn>: The Complex Square Root Formula In Mod
             ular Arithmetic And Pythagorean Triples
          2. #<removed-apn>: The Complex Square Root Formula In Mod
             ular Arithmetic And Pythagorean Triples, Part B
                                         2

      The two Innovation Patents describe how the three parameters of
      the Pythagorean Triple (a 2 + b2 = c 2 ) are, according to Euclid's
      famous formulas:
         1. a= 2 *m *n
                        2
         2. b=m 2    _n
                        2
         3. c=m 2   +n
      As such, for each Pythagorean Triple,
         1. a+c = 2*m*n+ m 2 +n 2 = (m+n)2 . Thus         (a + c) = m+n
            is an integer where a and c are integers
                          2                    2
         2. c-a  = m 2 +n   -2*m*n = (m-n)       . Thus   (c - a) = m-n
            is an integer where a and c are integers.
      As such, all the intermediate calculations of the Complex Square
      Root formula reduce to natural squares, thus, modular square
      roots need not be taken. Thus, the Complex Square Root formula
      immediately reveals the square root of a modular complex number
      where the REAL and IMAGINERY coefficients are taken from
      Pythagorean Triples when one of the square roots of -1 mod p*q
      is known. (Please see either of the patents quoted for 4 examples
      of this).
   The idea of using Pythagorean Triples to create modular complex num
bers and the use of the modular quadratic formula of Gauss will constitute
much of the work of this patent.

3.1 Pythagorean Triples Can Make A Natural
Square For Gauss's Quadratic Equation
In this section, I will quickly show that Pythagorean Triples,
fed into Gauss' Quadratic Equation solution, can provide natural
squares in the b2 - 4 * a * c mod 4 * a * m half the time. However,
the root of the natural square given is NOT the solution root.
The solution root is the root * 1 mod m.
This method rests upon the observation that
2*(a+b2+b*         )-D*(a1 +b1*       1) mod m - 2(a+b2)-D*ai
where D = 2 * b/bi
or
X2 - D * x  + (2(a + b2) - D * ai) - 0 so that a = 1, b = -D, c =
(2(a + b2) - D * ai)
As such, 2(a + b2) - D * a1 is an equation that does not contain
   1 mod m or any unknown. See Australian Innovation Patent:
<removed-apn> "Using The Complex Square Root Formula And Pythagorean
Triples To Take Square Roots Of Quaternions, Tessarines, Split
Complex Numbers, and Modular Tessarines" for a citation on the
use of Pythagorean Triples and squares and roots using 1 mod
p * q instead of V/1 mod p * q as is normally the case in this
math blog.
The following Mathematica procedure shows that Pythagorean
Triples fed into Gauss' method of solving a modular quadratic
equation can provide natural squares for b2 -4*a*c mod 4 * a * m.

The answer to Gauss equation, the (x - ai)/bi - 118286 mod
337 * 577 -1        is given by the root obtained by the Pythagorean
Triples method multiplied by the 1 mod m.
Thus part of the root is obtained by this method, but not the
whole root needed.
Two other anchors, besides         1 mod p * q, for the square and root
equations are possible:
  1. 2*(a + b + b*           ) mod p * q - (ai+ b1 * v/1)2
  2. 2 * (a + b * V/ T--)mod p * q -- (a1 + b1* V/ T)I)2
  3. (2*a+(2*b+b,)*3 -)modp*q                        (a1+ b1 *   1) 2
Feeding in the following parameters will return natural squares
for when the anchor is V/-1 mod p * q. The actual square root
of -1 will be found when the square is found. The equation that
has to be solved in order to find the first natural square is:
2 * (1p1 2 + 1p2 2 ) + 1 mod p * q - 2 * (lp1 + lp2)
There seems to be no easy way to solve this equation. The output

4      The Inventive Work
To extend the public domain work of the author shown above, we
    1. let X2 = 2*a + (I + 1)* b2+2b* I mod p * q be a modular complex
       number, and let x = ai + b1 * I mod p * q as described in the prior
       work section of this patent.
   2. let the imaginary, I, be a known square, io.,     4 = 2 or    9= 3
   3. create a x2 - D * x + C mod p * q = 0 such that the real component of
       the complex square number is cancelled out instead of the imaginary
       component as in the public domain work.
    Thus, if the real coefficient of the complex square were pyl and the imag
inary coefficient were py2 and D = mult and c = minus *              4 then the
following mathematica would create D and c/ 4 when the imaginary num
ber was /4
mult = Mod[(2 pyl + (4 + 1) r2 r2             ) PowerMod[r1,    -1,  p q], p q];
minus    =  Mod[-(2 py2 - mult        r2), p q];
    Thus, if the real coefficient of the complex square were pyl and the imag
inary coefficient were py2 and D = mult and c = minus *              9 then the
following mathematica would create D and c/ 9 when the imaginary num
ber was 9
mult = Mod[(2 pyl + (9 + 1)           r2 r2   ) PowerMod[r1,    -1,  p q], p q];
minus = Mod[-(2 py2 - mult            r2), p q];
    Thus, if the real coefficient of the complex square were pyl and the imag
inary coefficient were py2 and D = mult and c = minus * /              then the
following mathematica would create D and c/ I        when the imaginary num
ber was /
mult = Mod[(2 pyl + (I + 1)           r2 r2   ) PowerMod[r1,    -1,  p q], p q];
minus = Mod[-(2 py2 - mult            r2), p q];
    Please remember that rl is the real component of the root (of x), and
that r2 is the imaginary coefficient of the root.
                                         14

    These equations are extensions of the Pythagorean Triple equations writ
ten up in the three Innovation Patents mentioned in the prior work part of
this patent.
    Thus, following Gauss' modular quadratic equation formulas, and known
ing the I number, because we have set it to be a natural square, then the
formula for the square would be:
              D 2 -4*a*c       mult 2 -4*     minus*      II mod p * q    (1)
    And the equation for the modular square root would be
             -D + 2* (x) mod p * q - -mult + 2* (a1+ bi *            I)   (2)
    It will be shown later in the examples that the root is a modular and
not natural root of the square mod p*q, and that the algebraic relationship
between the root and the square is not easily derived.
    Adapting the Mathematica procedure shown in the public work section
of this patent so that it only runs 1 instance of the loop, and sets lpl and
lp2 (lpl = m and lp2 = n where m and n are the variables in the famous
Euclid) Pythagorean Triples equation such that
                                2
                    (2 * m * n)   + (M 2
                                         - n 2) 2 = (in
                                                        2
                                                          + n 2) 2        (3)

4.1         Example 1
Feeding in the following function call and getting the variables for D = mult
and c = minus * v"9, we get
gaussian7[353, 593, 3, 2, 91
{Pythagorean Triple ,12,5,13},{Root Coefficients ,5,1},
{mult ,167470 ,minus, 167460,square, 50298},
     The equation for the square is thus:
     1674702 - 4 * 167460 * 3 mod 353 * 593 - 175921
     and the equation for the root is:
     (-167470 + 2 * (5 + 1 * 3))2 mod 353 * 593 - 175921
     The non modular number for the square is:
     1674702 - 4 * 167460 * (3) = 28044191380
     The non modular number for the root squared is:
     (-167470 + 2 * (5 + 1 * 3))2 = 28040842116
     You can see that both numbers are equivalent mod 353*593 but are actu
ally different numbers. Thus we have found a modular square root and not
just a natural square root.
     Since -3 is also the square root of 9, we can insert -3 instead of 3 and
still get roots and squares:
     The equation for the square is thus:
     1674702 - 4 * 167460 * (-3) mod 353 * 593 - 8381
     and the equation for the root is:

     The equation for the square is thus:
     1674692 - 4 * 167459 * 2 mod 353 * 593 - 92172
     and the equation for the root is:
     (-167469 + 2 * (5 + 1 * 2))2 mod 353 * 593 - 92172
     The non modular number for the square is:

     The non modular number for the root squared is:
     (-167469 + 2 * (5 + 1 * 2))2 = 28041177025
     You can see that both numbers are equivalent mod 353*593 but are actu
ally different numbers. Thus we have found a modular square root and not
just a natural square root.
     Since -2 is also the square root of 4, we can insert -2 instead of 2 and
still get roots and squares:
     The equation for the square is thus:
     1674692 - 4 * 167459 * (-2) mod 353 * 593 - 50239
     and the equation for the root is:
     (-167469 + 2 * (5 + 1 * (-2)))2 mod 353 * 593 - 50239
4.3      Example 3
We will try the 3 mod 4 semiprime 19 * 79 in this example to show that since
v'4 mod 19 * 79 - 2 the equations hold even though there is no        -1 mod
19 * 79 for 3 mod 4 semiprimes:
     Feeding in the following function call and getting the variables for D =
mult and c = minus * v'4, we get
gaussian7[19, 79, 3, 2, 41         -- 4 is the imaginary this time
{Pythagorean Triple ,12,5,13},{Root Coefficients ,5,1},
{mult,306,minus,296,square,891}
     The equation for the square is thus:
     3062 - 4 * 296 * 2 mod 19 * 79 - 1208
     and the equation for the root is:
     (-306 + 2 * (5 + 1 * 2))2 mod 19 * 79 - 1208
                                       19

     The non modular number for the square is:
     3062 - 4 * 296 * 2 = 91268
     The non modular number for the root squared is:
     (-306 + 2 * (5 + 1 * 2))2 = 85264
     You can see that both numbers are equivalent mod 19*79 but are actually
different numbers. Thus we have found a modular square root and not just
a natural square root.
     Since -2 is also the square root of 4, we can insert -2 instead of 2 and
still get roots and squares:
     The equation for the square is thus:
     3062 - 4 * 296 * (-2) mod 19 * 79 - 1441
     and the equation for the root is:
     (-306 + 2 * (5 + 1 * (-2)))2 mod 19 * 79 - 1441
4.4      Example 4
Using the 19 * 79 modulus this time again, we shall use a more complicated
root ai + bi * v9 where b1 > 1.
     Feeding in the following function call and getting the variables for D =
mutt and c = minus * v 9, we get
gaussian7[19, 79, 7, 4, 91
{Pythagorean Triple ,56,33,65},{Root Coefficients ,11,3},

     The equation for the square is thus:
     11102 - 4 * 262 * (3) mod 19 * 79 - 1138
     and the equation for the root is:
     (-1110 + 2 * (11 + 3 * (3)))2 mod 19 * 79 - 1138
     The non modular number for the square is:
     11102 - 4 * 262 * (3) = 1228956
     The non modular number for the root squared is:
     (-1110 + 2 * (11 + 3 * (3)))2 = 1144900
     You can see that both numbers are equivalent mod 19*79 but are actually
different numbers. Thus we have found a modular square root and not just
a natural square root.
     Since -3 is also the square root of 9, we can insert -3 instead of 3 and
still get roots and squares:
                                       20

    The equation for the square is thus:
    11102 - 4 * 262 * (-3) mod 19 * 79 - 1422
    and the equation for the root is:
    (-1110 + 2 * (11 + 3 * (-3)))2 mod 19 * 79 - 1422
5      Without The Complex Modular Numbers,
       We Have Natural Squares
Working the Gauss quadratic equation without the modular complex num
bers and the Pythagorean Triples, we obtain natural squares.
    25 - 2 * 5 - 15 = 0
    The square is 4 + 4 * 15 = 64 and the root is -2+ 2 * 5 = 8.
    Cancelling out the imaginary component also reveals a natural square as
in the following example:
{{"Pythagorean Triple ", 8,         15,   17},  {"Root Coefficients ", 5,
   3}, {"mult", 10, "minus",        209318,    "square",
   144}
    The equation for the square is 102 - 4 * 209318 mod 353 * 593 - 144
    The equation for the root is (2 * (5 + 3 * 2) - 10) mod 353 * 593 - 12
    With the Pythagorean Triples populating the coefficients for the modular
complex numbers, and cancelling out the real component of the complex
square, we produce, through the Gauss Quadratic Equation, modular squares
instead of natural squares, as in the two examples shown above.
5.1     The Square And The Root When Both Roots Of
        The Natural Square Are Used
Multiplying the two squares together
    (11102 - 4 * 262 * (3)) * (11102 - 4 * 262 * (-3)) mod 19 * 79 - 158
    which equals
    (11104 - 16 * 2622 * (9)) mod 19 * 79 - 158
    The two roots multiplyed together make:
    ((-1110+2*(11+3*(3)))*(-1110+2*(11+3*(-3))))2          mod 19 * 79 - 158
                                        21

6       Summary
Thus, every Pythagorean Triple and every natural square can create a square
and root squared combination that is not a natural square but a modular
square, that is, they are equivalent mod p*q, not the same number.
     It has been shown that the modular complex number holds here as both
the positive and the negative root of the modular complex square and root
(populated with Pythagorean Triples) yield modular squares and modular
square root combinations.
     So a bridge has been created, a mapping if you will, between squares and
roots mod p*q. You can create the square as easily as creating the root, and
you can cannot create the root except by the algorithms given above.
