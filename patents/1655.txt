    A therapeutic pillow
    Field of the Invention
    The invention relates to pillows, more specifically, to a therapeutic pillow for correct postural
    support of the cervical spine that is designed to be placed under the head and neck of the user
  5 while lying in a supine or side-supported position.
    Background of the Invention
    The standard rectangular pillow has been dominant for decades. The fundamental design flaw of
    the standard pillow leads to a flexed forward position of the neck. This forward protrusion can
 .0 create an anterior weight bearing posture in the user's neck, shortening the anterior cervical spine
    musculature and increasing the curve in the thoracic and lumbar spine. This can lead to a variety
    of problems including poor or uneven sleeping support, discomfort and exacerbation of pre
    existing injuries, head ache, neck ache, back ache and other muscular discomfort, tension on the
    spinal cord, joints and discs and encourages poor posture in the upright, standing position.
 .5 Approximately one-third of all human existence is spent asleep. Due to the key benefits of better
    sleep including - more energy; improved breathing; improved cognition and memory; reduced
    inflammation and weight - there is an increased demand for pillows that promote proper sleeping
    posture to address the issues created by standard rectangular pillows.
    Recently, a number of "memory foam" pillows, formed of visco-elastic material, have entered
 .0 the market. Responding to temperature changes, an individual's body heat moulds the pillow to
    conform to their natural curves for optimal comfort and support. Memory foam pillows contour
    easily, making a precise fit less critical, but they do not provide optimal alignment of the neck
    and spine when in supine or side-supported position.
    Memory foam pillows are manufactured using chemicals including polyurethane, which emits a
25  strong odour. More chemicals are then added to polyurethane to make it more dense and viscous,
    and flame retardant. One of these was pentabde (pentabromodiphenyl(ether)) which is now
    known to be toxic to the liver, thyroid, and nervous system. The chemical odour produced is
    known as "off gassing". This "off gassing" of volatile organic compounds is well documented
    with several studies indicating that memory foam is somewhat toxic, and not entirely benign.
30  Recently, there has been an influx in therapeutic pillows designed to properly support the
    cervical spine when sleeping in supine or side-supported position. Despite the redesign, similar
    visco-elastic materials are used to provide the same amount of comfort as the memory foam
    pillows. Therefore, these supposed "new and improved" design alternatives to the memory foam
    pillows are still just as harmful to the user and environment.

                                                        2
    There is a need to provide an improved pillow addressing the drawbacks of the standard
    rectangular pillow, and memory foam pillows. The improved pillow needs to be comfortable but
    provide additional therapeutic effects of improved cervical spine alignment, and a decrease in the
    chemical impact on the user and the environment.
  5 In order to overcome the deficiencies in currently available therapeutic pillows, there is herein
    provided a therapeutic pillow substantially rectangular in shape for supporting the cervical spine,
    made with all-natural, sustainable materials comprising:
    - a pair of substantially rectangular sheets of GOTS Certified organic cotton material affixed
    together to form an internal chamber
 .0 - a third substantially rectangular sheet of GOTS Certified organic cotton material divides the
    internal chamber into a pair of cells which are overstuffed with Oeko-Tex Standard 100 wool to
    form a cushioned portion adjacent the edges of the pillow for supporting a user's neck
    - a centrally located planar region which contains organic cotton wadding for receiving the user's
    head
 .5 - and including an internal pocket within the pillow for receiving a support insert to provide
    additional support for the user's cervical spine.
    In a preferred embodiment of the invention the support insert is removable and support inserts of
    different dimensions can be inserted within the pocket.
    In especially preferred embodiments of the invention the cells are each stuffed with at least 400
  0 grams of Oeko-Tex Standard 100 wool.
    In other embodiments, the cells are stuffed to different densities to form a dense support layer
    and a less dense comfort layer.
    Preferably the pillow includes a pillow case.

    Detailed Description of the Invention
    Rectangular pillows and memory foam pillows have inherent disadvantages in their design and
    make. Accordingly, there is a societal demand for a pillow that maintains the comfort associated
  5 with memory foam pillows but which provides appropriate therapeutic benefits and decreases the
    environmental impact associated with pillows manufactured from memory foam.
    The cervical pillow 10 of the present invention is hand made with all-natural and sustainable
    materials sourced in Australia where possible. The therapeutic pillow 10 is substantially
    rectangular in shape and is designed to provide support for the cervical spine of the user. The
 .0 pillow is constructed of a pair of substantially rectangular sheets 12 of Global Organic Textile
    Standard ("GOTS") Certified Organic Cotton material affixed together to form an internal
    chamber which is hand-stuffed with Australian Wool Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified wool.
    The pillow has been minimally processed using only hot water and non-caustic mild detergent to
    remove the natural oils and odours. This pure, sustainable, natural, and breathable wool wicks
 .5 away moisture, preventing dust mites, mould and mildew, lowers health risks and makes them a
    hypoallergenic option to the chemically created memory foam pillows which are currently
    available. As a natural fibre, wool has the tendency to compress over time; therefore, the
    pillow's internal chamber is "overstuffed" to delay the effects of regular use and compression by
    the weight of the user's head and neck.
  o The main disadvantage of using wool as the predominate material in the pillows is its natural
    inconsistencies in texture and microns, and its tendency to clump and separate over time. To
    successfully use wool and ensure these natural characteristics do not affect the aesthetics or
    physical structure of the therapeutic pillow, the inventor has developed "dual cell technology".
    An extra layer of 100% certified organic cotton fabric is added inside the pillow, creating a pair
 .5 of separate internal compartments or cells 21a, 21b which are each overstuffed with at least 400
    grams of wool enabling the wool to maintain its shape, density and consistency over time,
    simulating the longevity benefits of the memory foam.
    The cells 21a, 21b can be stuffed to different densities to form a dense support layer and a less
    dense comfort layer which can be used alternately by the user according to his or her
30  requirements or preferences.
    The pillow is designed to structurally support the cervical spine whilst the user is lying down in
    supine or side-supporting position and to encourage proper skeletal alignment when sleeping,
    leading to correct posture when standing. The pillow 10 has a centrally located planar region 14
    of a generally trapezoidal shape which contains organic cotton wadding for receiving and
35  providing support for the user's head. The trapezoidal centrally planar region 14 prevents flexed,
    forward head posture when sleeping, allowing the neutral position of the head in the supine or
    side-supporting positions, while still allowing proper support of the neck and shoulders. This

                                                      4
    decreases tension on the spine and allows the body to experience rest and healing free from
    pillow-created spinal stress, nerve interference or spinal cord tension.
    The pillow 10 also has an internal pocket 15 within the pillow for receiving a support insert 25,
    30 to provide additional support for the user's cervical spine. The support insert 25, 30 is
  5 removable and support inserts 25, 30 of different dimensions can be inserted within the pocket
    15 according to the user's preferences or in accordance with the directions of the user's health
    practitioner.
    Existing pillows are often found to be uncomfortable, particularly when the user is lying in a
    side-supported position which causes the neck to arch over excessively. This can cause the user
 .0 to awaken with neck pain. In order to address this, support inserts 25, 30 of different dimensions
    (for example, inserts having different weights of 35g and 75g) can be inserted within the internal
    pocket 15 of the pillow 10 to assist in the individualisation of cervical spine support and to
    promote improved alignment of the neck and spine when the user is lying in a supine position as
    the extra depth accommodates for variances in an individual's neck length and mobility. This
 .5 feature allows modification over the course of the user's healthcare, according to the user's
    needs and the healthcare provider's recommendations.
    The pillow 10 can have a pillow case made of the same organic material as the pillow 10 for
    protecting the pillow 10 and extending its useful lifespan. The fabric of the pillow 10 casing,
    cervical support insert pocket 15, the zippered pillow protector and each of the support inserts is
 .0 made from 100% certified organic cotton which is natural, non-bleached, with no dyes. The
    colour of the fabric is natural, uncoloured, and un-bleached for maximum health benefits. The
    thread used to affix the components of the pillow is a neutral colour made from a poly/cotton
    blend for maximum durability. Any zippers incorporated into the pillow case can be made of
    brown plastic nylon for optimal comfort and ease of use although other materials may be suitable
 .5 according to the user's requirements.
    The pillow 10 can be fitted with a label indicating the identity of the manufacturer.
    The packaging of individual pillows 10 are plastic free. When a single therapeutic pillow 10 is
    shipped out, it is shipped in a box made of predominately recycled brown, un-bleached packing
    materials which limits the amount of packaging waste.
30  The overall aim of the invention is to revolutionize the way consumers think and shop by
    providing high quality, natural, sustainable and ethically produced products in a design that is
    practically useful and demanded in modern society.
    In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific
    to structural or methodical features. The term "comprises" and its variations, such as
35  "comprising" and "comprised of' is used throughout in an inclusive sense and not to the

                                                    5
  specific features shown or described since the means herein described comprises preferred forms
  of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or
  modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted by those
  skilled in the art.
