CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This application is a divisional application of
Australian application number 2014203473, the entire
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE  INVENTION
[0002]     The present invention relates to the field of
mining machines.   Specifically, the present invention
relates to a reel system located within the boom of a
mining machine, such as a rope shovel.
[0003]     Industrial mining machines, such as electric
rope or power shovels, draglines, etc.,         are used to
execute digging operations to remove material from a bank
of a mine.   On a conventional rope  shovel, a dipper is
attached to a handle, and the dipper is supported by a
cable, or rope, that passes over a boom sheave.                   The rope
is secured to a bail that is pivotably coupled to the
dipper.  During a hoist phase, the rope is reeled in by a
winch in a base of the machine, lifting the dipper upward
through the bank and liberating the material to be dug.
The handle is moved slidingly   (e.g., telescopingly) along
a saddle block to maneuver a position of the dipper.
Long, heavy conduits, such as hydraulic conduits, electric
conduits, and grease conduits, are directed from a base
portion of the shovel to the dipper, and deliver hydraulic
fluid, grease, etc. to the dipper or elsewhere on the
mining shovel to assist in the mining operation.
[0004]     Currently on electric shovels with rack and
pinion handle crowding or with hydraulic crowding of
telescoping handles there is no reliable method used to
                                      9754337_1  (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0024]     FIG. 1 illustrates a mining shovel 10.                     The
mining shovel 10 rests on a support       surface, or floor 14,
and includes a base 18,  a boom 22,     a handle 26,              a dipper
30, tilt actuators  34, and a hydraulic system 38.                      The
base 18 includes a hoist drum 42      (illustrated
schematically with dashed lines in FIG. 1) for reeling in
and paying out a cable or rope 46.        The boom 22             includes a
first end 50 coupled to the base 18,        a second end 54
opposite the first end 50,    a boom sheave 58 coupled to the
second end 54,  a saddle block 62,     and a shipper shaft                    66.
The boom sheave 58 guides the rope      46 over the second end
54.   The saddle block 62 is rotatably coupled to the boom
22 by the shipper shaft  66, which is positioned between
the first end 50 and the second end 54 of the boom 22 and
extends through the boom 22.       The rope     46 is coupled to
the dipper 30 by a bail 70,    and the dipper 30              is raised or
lowered as the rope  46 is reeled in or paid out,
respectively, by the hoist drum 42.         The handle 26 is
coupled to the shipper shaft      66 via a rack and pinion, and
slidably  (e.g., telescopingly) moves relative to the
shipper shaft  66.
                                         9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                              - 6
[0025]     As illustrated in FIGS. 2-11, the hydraulic
system 38 includes a reel system 74.          The reel system 74
is at least partially disposed within a chamber 76 located
within the boom 22.    The reel    system 74 includes a reel 78
for reeling in and reeling out portions of conduits 82.
The conduits 82  include, for example, hydraulic conduits,
electric conduits, and lubricating grease conduits.                         In
some constructions the conduits 82 are held together next
to one another with clips or other binding structures.
[0026]     As illustrated in FIGS. 5-7, the reel 78
includes a central shaft 86 centered in the reel                    78 and
defining an axis of rotation      90 (FIGS. 3, 5,           5A, and 7) of
the reel  78.  The central shaft 86 includes a
swivel/rotary union 94    (FIGS. 6, 7,    9, and 10)            capable of
transporting fluid through rotational motion of the reel
78.   The swivel/rotary union 94 includes input ports                       98
(FIG. 6)  for receiving portions of the conduits 82.
[0027]     With reference to FIGS. 5 and 7, the reel 78
includes a first member 102 positioned at a first end of
the shaft 86 and a second member 106 positioned at a
second end of the shaft    86.   Each of the members 102,                     106
includes an exterior surface and an interior surface
facing the interior surface of the opposing member.                         The
reel  78 further includes a reel hub 107           (FIG. 7) connected
to the central shaft 86 and webs 108         (FIG. 7)         connecting
the reel hub 107 to the first and second members 102,                         106.
The reel  78 also includes a reel cover 110             (FIG. 5).             The
reel cover 110 extends between the first and second
members 102,  106,  and protects portions of the conduits 82
from exposure to wear, as well as provides added overall
structural stability to the reel 78 and guidance                    for the
conduits  82.
[0028]     The reel  system 74 also includes a drive shaft
114  (FIG. 5) coupled to the reel 78.         In some
                                         9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

constructions, the drive shaft 114 is releasably coupled
to the reel 78.     The drive shaft 114    extends from the
central shaft   86, along the axis of rotation 90.                   The
drive shaft 114    includes a first drive shaft portion 118
and a second drive shaft portion 122.          The first drive
shaft portion 118 extends from the central shaft                   86, and
the second drive shaft portion 122 is releasably coupled
to the first drive shaft portion 118.          In the illustrated
construction, the first and second drive shaft portions
118,  122 include one or more   flanges 124 that are bolted
together with fasteners 125    (FIG. 7),     though in other
constructions different connections and/or fastening
elements are used.     As illustrated in FIG. 7,             in some
constructions a separate flange 124      is positioned between
the first drive shaft portion 118 and the second drive
shaft portion 122, and is coupled to the first drive shaft
portion 118   (e.g., with fasteners in a countersunk
arrangement).    Both the first and second drive shaft
portions 118,   122 extend along the axis of rotation                    90.
In some constructions the first and second drive shaft
portion 118,   122  are integrally formed together as a
single piece.
[0029]      With continued reference to FIG. 5, the reel
system 74 includes a first drive member 126 releasably
coupled to the drive shaft 114.     In the illustrated
construction the drive member 126 is a sprocket having
teeth   (not shown).   In other constructions the drive
member 126 is a pulley, sheave, or other structure
configured to rotate and drive rotation of the reel 78.
The drive member 126 includes a central opening 130.                         The
second drive shaft portion 122 extends into the opening
130.   A removable pin 134 extends through a distal end of
the second drive shaft portion 122 to prevent the drive
member 126 from disengaging the drive shaft              114, though in
other constructions different connection mechanisms are
used.    The drive member 126 has a diameter 138.                  In some
                                        9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                              -  8
constructions the first drive member 126 is integrally
formed with the drive shaft 114.       For example, in some
constructions the drive member 126 is integrally formed
with the second drive shaft portion 122.              In other
constructions, the drive member 126 and drive shaft
portion 122  include a key and/or spline structure, such
that rotational motion of the drive member 126 is
transferred to the drive shaft portion 122.
[0030]     With reference to FIGS. 3, 5, and 7, the reel
system 74 also includes a second drive member 142.                        The
drive member 142   is located on the shipper shaft                  66 along
an axis 144   (FIG. 7).    In some constructions the drive
member 142  is formed integrally with the shipper shaft 66.
In the illustrated construction, the drive member 142 is a
sprocket having teeth     (not shown).    In other constructions
the drive member 142     is a pulley, sheave, or other
structure configured to rotate and drive rotation of the
reel  78.  The drive member 142 has a diameter 146                     (FIG.
5).  The diameter 146 is different than the diameter 138
of the first drive member 126, though in some
constructions the diameters 146,      148 are equal.
[0031]     The reel   system 74 also includes a continuous
loop element 150 that engages both of the drive members
126,  142.  The illustrated loop element 150 is a chain
(links not  shown).     In other constructions the loop
element 150 is a rope, belt, or any other structure that
transfers the rotational motion of the drive member 142 to
the drive member 126 without any significant                slippage
between the loop element 150 and the drive members 126,
142.
[0032]     With reference to FIG. 11,       the shipper shaft 66
is driven by a prime mover 154.       The shipper shaft 66
rotates the drive member 142 and also generates linear
movement of the handle 26 at the same time              (i.e.,
                                         9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                             - 9
generates extension or crowding of the handle 26).
Rotation of the drive member 142 causes movement of the
loop element 150, which causes rotational movement of the
drive member 126 at a rotational speed that is
proportional to the drive member 142.
[0033]     While FIGS. 1-5 illustrate the diameter 138
being larger than the diameter 146,     in some constructions,
like that shown in FIG. 5A, the diameter 138 is equal to
or smaller than the diameter 146.     The ratio of the
diameter 146 to the diameter 138 is chosen to time the
rotation of the shipper shaft 66 with the rotation of the
reel  78 such that an optimum sag, or dip         (seen for example
in FIGS. 1-4) of the conduits 82 is maintained along the
conduits  82.  Maintaining an optimum sag prevents the
conduits  82 from experiencing axial loads          (too tight) or
bending loads   (too loose) that damage the conduits 82,                      and
enhances the overall life of the conduits 82.                 The optimum
sag reduces a total length of the conduits 82               so as to
minimize swaying as the mining shovel 10          swings        (lateral
bending in the conduits   82) while not pulling to a
significant degree on the conduits 82 so as to infer axial
loads.
[0034]     In particular,  for the construction illustrated
in FIG. 5A, the ratio of the diameter 146 to the diameter
138 is between approximately 1.1:1 and 1.9:1.                 In some
constructions, the ratio of the diameter of the diameter
146 to the diameter 138 is between approximately 1.4:1 and
1.6:1.   In some constructions, the ratio of the diameter
of the diameter 146 to the diameter 138 is approximately
1.5:1.   Other constructions include different              ranges
values for the ratio, such ranges and values depending for
example upon the specific handle 26 length and/or boom 22
length being used on the particular mining shovel 10,                       and
the desired amount of sag.     In some constructions the
ratio between the two diameters 146,      138 is determined
                                       9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                            - 10
based on a diameter of the reel 78 and/or a desired number
of wraps of the conduits 82 around the reel             78    (e.g.,
based off available space inside the interior chamber 76).
[0035]     With continued reference to FIG. 5A, a ratio
above 1:1 is particularly advantageous because this ratio
of the diameter 146 to the diameter 138 causes the
conduits  82 to be paid out faster than the handle 26 is
being lengthened.    With this ratio, a sag in the conduits
82 is generated when the handle 26 is at low angles
relative to the support   surface, or floor 14.               When an
operator hoists the handle 26 upwards toward the boom
sheave 58,   (i.e., when the dipper 30 is raised by the rope
46 on the mining shovel 10)   the handle 26 moves and
rotates in a pivoting manner relative to the boom 22
generally about the shipper shift    66.      The sag is then
reduced and the conduits 82 straighten out,             such that the
conduits  82 do not interfere with any components of the
mining machine 10.
[0036]     With reference to FIGS. 1-5A, rotation of the
drive member 126 causes rotation of the drive shaft 114,
which causes rotation of the reel    78 to reel in or reel
out the conduits 82.    Thus, as the handle 26 is extended
and crowded, the reel system 74 works in harmony with the
movement of the handle 26 to reel in or reel out a portion
of the conduits 82.    The reel  system 74 is configured to
maintain an optimum level of    sag in the conduits               82 that
extend generally between the reel    78 and the dipper 30.
As the handle 26 is extended, rotation of the shipper
shaft 66 causes rotation of the reel 78 to             automatically
reel out a length of the conduits    82 that maintains a
desired overall sag, and as the handle 26 is retracted,
the reel  78 automatically reels in a length of the
conduits  82 that maintains a desired overall sag.                    This
correlation between the shipper shaft       66 and the reel                 78
                                       9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                            - 11
advantageously reduces or eliminates the need for
additional controls or motors for driving the reel 78.
[0037]     With reference to FIG. 8, an alternative reel
system 374  is illustrated.   The reel system 374 employs
much of the same structure and has many of the same
properties as the reel system 74,    with similar elements
increased in numerical value by 300.        The reel system 374
is driven by an offset gear mesh that includes drive
members 426,  442,  along with gears 355 and 356 and a shaft
357.   Gear 355, which is on the shaft 357,            is coupled to
or integrally formed with the drive member 426 and rotates
with the drive member 426.    Gear 356 is coupled to or
integrally formed with a reel    378, and rotates with the
reel 378.   A loop element 450 couples the two drive
members 426 and 442.    Rotation of drive member 442 about
an axis 444  causes rotation of the reel         378 about an axis
390.   Similar to the constructions illustrated in FIGS. 5
and 5A, a ratio between the drive members 442,                 426 is
chosen to maintain a desired level of sag in the conduits
82.  For example, a ratio is chosen such that one                    full
rotation of the drive member 442 causes approximately one
and one half full rotations of the reel          378.       As
illustrated in Fig. 8, the reel system 374 further
includes an end cap 358.
[0038]     With reference to FIGS. 2-11, the reel                  system 74
(or similar reel system 374),    including reel            78,     is
accessible for maintenance and/or replacement.                   In
particular, the mining shovel 10 includes a first access
element 158 that is coupled to both the boom 22                  and to the
reel system 74.    The access element 158 is located along a
bottom facing surface 162 of the boom 22,            and has an
opening 166 extending through the access element                   158 that
provides visual access to the reel    78 inside the chamber
76, and that also provides an area for the conduits 82 to
pass out of the boom 22.    The opening 166 is sized large
                                       9754337_1  (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                             -   12
enough to account for movement and sagging of the conduits
82 during use of the machine 10, without the need for
rollers to facilitate movement.        In some constructions the
access element 158 additionally or alternatively includes
one or more rollers   (not shown) that facilitate movement
of the conduits 82 in and out of the opening 166.                         As
illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, the conduits 82 pass over
the top of the reel  78,  which allows for greater sag.                           In
some constructions the conduits 82 instead pass underneath
the reel  78.
[0039]     The access element      158 includes an outer frame
member 170 that defines the opening 166.                In the
illustrated construction the frame member 170 is
rectangular, though in in other constructions the frame
member 170 has different    shapes.     As illustrated in FIG.
5, the frame member 170 includes apertures 174 which are
used for insertion of fasteners 178 that releasably couple
the frame member 170 to the boom 22.           The apertures 174
extend along flanges   182.
[0040]     The access element      158 includes two projections
or arms 186 that extend from the frame member 170 on
either side of the reel   78 and couple the first access
element 158 to the reel   78.     As illustrated in FIG. 5, the
projection 186 adjacent the drive member 126 includes an
aperture  190.  The drive shaft 114 extends through the
aperture  190, and is free to rotate within the aperture
190.   In some constructions the aperture 190 forms a
bearing that includes one or more lubricated surfaces.                               In
some constructions ball bearings are used.                 The
projections 186 fixedly attach the reel             78 to the first
access element 158.    For example, in some constructions
the projection 186 is coupled to the swivel/rotary union
94 with one or more bolts      (e.g., on a bolt circle flange).
                                          9754337_1  (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                           - 13
[0041]     With reference to FIGS. 9 and 10 the access
element 158 is pivotable from a first position               (FIG. 9) in
which the access element 158 is coupled to the boom 22
with the fasteners 178, to a second position             (FIG. 10)           in
which the access element 158 is pivoted away from the boom
22,  and the reel 78 is exposed for repair and/or
replacement.   To permit the pivoting motion, the mining
shovel 10 includes one or more pivot elements 194                   (e.g., a
hinge pin) coupled to both the boom 22 and to the access
element 158.   The access element 158 is allowed to pivot
up to approximately 90 degrees relative to the boom 22,
though in other constructions different ranges of movement
are permitted.   Because of the size and weight of the
structures involved, in some constructions a hoist system
or additional truck can be used to help lower the access
element 158 down to the position illustrated in FIG. 10.
[0042]     With reference to FIG. 2,   in some constructions
the boom 22  further includes one or more bumper portions
198.   In the illustrated construction the bumper portions
198 extend alongside at least a portion of the access
element 158.   In other constructions the bumper portions
198 are disposed on the access element       158 itself.               In the
illustrated construction the bumper portions 198 are
elongate members made of metal, rubber, or other suitable
material.   The bumper portions 198 are      separate pieces
coupled to the boom 22,  although in some constructions the
bumper portions 198 are integrally formed in one piece
with the boom 22.   The bumper portions 198 inhibit the
dipper 30 or any other moving part of the machine 10 from
contacting and damaging the reel 78.       The bumper portions
198 allow a larger diameter reel 78 to be used, and allow
at least a portion of the reel 78 to protrude out of the
chamber 76, without the reel   78 being contacted or
otherwise damaged by a nearby moving component.                  Using a
larger reel 78 is advantageous, since a larger reel 78
requires  fewer revolutions to pay out a predefined length
                                      9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

of conduits 82, and reduces or eliminates the need to
overlay more than one layer of conduits 82 on the reel                       78.
[0043]    With reference to FIG. 12,     in some constructions
the reel 78 includes helical grooves 200.            The helical
grooves 200 also help to reduce or eliminate the need to
overlay more than one layer of conduits 82 on the reel                       78.
For example, in some constructions each conduit 82                    (shown
partially in cross-section in FIG. 12)       is assigned a
helical groove 200 that wraps around the reel 78 twice,
such that the reel  78 itself completes two rotations
before any overlaying or double-layering of conduits 82
becomes necessary, or before any bunching of the conduits
82 occurs on the reel 78.
[0044]    With reference to FIG. 2, the mining shovel 10
also includes a second access element 202.            The access
element 202 is coupled to the boom 22      along a side facing
surface 206 of the boom 22   and provides access to the
chamber 76 and the reel  78.   The access element 202 is
generally rectangular in shape, though in other
constructions different  shapes are used.          The access
element 202 includes apertures   210 along outer edges 214
of the access element 202.    The apertures 210 are used for
insertion of fasteners 216 that releasably couple the
access element 202 to the boom 22.
[0045]    The access element 202 includes an aperture                       (not
shown) extending through the access element 202 generally
in a central area of the access element 202.              As
illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, a portion of the drive shaft
114 extends through the access element 202,           and the drive
member 126 and a portion of the drive shaft            114 are
disposed outside of the chamber 76 and outside of the
access element 202.

[0046]     In order to pivot the reel 78         from the position
illustrated in FIG. 9 to the position illustrated in FIG.
10 for repair and/or replacement, the drive member 126 is
first removed.   To remove the drive member 126,                 the pin
134  (FIG. 5) is removed from the drive shaft 114, allowing
the drive member 126 to slide off the end of the drive
shaft 114.   In some constructions, and as noted above, the
pin 134 maintains a keyed and/or splined connection
between the drive member 126 and the drive shaft                   114.
[0047]     Prior to removing the drive member 126, the loop
element 150 is first removed from the drive member 126, or
from both drive members 126,    142.  Alternatively, in some
constructions the loop element 150 remains on the drive
member 126 as the drive member 126 is removed from the
drive shaft 114.   With the drive member 126 removed, the
fasteners 216 on the access element 202 are loosened.                          The
access element 202 is then slid over the end of the drive
shaft 114 and removed from the boom 22,          thereby exposing
the inside of the chamber 78.     The first drive shaft
portion 118 is then de-coupled and removed from the second
drive shaft portion 122   (i.e., by removing the fasteners
extending through the flanges    124 as shown in FIG. 5).
[0048]     With the drive member 126,     access element 202,
and the first drive shaft portion 122 removed, the
fasteners 178 on the access element 158 are removed, and
the access element  158 and reel 78 are       free to pivot down
to the position illustrated in FIG. 10.           To raise the reel
78 back inside the chamber 76 and assemble the reel system
74, the steps described above are reversed in order.
[0049]     In some constructions, the drive member 126
remains coupled to a portion of the drive shaft 114                      and
the access element 202 remains on the boom 22.                   For
example, by reaching up into the chamber 76 the first
drive shaft portion 118 is de-coupled and removed from the
                                       9754337_1  (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                               -  16
second drive shaft portion 122        (i.e., by removing the
fasteners extending through the flanges              124 as shown in
FIG. 5).    The  fasteners 178 on the access element 158 are
then removed.     The access element     158 and the reel 78 are
then free to pivot down, with the access element 202 still
remaining on the boom 22,      and the second drive shaft
portion 122    remaining extending through the access element
202.
[0050]      Along with the reel      system 74 and the conduits
82,  the hydraulic system 38 also includes a fluid source
222  (illustrated schematically in dashed lines in FIG. 1).
In the illustrated construction, the conduits 82 deliver
fluid   (e.g., hydraulic fluid) from the fluid source 222 to
the tilt actuators     34 near the dipper 30 and to dump
cylinders    (not shown) in the dipper 30.             In other
constructions, the conduits 82 deliver fluid to other
areas of the mining shovel 10.
[0051]      With reference to FIGS. 1-11, the conduits 82
include a first set of conduits 226         (FIGS. 9 and 10),                    a
second set of conduits 230       (FIGS. 9 and 10),            a third set
of conduits 234     (FIG. 6),  and a fourth set of conduits 238
(FIGS. 2-6).     The hydraulic system 38 includes a first
manifold 242    (FIGS. 9 and 10)     disposed in the boom 22,                      the
swivel/rotary union 94      (FIG. 6) described above, a second
manifold 246    (FIG. 6) disposed within the reel 78,                      and a
third manifold 250     (illustrated schematically in FIG. 4)
disposed adjacent the tilt actuators 34.                Each of the
first manifold 242,     the swivel/rotary union 94,                  the second
manifold 246, and the third manifold 250 is in fluid
communication with one or more of the conduits 226, 230,
234,  238.
[0052]      With reference to FIGS. 1,        9 and 10,            the
conduits 226 extend from the fluid source 222 to the
manifold 242.     The conduits 226 are rigid, and are made of
                                           9754337_1  (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

                             - 17
metal tubing or other rigid material.         The conduits 226
are disposed within the mining shovel 10.              In some
constructions the conduits 226 have some limited amount of
flexibility.
[0053]      With reference to FIGS. 6, 7,        9, and 10,            the
conduits 230 extend from the manifold 242 to the
swivel/rotary union 94.     The conduits 230 are flexible,
and accommodate the pivoting motion of the reel 78
described above.     In particular, and with reference to
FIGS. 9 and 10,   the conduits 230 are flexible enough, and
long enough, to accommodate movement of the reel                   78
through approximately up to 90 degrees relative to the
boom 22  from the first position    (FIG. 9) to the second
position   (FIG. 10).   The manifold 242 remains rigidly
attached within the boom 22 while the conduits 230 flex
and bend to accommodate the two positions of the reel                        78.
[0054]      With continued reference to FIG. 6, the conduits
234 extend from the swivel/rotary union 94 to the manifold
246.   The illustrated conduits 234 are       flexible.              In some
constructions the conduits 234 are rigid, and are made of
metal tubing or other rigid material.
[0055]      With reference to FIGS. 2-6, the conduits 238
extend from the manifold 246 to the manifold 250,                    and are
flexible.    At least a portion of the conduits 238 wrap
around the reel 78 as the reel 78 is turned by the drive
member 126.    As illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, the conduits 238
extend generally alongside underneath the handle 26 as the
handle 26 is moved.     The conduits 238 incur a sag in an
area between the reel 78 and the dipper 30.               As described
above, the reel 78 and the shipper shaft 66 rotate in a
proportional manner, such that as the rate of movement of
the handle 26 increases, the rotational rate of the reel
78 also increases, and vice versa.      This proportional
relationship facilitates and maintains an ideal amount sag
                                       9754337_1  (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

(i.e.,  a preset tension) in the conduits 238,                regardless
of the position of the dipper 30,      such that the conduits
238 do not   impede or interfere with operation of the
mining shovel 10.
[0056]      The conduits 226, 230,    234,    238 provide pathways
for movement of fluid     (e.g., hydraulic fluid, grease,
etc.)  from one area of the shovel 10 to another.                     In
particular, the hydraulic system 38       supplies pressurized
hydraulic fluid to the tilt actuators 34 and dump
cylinders through the reel system 74 and to return
conduits   (e.g., the same conduits    82) back to the fluid
source 222    (e.g., a tank) in the base 18,          and accommodates
various extension conditions of the handle 26 relative to
the saddle block 62.
[0057]      While the illustrated construction uses the
shipper shaft    66 to drive rotation of the reel 78,                   and to
facilitate movement of fluid from the fluid source 222 to
the tilt actuators    34,  in some constructions an
independent system     (e.g., coupled to the boom 22 or
elsewhere) drives rotation of the reel          78 instead.               The
independent system may be,      for example, a constant
tension/torque motor, controlled stepper motor, or a
mechanical tensioning system that provides a generally
constant tension on the fourth set of conduits 238,                       and
may be used, for example, to fine-tune and maintain a
constant desired sag.
[0058]      Overall, the reel system 74 allows routing of
hydraulic fluid from the base 18 to various components of
the shovel 10,    and in particular the tilt actuators 34,                         so
that hydraulic fluid is delivered during both
translational motion and rotational motion of the handle
26,  and so that a tilting dipper 30      can be used on the
shovel 10.     The reel system 74 advantageously is disposed
within the boom 22 to provide space savings and inhibit
                                         9754337_1 (GHMatters) P97447.AU.2 4/12/17

damage to the reel  78 during use.  The reel          system 74 is
accessible, with the reel 78 configured to pivot away from
the boom so that repairs and/or replacement of reel system
74 components can advantageously take place with ease.
[0059]  Although the invention has been described in detail
with reference to certain preferred embodiments,
variations and modifications exist within the scope and
spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1.   A mining machine comprising:
     a boom having an interior chamber;
     a handle slidably coupled to the boom;         and
     a reel system disposed at least partially within the
