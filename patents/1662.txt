The invention is described in the following statement:
                                       1

                                      2
              CONTROL APPARATUS FOR A WINDOW BLIND
       The disclosure relates to a control apparatus for a
   windowblind, andmore particularly to a control apparatus
   for controlling rotation of a shaft of a window blind.
 5     A conventional safety window blind is         designed to have
   a pulling cord looped on and rotating a rotary member for
   rolling a curtain.       When an excess downward pulling force
   is  applied      to  the   pulling    cord   in case   a child  is
   accidentally entangled by the cord, the rotary member is
10 drawn downward and the pulling cord is disengaged therefrom
   to quickly release the child. Referring to FIGS.             1 and
   2, a safety control device as disclosed in WO 2015/174827
   includes a housing 91, a roller 92 disposed within the
   housing 91,     a slider 93 disposed between a rear side wall
15 of the housing 91 and the roller          92 and biased forwardly
   by a spring 94 to urge the roller 92 forwardly to press
   against a support member 95,         and a pulling cord 96 looped
   on the roller      92 to be pulled to rotate the roller      92 so
   as to transmit a torque to rotate a shaft 97 through the
20 support member 95 for rolling a curtain.           Once an excess
   downwardpullingforceis applied to the cord96, the roller
   92 is drawn out of the housing 91 and the cord 96 is disengaged
   from the roller     92 so as to prevent children from accidental
   strangulation.
25     Since the roller 92 is supported resiliently by the
   support member 95 and the slider 93 at front and rear sides
   with the resilient       force of the spring 94,    and since both

                                                     3
   the support member 95 and the slider 93 are movable in
   a front-and-rear direction relative to the housing 91,
   a tolerance connection between the housing 91 and each
   of the support member 95 and the slider 93 is required,
 5 which results in unsteady engagement between the roller
   92 and each of the support member 95 and the slider 93,
   thus adversely affecting                      the transmission of the torque
   and the control of the roller                           92.
         Other safety          control        apparatus for a window blind,               such
10 as that     disclosedin            EP 1319793, U.S.          PatentNo.        8,336,598,
   US    2011/0048657             or     US    2012/0017399,          suffers      from      the
   aforesaid drawback as well.
         Therefore,          an object of the disclosure                      is to provide
   a control apparatus                   that can alleviate at least one of
15 the drawbacks of the prior art.
         According to the disclosure,                      the control        apparatus for
   controlling            rotation          of    a    shaft    about       an   axis    in    a
   front-and-rear direction, includes a housing including
   front     and rear        housing mounts which are spaced apart from
20 each      other      in     the     front-and-rear           direction,         a  roller
   interposed between the front                        and rear     housing mounts and
   releasably and rotatably connected to the rear housing
   mount to be rotatable relative to the housing about the
   axis, an endless operating cord looped on the roller to
25 be operated to rotate the                        roller about the axis, and a
   coupling mechanism rotatably                         disposed between the front
   housing mount and the roller.                        The coupling mechanism has

                                     4
   a front coupling member which is         disposed to be coupled
   with and rotate the shaft, a rear coupling member which
   is    releasably    connected   to  the  roller   by  a   rearward
   resilient    force along the axis tobe rotatedwith the roller,
 5 and which is movable along the axis and non-rotatable about
   the axis relative to the front coupling member so as to
   synchronously rotate the front coupling member when being
   rotated through the rotation of the roller,       and a resilient
   member which is      disposed to apply the rearward resilient
10 force to the rear coupling member. The coupling mechanism
   is configured such that the roller is movable relative
   to the housing, upon an excess downward pulling force
   applied to the operating cord,        from a driving position,
   where the roller     is disposed within the housing and rotated
15 by pulling the operating cord so as to rotate the coupling
   mechanism and the shaft, to a releasing position, where
   the rear coupling member is moved forwardly toward the
   front coupling member against the rearward resilient            force
   to release connection of the roller       with the rear coupling
20 member and the rear housing mount so as to permit removal
   of the roller from the housing.

   which is tapered rearwardly along the axis (X) tobe retained
   in   the concavity 521 of the front               connecting portion            52,
   and a plurality        of driven protrusions               724 each of which
   extends        radially     and    outwardly          from        the     retained
 5 protrusion       723 to be retained        in   a respective            one of the
   indentations        522.   Through     the    retention          of the driven
   protrusions       724 in   the respective          indentations           522,  the
   rear     coupling member 72 is      synchronously rotated                 with the
   roller 5.
10       The front connecting section 722 has a tubular hole
   725 which extends rearwardly from a front                     end face thereof
   and which has a square cross-section                    in    this     embodiment
   to permit fitting        and synchronously rotatable                   engagement
   with the stem portion        712.  Alternatively,             the tubular      hole
15 725 may have other non-circular cross-section, such as
   triangular,        pentagonal,       hexagonal,             oval,        etc.   The
   resilientmember 73 is acompression springwhichis                           sleeved
   around the stemportion 712 andwhich has two ends abutting
   against      the shoulder abutment 714 and the front                      end face
20 of the front connecting section 722 to apply a rearward
   resilient force along the axis                 (X) to the rear coupling
   member 72 relative to the front coupling member 71. The
   resilient member 73          may be made from rubber.
         The head portion      713 is  hexagonal in           cross-section        and
25 isengagedwiththe          connectinghole 901 to transmita                   torque
   thereto.      The head portion      713 and the connecting hole 901
   may      be    triangular,     square,        pentagonal            or    oval   in

       The suspending unit 8 includes a holding member 81 which
   is pivotably connected to the neck portion 54 to be disposed
   between the rear connecting portion 53 and the roller         body
 5 51,  and a rope 83 which is   connected between the holding
   member 81 and the rear housing mount 4 through a fastener
   82.  In this embodiment, the holding member 81 is a flat
   plate,   and has a circular pivot hole 811 dimensioned to
   be pivotably retained on the neck portion 54 and between
10 the rear connecting portion 53 and the roller body 51.
       With reference to FIGS.    5, 6,   8 and 9,   during assembly
   of the control apparatus,    the housing 2 is       secured on the
   mount 1 that is   screwed on a ceiling through the main and
   auxiliaryprotrusions 413, 414.       Firstly,    as shown in FIGS.
15 8 and 9, the main protrusion 413 and the retaining portions
   418 of the auxiliary protrusions 414 are respectively
   engaged in the main and auxiliary holes 11,             12 to have
   the step portions 419 abut against the mount 1. The housing
   2 is then moved downwardly to the state shown in FIGS.
20 5 such that the vertical portion 417 is retained on a lower
   edge of the main hole 11    (as shown in       FIG.  6) to prevent
   movement of the control apparatus in          the front-and-rear
   direction, and that the step portions 419 respectively
   abut against upper edges of the auxiliary holes 12              (as
25 shown in FIG. 9) topreventmovement of the control apparatus
   in the up-and-down direction. Thus, the housing 2 is firmly
   secured to the mount 1. The main protrusion 413 may also

                                     12
   have a step portion to be retained on an upper edge of
   the locking portion 111 of the main hole 11 to provide
   firmer retention of the housing 2.
       Moreover,   by means of the main and auxiliary holes 11,
 5 12,  the mount 1 may be rotated about the axis                (X) by 90
   degrees     for being    secured    on   an   upright    wall,    which
   facilitates assembly of the window blind at different
   locations.
       Referring to FIGS.      3, 6,  10 and 11,     in use, by pulling
10 the operatingcord6, the roller          andthe couplingmechanism
   7 are rotated synchronously to rotate the shaft 900 for
   rolling a curtain.      Upon an excess downward pulling force
   applied to the operating cord 6, the roller 5 is moved
   relative to the housing 2 from a driving position                   (see
15 FIG. 6),   where the roller    5 is disposed within the housing
   2,  to a releasing position        (see FIG.     11) . Specifically,
   in the driving position, the roller         5 is sandwiched between
   the rear coupling member 72 and the rear housing mount
   4 such that the rear connecting portion 53 is              releasably
20 and rotatably connected with the recess 412,             and that the
   front connecting portion 52 is in synchronously rotatable
   connection with the coupling mechanism 7 to establish the
   releasable and synchronously rotatable connection of the
   roller 5 to the rear coupling member 72.               Hence, when a
25 user pulls the operating cord 6,          the roller     5 is   rotated
   about    the axis   (X)   to drive     rotation     of  the   coupling
   mechanism 7 so as to rotate the shaft 900 for rolling the

                                   13
   curtain.
        Once an excess downward pulling force is applied to
   the cord 6, such as if a kid plays with the cord 6 and
   gets entangled in     the cord 6 accidentally,      the roller   5
 5 is  pulled downward as shown in FIG.       10 such that the rear
   coupling member 72 is moved forwardly toward the front
   coupling member 71 against the rearward resilient            force
   of the resilient     member 73 to release connection of the
   roller 5 with the rear coupling member 72 and the rear
10 housing mount 4, so as to permit removal of the roller
   5 from the housing 2.   Forward movement of the rear coupling
   member 72 results in a residence for facilitating       downward
   movement of the roller     5 and the cord 6 to be removed from
   the housing 2.     Thereafter,  the roller    5 can be suspended
15 by the suspending unit 8 under the housing 2 to prevent
   injury to the kid. The cord 6 falls down to release the
   kid from entanglement.     The rope 83 of the suspending unit
   8 is designed to have an appropriate length to hold the
   fallen roller    5 and to keep the fallen roller    5 suspended.
20     With such construction of the above embodiment,         in the
   driving position, the roller 5 is supported at a front
   side by the coupling mechanism 7 which is       a moving member,
   and at a rear side by the rear housing mount 4 which is
   afixedmember. Thus, the roller      andthe couplingmechanism
25 7 can be rotated steadily and firmly and is         not affected
   by the pulling force of the cord 6. With engagement of
   the recess 412 of the rear housing mount 4 with the rear

                                 14
  connecting portion 53 of the roller 5, the roller 5 can
  be easily assembled to the rear housing mount 4 without
  the need to have any tolerance therebetween, whichprevents
  wobbling of the roller   5 relative to the rear housing mount
5 4.
