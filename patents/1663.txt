           PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR SEPARATION OF NITROGEN FROM LNG
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
   This disclosure relates to processes and apparatus for the separation of nitrogen
 5 from liquefied natural gas (LNG) - mixtures comprising nitrogen gas and
   low-boiling hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane and butane.
                                    BACKGROUND ART
   Nitrogen is found in many natural gas reservoirs, sometimes at relatively high
10 levels, for example greater than around 5 mol%, which can necessitate removal to
   meet specifications for use as fuel, but often at lower levels not requiring
   removal. As high quality gas fields are depleted, natural gas increasingly needs to
   be sourced from lower quality gas fields, containing higher levels of contaminants
   such as nitrogen.
15 Many natural gas reservoirs are not sufficiently close to gas consumers to make
   pipeline transportation economical and infrastructure has grown worldwide for the
   transportation of gas in liquefied form as LNG. The presence of greater than about
   1 mol% nitrogen in LNG, can lead to auto-stratification and rollover in storage
   tanks, which presents a significant safety concern, and there is therefore a need for
20 efficient techniques for the separation of nitrogen from LNG, even for relatively
   low nitrogen levels.

   For relatively low nitrogen levels of approximately 1 to 2 mol%, nitrogen removal
   from LNG can be achieved by the separation of the nitrogen rich vapour, also
   referred to as "flash gas", which is evolved when the pressure of sub-cooled LNG
   is reduced to the LNG storage tank pressure - which is typically just above
 5 atmospheric pressure. For feed gas nitrogen levels of greater than about 2 mol%
   of nitrogen, a fractionation column is typically employed to achieve separation of
   nitrogen from the LNG, while avoiding excessive flash gas flow rates.
   Fractionation systems used for the separation of nitrogen from liquefied natural
   gas typically incorporate a reboiler to produce stripping vapour, required to
10 reduce the nitrogen level in the LNG product to less than 1 mol%.
   An example of a conventional apparatus for separation of nitrogen from LNG is
   shown in Figure 1.
   A nitrogen-containing LNG feed stream (101) already sub-cooled at elevated
   pressure is further cooled in a reboil heat exchange system (102). The resultant
15 stream (103) is expanded in a hydraulic expansion turbine (104) to give a two
   phase stream (105), which is fed to a fractionation column (106).
   Liquid (140) from the bottom tray (or packed section) of the fractionation column
   is partially vaporised in the reboil heat exchange system (102), to produce
   stripping vapour (141) which is fed to the fractionation column, and thereby also
20 providing refrigeration to further sub-cool the feed stream (101).
   A LNG stream (107) having low nitrogen content is withdrawn from the bottom
   of the fractionation column, and is reduced in pressure across a valve (108) to
   give a two- phase stream (109). The two-phase stream (109) is then passed to a
   vapour-liquid separator (111) to separate a flash gas stream (110) and a low
                                              2
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   pressure LNG stream (112) for storage. The flash gas stream (110) is passed to a
   compressor (134), and a resulting compressed stream (135) is cooled by a heat
   exchanger (136) to give a fuel gas stream (137).
   An overhead vapour stream (113) rich in nitrogen, but with significant methane
 5 content, is withdrawn from the top of the fractionation column (106).
   While low temperature fractionation processes, such as that shown in Figure 1,
   allow a LNG product having a low nitrogen content to be obtained, the nitrogen
   vapour overhead from the fractionation column generally comprises significant
   amounts of methane as the column incorporates no rectification section.         The
10 methane-containing overhead vapour is typically used as fuel gas for power
   generation or to drive compression equipment. However, restrictions exist as to
   the nitrogen content of fuel gas which may be used in gas turbines, particularly
   those derived from aero engines, which can typically burn gases comprising
   up to 10 mol%, or up to 15 mol% nitrogen, and sometimes as high as 20 mol%
15 nitrogen.
   Alternatively, the methane-containing overhead vapour from the fractionation
   column          is sometimes used as part of a refrigeration cycle in processes that
   require methane as a refrigerant. It would be preferable if the methane content of
   the fractionation overhead vapour could be substantially eliminated. There is
20 therefore a need in the art for efficient separation processes that are able to
   separate mixtures of nitrogen and LNG to form a natural gas product that is low
   in nitrogen, and preferably substantially free of nitrogen, and also a nitrogen
   product that is low in hydrocarbons, and preferably substantially free of
   hydrocarbons.

   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   One solution to the issue of high methane content of the overhead vapour
   from the fractionation column would be to feed the overhead vapour to a
   separate nitrogen rejection unit that is able to produce a nitrogen stream with
   low methane content suitable for venting to the atmosphere and a methane rich
 5 stream suitable for use as fuel gas. In addition to compression and heat exchange
   equipment, this would require additional separation equipment including one or
   more vapour/liquid separators and fractionation columns.

   not constitute an admission that the prior art forms a part of the common general
10 knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
                                          SUMMARY
   The process and apparatus of the present invention avoids the necessity for a
   nitrogen rejection unit by producing an overhead vapour stream from the LNG
15 fractionation that has a suitable composition (i.e. substantially devoid of
   hydrocarbons) for venting to the atmosphere.
   By recycling a portion of the nitrogen-containing overhead vapour stream from
   the fractionation column it has surprisingly been found that an improvement in
   separation may be obtained. More specifically, the recycled portion may be used
20 as a nitrogen-rich reflux stream, which nitrogen-rich reflux stream may be
   efficiently cooled by heat exchange with one or more streams withdrawn from
   the fractionation, particularly against evaporating methane rich liquid streams.
   By avoiding a separate nitrogen rejection unit, thermodynamic losses are
                                               4
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   reduced and process efficiency is increased, leading to greater LNG production
   with lower power consumption, as well as improved separation in the
   fractionation system. The process of this invention also avoids the operating
   complexity of a separate nitrogen rejection unit and is robust to changes in feed
 5 composition.
   In accordance with the present disclosure, there is provided a process for the
   separation of nitrogen from a liquid feed comprising liquefied natural gas and
   nitrogen, the process comprising the steps of:
   (i) cooling the feed and passing the feed to a fractionation column;
10 (ii)                         withdrawing from the fractionation column an overhead
   vapour stream having an enriched nitrogen content, and a liquid stream
   having a reduced nitrogen content;
   (iii)                        dividing the overhead vapour stream from step (ii) into at
   least first and second overhead streams;
15 (iv)                         compressing, cooling and at least partially condensing at
   least the first overhead stream from step (iii); and
   (v)                          expanding the stream from step (iv) and passing the
   expanded stream to the fractionation column as reflux,
   wherein cooling in step (iv) is provided, at least in part, by heat exchange
20 with at least a portion of the liquid stream withdrawn from the fractionation
   column, and wherein at least a portion of the condensed stream withdrawn
   from the fractionation column is expanded before being passed in heat
   exchange with the compressed first overhead vapour stream.
   By recycling a portion of the overhead vapour stream to the fractionation as
                                                     5
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   reflux, the process of the present invention adds a rectification section to the
   fractionation column, which enables an overhead stream to be obtained from the
   fractionation column that is substantially devoid of hydrocarbons. For example,
   the process of the present invention is capable of producing an overhead stream
 5 from the fractionation column that comprises less than 2 mol% methane, less
   than 1 mol% methane, less than 0.5 mol% methane, and potentially as low as
   0. 1 mol% methane.
   Furthermore, by cooling and at least partially condensing the compressed first
   overhead stream in heat exchange with one or more streams from the
10 fractionation column, the heat integration of the process is improved, thereby
   reducing energy demands.
   The proportion of the overhead vapour stream from step (ii) that is recycled to
   the column as reflux in steps (iii) to (v) is preferably in the range of from 20 to
   80 mol% of the total overhead vapour stream, more preferably 30 to 70 mol%,
15 and most preferably 40 to 60 mol% of the total overhead vapour stream from the
   fractionation column. However, the exact amount of reflux depends on the
   nitrogen content of the feed and overhead stream purity. An advantage of the
   present invention is that liquid feeds comprising various quantities of nitrogen
   can be processed while maintaining methane content of the overhead stream
20 simply by varying the proportion of the overhead vapour stream that is
   recycled to the column as reflux.
   As used herein, the expression "one or more streams from the fractionation
   column" refers to any liquid or gas from the fractionation column that can be
   used as a source of refrigeration to cool a compressed overhead stream from step
                                                6
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   (iv). Thus, the expression may refer to overhead vapour withdrawn from the top
   of the fractionation column. The expression may also refer to the liquid
   stream withdrawn from the bottom of the fractionation column. The
   expression may further refer to a side stream obtained from an intermediate
 5 stage of the column. Still further, the expression may refer to liquid and/or
   vapour within the column where one or more heat exchange steps takes place
   within the column.
   The LNG feed may consist of, or consist substantially of, methane. The feed
   may also comprise small amounts of other hydrocarbons such as, for example,
10 ethane, propane, butane and/or heavier hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons in the
   LNG feed usually comprise greater than 80 mol% methane, more typically
   greater than 85 mol% methane, and potentially up to near 100% methane. The
   balance of the LNG feed may comprise ethane, propane, butane and/or heavier
   hydrocarbons. Preferably the total content of ethane and/or propane and/or
15 heavier hydrocarbons in the LNG feed is less than 20 mol%, more preferably
   less than 10 mol%, and most preferably less than 5 mol%. The total content of
   propane and/or heavier hydrocarbons in the LNG feed is preferably less than 10
   mol%, more preferably less than 5 mol%, and most preferably less than 2 mol%.
   The total content of hydrocarbons heavier than propane in the LNG feed is
20 preferably less than 5 mol%, more preferably less than 2 mol% and most
   preferably less than 1 mol%.
   The process of the present invention may be used in particular for the separation
   of nitrogen from LNG feeds that comprise up to 40 mol% nitrogen. For instance,
   the feed may comprise up to 30 mol% nitrogen, up to 20 mol% nitrogen
                                              7
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   or up to 15 mol% nitrogen. Preferably, the feed comprises at least 1 mol%
   nitrogen, for example at least 2 mol% nitrogen, possibly 5 mol% nitrogen, or at
   least 10 mol% nitrogen.
   The present invention is particularly applicable to the separation of nitrogen
 5 from feeds that comprise or consist of liquefied natural gas.
   The fractionation column is typically operated in a pressure range of from 100 to
   500 kPa, more preferably 100 to 300 kPa, and most preferably 120 to 200 kPa.
   For example, suitable operating pressures for the fractionation column include
   130 kPa, 140 kPa, 150 kPa, 160 kPa, 170 kPa, 180 kPa and 190 kPa.               The
10 operating temperature of the fractionation column is dependent on the
   operating pressure, but the overhead temperature is generally in the range -175
   'C to -190 'C and the bottom liquid temperature is generally in the range -135
   'C to -160'C.
   It will be appreciated that, as used herein, expressions such as "an overhead
15 vapour stream having an enriched nitrogen content" or "a liquid stream having a
   reduced nitrogen content" are intended to refer to the relative nitrogen content of
   the respective stream when compared with the nitrogen content of the feed.
   Thus, an overhead vapour stream having an enriched nitrogen content is one that
   comprises a higher mole fraction of nitrogen than that of the feed.    Similarly, a
20 liquid stream having reduced nitrogen content is one that comprises a lower
   mole fraction of nitrogen than that of the feed.
   Generally, the feed is supplied to the fractionation column at or around the
   operating temperature and pressure of the column. Suitable operating
   temperatures and pressures for the fractionation column are discussed above. In
                                              8
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   most cases, the LNG feed will be supplied at a pressure significantly higher than
   the operating pressure of the fractionation column. For example, a liquefied
   natural gas feed would typically have a pressure in the range of from 3,000 to
   10,000 kPa. In most cases it is therefore necessary to expand the cooled feed to
 5 column pressure. For example, the feed may be expanded to column pressure
   across an expansion valve or by way of an expansion turbine. Expansion
   turbines have the benefit of extracting work from the process under near
   isentropic conditions and reducing the amount of upstream cooling of the feed
   LNG that is necessary, and thus providing a reduction in energy requirements in
10 upstream liquefaction plant.
   The cooled and expanded feed is preferably supplied to the fractionation column
   as a two-phase vapour-liquid mixture. More preferably, the two-phase mixture
   has a vapour fraction of from 1 to 40 mol%, more preferably 2 to 20 mol%, and
   most preferably from 3 to 10 mol%, for example 5 to 8 mol%.
15 In one embodiment, cooling in step (iv) is provided, at least in part, by heat
   exchange with at least a portion of the overhead vapour stream withdrawn
   from the fractionation column.
   In a further embodiment, cooling in step (iv) is provided, at least in part, by heat
   exchange with at least a portion of the liquid product stream withdrawn
20 from the fractionation column. The portion of the liquid product stream passed
   in heat exchange with the compressed first overhead vapour stream in step (iv)
   may optionally be expanded first, in order to provide further cooling.
   Heat to the fractionation column is preferably provided, at least in part by a
   reboiler. Heated vapour from the reboiler is fed back to the fractionation column
                                              9
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   to strip nitrogen from the descending LNG in the column.
   Where the fractionation column comprises a reboiler, cooling in step (iv) may be
   provided, at least in part, by heat exchange with a stream from the fractionation
   column in the reboiler.
 5 The type of reboiler that may be used is not limited, and a person of skill in the
   art can select suitable reboiler systems. For example, thermosyphon, forced
   circulation, and kettle reboilers may be used in the process of the invention.
   The fractionation column may comprise an internal reboiler, located within the
   column, or an external reboiler located outside the fractionation column.
10 Where an internal reboiler is used, the reboiler is preferably immersed in boiling
   liquid at the bottom of the fractionation column. Where an external reboiler is
   used, a liquid stream is withdrawn from the column and fed to the reboiler to
   produce a heated vapour stream, which is returned to the column as stripping
   vapour.
15 In preferred embodiments, the bulk of the condensing duty required to cool and
   at least partially condense the compressed overhead stream from step (iv) is
   provided by heat exchange with one or more evaporating methane-rich liquids,
   which may be selected from the liquid product stream withdrawn from the
   fractionation column and/or boiling liquid at the bottom of the fractionation
20 column and/or a liquid side-stream that is withdrawn from the column and fed to
   a column-side reboiler.
   In another embodiment, further cooling of the first overhead stream from step
   (iii) may be provided by heat exchange with the LNG feed.
                                              10
   8267781_1(GHMatters) P90553.AU

   In another embodiment, heat exchange with a liquid stream from the
   fractionation column in the reboiler may be used to provide cooling of the feed
   in step (i).
   The reflux feed is fed to the top stage of the fractionation column in step (v) to
 5 provide rectification of the column vapour, and thereby improve separation,
   reducing methane content of the column overhead vapour. The reflux stream is
   expanded before being fed to the fractionation column, for example using an
   expansion valve or an expansion turbine.
   The liquid stream withdrawn from the fractionation column in step (ii) is
10 preferably expanded to form a two-phase vapour-liquid stream. As noted above,
   this expanded stream, or a portion thereof, may be used to provide cooling in
   step (iv). The two-phase stream is then passed to a vapour-liquid separator to
   separate a low pressure liquid hydrocarbon stream substantially free of nitrogen,
   and a hydrocarbon vapour stream.
15 Preferably, the hydrocarbon vapour stream contains less than about 15 mol%
   nitrogen, and more preferably less than about 10 mol% nitrogen. The
   hydrocarbon vapour stream may advantageously be compressed and cooled to
   form a fuel gas product. Alternatively, this stream may be used as part of a
   refrigeration cycle.
20 In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an
   apparatus for the separation of nitrogen from a feed comprising liquefied natural
   gas and nitrogen, the apparatus comprising:
             (i)                means for cooling and expanding the feed;

   condensing the compressed stream from step (v) comprises a heat exchanger
   for heat exchange with at least a portion of the condensed stream withdrawn
   from the column; and the apparatus further comprises an expander to expand
20 the condensed stream withdrawn from the column, or a portion thereof, before
   heat exchange with the compressed stream from step (v).
   In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus of the invention comprises a heat
   exchanger for cooling and condensing at least one stream from step (v) in heat
   exchange with at least a portion of the overhead vapour stream withdrawn from
                                                       12

   comprises a heat exchanger for cooling and condensing at least one stream
   from step (v) in heat exchange with at least a portion of the condensed stream
 5 withdrawn from the column.
   The apparatus may further comprise an expander to expand the condensed
   stream withdrawn from the column, or a portion thereof, before heat exchange
   with the at least one stream from step (v).
   The fractionation column may comprise one or more reboilers, which may be

   particularly limited, and thermosiphon, forced-circulation, and kettle reboilers
   are examples of reboiler types that are compatible with the apparatus of the
   invention.
   Where the fractionation column comprises a reboiler, the reboiler may be a heat

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 5 In the following detailed description, reference is made to accompanying
   drawings which form a part of the detailed description. The illustrative
   embodiments described in the detailed description, depicted in the drawings and
   defined in the claims, are not intended to be limiting. Other embodiments may be

   drawings can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated and designed in a
   wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated in this
   disclosure.
15 In the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 2, a sub-cooled liquid feed
   stream (201) comprising LNG and nitrogen is further cooled in reboil heat
   exchange system (202), to give stream (203). Stream (203) is expanded in
   hydraulic expansion turbine (204) to give a two-phase stream (205) which is fed
   to the fractionation column (206).
20 A liquid stream (240) is removed from the bottom tray (or packed section)
   of the fractionation column below the two-phase feed stream (205) and is partially
   vaporised to produce stripping vapour (241) in reboil heat exchange system (202),
   providing refrigeration to further sub-cool the feed stream (201) and condense
   nitrogen rich reflux stream (223).

   Nitrogen rich overhead vapour (213) is removed from the fractionation column
   (206) and passed to a heat exchange system (214) where it is warmed to a suitable
   temperature (215) for atmospheric venting (217) downstream of a pressure control
   valve (216).
 5 A portion (218) of the nitrogen rich overhead vapour (213) from the fractionation
   column is compressed in a compression system (219) to give a compressed
   stream (220). Compression system (219) includes inter-stage cooling which
   is not shown. The compressed stream (220) is then cooled (typically in heat
   exchange against air or water) in a cooler (221) to give a high pressure nitrogen
10 rich stream (222). The high pressure nitrogen rich stream (222) is further cooled
   in heat exchange systems (214) and (202) to give a liquid stream (224) which is
   further sub-cooled in the heat exchange system (214) to provide a sub-cooled
   liquid stream (225).
   The sub-cooled liquid stream (225) is let down to fractionation column pressure
15 across a valve (226) to give a two phase stream (227) which is supplied as
   reflux to the fractionation column (206).
   A LNG stream (207), with low nitrogen content, is removed from the
   fractionation column (206), and is let down to storage pressure across a valve
   (208) to give a two-phase stream (209). The two-phase stream (209) is then
20 passed to a vapour-liquid separator (211) and a flash gas stream (210) and a low
   pressure LNG product stream (212) for storage are obtained. The flash gas stream
   (210) is compressed using a compressor (234), giving a stream (235), which is
   cooled (typically in heat exchange against air or water) in a cooler (236) to give a
   fuel gas stream (237). In this embodiment of the invention, the necessary
25 refrigeration to cool and sub-cool the nitrogen rich reflux stream (222) to form the
                                             16

   stream (225) is provided by heat exchange with the overhead vapour (213) from
   the fractionation column (206) and the liquid stream (240) that is fed to the reboil
   heat exchange system (202).
   The embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 3 differs from that of Figure 2
 5 by way of the heat exchange systems that are employed to provide the
   reflux stream to the fractionation column (306). Thus, a sub-cooled liquid feed
   stream (301) comprising LNG and nitrogen is further cooled in a reboil heat
   exchange system (302), to give a stream (303). Stream (303) is expanded in
   hydraulic expansion turbine (304) to give a two- phase stream (305) which is fed
10 to the fractionation column (306).
   A liquid stream (340) is removed from the bottom tray (or packed section) of the
   fractionation column (306) below the two-phase feed stream (305) and is partially
   vaporised to produce stripping vapour (341) in the reboil heat exchange system
   (302), which provides refrigeration to further sub-cool the feed stream (301).
15 Nitrogen rich overhead vapour (313) from the fractionation column (206) passes
   to a heat exchange system (314) where it is warmed to a suitable temperature
   (315) for atmospheric venting (317) downstream of pressure control valve (316).
   A portion (318) of the nitrogen rich overhead vapour (313) from the fractionation
   column is compressed in a compression system (319) to give a compressed stream
20 (320). The compression system (319) includes inter-stage cooling which is not
   shown. The compressed stream (320) is then cooled (typically in heat exchange
   against air or water) in a cooler (321) to give a high pressure nitrogen rich stream
   (322). The high pressure nitrogen rich stream (322) is further cooled and sub
   cooled in the heat exchange system (314) to provide a sub-cooled liquid stream
25 (325).

   The sub-cooled liquid stream (325) is let down to fractionation column pressure
    across a valve (326) to give a two phase stream (327) which is supplied as reflux
   to the fractionation column (206).
   A LNG stream (307), with low nitrogen content, is removed from the
 5  fractionation column (306). A portion (328) of the stream (307) is let down to
   just above storage pressure
    across a valve (330) to produce a two-phase stream (331), which is vaporised to
   provide refrigeration in the heat exchange system (314). A remaining portion
    (329) of the stream (307) is let down to storage pressure across a valve (308) to
10 give a two-phase stream (333). The stream (332) resulting from vaporisation
    of the stream (331) in the heat exchange system (314) is combined with the
    stream (333) to give a two-phase stream (309). The two-phase stream (309) is
   then passed to a vapour-liquid separator (311) to separate a flash gas stream (310)
    and a low pressure LNG product stream (312) for storage. The flash gas stream
15  (310) is compressed by means of a compressor (334), giving a stream (335),
   which is cooled (typically in heat exchange against air or water) in a cooler (336)
   to give a fuel gas stream (337).

   It will be noted that the prior art process produces an overhead vapour stream
   (113) from the fractionation column that comprises a significant amount of
   methane (37 mol%), and which requires further processing to separate the
 5 remaining nitrogen. This is in contrast with the process of the present invention in
   which the overhead vapour stream (113) is substantially free of methane (see
   below).

   It will be noted that the process of the present invention shown in Figure 2 gives
   rise to a nitrogen rich overhead vapour stream (213) which comprises 99.5 mol%
   of nitrogen, and only 0.5 mol% methane (in comparison with 63 mol% nitrogen
   and 37 mol% methane in the overhead stream (213) in Example 1). This is
 5 reflected in the amount of hydrocarbon product (212) obtained, which represents
   87.1 mol% of the total feed, compared with only 81.9 mol% in Example 1.
   The improved separation obtained by the process of the present invention can be
   attributed to the provision of the low temperature nitrogen rich reflux stream
   (227), which is obtained at -191.6 'C and supplied to the column at a temperature
10 25 'C below the feed (205) to the column. The rectification of column vapour
   provided by this nitrogen rich reflux stream allows the temperature differential
   between the overhead vapour stream (213) and the liquid hydrocarbon stream
   (207) to be increased to 35.3 'C, and the temperature differential between the
   nitrogen rich overhead vapour stream (213) and the feed (205) to the column to be
15 increased to 23.3 'C, reflective of the increased purity of the nitrogen rich
   overhead vapour stream (213). In Example 1, in contrast, where no nitrogen rich
   reflux stream is provided, the temperature differential between the column
   overhead vapour stream (213) and the liquid hydrocarbon stream (207) is only
   10.3 'C, and the temperature differential between the column overhead vapour
20 stream (213) and the feed (205) to the column is negligible at 0.3 'C, reflective of
   much poorer separation.

   The process of the present invention shown in Figure 3 also gives rise to an
   nitrogen rich overhead vapour stream (313) which comprises 99.5 mol% of
   nitrogen, and only 0.5 mol% methane (in comparison with 63 mol% nitrogen and
 5 37 mol% methane in the overhead stream (313) in Example 1).
   As in Example 2, the improved separation obtained by the process is
   attributable to rectification of the column vapour by the low temperature nitrogen
   rich reflux stream (327), which is obtained at -191.6 'C and supplied to the
   column at a temperature 24.20 C below the feed (205) to the column. This in turn,
10 means that the temperature differential between the nitrogen rich overhead
   vapour stream (313) and the liquid hydrocarbon stream (307) is increased to
            0
   33.6       C, and the temperature differential between the nitrogen rich overhead
   vapour stream (313) and the feed (205) to the column is increased to 23.5 'C,
   reflecting the increased purity of the nitrogen rich overhead vapour stram.
15 In this Example, refrigeration to cool the reflux stream (322) is provided by
   expanding a portion (328) of the liquid hydrocarbon stream (307).                  As a result,

   the flash gas flow is higher in this embodiment at 13265 kg/h compared with 6729
   kg/h in Example 2, but as the full reboil duty in exchanger (202) is used to sub
   cool the feed LNG, the feed temperature from the liquefaction process can be
   higher, reducing load on the upstream liquefaction refrigeration system.
 5 It will additionally be understood that the LNG feed used in the process of the
   present invention may undergo additional separation and/or conditioning.
   Examples of such additional processes include one or more of the following:
   " Separation of vapour formed on expansion of the LNG feed stream. The
        separated vapour may, in a preferred example, then be introduced as a separate
10      feed to the fractionation column, and more preferably to the fractionation
        column above the main feed;
   " Heating a portion of the LNG feed stream and introducing it as a separate feed
        to the fractionation column, preferably above the main feed. The portion of
        the stream is preferably heated by way of a well integrated heat exchange

        operation.
20 It will also be understood that the fractionation column, as described in the
   process of the present invention, may additionally comprise or incorporate a side
   condenser system. In a preferred example, a vapour side draw is taken from an
   intermediate point, preferably above the main LNG feed to the fractionation
   column. In the same way that nitrogen rich reflux is generated from the overhead
25 vapour in the embodiments of the invention described above, the vapour side

   draw is warmed in a heat exchange operation; compressed and cooled; condensed
   primarily against an evaporating liquid stream rich in methane and sub-cooled
   against cold vapour in a heat exchange operation; expanded to the fractionation
   column pressure; and returned to the fractionation column as an intermediate two
 5 phase feed.
   It is believed that the incorporation of a side condenser system reduces the
   required overhead reflux flow. As the vapour side draw comprises a mixture of
   methane and nitrogen, it can be condensed against methane rich liquid streams at
   a lower pressure than can the overhead stream from the fractionation column,
10 which is purer in nitrogen. As a large proportion of the liquid required for
   rectification can be met by the side condenser system, compression power
   requirements overall can be reduced.
   Variations and modifications may be made to the parts previously described
   without departing from the spirit or ambit of the disclosure.
