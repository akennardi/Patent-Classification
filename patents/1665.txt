[0001]       This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014203987,
filed on 3 January 2014, which claims priority to and benefit of U.S. Provisional Application

                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       The invention provides novel methods and kits for isolating microvesicles from a
biological sample and for extracting nucleic acids from the microvesicles.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0003]       Membrane vesicles that are shed by cells and are < 0.8pmrn in diameter are referred
collectively as microvesicles. Microvesicles from various cell sources have been extensively
studied with respect to protein and lipid content. Recently, microvesicles have been found to
also contain both DNA and RNA, including genomic DNA, cDNA, mitochondrial DNA,
microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA).
[0004]       Due to the genetic and proteomic information contained in microvesicles shed by
cells, current research is directed at utilizing microvesicles to gain further insight into the status
of these cells, for example, disease state or predisposition for a disease. Accordingly, there is a
need for methods of isolating microvesicles from biological samples and methods of extracting
high quality nucleic acids for accurate diagnosis of medical conditions and diseases.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]       The present invention provides methods and kits for isolating microvesicles by
capturing the microvesicles to a surface and subsequently lysing the microvesicles to release the
nucleic acids contained therein. In some embodiments, the methods and kits isolate and extract
the RNA from the microvesicle fraction. These methods and kits are referred to herein as
EXO50 or EXO50-based methods and/or kits. In some embodiments, the methods and kits
isolate and extract the DNA from the microvesicle fraction. The RNA can then be processed for
further analysis. These methods and kits are referred to herein as
                                                   1

EX052 or EX052-based methods and/or kits, and can include derivatives of the EX052
methods and/or kits, referred to herein as EX052.2. The DNA can then be processed for
further analysis.
[0006]          The present invention also provides methods and kits for isolating
microvesicles by capturing the microvesicles to a surface and subsequently eluting the
microvesicles from the capture surface. These methods and kits are referred to herein as
EXO5 1. The microvesicles can then be processed for further analysis.
[00071          Previous procedures used to isolate microvesicle fractions and extract nucleic
acids from the microvesicle fraction of a biological sample relied on the use of
ultracentrifugation, e.g., spinning at less than 10,000 xg for 1-3 hrs, followed by removal of
the supernatant, washing the pellet, lysing the pellet and purifying the nucleic acids, e.g.,
RNA on a column. These previous methods demonstrated several disadvantages such as
being slow, tedious, subject to variability between batches, and not suited for scalability.
The methods and kits for isolation and extraction overcome these disadvantages and provide
a spin-based column for isolation and extraction that is fast, robust and easily scalable to
large volumes.
[0008]          The methods and kits isolate and extract RNA from a biological sample
using the following the general procedure, which is referred to herein as "EXO50." First,
the microvesicle fraction is bound to a membrane filter, and the filter is washed. Then, a
reagent is used to perform on-membrane lysis and release of the RNA. Chloroform
extraction is then performed using PLG tubes, followed by ethanol conditioning. The RNA
is then bound to a silica column, washed and then eluted. The RNA can then be processed
for further analysis.
[0009]          The membranes used in the EXO50 methods and kits have large pores and,
overall, are positively charged. In some embodiments, more than one membrane is used in
the EXO50 methods and kits, for example, two or more membranes are used. In some
embodiments, three membranes are used. In some embodiments, more than three
membranes are used. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is a different type of
membrane. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is the same type of membrane.
In some embodiments, the layers of membranes are a combination of at least two different
types of membranes. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of a
different material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of the same
                                                 2

material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is charged. In some embodiments,
at least one layer is not charged. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the
same charge. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the same charge. In some
embodiments, each layer of membrane has a different charge.
[0010]          In some embodiments, the membrane or at least one layer of membrane is a
positively charged membrane. In some embodiments, the capture surface or at least one
layer is a regenerated cellulose, strong basic anion exchanger ("RC/SBAE") membrane,
which is a positively charged membrane and is an anion exchanger with quaternary amines.
For example, the RC/SBAE membrane is functionalized with quaternary ammonium, R
CH 2-N*(CH 3)3 . In some embodiments, the membrane has a pore size that is at least 3 um.
[0011]          The number of membranes used in the EXO50 methods and kits correlates
with the total volume of sample that can be analyzed at one time. The number of layers and
the capacity, e.g., binding capacity, flowthrough rate or other measurement, of each layer
used in the methods and kits affects the total volume of sample size that can be used. Where
a layer or each layer has a higher binding capacity, more layers can be used in the methods
and/or kits, and where a layer or each layer has a lower binding capacity, few layers can be
used in the methods and/or kits. Furthermore, the viscosity and composition of the sample
also affects the total volume of sample size that can be used. For example, in some
embodiments where the sample is plasma, about 1 ml of samples is processed for each layer
of membrane used in the EXO50 methods and kits.
[0012]          In some embodiments, the agent used for on-membrane lysis is QIAzol. In
some embodiments, the QIAzol is used at a volume of about 700 ul.
[00131          The methods and kits isolate and extract DNA from a biological sample
using the following the general procedure, which is referred to herein as "EX052." First,
the microvesicle fraction is bound to a membrane filter, and the filter is washed. Then, a
reagent is used to perform on-membrane lysis and release of the nucleic acids, e.g., RNA.
Ethanol precipitation is then performed, followed by lysis and protease digestion. The DNA
is then bound to a silica column, washed and then eluted. The DNA can then be processed
for further analysis.
[0014]          The membranes used in the EX052 methods and kits have large pores and,
overall, are positively charged. In some embodiments, more than one membrane is used in
the EX052 methods and kits, for example, two or more membranes are used. In some
                                                3

embodiments, three membranes are used. In some embodiments, more than three
membranes are used. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is a different type of
membrane. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is the same type of membrane.
In some embodiments, the layers of membranes are a combination of at least two different
types of membranes. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of a
different material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of the same
material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is charged. In some embodiments,
at least one layer is not charged. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the
same charge. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the same charge. In some
embodiments, each layer of membrane has a different charge.
[00151          In some embodiments, the membrane or at least one layer of membrane is a
positively charged membrane. In some embodiments, the capture surface or at least one
layer is a regenerated cellulose, strong basic anion exchanger ("RC/SBAE") membrane,
which is a positively charged membrane and is an anion exchanger with quaternary amines.
For example, the RC/SBAE membrane is functionalized with quaternary ammonium, R
CH 2-N*(CH 3)3 . In some embodiments, the membrane has a pore size that is at least 3 um.
[00161          The number of membranes used in the EX052 methods and kits correlates

the capacity, e.g., binding capacity, flowthrough rate or other measurement, of each layer
used in the methods and kits affects the total volume of sample size that can be used. Where
a layer or each layer has a higher binding capacity, more layers can be used in the methods
and/or kits, and where a layer or each layer has a lower binding capacity, few layers can be
used in the methods and/or kits. Furthermore, the viscosity and composition of the sample
also affects the total volume of sample size that can be used. For example, in some
embodiments where the sample is plasma, about 1 ml of samples is processed for each layer
of membrane used in the EX052 methods and kits.
[00171          In some embodiments, the agent used for on-membrane lysis is QIAzol. In
some embodiments, the QIAzol is used at a volume of about 700 ul.
[00181          The membranes used in the EXO51 methods and kits have large pores and,

the EXO51 methods and kits, for example, two or more membranes are used. In some
embodiments, three membranes are used. In some embodiments, more than three
                                                4

membranes are used. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is a different type of
membrane. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is the same type of membrane.
In some embodiments, the layers of membranes are a combination of at least two different
types of membranes. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of a
different material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of the same
material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is charged. In some embodiments,
at least one layer is not charged. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the

[0019]          In some embodiments, the membrane or at least one layer of membrane is a

some embodiments, the QIAzol is used at a volume of about 700 ul.
[0022]          Purification of the microvesicle fraction in any of these methods and/or kits
is performed using ion exchange techniques. In some embodiments, the ion exchange
technique is a technique selected from those shown in the working examples provided
herein.
                                                5

[00231          In one aspect, the method for extracting nucleic acids from a biological
sample comprises (a) providing a biological sample; (b) contacting the biological sample
with a capture surface under conditions sufficient to retain the microvesicle fraction on or in
the capture surface; (c) lysing the microvesicle fraction while the microvesicles are on or in
the capture surface; and (d) extracting the nucleic acids from the microvesicle fraction.
Alternatively, the method for extracting nucleic acids from the biological sample further
comprises eluting the microvesicle fraction from the capture surface after step (b),
collecting the eluted microvesicle fraction, and extracting the nucleic acids from the eluted
microvesicle fraction. Optionally, the eluted microvesicle fraction can be concentrated by a
spin concentrator to obtain a concentrated microvesicle fraction, and the nucleic acids are
subsequently extracted from the concentrated microvesicle fraction.
[0024]          In one embodiment, the capture surface is positively charged. In another
embodiment, the capture surface is negatively charged. In yet another embodiment, the
capture surface is neutral. In some embodiments, the capture surface includes more than one
layer. In some embodiments, more than one membrane is used in the EXO51 methods and
kits, for example, two or more membranes are used. In some embodiments, three
membranes are used. In some embodiments, more than three membranes are used. In some
embodiments, each layer of membrane is a different type of membrane. In some
embodiments, each layer of membrane is the same type of membrane. In some
embodiments, the layers of membranes are a combination of at least two different types of
membranes. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of a different
material. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is composed of the same material.
In some embodiments, each layer of membrane is charged. In some embodiments, at least
one layer is not charged. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the same
charge. In some embodiments, each layer of membrane has the same charge. In some
embodiments, each layer of membrane has a different charge.
[00251          In one embodiment, the capture surface is a bead. For example, the bead is
magnetic. Alternatively, the bead is non-magnetic. In yet another embodiment, the bead is
functionalized with an affinity ligand.
[00261          Preferably, the capture surface is a membrane. In one aspect, the membrane
comprises regenerated cellulose. For example, the membrane has a pore size in the range of
3-5 um. In another aspect, the membrane comprises polyethersulfone (PES). For example,
                                                6

the membrane has a pore size in the range of 20 nm to 0.8 um. In another aspect, the
membrane is positively charged.
[00271           In some aspects, the membrane is functionalized. For example, the
membrane is functionalized with quaternary ammonium R-CH 2 -N*(CH 3) 3.
[0028]           In one embodiment, the capture surface comprises three membranes, wherein
said three membranes are directly adjacent to one another.
[0029]           Preferably, the biological sample is plasma, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid
or cell culture supernatant.
[0030]           In some aspects, the method and/or kit described herein further comprises
contacting the biological sample with a loading buffer. The loading buffer is in the range of
pH 4-8. In one aspect, the loading buffer has a neutral pH.
[0031]           The methods and/or kits described herein provide for the extraction of
nucleic acids from microvesicles. Preferably, the extracted nucleic acids are RNA. The
extracted RNA may comprise messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, small RNAs
such as microRNAs, noncoding RNA, and any other short RNAs and/or RNA fragments, or
any combination thereof
[0032]           In some embodiments, the methods and/or kits are used to remove species of
nucleic acids from a biological sample. For example, the EXO50 and/or kits are used to
remove species of RNAs from a biological sample, including, by way of non-limiting
example, vesicle-bound RNA from a biological sample to isolate reciprocal RNA(s) from
the flow-through.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[001471          The present invention provides methods of isolating microvesicles by
capturing the microvesicles to a surface and subsequently lysing the microvesicles to release
the nucleic acids, particularly RNA, contained therein. Microvesicles are shed by eukaryotic
cells, or budded off of the plasma membrane, to the exterior of the cell. These membrane
vesicles are heterogeneous in size with diameters ranging from about 10 nm to about 5000
nm. All membrane vesicles shed by cells < 0.8gm in diameter are referred to herein
collectively as "microvesicles." These microvesicles include microvesicles, microvesicle
like particles, prostasomes, dexosomes, texosomes, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic
bodies, retrovirus-like particles, and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) particles. Small
microvesicles (approximately 10 to 1000nm, and more often 30 to 200 nm in diameter) that
                                                26

are released by exocytosis of intracellular multivesicular bodies are referred to in the art as
"microvesicles."
[001481          Current methods of isolating microvesicles include ultracentrifugation,
ultrafiltration, e.g., using 100 kD filters, polymer precipitation techniques, and/or filtration
based on size. However, there exists a need for alternative methods that are efficient and
effective for isolating microvesicles and, optionally, extracting the nucleic acids contained
therein, preferably microvesicle RNA, for use in a variety of applications, including
diagnostic purposes.
[00149]          In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of isolating
microvesicles by capturing the microvesicles to a surface and subsequently lysing the
microvesicles to release the nucleic acids, particularly RNA, contained therein. In some
embodiments, the present invention provides methods of isolating microvesicles by
capturing the microvesicles to a surface and subsequently eluting the intact microvesicles
from the capture surface.
[001501          Microvesicles are a rich source of high quality nucleic acids, excreted by all
cells and present in all human biofluids. The RNA in microvesicles provides a snapshot of
the transcriptome of primary tumors, metastases and the surrounding microenvironment in
real-time. Thus, accurate assessment of the RNA profile of microvesicles by assays
provides companion diagnostics and real-time monitoring of disease. This development has
been stalled by the current standard of isolating exosomes which is slow, tedious, variable
and not suited for a diagnostic environment.
[001511          The isolation and extraction methods and/or kits provided herein referred to
as the EXO50 plasma exosome RNA isolation methods and/or kits use a spin-column based
purification process using an affinity membrane that binds microvesicles. The methods and
kits of the disclosure allow for the capability to run large numbers of clinical samples in
parallel, using volumes from 0.2 up to 4 mL on a single column. The isolated RNA is highly
pure, protected by a vesicle membrane until lysis, and intact vesicles can be eluted from the
EXO50 membrane. The EXO50 procedure is able to deplete all mRNA from plasma input,
and is equal or better in mRNA/miRNA yield when compared to ultracentrifugation or
direct lysis. In contrast, the EXO50 methods and/or kits enrich for the microvesicle bound
fraction of miRNAs, and they are easily scalable to large amounts of input material. This
ability to scale up enables research on interesting, low abundant transcripts. In comparison
                                                 27

with other commercially available products on the market, the methods and kits of the
disclosure provide unique capabilities that are demonstrated by the examples provided
herein.
[00152]         The EXO50 methods and kits isolate and extract nucleic acids, e.g., RNA
from a biological sample using the following the general procedure. First, the microvesicle
fraction is bound to a membrane filter, and the filter is washed. Then, a reagent is used to
perform on-membrane lysis and release of the nucleic acids, e.g., RNA. Chloroform
extraction is then performed using PLG tubes, followed by ethanol conditioning. The
nucleic acids, e.g., RNA, is then bound to a silica column, washed and then eluted.

surface method to isolate microvesicle RNA from a biological sample is shown below:

[001571             As demonstrated by the working examples provided herein, the format of the
capturing surface, e.g., beads or a filter (also referred to herein as a membrane), does not
affect the ability of the methods provided herein to efficiently capture microvesicles from a
biological sample. Moreover, the surface charge of the capturing surface does not affect the
ability of the methods provided herein to efficiently capture microvesicles. In addition, the
working examples demonstrate that the ionic strength of the binding and wash buffer is of
limited importance in the methods provided herein.
[001581             A wide range of surfaces are capable of capturing microvesicles according to
the methods provided herein, but not all surfaces will capture microvesicles (some surfaces
do not capture anything).
[001591             The present disclosure also describes a device for isolating and concentrating
microvesicles from biological or clinical samples using disposable plastic parts and
centrifuge equipment. For example, the device comprises a column comprising a capture
surface (i.e., a membrane filter), a holder that secures the capture surface between the outer
frit and an inner tube, and a collection tube. The outer frit comprises a large net structure to
                                                         29

allow passing of liquid, and is preferably at one end of the column. The inner tube holds the
capture surface in place, and preferably is slightly conus-shaped. The collection tube may be
commercially available, i.e., 50ml Falcon tube. The column is preferably suitable for
spinning, i.e., the size is compatible with standard centrifuge and micro-centrifuge
machines.
[00160]          In embodiments where the capture surface is a membrane, the device for
isolating the microvesicle fraction from a biological sample contains at least one membrane.
In some embodiments, the device comprises one, two, three, four, five or six membranes.
Preferably, the device comprises three membranes. In embodiments where the device
comprises more than one membrane, the membranes are all directly adjacent to one another
at one end of the column. In embodiments where the device comprises more than one
membrane, the membranes are all identical to each other, i.e., are of the same charge and/or
have the same functional group.
[001611          As demonstrated by working Examples 1-32 provided herein, the choice of
buffer component(s), the pH of the buffer and the choice of lysis buffer affect the ability of
the methods provided herein to efficiently capture microvesicles and release the nucleic
acids, particularly RNA, contained therein. In some embodiments, the lysis buffer is a
phenol-based lysis buffer. For example, the lysis buffer is QIAzol@ lysis reagent (Qiagen).
[00162]          Working Examples 1-32 provided herein also demonstrate that capture by
filtering through a pore size smaller than the microvesicles is not the primary mechanism of
capture by the methods provided herein. However, filter pore size is nevertheless very
important, e.g. because mRNA gets stuck on a 20nm filter and cannot be recovered,
whereas microRNAs can easily be eluted off, and e.g. because the filter pore size is an
important parameter in available surface capture area.
[001631          Working Examples 1-32 provided herein have also demonstrated the
feasibility of microvesicle isolation with beads (magnetic or non-magnetic) that would be a
more suitable format in clinical utility. Results showed that positively charged, negatively
charged, and neutral beads all showed good microvesicle capturing efficiencies. This
observation suggests that they may act on different ligands on the surface of microvesicle,
thus one microvesicle can be captured with different (functionalized) particles via different
(multiple) forces.

[001641          The methods provided herein use any of a variety of capture surfaces. In
some embodiments, the capture surface is a membrane, also referred to herein as a filter or a
membrane filter. In some embodiments, the capture surface is a commercially available
membrane. In some embodiments, the capture surface is a charged commercially available
membrane. In some embodiments, the capture surface is neutral. In some embodiments, the
capture surface is selected from Mustang@ Ion Exchange Membrane from PALL
Corporation; Vivapure @      Q membrane    from Sartorius AG; Sartobind     Q, or Vivapure@ Q
Maxi H; Sartobind @ D from Sartorius AG, Sartobind (S) from Sartorius AG, Sartobind @
Q from    Sartorius AG, Sartobind @ IDA from Sartorius AG, Sartobind@ Aldehyde from
Sartorius AG, Whatman@ DE81 from Sigma, Fast Trap Virus Purification column from
EMD Millipore; Thermo Scientific* Pierce Strong Cation and Anion Exchange Spin
Columns.
[001651          In embodiments where the capture surface is charged, the capture surface can
be a charged filter selected from the group consisting of 0.65um positively charged       Q PES
vacuum filtration, 3-5um positively charged      Q RC spin column   filtration, 0.8um positively
charged    Q PES homemade     spin column filtration, 0.8um positively charged     Q PES syringe
filtration, 0.8um negatively charged S PES homemade spin column filtration, 0.8um
negatively charged S PES syringe filtration, and 50nm negatively charged nylon syringe
filtration. Preferably, the charged filter is not housed in a syringe filtration apparatus, as
Qiazol/RNA is harder to get out of the filter in these embodiments. Preferably, the charged
filter is housed at one end of a column.
[00166]          In embodiments where the capture surface is a membrane, the membrane can
be made from a variety of suitable materials. In some embodiments, the membrane is
polyethersulfone (PES) (e.g., from Millipore or PALL Corp.). In some embodiments, the
membrane is regenerated cellulose (RC) (e.g., from Sartorius or Pierce).
[001671          In some embodiments, the capture surface is a positively charged membrane.
In some embodiments, the capture surface is a       Q membrane, which    is a positively charged
membrane and is an anion exchanger with quaternary amines. For example, the           Q
membrane is functionalized with quaternary ammonium, R-CH 2 -N*(CH 3) 3 . In some
embodiments, the capture surface is a negatively charged membrane. In some embodiments,
the capture surface is an S membrane, which is a negatively charged membrane and is a
cation exchanger with sulfonic acid groups. For example, the S membrane is functionalized
                                                 31

with sulfonic acid, R-CH 2 -SO3-. In some embodiments, the capture surface is a D
membrane, which is a weak basic anion exchanger with diethylamine groups, R-CH 2
NH(C     2 H5 ) 2 . In some embodiments, the capture surface is a metal chelate membrane. For
example, the membrane is an IDA membrane, functionalized with minodiacetic acid
N(CH 2COOH-)2 . In some embodiments, the capture surface is a microporous membrane,
functionalized with aldehyde groups, -CHO. In other embodiments, the membrane is a weak
basic anion exchanger, with diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose. Not all charged
membranes are suitable for use in the methods provided herein, e.g., RNA isolated using a
regenerated cellulose, strong acidic cation exchanger ("RC/SACE") membrane spin column
showed RT-qPCR inhibition and, thus, unsuitable for PCR related downstream assay.
[001681               In embodiments where the capture surface is charged, microvesicles can be
isolated with a positively charged filter. In embodiments where the capture surface is
charged, the capture surface is preferably not a negatively charged regenerated cellulose S
filter, as this embodiment causes PCR inhibition. In contrast, negatively charged PES filters
do not exhibit this phenomenon.
[001691               In embodiments where the capture surface is charged, the pH during
microvesicle capture is a pH <7. In some embodiments, the pH is greater than 4 and less
than or equal to 8.
[001701               In embodiments where the capture surface is a positively charged     Q filter,
the buffer system includes a wash buffer comprising 250mM Bis Tris Propane, pH6.5-7.0.
In embodiments where the capture surface is a positively charged          Q filter, the lysis buffer is
Qiazol. In embodiments where the capture surface is a positively         charged Q filter, the lysis
buffer is present at one volume. In embodiments where the capture surface is a positively
charged    Q filter, the   lysis buffer is present at more than one volume.
[001711               In embodiments where the capture surface is neutral, the capture surface is a
filter selected from the group consisting of 20nm neutral PES syringe filtration (Tisch and
Exomir), 30nm neutral PES syringe filtration (Sterlitech), 50nm neutral PES syringe
filtration (Sterlitech), 0.2um neutral PES homemade spin column filtration (Pall), 0.8um
neutral PES homemade spin column filtration (Pall) and 0.8um neutral PES syringe
filtration (Pall). In embodiments where the capture surface is neutral, preferably the neutral
capture surface is not housed in a syringe filter.
                                                      32

[001721         In embodiments where the capture surface is neutral, the lysis buffer is
Qiazol. In embodiments where the capture surface is neutral, the lysis buffer is present at
one volume. In embodiments where the capture surface is neutral, the lysis buffer is present
at more than one volume. In embodiments where the capture surface is neutral, the methods
include a wash step.
[001731         Depending on the membrane material, the pore sizes of the membrane range
from 3 gm to 20 nm. For example, in embodiments where the capture surface is a
commercially available PES membrane, the membrane has a pore size of 20nm (Exomir),
0.65gm (Millipore) or 0.8gm (Pall). In embodiments where the capture surface is a
commercially available RC membrane, the membrane has a pore size in the range of 3-5gm
(Sartorius, Pierce).
[00174]         The surface charge of the capture surface can be positive, negative or neutral.
In some embodiments, the capture surface is a positively charged bead or beads. In some
embodiments, the capture surface is a negatively charged bead or beads. In some
embodiments, the capture surface is a neutral bead or beads. In some embodiments, the
capture surface is a neutral filter, e.g., a PES membrane that is not surface modified with a
charged group.
[001751         In some embodiments, the methods provided herein include a variety of
buffers including loading and wash buffers. In some embodiments, loading and wash
buffers can be of high or low ionic strength. In some embodiments, the salt concentration,
e.g., NaCl concentration, can be from 0 to 2.4M. The buffers can include a variety of
components. In some embodiments, the buffers include one or more of the following
components: Tris, Bis-Tris, Bis-Tris-Propane, Imidazole, Citrate, Methyl Malonic Acid,
Acetic Acid, Ethanolamine, Diethanolamine, Triethanolamine (TEA) and Sodium
phosphate. In the methods provided herein, the pH of loading and wash buffers is important.
Filters tend to clog when plasma samples at set to pH < 5.5 before loading (the plasma will
not spin through the column at all), and at higher pH microvesicle RNA recovery is lower
due to instability of the microvesicles. At neutral pH, the RNA recovery from microvesicles
is optimal. In some embodiments, the buffer used is at 1X concentration, 2X concentration,
3X concentration, or 4X concentration. For example, the loading or binding buffer is at 2X
concentration while the wash buffer is at 1X concentration.
                                                 33

[001761          In some embodiments, the methods include one or more wash steps, for
example, after contacting the biological sample with the capture surface. In some
embodiments, detergents are added to the wash buffer to facilitate removing the non
specific binding (i.e., contaminants, cell debris, and circulating protein complexes or nucleic
acids), to obtain a more pure microvesicle fraction. Detergents suitable for use include, but
are not limited to, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Tween-20, Tween-80, Triton X-100,
Nonidet P-40 (NP-40),, Brij-35, Brij-58, octyl glucoside, octyl thioglucoside, CHAPS or
CHAPSO.
[001771          In some embodiments, the capture surface, e.g., membrane, is housed within
a device used for centrifugation; e.g. spin columns, or for vacuum system e.g. vacuum filter
holders, or for filtration with pressure e.g. syringe filters. In a preferred embodiment, the
capture surface is housed in a spin column or vacuum system.
[00178]          The isolation of microvesicles from a biological sample prior to extraction of
nucleic acids is advantageous for the following reasons: 1) extracting nucleic acids from
microvesicles provides the opportunity to selectively analyze disease or tumor-specific
nucleic acids obtained by isolating disease or tumor-specific microvesicles apart from other
microvesicles within the fluid sample; 2) nucleic acid-containing microvesicles produce
significantly higher yields of nucleic acid species with higher integrity as compared to the
yield/integrity obtained by extracting nucleic acids directly from the fluid sample without
first isolating microvesicles; 3) scalability, e.g., to detect nucleic acids expressed at low
levels, the sensitivity can be increased by concentrating microvesicles from a larger volume
of sample using the methods and/or kits described herein; 4) more pure or higher
quality/integrity of extracted nucleic acids in that proteins, lipids, cell debris, cells and other
potential contaminants and PCR inhibitors that are naturally found within biological
samples are excluded before the nucleic acid extraction step; and 5) more choices in nucleic
acid extraction methods can be utilized as isolated microvesicle fractions can be of a smaller
volume than that of the starting sample volume, making it possible to extract nucleic acids
from these fractions or pellets using small volume column filters.
[001791          Several methods of isolating microvesicles from a biological sample have
been described in the art. For example, a method of differential centrifugation is described
in a paper by Raposo et al. (Raposo et al., 1996), a paper by Skog et. al.(Skog et al., 2008)
and a paper by Nilsson et. al.(Nilsson et al., 2009). Methods of ion exchange and/or gel
                                                 34

permeation chromatography are described in US Patent Nos. 6,899,863 and 6,812,023.
Methods of sucrose density gradients or organelle electrophoresis are described in U.S.
Patent No. 7,198,923. A method of magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) is described in a
paper by Taylor and Gercel Taylor (Taylor and Gercel-Taylor, 2008). A method of
nanomembrane ultrafiltration concentration is described in a paper by Cheruvanky et al.
(Cheruvanky et al., 2007). A method of Percoll gradient isolation is described in a
publication by Miranda et al. (Miranda et al., 2010). Further, microvesicles may be
identified and isolated from bodily fluid of a subject by a microfluidic device (Chen et al.,
2010). In research and development, as well as commercial applications of nucleic acid
biomarkers, it is desirable to extract high quality nucleic acids from biological samples in a
consistent, reliable, and practical manner.
[00180]          An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a method for quick
and easy isolation of nucleic acid-containing particles from biological samples such as body
fluids and extraction of high quality nucleic acids from the isolated particles. The method of
the invention may be suitable for adaptation and incorporation into a compact device or
instrument for use in a laboratory or clinical setting, or in the field.
[00181]          In the working examples provided herein, human plasma from normal
healthy controls was obtained from Bioreclamation LLC with a blood collection SOP
developed by Exosome Diagnostic Inc. Briefly, blood was collected into K2 EDTA tubes
and mixed well with complete inversions. Then the tubes were centrifuged at 1300xg for
 10min to separate the blood cells and plasma. Then plasma was removed and filtered
through a 0.8gm filter to remove cell debris and platelets. All plasma samples were then
aliquoted into 1ml cryovials and store at -80'C until use.
[00182]          Before RNA isolation, the membrane was conditioned by passing through
equilibrium buffer. The thawed plasma sample was diluted with loading buffer. The diluted
plasma sample was slowly passed through the membrane that adsorbs the microvesicles.
The membrane was then washed with a wash buffer to remove any weakly bound plasma
components. Then a lysis reagent was passed through the membrane to lyse the
microvesicles. RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).
[00183]          RNA was assessed for quality and concentration with the 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent) using a RNA 6000 Pico Chip. The relative quantity of the extracted RNA was
                                               35

measured by RT-qPCR using selected human gene expression assays from Applied
Biosystems (Taqman Assay).
[00184]         While the examples provided herein used plasma samples, the skilled artisan
will appreciate that these methods are applicable to a variety of biological samples. Other
suitable biological samples include urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood including blood
components, e.g., plasma and serum, sputum, pleural fluid, nipple aspirates, lymph fluid,
fluid of the respiratory, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tear fluid, saliva, breast milk,
fluid from the lymphatic system, semen, intraorgan system fluid, ascitic fluid, tumor cyst
fluid, amniotic fluid, cell culture supernatant and combinations thereof
[001851         The methods and kits of the disclosure are suitable for use with samples
derived from a human subject. The methods and kits of the disclosure are suitable for use
with samples derived from a non-human subject such as, for example, a rodent, a non
human primate, a companion animal (e.g., cat, dog, horse), and/or a farm animal (e.g.,
chicken).
[00186]         In some embodiments, a pre-processing step prior to isolation, purification or
enrichment of the microvesicles is performed to remove large unwanted particles, cells
and/or cell debris and other contaminants present in the biological sample. The pre
processing steps may be achieved through one or more centrifugation steps (e.g., differential
centrifugation) or one or more filtration steps (e.g., ultrafiltration), or a combination thereof
Where more than one centrifugation pre-processing steps are performed, the biological
sample may be centrifuged first at the lower speed and then at the higher speed. If desired,
further suitable centrifugation pre-processing steps may be carried out. Alternatively or in
addition to the one or more centrifugation pre-processing steps, the biological sample may
be filtered. For example, a biological sample may be first centrifuged at 20,000g for 1 hour
to remove large unwanted particles; the sample can then be filtered, for example, through a
0.8 gm filter.
[001871         In some embodiments, one or more centrifugation steps are performed before
or after contacting the biological sample with the capture surface to separate microvesicles
and concentrate the microvesicles isolated from the biological fraction. For example, the
sample is centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 hour at 4'C. To remove large unwanted particles,
cells, and/or cell debris, the samples may be centrifuged at a low speed of about 100-500g,
preferably about 250-300g. Alternatively or in addition, the samples may be centrifuged at a
                                                 36

higher speed. Suitable centrifugation speeds are up to about 200,000g; for example from
about 2,000g to less than about 200,000g. Speeds of above about 15,000g and less than
about 200,000g or above about 15,000g and less than about 100,000g or above about
 15,000g and less than about 50,000g are preferred. Speeds of from about 18,000g to about
40,000g or about 30,000g; and from about 18,000g to about 25,000g are more preferred.
Particularly preferred is a centrifugation speed of about 20,000g. Generally, suitable times
for centrifugation are from about 5 minutes to about 2 hours, for example, from about 10
minutes to about 1.5 hours, or more preferably from about 15 minutes to about 1 hour. A
time of about 0.5 hours may be preferred. It is sometimes preferred to subject the biological
sample to centrifugation at about 20,000g for about 0.5 hours. However the above speeds
and times can suitably be used in any combination (e.g., from about 18,000g to about
25,000g, or from about 30,000g to about 40,000g for about 10 minutes to about 1.5 hours,
or for about 15 minutes to about 1 hour, or for about 0.5 hours, and so on). The
centrifugation step or steps may be carried out at below-ambient temperatures, for example
at about 0-10 0 C, preferably about 1-5 'C, e.g., about 3 'C or about 4'C.
[00188]          In some embodiments, one or more filtration steps are performed before or
after contacting the biological sample with the capture surface. A filter having a size in the
range about 0.1 to about 1.0 pm may be employed, preferably about 0.8 pm or 0.22 gm.
The filtration may also be performed with successive filtrations using filters with decreasing
porosity.
[00189]          In some embodiments, one or more concentration steps are performed, in
order to reduce the volumes of sample to be treated during the chromatography stages,
before or after contacting the biological sample with the capture surface. Concentration may
be through centrifugation of the sample at high speeds, e.g. between 10,000 and 100,000 g,
to cause the sedimentation of the microvesicles. This may consist of a series of differential
centrifugations. The microvesicles in the pellet obtained may be reconstituted with a smaller
volume and in a suitable buffer for the subsequent steps of the process. The concentration
step may also be performed by ultrafiltration. In fact, this ultrafiltration both concentrates
the biological sample and performs an additional purification of the microvesicle fraction.
In another embodiment, the filtration is an ultrafiltration, preferably a tangential
ultrafiltration. Tangential ultrafiltration consists of concentrating and fractionating a
solution between two compartments (filtrate and retentate), separated by membranes of
                                                 37

determined cut-off thresholds. The separation is carried out by applying a flow in the
retentate compartment and a transmembrane pressure between this compartment and the
filtrate compartment. Different systems may be used to perform the ultrafiltration, such as
spiral membranes (Millipore, Amicon), flat membranes or hollow fibers (Amicon,
Millipore, Sartorius, Pall, GF, Sepracor). Within the scope of the invention, the use of
membranes with a cut-off threshold below 1000 kDa, preferably between 100 kDa and 1000
kDa, or even more preferably between 100 kDa and 600 kDa, is advantageous.
[00190]          In some embodiments, one or more size-exclusion chromatography step or
gel permeation chromatography steps are performed before or after contacting the biological
sample with the capture surface. To perform the gel permeation chromatography step, a
support selected from silica, acrylamide, agarose, dextran, ethylene glycol-methacrylate co
polymer or mixtures thereof, e.g., agarose-dextran mixtures, are preferably used. For
example, such supports include, but are not limited to: SUPERDEX@ 200HR (Pharmacia),
TSK G6000 (TosoHaas) or SEPHACRYL@ S (Pharmacia).
[00191]          In some embodiments, one or more affinity chromatography steps are
performed before or after contacting the biological sample with the capture surface. Some
microvesicles can also be characterized by certain surface molecules. Because microvesicles
form from budding of the cell plasma membrane, these microvesicles often share many of
the same surface molecules found on the cells they originated from. As used herein,
"surface molecules" refers collectively to antigens, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and
markers found on the surface or in or on the membrane of the microvesicle. These surface
molecules can include, for example, receptors, tumor-associated antigens, membrane
protein modifications (e.g., glycosylated structures). For example, microvesicles that bud
from tumor cells often display tumor-associated antigens on their cell surface. As such,
affinity chromatography or affinity exclusion chromatography can also be utilized in
combination with the methods provided herein to isolate, identify, and or enrich for specific
populations of microvesicles from a specific donor cell type (Al-Nedawi et al., 2008; Taylor
and Gercel-Taylor, 2008). For example, tumor (malignant or non-malignant) microvesicles
carry tumor-associated surface antigens and may be detected, isolated and/or enriched via
these specific tumor-associated surface antigens. In one example, the surface antigen is
epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is specific to microvesicles from
carcinomas of long, colorectal, breast, prostate, head and neck, and hepatic origin, but not of
                                               38

hematological cell origin (Balzar et al., 1999; Went et al., 2004). Additionally, tumor
specific microvesicles can also be characterized by the lack of certain surface markers, such
as CD80 and CD86. In these cases, microvesicles with these markers may be excluded for
further analysis of tumor specific markers, e.g., by affinity exclusion chromatography.
Affinity chromatography can be accomplished, for example, by using different supports,
resins, beads, antibodies, aptamers, aptamer analogs, molecularly imprinted polymers, or
other molecules known in the art that specifically target desired surface molecules on
microvesicles.
[00192]      Optionally, control particles may be added to the sample prior to microvesicle
isolation or nucleic acid extraction to serve as an internal control to evaluate the efficiency
or quality of microvesicle purification and/or nucleic acid extraction. The methods and/or
kits described herein provide for the efficient isolation and the control particles along with
the microvesicle fraction. These control particles include Q-beta bacteriophage, virus
particles, or any other particle that contains control nucleic acids (e.g., at least one control
target gene) that may be naturally occurring or engineered by recombinant DNA techniques.
In some embodiments, the quantity of control particles is known before the addition to the
sample. The control target gene can be quantified using real-time PCR analysis.
Quantification of a control target gene can be used to determine the efficiency or quality of
the microvesicle purification or nucleic acid extraction processes.
[00193]      Preferably, the control particle is a Q-beta bacteriophage, referred to herein as
"Q-beta particle." The Q-beta particle used in the methods and/or kits described herein may
be a naturally-occurring virus particle or may be a recombinant or engineered virus, in
which at least one component of the virus particle (e.g., a portion of the genome or coat
protein) is synthesized by recombinant DNA or molecular biology techniques known in the
art. Q-beta is a member of the leviviridae family, characterized by a linear, single-stranded
RNA genome that consists of 3 genes encoding four viral proteins: a coat protein, a
maturation protein, a lysis protein, and RNA replicase. Due to its similar size to average
microvesicles, Q-beta can be easily purified from a biological sample using the same
purification methods used to isolate microvesicles, as described herein. In addition, the low
complexity of the Q-beta viral single-stranded gene structure is advantageous for its use as a
control in amplification-based nucleic acid assays. The Q-beta particle contains a control
target gene or control target sequence to be detected or measured for the quantification of
                                                39

the amount of Q-beta particle in a sample. For example, the control target gene is the Q-beta
coat protein gene. After addition of the Q-beta particles to the biological sample, the nucleic
acids from the Q-beta particle are extracted along with the nucleic acids from the biological
sample using the extraction methods and/or kits described herein. Detection of the Q-beta
control target gene can be determined by RT-PCR analysis, for example, simultaneously
with the biomarkers of interest (i.e., BRAF). A standard curve of at least 2, 3, or 4 known
concentrations in 10-fold dilution of a control target gene can be used to determine copy
number. The copy number detected and the quantity of Q-beta particle added can be
compared to determine the quality of the isolation and/or extraction process.
[00194]       In a preferred embodiment, the Q-beta particles are added to the urine sample
prior to nucleic extraction. For example, the Q-beta particles are added to the urine sample
prior to ultrafiltration and/or after the pre-filtration step.
[00195]       In some embodiments, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 1,000 or
5,000 copies of Q-beta particles added to a bodily fluid sample. In a preferred embodiment,
 100 copies of Q-beta particles are added to a bodily fluid sample. The copy number of Q
beta particles can be calculated based on the ability of the Q-beta bacteriophage to infect
target cells. Thus, the copy number of Q-beta particles is correlated to the colony forming
units of the Q-beta bacteriophage.
Nucleic Acid Extraction
[00196]          The present invention is directed towards the use of a capture surface for the
improved isolation, purification, or enrichment of microvesicles. The methods disclosed
herein provide a highly enriched microvesicle fraction for extraction of high quality nucleic
acids from said microvesicles. The nucleic acid extractions obtained by the methods and/or
kits described herein may be useful for various applications in which high quality nucleic
acid extractions are required or preferred, such as for use in the diagnosis, prognosis, or
monitoring of diseases or medical conditions.
[001971          Recent studies reveal that nucleic acids within microvesicles have a role as
biomarkers. For example, WO 2009/100029 describes, among other things, the use of
nucleic acids extracted from microvesicles in GBM patient serum for medical diagnosis,
prognosis and therapy evaluation. WO 2009/100029 also describes the use of nucleic acids
extracted from microvesicles in human urine for the same purposes. The use of nucleic
acids extracted from microvesicles is considered to potentially circumvent the need for
                                                  40

biopsies, highlighting the enormous diagnostic potential of microvesicle biology (Skog et
al., 2008).
[00198]          The quality or purity of the isolated microvesicles can directly affect the
quality of the extracted microvesicle nucleic acids, which then directly affects the efficiency
and sensitivity of biomarker assays for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and/or monitoring.
Given the importance of accurate and sensitive diagnostic tests in the clinical field, methods
for isolating highly enriched microvesicle fractions from biological samples are needed. To
address this need, the present invention provides methods for isolating microvesicles from
biological sample for the extraction of high quality nucleic acids from a biological sample.
As shown herein, highly enriched microvesicle fractions are isolated from biological
samples by methods and/or kits described herein, and wherein high quality nucleic acids
subsequently extracted from the highly enriched microvesicle fractions. These high quality
extracted nucleic acids are useful for measuring or assessing the presence or absence of
biomarkers for aiding in the diagnosis, prognosis, and/or monitoring of diseases or other
medical conditions.
[00199]          As used herein, the term "biological sample" refers to a sample that contains
biological materials such as DNA, RNA and protein. In some embodiments, the biological
sample may suitably comprise a bodily fluid from a subject. The bodily fluids can be fluids
isolated from anywhere in the body of the subject, preferably a peripheral location,
including but not limited to, for example, blood, plasma, serum, urine, sputum, spinal fluid,
cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, nipple aspirates, lymph fluid, fluid of the respiratory,
intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tear fluid, saliva, breast milk, fluid from the lymphatic
system, semen, intra-organ system fluid, ascitic fluid, tumor cyst fluid, amniotic fluid and
cell culture supernatant, and combinations thereof In some embodiments, the preferred
body fluid for use as the biological sample is urine. In other embodiments, the preferred
body fluid is serum. In yet other embodiments, the preferred body fluid is plasma. In other
embodiments, the preferred body fluid is cerebrospinal fluid. Suitably a sample volume of
about 0. Iml to about 30ml fluid may be used. The volume of fluid may depend on a few
factors, e.g., the type of fluid used. For example, the volume of serum samples may be
about 0. Iml to about 4ml, preferably about 0.2ml to 4ml. The volume of plasma samples
may be about 0. 1ml to about 4ml, preferably 0.5ml to 4ml. The volume of urine samples
                                                 41

may be about 10 ml to about 30ml, preferably about 20 ml. Biological samples can also
include fecal or cecal samples, or supernatants isolated therefrom.
[00200]         The term "subject" is intended to include all animals shown to or expected to
have nucleic acid-containing particles. In particular embodiments, the subject is a mammal,
a human or nonhuman primate, a dog, a cat, a horse, a cow, other farm animals, or a rodent
(e.g. mice, rats, guinea pig. etc.). A human subject may be a normal human being without
observable abnormalities, e.g., a disease. A human subject may be a human being with
observable abnormalities, e.g., a disease. The observable abnormalities may be observed by
the human being himself, or by a medical professional. The term "subject," "patient," and
"individual" are used interchangeably herein.
[00201]         As used herein, the term "nucleic acids" refer to DNA and RNA. The nucleic
acids can be single stranded or double stranded. In some instances, the nucleic acid is DNA.
In some instances, the nucleic acid is RNA. RNA includes, but is not limited to, messenger
RNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, and HERV elements.
[00202]         As used herein, the term "high quality" in reference to nucleic acid extraction
means an extraction in which one is able to detect 18S and 28S rRNA, preferably in a ratio
of approximately 1:1 to approximately 1:2; and more preferably, approximately 1:2. Ideally,
high quality nucleic acid extractions obtained by the methods and/or kits described herein
will also have an RNA integrity number of greater than or equal to 5 for a low protein
biological sample (e.g., urine), or greater than or equal to 3 for a high protein biological
sample (e.g., serum), and a nucleic acid yield of greater than or equal to 50 pg/ml from a 20
ml low protein biological sample or a 1 ml high protein biological sample.
[00203]         High quality RNA extractions are desirable because RNA degradation can
adversely affect downstream assessment of the extracted RNA, such as in gene expression
and mRNA analysis, as well as in analysis of non-coding RNA such as small RNA and
microRNA. The new methods and/or kits described herein enable one to extract high quality
nucleic acids from microvesicles isolated from a biological sample so that an accurate
analysis of nucleic acids within the microvesicles can be performed.
[00204]         Following the isolation of microvesicles from a biological sample, nucleic
acid may be extracted from the isolated or enriched microvesicle fraction. To achieve this,
in some embodiments, the microvesicles may first be lysed. The lysis of microvesicles and
extraction of nucleic acids may be achieved with various methods known in the art. In one
                                               42

embodiment, the lysis and extraction steps may be achieved using a commercially available
Qiagen RNeasy Plus kit. In another embodiment, the lysis and extraction steps may be
achieved using a commercially available Qiagen miRNeasy kit. In yet another embodiment,
the nucleic acid extraction may be achieved using phenol:chloroform according to standard
procedures and techniques known in the art. Such methods may also utilize a nucleic acid
binding column to capture the nucleic acids contained within the microvesicles. Once
bound, the nucleic acids can then be eluted using a buffer or solution suitable to disrupt the
interaction between the nucleic acids and the binding column, thereby successfully eluting
the nucleic acids.
[002051         In some embodiments, the nucleic acid extraction methods also include the
step of removing or mitigating adverse factors that prevent high quality nucleic acid
extraction from a biological sample. Such adverse factors are heterogeneous in that different
biological samples may contain various species of adverse factors. In some biological
samples, factors such as excessive DNA may affect the quality of nucleic acid extractions
from such samples. In other samples, factors such as excessive endogenous RNase may
affect the quality of nucleic acid extractions from such samples. Many agents and methods
may be used to remove these adverse factors. These methods and agents are referred to
collectively herein as an "extraction enhancement operations." In some instances, the
extraction enhancement operation may involve the addition of nucleic acid extraction
enhancement agents to the biological sample. To remove adverse factors such as
endogenous RNases, such extraction enhancement agents as defined herein may include, but
are not limited to, an RNase inhibitor such as Superase-In (commercially available from
Ambion Inc.) or RNaselNplus (commercially available from Promega Corp.), or other
agents that function in a similar fashion; a protease (which may function as an RNase
inhibitor); DNase; a reducing agent; a decoy substrate such as a synthetic RNA and/or
carrier RNA; a soluble receptor that can bind RNase; a small interfering RNA (siRNA); an
RNA binding molecule, such as an anti-RNA antibody, a basic protein or a chaperone
protein; an RNase denaturing substance, such as a high osmolarity solution, a detergent, or a
combination thereof
[00206]         For example, the extraction enhancement operation may include the addition
of an RNase inhibitor to the biological sample, and/or to the isolated microvesicle fraction,
prior to extracting nucleic acid; preferably the RNase inhibitor has a concentration of
                                                43

greater than 0.027 AU (I X) for a sample equal to or more than 1 1tl    in volume;
alternatively, greater than or equal to 0. 1 35 AU (5X) for a sample equal to or more than 1
  1il;alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.27 AU (lOX) for a sample equal to or more than
I 1il;alternatively, greater than or equal to 0.675 AU (25X) for a sample equal to or more
than 1 1il;  and alternatively, greater than or equal to 1 .35 AU (50X) for a sample equal to or
more than 1 1il;    wherein the I X concentration refers to an enzymatic condition wherein
0.027 AU or more RNase inhibitor is used to treat microvesicles isolated from 1 ptl or more
bodily fluid, the 5X concentration refers to an enzymatic condition wherein 0.135 AU or
more RNase inhibitor is used to treat microvesicles isolated from 1 ptl or more bodily fluid,
the lOX protease concentration refers lo an enzymatic condition wherein 0.27 AU or more
RNase inhibitor is used to treat particles isolated from 1 ptl or more bodily fluid, the 25X
concentration refers to an enzymatic condition wherein 0.675 AU or more RNase inhibitor
is used to treat microvesicles isolated from 1 ptl or more bodily fluid, and the 50X protease
concentration refers to an enzymatic condition wherein 1 .35 AU or more RNase inhibitor is
used to treat particles isolated from 1 ptl or more bodily fluid. Preferably, the RNase
inhibitor is a protease, in which case, 1 AU is the protease activity that releases folin
positive amino acids and peptides corresponding to 1 imol tyrosine per minute.
[002071           These enhancement agents may exert their functions in various ways, e.g.,
through inhibiting RNase activity (e.g., RNase inhibitors), through a ubiquitous degradation
of proteins (e.g., proteases), or through a chaperone protein (e.g., a RNA-binding protein)
that binds and protects RNAs. In all instances, such extraction enhancement agents remove
or at least mitigate some or all of the adverse factors in the biological sample or associated
with the isolated particles that would otherwise prevent or interfere with the high quality
extraction of nucleic acids from the isolated particles.
[00208]           In some embodiments, the quantification of 18S and 28S rRNAs extracted
can be used determine the quality of the nucleic acid extraction.
Detection of nucleic acid biomarkers
[00209]           In some embodiments, the extracted nucleic acid comprises RNA. In this
instance, the RNA is preferably reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA)
before further amplification. Such reverse transcription may be performed alone or in
combination with an amplification step. One example of a method combining reverse
transcription and amplification steps is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT
                                                  44

PCR), which may be further modified to be quantitative, e.g., quantitative RT-PCR as
described in US Patent No. 5,639,606, which is incorporated herein by reference for this
teaching. Another example of the method comprises two separate steps: a first of reverse
transcription to convert RNA into cDNA and a second step of quantifying the amount of
cDNA using quantitative PCR. As demonstrated in the examples that follow, the RNAs
extracted from nucleic acid-containing particles using the methods disclosed herein include
many species of transcripts including, but not limited to, ribosomal 18S and 28S rRNA,
microRNAs, transfer RNAs, transcripts that are associated with diseases or medical
conditions, and biomarkers that are important for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of
medical conditions.
[00210]         For example, RT-PCR analysis determines a Ct (cycle threshold) value for
each reaction. In RT-PCR, a positive reaction is detected by accumulation of a fluorescence
signal. The Ct value is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to
cross the threshold (i.e., exceeds background level). Ct levels are inversely proportional to
the amount of target nucleic acid, or control nucleic acid, in the sample (i.e., the lower the
Ct level, the greater the amount of control nucleic acid in the sample).
[00211]         In another embodiment, the copy number of the control nucleic acid can be
measured using any of a variety of art-recognized techniques, including, but not limited to,
RT-PCR. Copy number of the control nucleic acid can be determined using methods known
in the art, such as by generating and utilizing a calibration, or standard curve.
[00212]         In some embodiments, one or more biomarkers can be one or a collection of
genetic aberrations, which is used herein to refer to the nucleic acid amounts as well as
nucleic acid variants within the nucleic acid-containing particles. Specifically, genetic
aberrations include, without limitation, over-expression of a gene (e.g., an oncogene) or a
panel of genes, under-expression of a gene (e.g., a tumor suppressor gene such as p53 or
RB) or a panel of genes, alternative production of splice variants of a gene or a panel of
genes, gene copy number variants (CNV) (e.g., DNA double minutes) (Hahn, 1993), nucleic
acid modifications (e.g., methylation, acetylation and phosphorylations), single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., inversions, deletions and
duplications), and mutations (insertions, deletions, duplications, missense, nonsense,
synonymous or any other nucleotide changes) of a gene or a panel of genes, which
mutations, in many cases, ultimately affect the activity and function of the gene products,
                                               45

lead to alternative transcriptional splice variants and/or changes of gene expression level, or
combinations of any of the foregoing.
[00213]          The analysis of nucleic acids present in the isolated particles is quantitative
and/or qualitative. For quantitative analysis, the amounts (expression levels), either relative
or absolute, of specific nucleic acids of interest within the isolated particles are measured
with methods known in the art (described below). For qualitative analysis, the species of
specific nucleic acids of interest within the isolated microvesicles, whether wild type or
variants, are identified with methods known in the art.
[00214]          The present invention also includes various uses of the new methods of
isolating microvesicles from a biological sample for high quality nucleic acid extraction
from a for (i) aiding in the diagnosis of a subject, (ii) monitoring the progress or
reoccurrence of a disease or other medical condition in a subject, or (iii) aiding in the
evaluation of treatment efficacy for a subject undergoing or contemplating treatment for a
disease or other medical condition; wherein the presence or absence of one or more
biomarkers in the nucleic acid extraction obtained from the method is determined, and the
one or more biomarkers are associated with the diagnosis, progress or reoccurrence, or
treatment efficacy, respectively, of a disease or other medical condition.
Kits for isolating microvesicles from a biological sample
[002151          One aspect of the present invention is further directed to kits for use in the
methods disclosed herein. The kit comprises a capture surface apparatus sufficient to
separate microvesicles from a biological sample from unwanted particles, debris, and small
molecules that are also present in the biological sample. The present invention also
optionally includes instructions for using the foregoing reagents in the isolation and optional
subsequent nucleic acid extraction process.
                                            EXAMPLES
[00216]          While the examples provided herein use a variety of membranes and devices
used for centrifugation and/or filtration purposes, it is to be understood that these methods
can be used with any capture surface and/or housing device that allows for the efficient
capture of microvesicles and release of the nucleic acids, particularly, RNA, contained
therein.
                                                46

Example 1: Plasma Microvesicular RNA can be isolated using a 0.65um positively
charged   Q PES filter in   a vacuum format
[00217]         Normal control plasma was obtained from Bioreclamation LLC. Blood was
collected into K2 EDTA tubes and mixed well with complete inversions. The tubes were
centrifuged at 1300xg for 10min to separate the blood cells and plasma. Then, the plasma
was filtered through a 0.8gm mixed cellulose ester filter (Millipore, Billerica, Ma., USA) to
remove cell debris and platelets, and divided into 1 mL aliquots. Aliquots were frozen at
80'C until needed.
[00218]         Isolation of 4mL plasma microvesicular RNA was conducted using
ultracentrifugation or Fast Trap Adenovirus purification and concentration kit (Millipore,
Billerica, Ma., USA) 0.65um positively charged    Q polyethersulfone  vacuum filtration.
[00219]         In the ultracentrifugation method, one 1 mL aliquots of plasma from four
subjects were transferred to a 5mL polyallomer tube (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA)
containing 8 gL RNasin Plus (40 U/gl, Promega, Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor, and
incubated for 5 minutes at room temp. Following incubation, the plasma was diluted in 1
mL PBS (10mM Sodium phosphate, 2mM Potassium phosphate, 2.7mM KCl, 137mM
NaCl, pH 7.4). Microvesicles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 120,000g for 80
minutes at 80C. The microvesicle pellet was washed in 42 gL PBS and 8 gL RNasin Plus,
and incubated for 20 minutes at room temp. The microvesicle pellet was lysed in 700ul
Qiazol Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, Ca., USA).
[00220]         In the 0.65um positively charged  Q polyethersulfone  vacuum filtration
method, one ImL aliquots of plasma from the same four subjects used in the
ultracentrifugation method were pooled, diluted with 5mL PBS, and mixed with 1 mL        lOX
Binding Buffer (Millipore). Before the plasma sample was applied, the filter was
conditioned by passing through 25mL Equilibration Buffer (Millipore) by vacuum. Then,
the plasma sample was passed through the filter by vacuum. The filtrate was saved for
further analysis. The filter was washed with 20mL Wash Buffer (Millipore) by vacuum.
Then the microvesicles were lysed with Qiazol. 2.25mL Qiazol was applied to the
membrane and distributed by drawing approximately 5 drops of Qiazol through the filter by
vacuum. The filter was then incubated for 5 min at room temp and eluted by vacuum.
[00221]         The filtrate samples were transferred to two 5mL polyallomer tubes
(Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA) containing 8 gL RNasin Plus (40 U/gl, Promega,
                                               47

Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor, and incubated for 5 minutes at room temp.
Microvesicles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 120,000g for 80 minutes at 80 C. The
microvesicle pellets were washed in 42 gL PBS and 8 gL RNasin Plus, and incubated for 20
minutes at room temp. The microvesicle pellets were lysed in 700ul Qiazol Reagent
(Qiagen, Valencia, Ca., USA).
[00222]         For the ultracentrifugation and filtration (filter and filtrate) samples,
microvesicular RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the

patient using Millipore Fast Trap Virus Purification Column
[00224]         Melanoma plasma was obtained from Ludwig Maximilians University in
accordance with protocols approved by the IRB and as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00225]         Isolation of 2mL and l2mL plasma microvesicular RNA was conducted
using ultracentrifugation or Fast Trap Adenovirus purification and concentration kit
(Millipore, Billerica, Ma., USA) 0.65um positively charged       Q polyethersulfone    vacuum
filtration.
[00226]         In the ultracentrifugation method, 2mL and 3X4mL plasma were transferred
to a 5mL polyallomer tube (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA) containing 8 gL RNasin
Plus (40 U/gl, Promega, Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor, and incubated for 5 minutes
at room temp. Following incubation, the 2mL and each 4mL plasma was diluted in 3mL and

EXAMPLE 1.
[002271         In the 0.65um positively charged   Q polyethersulfone      vacuum filtration
method, 2mL and l2mL plasma was diluted with 2.5 mL and l5mL PBS, respectively, and
mixed with 500ul and 3mL      loX   Binding Buffer (Millipore), respectively. Before the plasma
samples were applied, the filters were conditioned by passing through 25mL Equilibration
Buffer (Millipore) by vacuum. Then, the plasma samples were passed through the filter by

filtrate, and wash) and ultracentrifugation to detect BRAF mutation, RT-PCRs were
performed on wild-type and mutant BRAF mRNA. The BRAF mutation assay uses ARMS
(Amplificatory refractive and Mutation System) allele specific PCR. The assay was adapted
from AstraZeneca (Cheshire, UK). The mutation assay contains primers specifically for
amplifying BRAF T1799A (detecting V600E, V600K or V600D, depending on additional
mutations present at 1798 or 1800 positions). The amplification reactions were performed in

[00235]         In the 3um positively charged   Q regenerated cellulose centrifugal filtration
method, ImL aliquots of plasma from the same four subjects used in the ultracentrifugation
method were pooled and diluted with 444ul lOX Loading Buffer (Sartorius). Before the
plasma sample was applied, the filter was conditioned by passing through 5mL IX Washing
Buffer (Sartorius) at 500xg for 5 min. Then, the plasma sample was passed through the filter

Example 8: Isolation of microvesicle RNA from Urine Sample
[00265]          Normal control urine was obtained in house and was filtered through a 0.8
pm mixed cellulose ester filter (Millipore) to remove cell debris. The filtered urine was
stored at 4'C until needed.
[00266]          Isolation of 1OmL urine microvesicular RNA was conducted using lOOK
centrifugal filter unit concentration (Millipore) or Fast Trap Adenovirus purification and
concentration kit (Millipore) 0.65um positively charged      Q polyethersulfone     vacuum
filtration.
[00267]          In the lOOK centrifugal filter unit concentration, lOmL urine transferred to a
lOOK centrifugal filter unit and concentrated at 4,500xg for 5 min. The concentrated
microvesicle sample was then lysed in 700ul Qiazol.
[00268]          In the 0.65um positively charged    Q polyethersulfone    vacuum filtration
method, lOmL urine from the same subject used in the lOOK centrifugal filter unit
concentration was diluted with 8mL PBS and mixed with 2 mL lOX Binding Buffer
(Millipore). The filter was equilibrated, loaded with the plasma sample, washed, and lysed
as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00269]          The filtrate sample was transferred to four 5mL polyallomer tubes
(Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA) containing 8 gL RNasin Plus (40 U/gl, Promega,
Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor and incubated for 5 min at room temp. Microvesicles
were pelleted and lysed as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00270]          For the ultracentrifugation and filtration (filter and filtrate) samples,
microvesicular RNA was isolated, and the quality and concentration were assessed, as
described in EXAMPLE 1. See FIG. 8A. cDNA was synthesized as described in
EXAMPLE 1.
                                                 55

[002711         To compare urine microvesicular RNA isolated by filtration (filter and
filtrate) and 100K centrifugal filter unit concentration, RT-PCRs were performed on mRNA
and non-coding RNA (including microRNA) using primers and probes specific to GAPDH,
RN7SL, RNaseP, miR-16, miR-150, and let-7a, as described in EXAMPLE 1. See FIG. 8B.
Example 9: Surface Charge (S Inhibition)
[00272]         Normal control plasma was obtained from Bioreclamation LLC, as described
in EXAMPLE 1.
[00273]         Isolation of 4mL plasma microvesicular RNA was conducted using
ultracentrifugation or modified 3um positively charged     Q regenerated  cellulose centrifugal
filtration or modified 3um negatively charged S regenerated cellulose centrifugal filtration.
[00274]         The ultracentrifugation sample was prepared, pelleted and lysed as described
in EXAMPLE 1.
[002751         In the 3um positively charged   Q regenerated  centrifugal filtration method
and the 3um negatively charged S regenerated cellulose centrifugal filtration method, the
spin columns were each modified by removing 21 out of 24 filter layers. One 1rmL aliquots
of plasma from the same four subjects used in the ultracentrifugation method were pooled.
[00276]         For the ultracentrifugation and filtration samples, microvesicular RNA was
isolated, and the quality and concentration were assessed, as described in EXAMPLE 1.
Prior to cDNA synthesis, the RNA was diluted 1:10 and 1:100. Three-fifths of the total
volume of microvesicular RNA, the 1:10 RNA dilution, and the 1:100 RNA dilution were
converted to cDNA using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Ca., USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol.
[002771         To determine if there was any inhibition of RT-PCR at the RNA level,
dilutions of microvesicular RNA isolated by filtration and ultracentrifugation were
compared. RT-PCRs were performed on GAPDH. The amplification reactions were
performed in a 20ul volume containing 2X Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Ca., USA), 20X Taqman Gene Expression Assay (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Ca., USA), and a 1:15 fraction of the cDNA reverse transcribed
with the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit. Amplification conditions were as
described in EXAMPLE 1. See FIG. 9.
                                                56

[002781         If there was not any inhibition of RT-PCR at the RNA level, each 1:10
dilution would result in a 3.3Ct increase, as shown in ultracentrifugation and 3um positively
charged  Q regenerated   cellulose filtration. However, the average Ct value decreased with
dilution for the 3um negatively charged S regenerated cellulose filtration, indication RT
PCR inhibition at the RNA level.
[002791         It was observed that the filters tended to clog when plasma samples were at a
pH set to less than or equal to 5.5 before loading, and the plasma would not spin through the
column.

            NaCl, pH 7.4
[00282]         Specifically, 16 1mL aliquots of plasma from one subject was pooled. 1.9mL
of the pooled plasma was transferred to eight 2.OmL Eppendorf tubes and pelleted at
21,130xg for 30 min at 8 0C. The microvesicle pellet was resuspended in 150ul of the
appropriate buffer and incubated for 20 min at room temp. The microvesicle pellet was then
lysed in 700ul Qiazol Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, Ca., USA).
[00283]         The microvesicular RNA was isolated, and the quality and concentration
were assessed, as described in EXAMPLE 1. See FIG. 10 A. cDNA was synthesized as
described in EXAMPLE 1.

[00286]         To determine the stability of plasma microvesicles in basic pH,
microvesicular pellets were resuspended in the following buffers:
        *    50mM Bis Tris Propane, 150mM NaCl, pH7
        *    50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH8
        *    50mM Diethanolamine, 150mM NaCl, pH9
        *    50mM Ethanolamine, 150mM NaCl, pHI
[002871         Plasma microvesicular RNA isolation and analysis was performed as
described in EXAMPLE 10. See FIG. 11 A and 11 B.
Example 12: Microvesicle capture and/or microvesicle stability on a charged
membrane are affected by buffer pH and/or buffer concentration and/or buffer type.
[00288]         Normal control plasma was obtained from Bioreclamation LLC, as described
in EXAMPLE 1.
[00289]         Isolation of 4.8mL plasma microvesicle RNA was conducted using
ultracentrifugation or 3um positively charged   Q regenerated cellulose centrifugal filtration.
[00290]         In the ultracentrifugation method, 1 mL aliquots of plasma from five subjects
were pooled. 4.8mL of the pooled plasma was transferred to a 5mL polyallomer tube
(Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA) containing 8 gL RNasin Plus (40 U/gl, Promega,
Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor, and incubated for 5 minutes at room temp.
Microvesicles were pelleted and lysed as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00291]         In the 3um positively charged  Q regenerated  cellulose centrifugal filtration
method, equilibration, loading, and wash buffers were tested with different buffer types and
pHs. The following buffer sets were used:
             *   100mM Bis Tris Propane, 150mM NaCl, pH6.8 (2X Loading Buffer) and
                50mM Bis Tris Propane, 150mM NaCl, pH7 (Equilibration and Wash
                Buffer),
             *   100mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH8 (2X Loading Buffer) and 50mM Tris,
                 150mM NaCl, pH8 (Equilibration and Wash Buffer), or
                                               58

             *   100mM Diethanolamine, 150mM NaCl, pH9 (2X Loading Buffer) and
                 50mM Diethanolamine, 150mM NaCl, pH9 (Equilibration and Wash
                Buffer).
[00292]         First, three 1rmL aliquots of plasma from the same five subjects used in the
ultracentrifugation method were pooled. 4.8mL of the pooled plasma was aliquoted into
separate 50mL conical tubes for each buffer set and mixed with 4.8mL of the appropriate
2X loading buffer. The pH of each diluted plasma sample was assessed for accuracy. Before
the plasma sample was applied, the filter was conditioned by passing through 5mL of the
appropriate equilibration buffer at 500xg for 5 min. Then, the plasma sample was passed
through the filter at 500xg for 5min. The filtrate was saved for further analysis. The filter
was washed twice with 18mL of the appropriate wash buffer at 500xg for 5min. Then the
microvesicles were lysed with Qiazol. ImL Qiazol was applied to the membrane and
distributed by centrifugation at 100xg for 1 sec. The filter was then incubated for 10 min at
room temp and eluted at 500xg for 5min.
[00293]         The filtrate samples were each prepared, pelleted and lysed as described in
EXAMPLE 1.
[00294]         For the ultracentrifugation and filtration (filter and filtrate) samples,
microvesicular RNA was isolated, and the quality and concentration were assessed, as
described in EXAMPLE 1. See FIG. 12A. cDNA was synthesized as described in
EXAMPLE 1.
[002951         To determine the preferred pH for microvesicular RNA filtration and to
compare microvesicular RNA isolated by filtration (filter and filtrate) and
ultracentrifugation, RT-PCRs were performed on mRNA and non-coding RNA (including
microRNA) using primers and probes specific to GAPDH, RN7SL, RNaseP, miR-16, miR
 150, and let-7a, as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00296]         As shown in FIG. 12B, pH and/or buffer type has a significant effect on the
filtration samples for GAPDH, RN7SL, RNaseP, let-7a, and miR-150. The 1OOmM Bis Tris
Propane, 150mM NaCl, pH6.8 (2X Loading Buffer) and 50mM Bis Tris Propane, 150mM
NaCl, pH7 (Equilibration and Wash Buffer) buffer set is preferred for the filter samples. pH
and/or buffer type does not have a significant effect on the filtration samples for miR-16.
Additionally, the levels of RNA for GAPDH, RN7SL, and RNaseP are similar for filter and
ultracentrifuge samples. The average Ct-value was 0.9Ct lower for let-7a and 0.7Ct higher
                                                59

for miR-150 in the ultracentrifuge sample compared to the preferred filter sample. The
average Ct-value was 2.3Ct lower for miR-16 in the ultracentrifuge sample compared to the
preferred filter sample. This is most likely due to differences in packaging of microRNA in
microvesicles. Some microRNAs are found in ribonucleoprotein complexes in plasma and
would not necessarily be captured by positively charged filtration.
Example 13: Microvesicle capture and/or microvesicle stability on a charged filter are
affected by buffer pH and/or buffer concentration and/or buffer type.

ultracentrifugation or 3um positively charged   Q regenerated  cellulose centrifugal filtration.
[00299]         In the ultracentrifugation method, 1 mL aliquots of plasma from four
subjects were pooled. 3.8mL of the pooled plasma was transferred to a 5mL polyallomer
tube (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA) containing 8 gL RNasin Plus (40 U/gl, Promega,
Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor, and incubated for 5 minutes at room temp. Following
incubation, the plasma was diluted in 1.2mL PBS. Microvesicles were pelleted and lysed as
described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00300]         In the 3um positively charged  Q regenerated   cellulose centrifugal filtration
method, equilibration, loading, and wash buffers were tested with different buffer types and
pHs. The following buffer sets were used:

Example 18: Microvesicle capture and microvesicle stability on a charged filter is not
affected by salt concentration of the loading or wash buffer.
[00333]         Normal control plasma was obtained from Bioreclamation LLC, as described
in EXAMPLE 1.
[00334]         Isolation of 3.8mL plasma microvesicle RNA was conducted using
ultracentrifugation or 3um positively charged  Q regenerated cellulose centrifugal filtration.
[00335]         The ultracentrifugation sample was prepared, pelleted, and lysed as described
in EXAMPLE 13.
[00336]         In the 3um positively charged Q regenerated  cellulose centrifugal filtration
method, equilibration and loading buffers were tested with varying salt concentrations. The
following buffer sets were used:
        *   100mM Bis Tris Propane, 0.15mM NaCl, pH6 (2X Loading Buffer) and 50mM
            Bis Tris Propane, 0.15mM NaCl, pH6.5 (Equilibration and Wash Buffer)
        *   100mM Bis Tris Propane, 1.05M NaCl, pH6 (2X Loading Buffer) and 50mM
            Bis Tris Propane, 0.6M NaCl, pH6.5 (Equilibration and Wash Buffer)
        *   1OOmM Bis Tris Propane, 2.25M NaCl, pH6 (2X Loading Buffer) and 50mM
            Bis Tris Propane, 1.2M NaCl, pH6.5 (Equilibration and Wash Buffer)

[003371          First, four 1rmL aliquots of plasma from the same four subjects used in the
ultracentrifugation method were pooled. 3.8mL of the pooled plasma was aliquoted into
separate 50mL conical tubes for each buffer set and mixed with 3.8mL of the appropriate
2X loading buffer. Before the plasma sample was applied, the filter was conditioned by
passing through 5mL of the appropriate equilibration buffer at 100xg for 5 min. Then, the
plasma sample was passed through the filter at 100xg for 5min. The filtrate was saved for
further analysis. The filter was washed with l8mL of the appropriate wash buffer at 100xg
for 5min. Then the microvesicles were lysed with Qiazol. 1mL Qiazol was applied to the
membrane and distributed by centrifugation at 100xg for 1 sec. The filter was then
incubated for 10 min at room temp and eluted at 200xg for 2min followed by 5000xg for
2min.
[00338]          For the ultracentrifugation and filtration samples, microvesicular RNA was
isolated, and the quality and concentration were assessed, as described in EXAMPLE 1. See
FIG. 18A. cDNA was synthesized as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00339]          To determine the preferred salt concentration for washing the plasma sample
in the filtration method and to compare microvesicular RNA isolated by filtration and
ultracentrifugation, RT-PCRs were performed on mRNA and non-coding RNA (including
microRNA) using primers and probes specific to GAPDH, RN7SL, HPRT 1, BRAF, miR
 16, and let-7a, as described in EXAMPLE 17. See FIG. 18B.

with Promega Lysis Reagent (Promega) method, one 1rmL aliquots of plasma from the same
four subjects used in the ultracentrifugation method were pooled and mixed with 4mL 2X
Loading Buffer (20mM Tris, pH7). Before the plasma sample was applied, the filter was
conditioned by passing through 25mL Equilibration Buffer (Millipore) by vacuum. Then,
the plasma sample was passed through the filter by vacuum. The filter was washed with
20mL Wash Buffer (10mM Tris, pH7) by vacuum. Then the microvesicles were lysed with
Promega Lysis Reagent. 2.25mL Promega Lysis Reagent was applied to the membrane and
distributed by drawing approximately 5 drops of Promega Lysis Reagent through the filter
by vacuum. The filter was then incubated for 5 min at room temp and eluted by vacuum. To
isolate the microvesicular RNA, 0.27 volume 100% isopropanol was added to the lysate,
mixed by pipet, transferred to a spin column, and centrifuged at 13,000xg for 30 sec until all
of the lysate was applied. The column was then washed twice with 500ul RNA Wash
Solution (Promega) at 13,000xg for 30 sec. A final 300ul RNA Wash Solution was applied
to the column at 13,000xg for 2 min. To dry the membrane, the column was centrifuged at
 13,000xg for 2 min. RNA was eluted with 20ul H 2 0 into a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube,
incubated at room temp for 1 min, and centrifuged at 10,000xg for 1 min.

[00360]          Normal control plasma was obtained in house, as described in EXAMPLE 1.
[00361]          Isolation of 4mL plasma microvesicular RNA was conducted using
ultracentrifugation or ExoMir kit (Bioo Scientific, Austin, Tx., USA) 20nm neutral
polyethersulfone syringe filtration.
[00362]          In the ultracentrifugation method, 4mL plasma from the same subject was
transferred to a 5mL polyallomer tube (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fl., USA) containing 8
gL RNasin Plus (40 U/gl, Promega, Madison, Wi., USA) RNase inhibitor, and incubated

filter (Tisch). See FIG. 24.
Example 25: Effect of RNA on Microvesicle Capture
[00373]          The microvesicle capture is RNA dependent. Some RNAs are more
efficiently captured on the filter compared to others (GAPDH vs. miR-45 1). This may
depend on whether the RNA is protected by proteins and/or microvesicles and on
microvesicle size. See FIG. 25.

[00378]          Microvesicular RNA yield is affected by a lysis buffer type when isolating
microvesicles on a neutral PES filter. See FIG. 30.
[003791          An additional elution with Qiazol does not significantly improve the RNA
yields in the isolation of microvesicular RNA on a 20nm PES neutral syringe filter. See
FIG. 31.
[00380]          Microvesicle stability and/or microvesicular RNA yield is affected by a wash
step when isolating microvesicles on a neutral filter. See FIG. 32.
[00381]          RNA gets stuck on the 20nm PES filter in a syringe format and cannot be
easily eluted off Larger RNA (ex. GAPDH) is harder to elute off than smaller RNA (let
7a). See FIG. 33.

[00382]                  The studies provided herein demonstrate the feasibility of using charged or
neutral (magnetic) beads for isolation of microvesicle RNA. These studies demonstrate
affinity capture with beads under various different conditions of charges or functional
groups, binding and wash buffers, bead loads/concentrations and/or incubation times. The
general flow chart for microvesicle isolation with beads and RNA extraction is shown in

positively charged quaternary amine with the anticipation that these positively charged
amines may capture microvesicles more effectively than the 10 or 20 amines. An overview
of the methods used in this study is presented in Figure 37. The following types of amine
magnetic beads were evaluated:
                                                                    75st..mated                                              Total

[003861                      Microvesicle capture was evaluated using RT-qPCR. Briefly, the following
steps were performed: lysis of captured microvesicles and extraction of total RNA by
Qiazole method; purification of total RNA with Qiagen miRNeasy kit/MinElute column (20
uL); checked RNA profile on Bioanalyzer (1 uL); RI reaction with VILO RI kit (l2uL)
and Micro RI kit (4 uL); Real time PCR with 2 uL of cDNA on the following targets:
VILO products (GAPDH (new assay kits), RN7SL, RNaseP, 132M, GUSB, HPRT 1)and
Micro RI products (miR16, miR150, Let-7a). Ihe microvesicle isolation results tested
using selected mRNA targets are shown in Figure 38, and the recovery of the selected
mRNA targets from the isolated microvesicles is shown in Figure 39. Ihe microvesicle
isolation results tested using selected micro RNA targets are shown in Figure 40, and the
recovery of the selected micro RNA targets from the isolated microvesicles is shown in
Figure 4 1.

TEA treated beads was evaluated in the studies described herein. Briefly, triplicates of
microvesicle isolation were performed with TEA Beads, 0.4 mE plasma pool BH1 1, qiazole
lysis and total RNA extraction (miRNeasy kit). A summary of the results is shown in the

[00389]         Without intending to be bound by theory, the data suggest that there might be
multiple classes of microvesicles bearing different surface (membrane) characteristics such
as charge, polarity, etc.. In addition to its membrane nature, each type of microvesicle may
carry different RNA expression patterns as well.
[00390]         Confirmation of Microvesicle Isolation with Other Beads: The studies
described herein were designed to confirm microvesicle isolation with other quaternary
amine or sulfonate functionalized non-magnetic ionic exchange beads. The following beads
were evaluated: Commercially manufactured (Hamilton); Quaternary Amine (Cationic)
Resin: PRP-X400 and Sulfonate (Anionic exchange) Resin: RCX30. The characteristics of
each bead type are summarized in the tables below:

                    P~.~                 O........A......u..      ...............

[003911         The microvesicle isolation results with non-magnetic beads using selected
mnRNA targets are shown in Figure 42, where X is cationic and R is anionic. The recovery
of these selected mRNA targets is shown in Figure 43. The microvesicle isolation results
                                                77

with non-magnetic beads using selected micro RNA targets are shown in Figure 44, where
X is cationic and R is anionic. The recovery of these selected micro RNA targets is shown
in Figure 45.
[00392]         In summary, results showed that microvesicles were not detected from
cationic exchange resin as analyzed from RT-qPCR on selected mRNA and micro RNA
targets. Anionic exchange resin captures microvesicles similarly to TEA treated magnetic
beads on the tested RNA targets. Gene dependent pattern in the distribution of microvesicle
RNA between supernatants and beads extraction was observed:

[00393]         Evaluation of microvesicle biding to selected control beads: In the studies
described herein, the background level of binding to various control beads was evaluated. In
these studies, untreated epoxy beads and unfunctionalized polysterene beads were used. In
particular, the following beads were tested:
Control Beads Tested:
[003941         The microvesicle isolation results with control beads using selected mRNA
targets are shown in Figure 46, and the recovery of these selected mRNA targets is shown in
Figure 47. The microvesicle isolation results with control using selected micro RNA targets
are shown in Figure 48, and the recovery of these selected micro RNA targets is shown in
Figure 49.
[003951          In summary, similar microvesicle isolation pattern was observed with both
anion exchangers (Hamilton TEA resin and in-house TEA modified beads). Sulfonate
exchanger (cation exchange resin) showed very poor microvesicle recovery as evaluated via
                                              78

RT-qPCR. Without intending to be bound by theory, this could be due to poor microvesicle
capturing and/or RT-qPCR inhibitors leached out from cation resin. However, a preliminary
study with carboxyl beads (cationic) did not show such effects as sulfonate resin; thus, it
may not be a general issue of cation exchangers Results showed a gene dependent pattern in
the distribution of microvesicle RNA between supernatants and beads extraction. Again,
without intending to be bound by theory, the data suggest that there might be multiple
classes of microvesicles bearing different surface (membrane) characteristics such as
charge, polarity, proteins (antigens), carbohydrates, etc.. The observed differential RNA
expression may indirectly associate to their microvesicle origins.
Example 28: Effect of Bead Titration of Capturing Efficiency and RNA Yield
[00396]           In the studies described herein, four types of beads were evaluated using a
fixed plasma volume (0.4 mL) and an increasing amount of beads to expand the beads to
microvesicle ratio (also referred to herein as B:E ratio) from 0.05:1 to 20:1. The following
table presents the characteristics of the magnetic beads used for microvesicle RNA isolation
in these studies:

5:1, to 10:1 for beads C; and from 0.2:1, 1:1, 4:1, 10:1, to 20:1 for beads D. The standard
control was ultracentrifugation with 0.4 mL plasma. An overview of the methods used in
this study is shown in Figure 50.
[003981           Evaluation of microvesicle capturing was performed via RT-qPCR. Real
time PCR was performed on the following 7 targets and recovery calculated using
ultracentrifugation results as 1000%: VILO products (GAPDH, RN7SL, RNaseP, B2M,

GUSB and HPRT1) and Micro RT products (Let-7a). The percent recovery as a function of
B:E ratio for each target is shown in Figures 51A-51G.
[00399]           A Ct comparison between individual and mixed beads is shown in Figure 52,
where the beads/microvesicle ratio was 2:1 for all targets. Ct values from mixed beads was
similar to bead C (PM), i.e., significantly higher than individual beads, except for let-7a
target. Without intending to be bound by theory, this is most likely an inhibitory effect of
bead C.
[00400]           A recovery comparison between individual and mixed beads is shown in
Figure 53, where the beads/microvesicle ratio was 2:1 for all targets. The % recovery from
mixed beads was similar to bead C, i.e., significantly lower than individual beads for all
targets, except let-7a. Without intending to be bound by theory, the poor recovery with
mixed beads is most likely an inhibitory effect from bead C. A summary of the % recovery

[004011          In summary, bead titration studies on selected RNA targets showed that a
2.5:1 ratio of bead/microvesicles as chosen in previous studies (tested with beads A & B),
achieves a saturation level for most genes (except RNAseP, GAPDH). Results showed
microvesicles are captured by beads with different surface characteristics (charged, neutral,
hydrophobic, etc.). Without intending to be bound by theory, this agrees with the previous
hypothesis: there might be multiple classes of microvesicles bearing different surface
(membrane) characteristics such as charge, polarity, etc. In addition to its membrane nature,
each type of microvesicle may carry different RNA expression patterns as well.
[00402]          Bead C (PM) appeared inhibitory to all targets tested except let-7a. The
inhibition could be at RT level (microRT kit for let-7a) or at microvesicle capturing. Mix of
A, B, C, and D beads performed similarly to bead C, suggesting that inhibition was
inherited from bead C. This also reduces the possibility of inhibition acting at microvesicle
capture. The source of inhibition can be confirmed by simply eliminating C from the mix of
4 beads.
Example 29: Titrations of Plasma Volume using a Fixed Beads to Microvesicle Ratio
[00403]          In the studies described herein, plasma titration was evaluated using four
types of beads to evaluate microvesicle recovery at a fixed bead:microvesicle ratio. The
characteristics of the beads used are shown in the table below:

Example 30: Time Course Study of Beads-Microvesicle Binding in Plasma
[00407]           In the studies described herein, epoxy magnetic beads (EPM-30) were
evaluated for binding to microvesicles (at a bead:microvesicle ratio of 5: 1) from 0.4 mL
plasma. The table below presents the magnetic beads used for microvesicle isolation in
these studies:
    A       Epoxy beads     Spherotech    Hyrpctie       EPM-20     2.85 urn   218 uL (5.5 mg) 2.4 X 108
[004081           An overview of the methods used in these studies is shown in Figure 57.
Five aliquots of EPM-30 beads mixed with 0.4 mL Plasma (B/E           = 5:1) were incubated at
40 C (on a rotor) and stopped at 1 min, 5 min, 15 min 30min, and 60 min. Beads were
separated and washed with 1X BB followed by Qiazol lysis and total RNA isolation with
miRNeasy kit. RT-qPCR was performed on selected mnRNA targets and let-7a microRNA.
The standard control was ultracentrifugation with 0.4 mL plasma.
[004091           The average Ct values for various targets in the time course study on epoxy
bead-microvesicle binding at 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min are shown in Figure
58, and the   00 recovery values for each target at the same time points are shown in Figure
59. The   00 recovery as a function of bead-microvesicle binding time is shown in Figure 60.
[004101           Results showed that 30 min (15 min for HPRT and let-7a) of incubation
gives the highest microvesicle RNA detection for all targets except EGFR. Signals started
declining at 60 min EGFR was detected with very poor signals         (~4.4%   recovery at 5 min).
Each single type of beads (Epoxy) seems performing similarly (in        00 recovery) (as observed
previously).
[004111           Future studies will be designed to evaluate whether microvesicles captured to
one beads type are the same as those bound to other types of beads, but through different
affinities/interactions.
Example 31: Additional Studies of Microvesicle Binding to Epoxy Beads
[004121           The studies described herein were designed to evaluate, if not captured
completely, whether the remaining microvesicles in the supernatant can be further captured
by additional fresh beads, and to evaluate the background level of microvesicle adsorption
                                                 83

to Eppendorf tube. An overview of these studies is shown in Figure 61. Briefly, these
studies were performed using the following steps:
            *   Performed one plasma (0.4 mL, pre-mixed in 1 mL of IX BB) binding
            sequentially to two epoxy beads aliquots (B/E ratio  =  5). Monitored beads bound
            microvesicles (to both aliquots) as well as free un-bound microvesicles present
            in the supernatant.
            *   Performed mock beads binding by adding pre-mixed plasma (0.4 mL) to an
            empty Eppendorf tube. Monitored tube bound microvesicles as well as free un
            bound microvesicles present in the supernatant.
            *   The amounts of microvesicles bound to beads/tube or free in the supernatant
            were measured and expressed as the amounts of selected RNA targets via RT
            qPCR (Note: qPCR was performed as single target assay).
[00413]         The average Ct values for a variety of RNA targets in collected fractions
(epoxy beads only) are shown in Figure 62, and the percent recovery for these RNA targets
is shown in Figure 63.
[00414]         A high linearity (R2>0.99) curve was determined for either EGFR or BRAF
standards, indicating a reliable RT-qPCR assay for either target. Results from sequential
beads binding study showed that microvesicles are primarily (90~124%) captured to the
first beads aliquot and <10% to the 2nd beads aliquot. However, there are still 7~59%
microvesicles present in the supernatant, suggesting that those microvesicles are either
inactive or not in the optimal conditions for beads binding. Mock beads binding results
showed that microvesicles are considered exclusively in the supernatants, only 0.05-0.5 10%
of them are adsorbed to the tube. While the capturing of EGFR microvesicles remains
problematic, future studies for screening and testing a variety of beads will be performed.
[004151         The studies provided herein have demonstrated the feasibility of
microvesicle isolation with beads (magnetic or non-magnetic) that would be a more suitable
format in clinical utility. Results showed that positively charged, negatively charged, and
neutral beads all showed good microvesicle capturing efficiencies. This observation
suggests that they may act on different ligands on the surface of microvesicle, thus one
microvesicle can be captured with different (functionalized) particles via different
(multiple) forces.
                                               84

Example 32: EXO50 Microvesicle Isolation and RNA Extraction
[00416]         This example describes EXO50 spin column and the protocol for
microvesicle isolation, subsequent RNA extraction, and target expression analysis of the
RNA preparation. The method described in this example was used for the following
experiments, optionally with some variation as described in the specific working example.
[004171         The EXO50 spin column, herein referred to as EXO50, comprises a
membrane filter (preferably,  Q functionalized).  The column can also comprise a column
holder that holds the membrane filter between the outer frit and an inner tube (FIG. 64). The
column is placed in a collection tube (FIG. 65). After adding the biological sample to the
membrane filter, the column is spun, and the flow-through is discarded. Wash buffer is
added to the membrane and the column is spun, and the flow-through is discarded. The
wash step may be repeated if desired. A lysis buffer, i.e., Qiazol, is then added to the
membrane for lysis of the microvesicles and subsequent release of microvesicle RNA. The
column is spun again to collect the microvesicle RNA. RNA extraction can be performed by
chloroform extraction and ethanol conditioning, and/or using silica columns and eluting the
isolated RNAs from the silica columns.
[00418]         Subsequent detection of RNA targets by quantitative PCR is utilized to
measure the quality of microvesicle isolation and/or RNA extraction. Once the RNA is
extracted from the microvesicle fraction, the RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA, for
example by using SuperscriptIl @ VILO cDNA Synthesis kit (Life Technologies) for
mRNA or miScriptII RT kit (Qiagen) for short RNAs. Quantitative PCR or Taqman
analysis is performed using specific RNA target primers, and optionally probes, to
determine Ct values. Expression analysis is performed in duplicate or triplicate.
[00419]         A variety of RNA targets were selected for expression analysis. Both large
(i.e., ribosomal RNA and messenger RNA) and small RNAs (i.e., miRNAs) were detected.
Examples of ribosomal RNAs detected include 18S and 28S. Target messenger RNAs
included housekeeping genes, such as HPRT 1, GAPDH. Other messenger RNAs included
cancer specific genes, such as wildtype (wt) BRAF, mutated BRAF V600E. Examples of
target miRNAs include let7a, miR16. In some experiments, target genes from control
particles, such as Qbeta were assessed (i.e., Qbeta coat protein).

Example 33: Analysis of Different Membrane Filters
[00420]        Membrane filters suitable for isolating microvesicles are preferably charged.
The table below presents the various types of membrane filters that are suitable of isolating
microvesicles:

               Paper
               ("DEAE")
[00421]        The ability of each of the membranes listed in the table above for isolating
microvesicles was assessed. Specifically, assessment of the RNA target signal (Ct values)
was determined as a means to quantify the quality of microvesicle isolation. Microvesicles
                                              86

were isolated using the following membranes: regenerated cellulose membranes, e.g.,
reinforced stabilize cellulose membranes that are reinforced with regenerated cellulose, a
metal chelate membrane, a regenerated cellulose coupling membrane, and DEAE cellulose
paper. The separation methods for each membrane tested are shown in the table above.
Biological samples were added to columns containing the different membranes, similar to
the column described in EXAMPLE 32. The flow-through was discarded and the
microvesicles were lysed, for example, on the membrane using lysis buffer. Microvesicle
RNA was subsequently extracted using a silica column. Detection of mRNA target genes
GAPDH, HPRT, and wildtype (wt) BRAF, and miRNA target genes hsa-let-7a and hsa
miR16 was determined by qPCR analysis (FIG. 66). Comparison of the Ct values obtained
for each membrane filter for each specific target genes demonstrated the capability of each
of the membranes to successfully isolate microvesicles from a biological sample. All buffer
conditions for each membrane were the same.
[00422]         As shown in FIG. 66, all of the membranes were able to isolate microvesicles
sufficient for RNA extraction and detection of at least one of the RNA targets. However,
membranes RC/SBAE; RC/WBAE; and RCCM performed better than the other membranes
tested. The RC/SBAE functionalized membrane performed the best in comparison to all
other membranes. Specifically, for each of the mRNA and miRNA targets assayed, lower Ct
values were obtained from the RNA preparation from microvesicles isolated by RC/SBAE
membrane compared to any other membrane from a microvesicle fraction. The capture
surface of the EXO50 columns described in the following examples is comprised of the
RC/SBAE membrane.
[00423]         These results demonstrate that positively charged (anionic) ion exchange
membranes purified vesicles at physiological pH. However, negatively charged ion
exchange inefficiently purified vesicles at physiological pH.
[00424]         FIG. 71 shows the microvesicles bound to the EXO50 membrane, as detected
by scanning electron microscopy. The arrows indicate the captured microvesicles.
Example 34: EX050 Membrane Input Capacity
[004251         Next, the input capacity of the RC/SBAE membrane was assessed by
titrating the amount of input plasma volume added to the membrane. Increasing volumes of
sample input was added to the RC/SBAE membrane; for example, 0.5ml, 1.Oml, 2.Oml,
                                               87

4.Oml, 8.Oml, and 16ml of plasma. Microvesicle fractions were isolated and microvesicle
RNA was extracted as described in Example 32. QPCR analysis was performed to detect
mRNA genes wt BRAF and HPRT1 and miRNAs let7a, miR16, and 18S. As shown in FIG.
67, the qPCR signal for both mRNA and miRNA genes increased linearly (i.e., a linear
decrease in Ct value) from samples between 0.5ml and 4.Oml. However, samples greater
than 4.Oml (i.e., 8.Oml and 16ml) failed to demonstrate additional increase in detected
signal. These results indicate that sample volumes greater than 4ml would not exhibit any
increased In FIG 68, the copy number from the RNA extracted from the microvesicle
fraction isolated by EXO50 was compared to the copy number from the flow-through. This
experiment identifies the maximal volume of sample input that would saturate the
membrane, such that microvesicles would be present in the flow-through and RNA signal
from the flow-through would be detected. For example, input volumes greater than 4.Oml
did not demonstrate linearly increased signal when compared to the signal detected from the
sample of 4.Oml. Consistent with these results, the signal detected from the flow through
increased with volumes greater than 4.Oml.
[00426]         Relative expression levels of various target genes were compared between
initial loading and isolation of the biological sample in a first EXO50 column to the flow
through in a second EXO50 column. Biological sample was added to EXO50, with
microvesicle isolation, RNA extraction and target gene analysis performed as described in
EXAMPLE 32. The flow-through from the first EXO50 column was then loaded onto a
second EXO50 column for microvesicle isolation, RNA extraction, and target gene analysis
with the same methods as used for the initial biological sample with the first EXO50
column. Varying volumes of initial biological sample (0.5ml - 16ml of plasma) was tested.
The target genes include mRNA targets: wt BRAF, GAPDH, and HPRT1; and miRNAs:
let7a, miR16; and ribosomal RNA 18S. The expression levels of each target gene were
normalized to the detected expression level of the corresponding target gene from the first
loading step. As shown in FIG. 69, the flow-through from samples between 0.5ml and
4.Oml had very little expression of any target genes, indicating that the EXO50 had
efficiently captured all of the microvesicles from the biological sample In contrast, the flow
through from samples of 8.Oml and 16ml showed at least 10% increase in expression
detected for some target genes, and up to 200% detected for other target genes. These
results show that the flow-through from the larger sample input volumes still contained
                                                88

microvesicles that were isolated from the second EXO50 column, thereby demonstrating
that sample volumes of 8ml and 16ml are not completely depleted of microvesicles.
Furthermore, these results demonstrate that two isolation and lysis steps are not needed to
isolate all of the microvesicles from a biological sample between 0.5ml and 4ml.
Example 35: Determining the Number of Membrane Layers to Deplete Sample
[00427]          The number of membrane layers was assessed for complete depletion of
microvesicle RNA from a 4.Oml plasma sample. One to six layers of RC/SBAE were placed
adjacent to one another in an EXO50 column. The microvesicle RNA was extracted and
analyzed as described in EXAMPLE 32 from the sample and from the flow-through. The
target genes assessed were wt BRAF and GAPDH.
[00428]          The results shown in FIG. 70 show that one and two layers were insufficient
to capture all of the microvesicles from the sample, as demonstrated by the signal detected
from the flow-through (filtrate) data points. However, the columns with 4 layers or more did
not show any increase in signal from the input data points, while the flow-through (filtrate)
was completely depleted of any signal. Thus, these results show that 3 layers is optimal to
ensure sufficient microvesicle capture, while increasing the number of layers to 4 or greater
does not yield any added benefit for microvesicle capture.
Example 36: EXO50 Buffer Conditions for Microvesicle Isolation
[00429]          Varying buffer conditions were assessed for optimal microvesicle isolation
using the EXO50 columns and methods as described in EXAMPLE 32. Different loading
buffers that were added to each sample for loading onto the column were assessed. The
buffers tested included:
             *    160mM Tris, 142mM Cl-, pH 7.0
             *    192mM imidazole; 159mM Cl-, pH 6.5-6.8
             *   300mM Bis Tris, 21 ImM Cl-, pH 6.3-6.4
             *   40mM Citrate, 124mM Na*, pH 6.7-6.9
             *   50mM Phosphate, 265mM Na*, 185mM Cl-, pH 7.0-7.2
             *   80mM Bis Tris Propane, 14mM Cl-, pH 6.7.
[00430]          As shown in FIG. 72, all buffers resulted in successful microvesicle
isolation, such that RNA targets BRAF, GAPDH, and HPRT were detected.
                                               89

[004311         Varying pH conditions were also assessed. Buffers were prepared at 2X PBS
pH 2.0, pH 4.75, pH 10.25, and pH 13.0 for loading the sample. Wash buffers were at IX.
 1000 copies of Qbeta was spiked with the sample upon loading into EXO50 column.
Buffers with increasing pH demonstrated that optimal buffer conditions are between pH 2
 10.25, while very basic buffers resulted in less efficient microvesicle isolation (FIG. 73).
The optimal range for isolation is between pH 4-8.
[00432]         Buffers were tested with varying amounts of detergent to show that the
process is tolerant to buffers with detergents of varying strength. FIG. 74 demonstrates that
SDS up to 0.001%, Triton X-100 up to 0.01%, and Tween up to 0.1% detergent in both the
binding and wash buffer resulted in successful microvesicle isolation and subsequent
microvesicle RNA extraction analysis.
Example 37: EXO50 RNA preparation
[00433]         The results shown in FIG. 76 demonstrate that the RNA purified by EXO50
is PCR-amplifiable RNA, i.e., suitable for amplification and PCR processing, and that
EXO50 isolates the same amount and quality of RNA as ultracentrifugation from a large
volume of plasma. 4ml of plasma sample were processed either by EXO50 or by
ultracentrifugation. Comparison of isolation and detection of RNA targets (wt BRAF,
GAPDH, Qbeta, let7a, miR16) showed that EXO50 purifies RNA of similar quality as
obtained by ultracentrifugation. With respect to some target genes, EXO50 was shown to
have improved RNA quality, as indicated by increased Ct signal.
[00434]         Furthermore, EXO50 purifies a high percentage of mRNA from
microvesicles. For example, EXO50 purifies 100% of mRNA from commercially available
cancer exosomes or cancer cell culture supernatant. Increasing input of commercial
available cancer exosomes from a colon cancer cell line (150, 1500, and 3000 ng) was
processed by EXO50 or by direct lysis (using Qiagen miRNeasy RNA isolation kit). The
results shown in FIG. 78 demonstrate that the flow-through fro EXO50 processing showed
no detection of mRNA (no Ct signal for RPLO and very high Ct signal for GAPDH),
therefore indicating that 100% of the mRNA was successfully extracted from the
microvesicle fraction of the sample.
[004351         The EXO50 RNA preparation also contains very little contaminating DNA.
The background level of detection of certain targets from the RNA preparation that is not
                                                90

reverse transcribed (-RT) shows that there is some background level of contaminating DNA
(FIG. 79). EXO50 RNA preparations were digested with RNase A, which showed loss of Ct
signal for the target genes, to show that the preparation mostly contains RNA and very little
contaminating DNA. QPCR analysis of the RNase-digested RNA prep showed very low
background level of BRAF similar to that detected when the sample is not reverse
transcribed. Addition of DNase was shown to remove the background DNA signal, as
shown by the loss of signal in the DNase-digested samples that were not reverse
transcribed.
Example 38: EXO 50 Operability Experiments
[00436]          EXO50 is robust for parallel processing of many samples. Eight 4ml of
plasma samples were processed in parallel using EXO50, with each sample having added 3
minutes of delay in pipetting for each single step in isolation. Thus, one sample was
processed as normal (0 minutes), a second sample was processed with 3 minutes between
each step (3 minutes), a third sample was processed with 6 minutes between each step (6
minutes), etc. with the eight sample processed with 21 minutes between each step. There
was no significant difference in the detected Ct values for targets GAPDH, wt BRAF, hsa
miR-142-3p, and hsa-miR-92a, even with 21 minutes between each step (FIG. 80). The
standard deviation for the individual assays between the isolation replicates were less than
0.5 Cts. This experiment demonstrates that the EXO50 process allows for processing of a
long row of replicates without change in isolation efficiency - as long as 21 minutes
pipetting time allows per step.
[004371          The operability of the EXO50 process by different users at different research
sites, using different qPCR analysis reagents was compared in an on-site experiment in
order to assess the ease of usability of the EXO50 process and the reproducibility of the
results. The sample used in this experiment comprised a pool of plasma from 900 single
blood draws. The sample was shipped on dry-ice to 8 different labs, some on different
continents. Each lab performed the EXO50 process with 2ml or 0.2ml plasma in triplicate.
RT-qPCR analysis on 2 mRNAs (i.e., wt BRAF, GAPDH) and 2 miRNAs (i.e., miR- 16 and
let-7a) was performed, and the results were compared in FIG. 81. In all labs the EXO50
procedure is reproducible and the PCR output scales linear with plasma input from 0.2 mL
to 2 mL. First-time users using the same PCR primers showed very similar output PCR
                                                91

signal (FIG. 81). These results demonstrate the robustness of the EXO50 for reproducibility
independent of user and research site.
Example 39: EX050 Mini Spin-Column Format
[004381         The EXO50 format was also adapted to a mini-spin column format to assess
its reproducibility and scalability. The EXO50 mini format comprises a miniature
RC/SBAE membrane. Miniature RC/WBAE and RC/SACE membranes were also tested for
comparison. 2ml and 0.2ml of plasma sample was tested. The standard buffers were used:
binding buffer (2X) 100mM Phosphate Buffer, 370mM NaCl; wash buffer (iX) 50mM
phosphate buffer, 185mM NaCl. The results from the mini-format was also compared to
ultracentrifugation. Detection of target mRNAs and miRNAs showed that the miniature
RC/SBAE membrane had the best Ct signal compared to the miniature RC/SACE and
miniature RC/WBAE membranes (FIG. 84). The comparison between EXO50 mini format
(RC/SBAE membrane) and ultracentrifugation is shown in FIG. 83.
Example 40: Comparison of EX050 to Other Methods
[00439]         The standard ultracentrifugation process comprises pre-filtering the
biological sample, i.e., plasma through a 0.8tm filter. The filtrate is then loaded into an
ultracentrifuge and spun at >100,000xg for 1-3 hours. The supernatant is removed and the
pellet containing the microvesicles is lysed. The microvesicle RNA is then purified on a
silica column, i.e., a commercially available RNA isolation column (Qiagen), using
manufacturer's protocol.
[00440]         Comparison of bioanalyzer profiles from the RNA extracted by
ultracentrifugation or by EXO50 were similar with respect to RNA-size distributions (FIG.
86). EXO50 was shown to isolate both small and large RNAs. Separation of the
microvesicle RNA was achieved by ethanol fractionation. rRNA (i.e., large RNA) peaks
were clearly visible at 2Kb and 4Kb. The majority of the isolated small RNAs were between
50-200 base pairs.
[00441]         Comparison between ultracentrifugation, EXO50, and self-assembled
membrane capture system is shown in FIG. 87. The self-assembled membrane capture
system also comprises Q-functionalized membranes. Two separate technical replicate
extractions are shown for each column. The non-filled circles (miR-16 and miR-92a) are
                                               92

known to exist as free circulating protein bound miRNAs. The results shown herein
demonstrate that EXO50 and the self-assembled      Q membranes   result in increased Ct signal
for microvesicle RNA targets.
[00442]         A similar comparison experiment was also performed using 0.2ml of plasma,
comparing ultracentrifugation, direct lysis, and EXO50. As shown in FIG. 88, EXO50 also
performed better than direct lysis for most all genes. EXO50 flow-through demonstrates that
some miRNA signal was still detected in the flow-through.
[00443]         However, increasing sample volumes to 4ml plasma showed that EXO50 had
increased detected Ct signal in comparison to ultracentrifugation (FIG. 89).
Example 41: EXO50 Detection of Cancer Mutations
[00444]         Importantly, EXO50 was shown to successfully detect cancer mutations from
2ml plasma samples from a melanoma patient. Samples were processed by
ultracentrifugation (UC) or EXO50. The copy number was determined by qPCR analysis of
wild-type BRAF (wt BRAF) and compared to the copy number of mutated BRAF (BRAF
V600E). As shown in FIG. 90, ultracentrifugation and EXO50 were both able to detect wt
BRAF copies. However, only EXO50 was able to detect the presence of mutated BRAF
V600E. These results demonstrate that EXO50 was able to detect cancer mutations from
microvesicle RNA, while ultracentrifugation was unable to resolve the presence of the
cancer mutation.
Example 42: EXO51 Elution Step
[004451         This example shows the optional elution step for isolating the microvesicles
from the filter membrane prior to RNA lysis and extraction, also referred to herein as
EXO5 1. Specifically, the microvesicles were isolated from the EXO50 column by a
wash/elution step to isolate intact isolated microvesicles from the membrane. 1Oml of
wash/elution buffer was added to the column twice. In some cases, a different NaCl
concentration was used the first time compared to the second time, while in some cases, the
same NaCl concentrations were used. For example, 185mM, 10OOmM, and 2000mM NaCl
buffer was used for the first wash. For the second was, 185mM, 1000mM, and 2000mM
NaCl buffer was used. The columns were spun at 5,000xg for 1 minute. Comparison of Ct
values for various genes (i.e., GAPDH, BRAF, Kras, etc.) using the various elution
                                               93

protocols compared to EXO50 demonstrated that RNA isolation of EXO51 was comparable
to that of EXO50 (FIG. 91).
[00446]         Scanning electron microscopy of the eluted microvesicles from EXO51
showed that microvesicles from 50-200 nm in size (FIG. 85). In comparison, microvesicles
isolated by ultracentrifugation revealed more fibrous protein structure-like materials in the
isolated microvesicles, which can potentially affect RNA lysis and extraction, RNA purity,
and ability to detect/amply RNA sequences from the RNA preparation. The EXO51
isolation contained particles that are similar to purified material obtained using UC
procedures, but not similar to source material. The flow-through from the EXO51 method
still contained a large amount of particles that were different from purified vesicle material.
[004471         An additional concentrating step can be utilized with the EXO51 protocol.
Various spin concentrators (for example, VivaSpin 20 columns) with different size cutoff
values were used, for example, 10,000 MW, 50,000 MW, and 100,000 MW cutoff
concentrators were used. The eluates were spun for 5 minutes. If the retentate volume was
too high (> 200 gL), the retentate was spin in 5 min increments to the desired volume, i.e.,
less than 200 gL. The concentrated eluate was transferred from the upper chamber of the
concentrator (filter side) with gentle resuspending. The concentrated eluate was filled up to
200 gL total volume by using 1x wash buffer. Then the samples were ready for lysis and
RNA extraction. Concentration spin speeds and times ranged from 800xg and 4500xg for
concentrating the microvesicle eluate without significant changes to RNA yield or
subsequent Ct values obtained from RNA expression analysis.
Example 43: EX052 Isolation of DNA
[00448]         The EXO50 column can also be used to isolate all of the DNA from the
plasma. Two methods for utilizing the EXO50 column for DNA isolation in addition to
RNA is depicted in FIG. 92 (EX052) and FIG. 93 (EX052.2). Specifically, the difference
between the two processes EX052 and EX052.2, is that the RNA and DNA extraction is
combined in one tube in EX052.2, for ease in usability, streamlining of the protocol, and
increased reproducibility. FIG. 94 shows a gain of 1.5 Cts in EXO50 RNA + DNA
(EX052.2). FIG. 95 shows that increasing the amount of chloroform during phase
separation adds the DNA back to the aqueous phase, such that the DNA is co-isolated with
                                                94

the normal EXO50 procedure. Further optimization of pH levels during phase separation
also adds the DNA to the prep, as shown in FIG. 96.
[00449]         Thus, the EXO50 methods can be used, as shown in EX052 and EX052.2,
to isolate all DNA from plasma samples. The DNA is recovered from the lower,
hydrophobic phase of the QIAzol lysis after phase separation. The EXO50 methods, in
combination with the EX052 methods (e.g., EX052 or EX052.2), separate RNA and DNA
at similar levels for the same sample volume, and the RNA and DNA can be separated from
each other. These methods of the disclosure capture the same or more mRNA and much
more miRNA than a commercially available isolation kit, e.g., Qiagen.
Example 44: EX060 Microvesicle Isolation and RNA Extraction from CSF
[004501         This example demonstrates that microvesicle RNA can be isolated and
extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the EXO50 RC/SBAE membrane
containing column, in the process referred to herein as EXO60.
[004511         A titration experiment was performed, with increasing volumes of CSF
sample (0.5ml, 1ml, 2ml, and 4ml) from a patient. The CSF sample was pre-filtered by
0.8um filter before freezing. The CSF was processed through the column as described in
EXAMPLE 32. The results from qPCR analysis are shown in FIG. 97 and show that Ct
signal for target genes (both mRNA and miRNAs) increased linearly with sample volume.
This experiment demonstrates that EXO60 successfully isolated microvesicles from CSF
samples.
[00452]         An additional experiment was performed, comparing EXO60 and
ultracentrifugation from different patient samples and sources. Flow-through from the
EXO60 isolation and supernatant from the ultracentrifugation were also assessed to
determine the quality of the microvesicle extraction. Genes assessed were mRNA targets
GAPDH and HIF1A, and miRNA targets hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-124-3p. As shown in
Figure 99, the microvesicle RNA was successfully isolated, similar to results obtained from
ultracentrifugation.
[00453]         As shown in Figure 100, EXO60 isolates RNA from CSF better than
methods based on size filtration or ultracentrifugation. For EXO60, the RNA was extracted
using 70% EtOH, while the uCSC extraction used 30% isopropanol, and the UC extraction
used 60% EtOH. EXO60 demonstrated a linear PCR output in a range from at least 0.2 to 2
                                               95

mL of CSF input. In the flow-through of EXO60, only some miR-16 miRNA was found,
and no GAPDH and HIF1A mRNA was found. In contrast for the uCSC extractions, miR
 16 was found only in the columns fraction, and GAPDH and HIF1A and some miR-16 were
found in the flow-through fraction. The UC extraction showed that most of the mRNA and
miRNA remained in the supernatant. No HIFla and only some GAPDH were found in the
pellet fraction.
Example 45: EX070 Microvesicle Isolation and RNA Extraction from Urine
[00454]          The studies presented herein were designed to compare EXO50-based
isolation of microvesicle RNA, a method referred to herein as EXO70, with filtration based
isolation (uCSC). Each isolation method was run using a 20 ml urine sample. For the
EXO70 isolation, the RNA was extracted isolated according to EXAMPLE 32, but with
30% EtOH for mRNA-only capture. For the uCSC isolation, the RNA was extracted and
isolated according to EXAMPLE 32.
[00455]          As shown in Figure 101, RNA isolated by EXO70 and filtration
demonstrated similar RNA size-distributions when the ethanol conditioning was adjusted to
only isolate large RNAs. The studies also demonstrated that both methods yielded PCR
signal of the same strength.
[00456]          As shown in Figures 102, 103A and 103B, the load of the flow-throughs
from EXO70 to a fresh uCSC column yielded much higher Ct values (about 8 Ct values) for
the mRNA signal, signifying that in the flow-through are only less than 1% signal is left.
Thus, EXO70 captured mRNA and miRNA with > 99% efficiency since there was less than
 1% of mRNA and miRNAs left in the flow through.
[00457]          The flow-through from the uCSC loaded on an EXO70 column yielded little
to no signal for the mRNAs in 2 of 4 patients, and if there was a signal detectable then it
was about 15 Ct values higher than the on-column data point. There is less than 1% mRNA
signal left in the urine flow-through both EXO70 and uCSC.
Example 46: EXO50 Microvesicle Isolation in Cell Supernatant Samples
[00458]          The studies presented herein were designed to test the use the EXO50
methods and kits with cell supernatant samples. The samples were processed as set forth
above in EXAMPLE 32.
                                               96

[004591         As seen in Figures 104 and 105, EXO50 isolated vesicle RNA from human cell
culture supernatant. Different concentrations of 2x Binding Buffer (BB) with the Gli36 cell line
supernatant were used, as shown in Figure 105.
