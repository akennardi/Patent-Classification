                                      SOLAR SHEETING FOR ROOFING OR WALLING
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   The present invention relates to sheeting or cladding for the roofing and walling of buildings. In
 5 particular the invention concerns the integration of solar photovoltaic modules with the sheeting or
   cladding.
   RELATED APPLICATION
   This application is a divisional application of application no. <removed-apn>.

   BACKGROUND
   As the world seeks to harness renewable forms of energy such as solar, the large catchment area for
   solar radiation offered by building cladding makes such cladding an ideal location for photovoltaic
   (PV) modules.

   Solar photovoltaic panels are often rigid modules that are framed and glass encapsulated. These panels
   are typically roof mounted by attaching the panels to dedicated mounting structures installed onto the
   roof. The panels may be flush mounted to align with the roof surface or installed at an angle of tilt.
   Solar panels installed onto roofs in this manner are known as Building Attached Photovoltaic (BAPV)
 0 modules.
   An emerging market is developing for photovoltaic modules that are integrated as part of the roofing
   or walling material itself. Solar modules installed in this manner are known as Building Integrated
   Photovoltaic (BIPV) modules. BIPV modules are attractive from an aesthetic standpoint and enable
25 solar energy generation to be embodied seamlessly as part of the building envelope. BIPV modules are
   currently far less common than BAPV modules because they present significantly greater design
   challenges. For example, photovoltaic modules generally need to be mounted on a flat or nearly flat
   surface in order for the cells of which they are made to be exposed to similar levels of incident solar
   radiation and for the modules to perform optimally. However, roof sheeting with spanning capability
30 is generally not flat as it must have sufficient strength to achieve an acceptable level of foot traffic
   loading and wind uplift resistance.
   There are known BIPV modules that must be supported by a continuous underlayer of plywood
   sarking or similar in order to provide adequate strength and spanning capability. These sheets can be
35 self-supporting if the gauge of the metal is increased sufficiently and there is adequate batten support,

   but in colder climates such as Northern Europe they normally form the exterior layer of a multi
   skinned roofing system.
   It is against this background that the problems and difficulties associated therewith that the present
 5 invention has been developed.
   Certain objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following
   description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and
   example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.

   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
   Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, where there is illustrated a solar sheeting assembly 10 according to
   a first embodiment of the invention. The solar sheeting assembly 10 includes a cladding sheet (or
   panel) 20 which is roll formed from sheet metal so as have a cross-sectional profile which is
25 substantially constant throughout a length of the sheet 20.
   The cross-section of the cladding sheet 20 comprises a pair of opposing lengthwise extending edges, a
   standing seam portion 22 and 24 extending along each edge, a lengthwise extending rib 26 (formed by
   swaging) inset with respect to each standing seam portion 22 and 24, and a substantially flat portion 28
30 defined between the ribs 26. The portion of the cladding sheet 20 defined between the standing seam
   portions 22 and 24 is commonly referred to as 'a pan'.
   The ribs 26 increase the bending strength of the cladding sheet 20 in the direction perpendicular
   thereto, so each cladding sheet 20 is manufactured in lengths which extend in this direction.
35
                                                        4
   10371947_1 (GHMatters) P98765.AU.2

   A first standing seam portion 22 of the cladding sheet 20 terminates in an overlap portion 22A, and the
   distal standing seam portion 24 terminates in an underlap portion 24A, and in use, a pair of matching
   cladding sheets 20 can be arranged contiguously lengthwise (and secured to supporting structure such
   as battens) with the overlap portion 22A of a first cladding sheet 20 overlapping the under lap portion
 5 24A of a matching adjacent cladding sheet 20. The solar sheeting assemblies 10 can be retained from
   beneath by clips (not illustrated) extending between the supporting structure and the overlapping seam
   portions 22A and 24A.
   The solar sheeting assembly 10 further includes a photovoltaic solar sheet comprised of modules 30
 0 secured to the substantially flat portion 28 defined between the ribs 26. In this way, the ribs 26 protect
   the edges of the photovoltaic solar modules 30.
   Each solar module 30 is a thin film solar module. The preferred photovoltaic module 30 to be used is
   one based upon Copper, Indium, Gallium, Selenide (CIGS) semiconductor technology. An example of
 5 a CIGS module 30, is the SoloPanel SF1 manufactured by Solopower, Inc. This module 30 is flexible,
   thin, lightweight and more efficient than traditional amorphous-silicon technology in converting
   sunlight to electricity.
   The thin film solar modules 30 may have single pole electrical junction boxes 35 located at the top and
 0 bottom of each module 30 which makes them suitable for end to end series connection, as illustrated in
   Figure 4. The main wiring conduit at the ridge cap which routes all the electricity to an inverter would
   have a number of plug-in points which enables series connection of the modules on each sheet to
   modules on all other sheets.
25 In the illustrated embodiment, each solar module 30 is secured to the cladding sheet 10 by an elongate
   strip of double sided adhesive tape 40, as illustrated Figure 3. Such an adhesive tape 40 secures the
   solar module 30 to the cladding sheet 10 across its full width and along its full length.
   The solar sheeting assembly 10 as illustrated in the Figures provides a building integrated photovoltaic
30 (BIPV) solution that is suitable for roofing and/or walling of buildings and structures such as carports,
   verandas, sheds and the like.
   Producing cladding sheets 20 from steel rather than aluminium permits use of these in the construction
   of single skin buildings with larger spans. Furthermore, because of the small dead weight and the
35 absence of structural height, additional loading of the support structure when compared with standard
   cladding sheets is minimal. As such, the solar cladding sheet assemblies 10 are ideal for retro fit.
                                                        5

   Shadowing is detrimental to the electrical output of photovoltaic modules because the module's output
   can drop to the level of its lowest performing cell. An important advantage of the solar sheet assembly
   10 according to the present invention is that this is configured to prevent (or at least minimise)
   shadowing caused by the standing seam portions 22 and 24, and the resulting loss of electrical output.
 5 This is especially important for installations in mid-latitudes, where the sun drops below 45 degrees or
   so.
   Referring now to Figure 6, where there is illustrated a solar sheeting assembly 100 according to a
   second embodiment of the invention. The solar sheeting assembly 100 includes a cladding sheet (or
 0 panel) 120 which differs from cladding sheet 20 described above only in that it comprises an array of
   three (3) near equi-spaced, lengthwise extending ribs 26.
   As before, solar sheeting assembly 100 further includes a photovoltaic solar sheet comprised of
   modules 30 laterally bridging the array of ribs 20 and supported intermediate the ribs 20 by strips of
 5 double sided adhesive tape 40 of such a thickness as to fill the void beneath the modules 30 in the
   regions intermediate the ribs 20.It will be understood that the term "comprise" and any of its
   derivatives (eg comprises, comprising) as used in this specification is to be taken to be inclusive of
   features to which it refers, and is not meant to exclude the presence of any additional features unless
   otherwise stated or implied.

   acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common general
   knowledge.
25 Although an illustrative embodiment of the present invention has been described in the foregoing
   detailed description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiment
   disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without
   departing from the scope of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims.
