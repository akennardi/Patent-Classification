                              Lifting and support device
Technical Field
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a lifting and support device. In particular, the
present invention relates to a device for use in lifting and supporting truck and bus hubs and
brake drums. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that that the
invention may be used in other applications.
Background of the Invention
[0002] When removing truck and bus hubs for servicing the seals and/or brake assemblies,
it is generally necessary to remove the wheel from the truck and also the hub. In practice,
this can be a difficult process due to the weight of the hubs, especially with respect to large
truck and bus hubs.
[0003] There are several inherent problems associated with existing hub removal
techniques. Firstly, in the scenario that the hubs are manually lifted, there is a significant risk
of back and other injuries. The larger the truck, generally the more weight of the hub, and
hence the more manpower that is required to manually lift the hub.
[0004] The hubs are typically at least 70kg each, which is far more weight than a person
should attempt to lift safely. Furthermore, the combined weight of the drum and hub can be
over 100 kilograms for large trucks. This poses a significant operational health and safety
risk in the work place. Even if two or more technicians work together, this amount of weight
can still cause back injuries, which is a significant problem from the perspective of
operational health and safety.
[0005] A further problem with manual lifting techniques concerns possible damage to the
threaded studs which secure the wheel onto the axle. Ideally, the hub should be pulled from
the axle horizontally to ensure that the holes formed on the hub provide a clearance around
the threaded shafts. If the hub is pulled from the shaft unintentionally at an angle, such that
the hub is angled slightly away from the intended vertical plane, then there is a risk that the
circumferential edge of each hole may scrape on the threads. This can damage the threads,
and if the damage is significant, it can result in the damaged stud being unable to receive
the nut intended to hold the hub in position. Alternatively, one or more of the studs may
break, such that the studs would have to be replaced.

                                               2
[0006] This kind of damage can occur when the hub is removed manually. Alternatively, if
the hub is removed with a fork lift or other such mechanical lifting machinery, there is a risk
of this kind of damage to the threaded studs.
[0007] If the hub is removed at an angle relative to the rotational axis of the hub, as
described above, there is also a risk of damage to the seals.
Object of the Invention
[0008] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least
ameliorate one or more of the above disadvantages, or at least to provide a useful
alternative.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0036] A lifting and support device 100 is disclosed herein. The lifting and support device
100 is described with respect to brake drum and wheel hub lifting, and the lifting and
support device 100 is intended to be used with disc brake assemblies and brake drum and
hub assemblies.
[0037] However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the lifting and support
device 100 may be used in other industrial applications such as the fitting and maintenance
of cutting edges for buckets on earth moving equipment.

                                                 5
[0038] The lifting and support device 100 includes a platform 110. The platform 110 is
defined by a surface or tray which remains generally horizontal relative to an underlying
support surface in all modes of operation.
[0039] The lifting and support device 100 includes a wheel frame or base 120. In the
embodiment depicted in Fig. 1, the wheel base 120 is defined by a generally rectangular
frame having a wheel 130 located at or near each corner. In one embodiment, the wheels
130 may be locking wheels which enable the user to selectively isolate the device 100 at a
desired location.
[0040] Referring to Fig. 1, the platform 110 is connected to the wheel base 120 with two
pairs of pivotal struts 140. As such, the platform 110, wheel base 120, and struts 140
together define a parallelogram (when viewed in the side view of Fig. 2) which can be
selectively altered in shape, to thereby raise or lower the height of the platform 110 relative
to the wheel base 120.
[0041] The mechanism to raise or lower the platform 110 is provided by a pneumatic or
hydraulic cylinder lever action lift 152. This enables the user to selectively pump a lifting
peddle 150 to raise the platform 110. A lowering pedal 170 is also provided to enable the
user to selectively lower the platform 110. However, other lifting and lowering arrangements
may alternatively be deployed, such as hand operated buttons for an electric version.
[0042] The lifting and support device 100 includes a handle 160 for moving the device 110.
A handle extension (not shown) may be screwed into or otherwise attached to the handle
160.
[0043] Referring to Fig. 1, a pair of generally parallel tubes or bars 180 are secured to the
platform 110. The tubes 180 provide a seat for supporting a hub or drum.
[0044] A pair of leafs or spacers 200 are seated on the tubes 180. As shown in Fig. 2, each
spacer 200 includes a fastener 210 for securing the spacer 200 to the tube 180. As such, the
spacers 200 can selectively slide longitudinally along the tubes 180. The spacers 200 enable
the user to remove the truck hub without having to also remove the backing plate located on
the rear side of the hub.
[0045] The spacers 200 may be swung out of the way if not required. However, if they are
to be used, the spacers 200 can be locked in position.
[0046] The wheel lifting and support device 100 includes an engagement assembly 300 for
securing the drum to the device 100. The engagement assembly 300 is best seen in Figs. 1

                                                6
to 4. The engagement assembly 300 includes a height adjustment mechanism 310. In the
embodiment depicted in the drawings, the height adjustment mechanism 310 includes a
scissor jack 315. The scissor jack 315 has a proximal end 320 which is secured to the
 platform 110. The scissor jack 315 has a distal end 330 having an engagement formation
340.
 [0047] Referring to the embodiment depicted in Fig.4, the scissor jack 315 has a drive
screw 335 and a hexagonal or octagonal headed drive member 345 for expanding and
contracting the jack 315.
 [0048] Referring to Fig. 1, the scissor jack 315 is depicted in a partially retracted
configuration. In contrast, the scissor jack 315 is operable to move between a fully retracted
configuration (in which the scissor jack 315 is generally adjacent to the platform 110) and an
expanded configuration (in which an upper portion of the scissor jack 315 is furthest from
the platform 110). In the embodiment depicted in the drawings, the jack 315 is shown as a
scissor type jack. However, it will be appreciated that the height adjustment mechanism 310
 may be provided in other forms which enable vertical height adjustment of the engagement
formation 340.
 [0049] The engagement formation 340 is used to engage the threaded studs on the truck
 hub. As shown in Fig 2, the engagement formation 340 includes two sliding arms 350. Each
sliding arm 350 can be selectively moved in a longitudinal direction, which is generally
 parallel to the platform 110. As shown in Fig. 3, each sliding arm 350 is operated by a
 handle 360. By rotating the handles 360, the sliding arms 350 can be moved toward or away
from each other. A leading end of each sliding arm 350 includes an engagement finger 370.
An underside of each engagement finger 370 is angled at approximately 45 degrees relative
to the platform 110. As such, the engagement finger 370 defines an angular recess 380. The
 recess 380 is located between each finger 370 and a polymer protection plate 390.
 [0050] The operation of the lifting and support device 100 will now be described. When a
 user, such as a mechanic or technician, wishes to remove a wheel drum or hub, the wheel
 lifting and support device 100 is wheeled to a suitable located beneath the drum. The user
then operates pedal 150 to expand a pneumatic cylinder 152 and thereby raise the platform
 110 until the two bars 180 are seated on opposing sides of a circumferential lowermost
 portion of the drum.
 [0051] The user then raises the height adjustment mechanism 310 by raising the scissor
jack 315. The jack 315 is raised until two threaded studs of the hub are seated on the slide

                                                 7
plate 390. The user then operates the handles 360 to bring the engagement tips 370 toward
each other. As the tips come closer to each other, the two studs become located in the
recesses 380. This provides a means for preventing the drum assembly from tilting relative
to an axis of rotation of the drum assembly. Advantageously, this reduces the risk of damage
to the seal located on the rear side of the drum assembly.
[0052] The user may also secure a strap (not shown) to the frame of the wheel lifting and
support device 100. The strap is passed over the drum, to provide an additional protection
against the drum unintentionally moving relative to the lifting and support device 100.
[0053] Referring to Fig. 1, a bar 405 is located on each side of the device 100, adjacent to
the platform 110. The bar 405 provides a support for holding a hook located at each end of
the strap. This enables the longitudinal position of the strap to be readily adjusted during
fastening, to best suit the location of the drum.
[0054] The platform 110 is rotatable relative to the support structure. As shown in Figs. 3
and 4, a bolt 400 passes from the upper surface of the platform 110, in a generally central
region of the platform 110. The bolt 400 provides a rotation axis for the upper surface of the
platform. In this embodiment, the platform 110 consists of an upper layer 420, and a
generally parallel lower layer 430.
[0055] Referring to Fig. 3, the bolt 400 is secured at an underside of the platform 110 with
a nut. A locking mechanism 432 may be provided to lock the upper layer 420 of the platform
110 at one or more desired rotational orientations.
[0056] A safety lock may be provided to prevent the platform 110 from accidentally or
unintentionally falling.
[0057] Referring to Figs. 5 to 8, a hub rotating or spinning device 500 is disclosed. The hub
spinner 500 includes a stand 510 which is seated on a pair of support feet 520. The support
feet 520 are depicted as longitudinally extending members, but it will be appreciated by
those skilled in the art that other configurations may be possible.
[0058] The hub spinner 500 includes a hub support cradle 530. The cradle 530 supports an
adaptor plate 540 having a plurality of stud receiving holes 550 located on an equal pitch
circle diameter. The adaptor plate 540 may be interchanged as required to suit different
hubs which have studs having different angular spacing or pitch circle diameters.
[0059] In one embodiment, not shown, the adaptor plate 540 may include more than one
set of stud receiving holes 550, located on different pitch circle diameters, so that different

                                                 8
hubs can be accommodated on the same adaptor plate 540. Alternatively, the stud receiving
holes 550 may be provided in the form of radially extending slots.
[0060] The hub spinner 500, is configured to rotate the hub about a horizontal axis XX
which extends generally perpendicular to an axis of rotation of the hub. The hub spinner
includes a locking formation to selectively isolate rotation of the hub at a desired angular
orientation.
[0061] The hub spinner 500 operates with the lifting and support device 100 described
above to provide a hub maintenance system. When a hub is mounted to the lifting and
support device 100, the device 100 can be wheeled to a located adjacent to the hub spinner
500. The frames of the hub spinner 500 and the device 100 are designed to have
corresponding abutment portions for correct positioning relative to each other. The height of
the hub can be jacked up or down to achieve the intended vertical placement, so that the
hub studs are in alignment with the stud receiving holes 550. The lifting and support device
100 is then moved so that the studs enter the stud receiving holes 550. Once the studs are
inserted, at least two nuts are secured, to secure the hub to the hub spinner 500.
[0062] The hub spinner 500 includes a stopper 560 which enables the user to set a desired
angular rotation end point, about the axis XX. This enables the technician to easily return the
hub to the same starting angle for return to the vehicle.
[0063] The hub spinner 500 includes a rotation mechanism in the form of an angle drive
mechanism 570 to rotate the hub about the axis XX. The rotation mechanism secures the
hub at the desired angular position, and prevents slipping of the hub. The technician can
manually rotate the hub to the desired location at which the bearing cones are readily
accessible for removal, replacement or adjustment. Typically, the angle drive mechanism 570
is operable with a 14 mm socket. However, it will be appreciated that other rotation drive
systems may be deployed, which provide a controlled rotation. For example, an electric
motor and brake could be deployed.
[0064] Once the hub bearing cones have been replaced, the technician may use the angle
drive mechanism 570 to rotate the hub in the opposing sense about the axis XX. The stopper
560 defines the limit of rotation, thereby indicating to the technician when the hub has
returned to the starting point. At this time, the hub can be removed by undoing the nuts
from the studs, and the hub is returned to the hub lifting and support device 100. The
retention strap is used to secure the hub to the lifting and support device 100 for safety, and
the hub may be returned to the vehicle.

                                                 9
[0065] The hub spinner 500 is intended to be used in one direction only, such that the hub
support cradle 530 has a concave side for receiving the hub.
[0066] The lifting and support device 100 is described with respect to a scissor jack, such
as a 1000kg scissor jack. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other
varieties of jack may alternatively be deployed.
[0067] Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, it
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many
other forms.
