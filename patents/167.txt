DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0087] In one aspect described herein, there is provided a support 100. In a general embodiment as
shown in Figure 1, support 100 comprises a shelf 50 and a connector 20, shown generally as element
20 in Figure 1, for connecting the shelf 50 to an electrical outlet (not shown in this view). Various
embodiments of connector 20 will be described in more detail below.
[0088] Figure 2 shows another embodiment of support 100, in which shelf 50 comprises at least one
aperture 55. The at least one aperture 55 is used to receive and retain a cable that is used to connect the
electrical device to the electrical outlet as will become apparent when describing further embodiments
below.
[0089] Figure 3 shows an embodiment of support 100 in which the aperture 55 is provided as a cut
out portion extending inwards from an edge 51 of shelf 50. In another embodiment as shown in Figure
4, shelf 50 comprises two apertures, including aperture 55 and aperture 56 provided as the cut-out
portion from edge 51. In a further embodiment, shelf 50 comprises two apertures, being cut-out
portions 56 provided at each end of the shelf 50, with no central aperture 55.

                                                       8
[0090] Figure 5 shows another embodiment of support 100 in which shelf 50 comprises three
apertures, being aperture 55 and two apertures 56 provided as cut-out portions from respective edges
51 and 52 of shelf 50. In other embodiments, any other number of apertures 55 can be provided,
including 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more than 10.
[0091] In other embodiments, shelf 50 of support 100 further comprises a friction portion 60. The
friction portion 60 acts to increase the frictional forces between shelf 50 and any electrical device
placed on shelf 50 and over friction portion 60. This reduces the likelihood of the electrical device on
shelf 50 from sliding off the shelf when being supported by support 100. In some embodiments,
friction portion 60 is provided as multiple discrete tabs, strips, dots or any other suitable configuration.
In some embodiments, the entire surface of shelf 50 is coated so as to provide friction portion 60. In
further embodiments, there is no discrete additional portion or material to the surface of the shelf 50,
but the surface, or a portion of the shelf 50 is roughened or otherwise treated to provide a portion of
higher coefficient of friction than the unroughened or otherwise untreated surface, to provide the
friction portion 60.
[0092] Friction portion 60 can be made from any suitable material such as rubber, non-slip materials
such as foam, silicon rubber or thermoplastic elastomer, or a material that has low friction but whose
surface has been roughened or otherwise treated to increase its friction. In fact any material that
provides a coefficient of friction between the material and the electrical device that is greater than the
coefficient of friction between the electrical device and the material from which the shelf is made, is a
suitable material for friction portion 60. Shelf 50 can be made from any suitable material that has the
strength to support the weight of a desired electrical device as will be understood by the person skilled
in the art. Such materials include plastic, such as engineering thermoplastic materials, wood, and metal
such as aluminium.
[0093] In another embodiment, support 100 comprises a padded portion 70 on shelf 50. Padded
portion 70 provides some cushioning to reduce any damage to the shelf 50 and/or the electrical device
(not shown in this view) from impact or other interactions between the electrical device and the shelf.
Padded portion 70 can be of any suitable material, including rubber, foam, silicon rubber or
thermoplastic elastomers.
[0094] In some embodiments, the padded portion 70 and the friction portion 60 are provided by the
same material, such as a layer of rubber, which can provide both increased friction and some
cushioning.

                                                       9
[0095] Figure 8 shows a top view of another embodiment of support 100. In this view, the top of shelf
50 is shown, including aperture 55 and apertures (cut-out portions) 56 on each edge 51 and 52. At least
partially-overlaying these apertures, is flexible portion 80, with respective flexible apertures 81,
substantially aligned with the apertures 55, 56 of shelf 50. The flexible apertures serve to reduce the
effective area of the apertures 55 and 56 to assist in more strongly retaining any cable received within
the apertures 55, 56, while being deformable to allow the cable to be introduced and removed from the
apertures 55, 56 by the user with some manual force.
[0096] Any suitable material can be used for flexible portion 80, including rubber, plastic sheet,
foam, silicon rubber or thermoplastic elastomers, and in some embodiments, the same portion of
material can provide at least two of friction portion 60, padded portion 70 and flexible portion 80. In
other embodiments, the same portion of material can provide each of the friction portion 60, padded
portion 70 and flexible portion 80.
[0097] In another embodiment as shown in Figure 9A, shelf 50 of support 100 also has a barrier 90
located at, at least a portion of a length 53 of the shelf 50. In the embodiment shown in Figure 9A,
barrier 90 is a length of material extending substantially perpendicularly from the plane of the shelf 50
along substantially the entire length 53. In some embodiments, barrier 90 is angled from the
perpendicular, either towards shelf 50 or away from shelf 50.
[0098] Barrier 90 acts to provide a barrier to reduce the risk of the electrical device supported by
support 100 on shelf 50 from sliding off shelf 50 when in use.
[0099] In the embodiment of Figure 9B, barrier 90 comprises a sheet of material located along only a
portion of length 53. In the embodiment of Figure 9C, barrier 90 comprises two cylindrical posts
located at respective points along length 53. In the embodiment in Figure 9D, barrier 90 comprises a
length of material as a triangular strip.
[00100]           It will also be appreciated that barrier 90 need not be located exactly at the edge 53,
but may be inset inwards of the edge on shelf 50.
[00101]           Figures 1OA to 1OG show another embodiment of support 100, in which connector 20
is provided by a faceplate 30 for engaging with an electrical outlet or a part of an electrical outlet (not
shown). In this embodiment, connector 20/faceplate 30 has a faceplate aperture 35 which provides
access to the electrical socket(s) of the electrical outlet as will be described in more detail with
reference to Figures 13A to 14C below.

                                                       10
[00102]           Figure 1OA is a top view of support 100, showing shelf 50 with apertures 55 and 56,
and barrier 90. Figure 1OB is a front view showing shelf 50, barrier 90 and faceplate aperture 35 in
connector 20/faceplate 30. In this embodiment, barrier 90 is simply a portion of shelf 50 bent upwards,
forming length 53. Figure 1OC is a right side view of support 100 showing shelf 50, barrier 90,
aperture 56 and connector 20/faceplate 30. Also visible in this view are retaining clips 31 which retain
connector 20/faceplate 30 to the electrical outlet or a part of the electrical outlet as will be described in
more detail below. Figure 1OD shows a left side view of support 100, Figure 1OE shows a bottom view
looking up, Figure 1OF shows a rear perspective view of support 100, showing the shelf 50, barrier 90,
apertures 55 and 56 and connector 20/faceplate 30 with faceplate aperture 35 and retaining clips 31.
Figure 1OG shows a front perspective view, showing shelf 50, barrier 90, apertures 55 and 56,

[00103]           Retaining clips 31 can be provided by any suitable means for connecting and/or
retaining faceplate 30 to electrical outlet 200. In the examples shown in Figures 1 IC, 1 ID, 1IE and
1 IF, the retaining clips are standards face plate clips that slot into corresponding slots in the outlet 200
as will be understood by the person skilled in the art. Any other suitable means is also possible as will
be understood by the person skilled in the art
[00104]           Other means of retaining the faceplate 30 to the electrical outlet 200 include magnets,
other clips, pin and socket arrangements and adhesives.
[00105]           Figures 1 A to 1 IG show another embodiment of support 100. In this embodiment, as
shown in Figures 1IB, 1IF and 1 IG, connector 20/faceplate 30 has multiple faceplate apertures 35. In
this embodiment, these faceplate apertures 35 fit over and allow access to electrical sockets and
switches as described in more detail with reference to Figures 12A to 12H as described further below.
[00106]           Figures 12A to 12D show the support 100 of Figures 1lA to 1 IE and 1IG when
connected to an electrical outlet 200, or part of an electrical outlet 200. Figure 12A shows a front view
of the electrical outlet 200 with electrical socket 210 being provided by power sockets 211, and two
electrical switches 220. The sockets and switches align with the faceplate apertures 35 as seen in
Figures 1 B and 1IE, to allow them to be accessed when support 100 is in place. Also seen in Figure
12A is barrier 90.
[00107]           It will be appreciated that the power sockets 211 can be of any type and will vary
from country to country and include but are not limited to, single pin-co-axial sockets, 2-pin sockets
and 3-pin sockets.

                                                       11
[00108]           Figure 12B is a left side view of support 100 engaged with electrical outlet 200. This
view also shows switch 220 protruding through faceplate aperture 35.
[00109]           Figure 12C shows a top perspective view, showing the details of the shelf 50 of
support 100, including apertures 55 and 56. Figure 12D shows a front perspective view showing
electrical outlet 200 with power sockets 211 and switches 220; and support 100 with shelf 50 and
barrier 90. In this view, friction portion 60 is also seen disposed on shelf 50. As previously described,
friction portion can also provide the padded portion 70 and flexible portion 80.
[00110]           Figure 12E shows a top perspective view of another embodiment, in which power
outlet 200 with power sockets 211 supports support 100. Support 100 comprises shelf 50 with
apertures 55 and 56. In this embodiment, apertures 56 on each edge have a right-angled turn to provide
an additional securement for a cable (not shown) connecting an electrical device (not shown) to one of
the power outlets 211. This view also shows flexible portion 80 providing flexible apertures 81 laid
over apertures 56 to further retain a cable located within aperture 56 as previously described. Again, in
this embodiment, flexible portion 80 can also provide friction portion 60 and/or padded portion 70.
[00111]           Figure 12F shows a rear perspective view of electrical outlet 200 showing in this
view, power socket terminals 214 for connection to a mains or supply power, and switch mechanisms
221 containing the working components of the electrical switches 211 on the front side of the power
outlet 200. Figure 12F also shows support 100 with shelf 50, barrier 90 and apertures 55 and 56, with
flexible portion 80 and flexible apertures 81 over apertures 56.
[00112]           Figure 12G shows an application of the electrical outlet 200 with support 100, on
which an electrical device 300 (in this embodiment, a smart phone) is supported. Figure 12H shows
the same arrangement as in Figure 12G, but with the electrical device 300 being a tablet.
[00113]           In use, one end of a charging cable is inserted into the charging port of the electrical
device 300, and the other end is inserted into the power socket 211, either directly or via an adapter as
will be understood by the person skilled in the art. In this orientation, use of one or more of the
apertures 56 can be made to retain the cable to assist with keeping the arrangement tidy. The action of
barrier 90 of assisting to retain electrical device 300 on the shelf 50 can be seen in Figures 12G and
12H.
[00114]           Figure 13A shows the application of the support 100 as shown in Figures 1OA to 1OG.
In this application, the electrical sockets 210 are provided by Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports 213,

                                                       12
which can be used for data transfer and/or charging. In this embodiment, the faceplate aperture 35
allows access to these electrical sockets for use by the user.
 [00115]          Figure 13B shows the arrangement of Figure 13A in use, supporting an electrical
device 300, being in this case, a smartphone. In this application, the smartphone 300 is supported in a
vertical orientation on shelf 50, as opposed to the horizontal orientation shown in Figure 12G. When in
this orientation, use of aperture 55 can be made to allow cable 310 to access the data/charging port of
the electrical device directly. In this application, apertures 56 are not required, although could be used
as well if the cable 310 is excessively long.
 [00116]          Figure 14A shows another embodiment of the electrical outlet 200 with support 100,
supporting an electrical device 300. In this embodiment, electrical sockets 210 are data sockets 212,
and in this specific example, of the RJ-45 type of connector. It will be appreciated that data socket 212
can be for any other type of connector type, including but not limited to RJ 11, RJ 14, RJ25, RJ48,
