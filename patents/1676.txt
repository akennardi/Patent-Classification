This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013319737, the
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:
The present invention relates to a lyophilized pharmaceutical formulation comprising
antibacterial agent, daptomycin and tocopheryl phosphate hydrolysate mixture (TPM).
More particularly, the invention relates to stable, lyophilized daptomycin formulation
with improved reconstitution time and to the process of preparation thereof.
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:
Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent derived from the fermentation of
Streptomyces     roseosporus.      The chemical     name    is     N-decanoyl-L-tryptophyl-D
asparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-threonylglycyl-L-ornithyl-L-aspartyl-D-alanyl-L
aspartylglycyl-D-seryl-threo-3-methyl     -L-glutamyl-3-anthraniloyl-L-alanine     gl-lactone.
The chemical structure is:
                                       0                       ,'N
                              M.I
                                  T- N
Daptomycin is first disclosed in US4537717. The empirical formula is C72 HIoN]7 O2 6; the
molecular weight is 1620.67
Daptomycin is marketed in the United States under the trade name Cubicin in the form of
injection containing 500mg/vial marketed by Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc.            In Europe,
Cubicin is marketed by Novartis Europharm as Cubicin powder that is made up into a
solution for injection or infusion (drip into a vein). The single vials contain 350mg or
500mg of the active, Daptomycin. In Australia, cubicin is marketed by Novartis
Pharmaceuticals, Australia Pty limited as injectables containing 350mg or 500mg of
active, daptomycin per vial.

                                                  2
The currently marketed formulations of injectable Daptomycin are supplied in a single
use vial as a sterile, preservative-free, pale yellow to light brown, lyophilized cake
containing approximately 500 mg or 350mg of daptomycin for intravenous (IV) use
following reconstitution with 0.9% sodium chloride injection. The only inactive
ingredient is sodium hydroxide, which is used in minimal quantities for pH adjustment.
Freshly reconstituted solutions of Cubicin range in color from pale yellow to light brown.
During the preparation of Cubicin for administration, it is essential that the contents of the
vial should be reconstituted using aseptic technique which is described below:
     i.  Avoiding vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution to
         minimize foaming;
     ii. Removing     the polypropylene flip-off cap from the vial to expose the central
         portion of the rubber stopper;
    iii. Slowly transferring 10 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection through the center
         of the rubber stopper into the vial, pointing the transfer needle towards the wall of
         the vial;
     iv. Ensuring that the entire product is wetted by gently rotating the vial;
    v. Allowing the product to stand undisturbed for 10 minutes; and
    vi. Gently rotating or swirling the vial contents for a few minutes, as needed, to
         obtain a completely reconstituted solution.
The aseptic technique mentioned above for the preparation of final intravenous (IV)
solution is tedious. Further, as per Cubicin's pack insert the reconstituted solution is
stable in the vial for 12 hours at room temperature and up to 48 hours if stored under
refrigeration at 2 to 8'C (36 to 46'F).
Thus as indicated above, the major drawbacks of the innovator formulation is the long
reconstitution procedure where the finished product to be administered needs to be
reconstituted which takes about 10 min followed by gentle rotation or swirling of the
vial contents for another few minutes, as needed, to obtain a completely clear solution for
administration. Thus too much time is wasted before the product is administered to the
patient who could be critical during emergency cases as the drug is indicated for treating

                                               3
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections and complicated skin and skin structure
infections (cSSSI). Also, it increases the product exposure to room temperature which
could lead to product degradation.
In view of the above, it is the object of the present invention to provide a daptomycin
parental formulation that can be directly reconstituted with a vehicle with a reduced
reconstitution time.
The other object of the invention is to increase the stability of the product at room
temperature and to increase the rate of solubilization of lyophilized product thereby
reducing the time required for reconstitution.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:
In accordance with the objective, the present invention provides a lyophilized parental
formulation consisting of antibacterial agent daptomycin- as active, tocopheryl phosphate
hydrolysate mixture (TPM), which acts as an antioxidant as well as solubilizer. The
present composition increases the stability of the product at room temperature after
reconstitution, improves the reconstitution time, thus accelerating the administration
process to the patient in need of.
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process of preparation of the current
formulation thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:
The present invention is described herein after in more details substantiating various
embodiments and conditions of reaction for better understanding/ appreciation of the
invention.
The present invention relates to a stable, lyophilized pharmaceutical formulation
comprising antibacterial agent, daptomycin as active ingredient in an amount in the range
of 350mg-500 mg, tocopheryl phosphate hydrolysate mixture (TPM), wherein said
lyophilized formulation is directly reconstitutable within 5 minutes for parental
administration. Preferably, 0.5 % tocopheryl phosphate hydrolysate is used.
The lyophilized pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention provides an
improved reconstitution time and increases stability of the reconstituted formulation at
room temperature.
Tocopheryl phosphate hydrolysate mixture (TPM) used in the present formulation acts as
an antioxidant as well as solubilizer which increase the stability and storage capacity of
the finished product after reconstitution at room temperature for 24 hours in contrast to
the innovator product which needs to be used within 12 hours of reconstitution when
stored at room temperature.
Further, the present formulation can be directly reconstituted with 0.9% Sodium chloride
with a reduced reconstitution time of not more than 5 minutes as compared to soaking the
product for 10 minutes followed by gentle rotation or swirling the vial contents for a few
more minutes for complete dissolution.
As compared with the RLD (Cubicin) marketed formulation the present invention
possesses various advantages. Soak time of about 10 minutes as specified in the RLD
label is not required; the product of the present invention can be directly reconstituted
with a vehicle with a reduced reconstitution time of not more than 5 minutes as compared

                                                 5
to soaking the product for 10 minutes followed by gentle rotation or swirling the vial
contents for few minutes for complete dissolution.
Thus, it reduces the waiting period for the patient due to less time required for
reconstitution, thereby     accelerating the administration   process, decreases product
exposure of product to room temperature by increasing the stability, increased stability of
the reconstituted injection when stored at room temperature.
The comparative reconstitution time for RLD (Cubicin) vs. In-house (IH) developed
Generic 500 mg formulation (formulation composition in-line with RLD) vs. 500 mg
formulation of present Invention (daptormycin with TPM) is depicted in example 3.
Further, the stability data at room temperature as well as at 2 to 8'C, of the reconstituted
solution of lyophilized daptomycin injection of the present invention is illustrated in
example 4. At room temperature, the reconstituted solution of the present invention was
stable up to 24hours and up to 72 hours at 2 to 8'C.
The parental administration in the current invention is preferably intravenous (IV)
administration.
