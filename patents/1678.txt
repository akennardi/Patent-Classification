                                         ABSTRACT
         Autonomous connection switching in a wireless communication network
An access point of a wireless communication network serves a connection to a user
equipment. The access point determines a plurality of target access points. Further, the
access point sends a message to the user equipment. The message indicates the plurality of
target access points and authorizes the user equipment to autonomously switch the
connection to one or more of the target access points.

           Autonomous connection switching in a wireless communication network
 5 Technical Field
   The present invention relates to methods for managing a connection between a user
   equipment and a wireless communication network and to corresponding devices.
10 Background
   For cellular networks, e.g., as specified by 3GPP ( 3 rd Generation Partnership Project),
   handover (HO) procedures are defined which allow for maintaining an ongoing connection of
   a user equipment (UE) while moving between different serving cells.
15
   For example, in the case of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology, such HO procedures
   are specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 V12.0.0 (2014-01). In these HO procedures, the UE which
   is in a mode referred to as "RRCconnected", i.e., has an active connection to the cellular
   network, typically monitors a set of neighboring cells. These measurements may trigger
20 sending of a measurement report from the UE to its serving base station, in the LTE
   technology referred to as eNB (evolved Node B). A typical example of such triggering event,
   referred to as "Event A3", corresponds to the measurement result for the neighboring cell
   being better than the present serving cell plus an offset. The measurement result may for
   example be expressed in terms of Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) or Reference
25 Signal Received Quality (RSRQ). The triggering event further requires that such condition is
   met for a certain minimum duration, specified by a parameter referred to as "timeToTrigger".
   On the basis of the measurement report, the serving eNB decides whether a HO of the UE
   should be performed or not. When deciding to perform a HO of the UE, the serving eNB
   prepares the HO by sending a HO request to an eNB controlling a target cell for the HO. As a
30 part of this HO request, the serving eNB also provides context information of the UE, e.g.,
   concerning a current Access Stratum (AS) configuration and UE-specific Radio Resource
   Management (RRM) information. In response, the eNB controlling the target cell generates a
   HO command. The serving eNB then forwards the HO command to the UE. This is done in a
   transparent manner, i.e., the information provided to the UE is determined at the eNB
35 controlling the target cell and not modified by the serving eNB. The HO command which is
   sent to the UE for example includes the identity, and optionally the frequency, of the target
   cell and RRC information common to all UEs in the target cell, such as information required

                                                  -2
   to perform a random access, a dedicated radio resource configuration; a security
   configuration, or a cell-specific radio network temporary identity (C-RNTI) to be used in the
   target cell. Using such information, the UE may then proceed by performing a random
   access to the target cell. If the random access is successful, the UE confirms successful
 5 completion of the HO to the eNB controlling the target cell, which then becomes the new
   serving eNB for the UE.
   In some scenarios, a network initiated HO may also be performed without a preceding Event
   A3 and measurement report from the UE. In such a case, the UE does not know the target
10 cell before receiving the HO command from the serving eNB.
   As can be seen, the above-mentioned known HO procedure requires rather complex
   interaction between the serving eNB, the eNB controlling the target cell, and the UE, which
   means that such a HO can be time consuming.
15
   To meet future demands on wireless communication networks, a network deployment
   referred to as Ultra Dense Network (UDN) is being discussed (see, e.g., Ericsson White
   Paper "5G Radio Access", June 2013, published in the Internet). For such a UDN it is
   suggested to use a large number of densely deployed access points (APs) and to utilize
20 higher bandwidths and higher frequency bands than for example in the LTE technology, e.g.,
   a bandwidth of several 100 MHz or even up to the GHz range and a frequency band in the
   range of 10-100 GHz.
   A typical application scenario for a UDN deployment is in highly populated areas such as hot
25 spots, office buildings, or urban centers, which may have a demand of high data rate service.
   However, it can be expected that for such UDN deployment in a high frequency band weak
   scattering and diffraction may cause a significant attenuation difference between NLOS (non
   line of sight) and LOS (line of sight) radio links. Consequently, there may be a lot of areas
30 with weak signal levels or even sudden signal outage, i.e., radio coverage holes. Accordingly,
   existing mobility concepts may not be adequate for such deployments. For example, the
   higher density of APs may result in an excessive amount of HO procedures and
   unacceptable signalling overhead or service degradation. Further, a sudden signal outage
   may even have the effect that a conventional network-initiated HO procedure as mentioned
35 above cannot be performed, e.g., because the signal outage prevents the UE from sending
   the measurement report or receiving the HO command.

                                                -3
   Accordingly, there is a need for techniques which allow for efficiently managing the
   connection of a UE to a wireless communication network.

   message indicates a plurality of target access points and authorizes the UE to autonomously
20 switch the connection to one or more of the indicated target access points. According to the
   method, the UE further detects a triggering event. In response to detecting the triggering
   event, the UE switches the connection to one or more of the target access points. The
   message further indicates one or more conditions to be evaluated by the UE for triggering

35 the target access points.

   Detailed Description of Embodiments
   In the following, concepts according to embodiments of the invention will be explained in
   more detail by referring to the accompanying drawings. The illustrated concepts relate to
30 management of connection switching in a wireless communication network. In the illustrated
   embodiments, it is assumed that the wireless communication network is based on a UDN
   deployment. In particular, the wireless communication network may use densely spaced
   access points, e.g., with distances between neighboring access points in the range of 1 m to
   1000 m, typically in the range of 2 m to 500 m. Further, the access points may operate in a
35 radio frequency band between 10 GHz and 100 GHz, which means that there can be a
   significant difference in link quality between a LOS link and a NLOS link. However, it is to be
   understood that the illustrated concepts could be applied in a corresponding manner to other

                                                  -6
   radio technologies, e.g., LTE, UMTS (Universal Terrestrial Mobile Telecommunications
   System) or Wideband CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), or CDMA2000.
   Fig. 1 schematically illustrates structures of the wireless communication network and an
 5 exemplary UE 50. In particular, Fig. 1 illustrates a plurality of access points 100-1, 100-2,
   100-3, 100-4 of the wireless communication network, which may be used by the UE 50 for
   connecting to the wireless communication network. Here, it should be noted that a
   connection between the UE 50 and the wireless communication network may be formed by
   selecting an appropriate access point 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4 and setting up a radio link
10 between the UE 50 and this access point 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4. In the exemplary
   scenario illustrated in Fig. 1, the connection is formed by a radio link to the access point 100
   1. This access point 100-1, which maintains the active connection between the UE 50 and
   the wireless communication network, may also be referred to as serving access point of the
   UE 50. In some cases, a connection may also utilize multiple radio links to different access
15 points 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4, which may then cooperatively serve the UE 50.
   As mentioned above, the wireless communication network may utilize a high frequency band
   in the range of 10 GHz to 100 GHz, in particular a frequency band above 30 GHz, such as in
   the range around 60 GHz. This frequency region above 30 GHz is also referred to as MMW
20 (Millimetre Wave) band.
   In such high frequency band, relatively high radio attenuation and relatively low radio
   diffraction have the effect that typically a LOS radio link will have significantly better quality
   than a NLOS radio link. However, since a LOS radio link radio link is sensitive to propagation
25 obstacles, fast switching of the connection between different access points 100-1, 100-2,
   100-3, 100-4, may be necessary to maintain the connection. For example, due to movement
   of the UE 50 an obstacle may affect the LOS radio link to the access point 100-1, which
   means that switching of the connection to another access point 100-2, 100-3, 100-3, 100-4 is
   needed. Similar effects may occur in the case of moving propagation obstacles, e.g., a
30 person moving into the LOS between the UE 50 and the current serving access point 100-1.
   Because the transition from a LOS condition to a NLOS condition may occur suddenly, there
   is a risk of a sudden failure of the radio link to the current serving access point 100-1. This
   may in turn have the effect that the UE 50 is no longer able to report measurements to the
   serving access point 100-1 and that the serving access point 100-1 is not able to send
35 control commands to the UE 50. Accordingly, a conventional HO procedure as for example
   described in 3GPP TS 36.331 may not be applicable in these circumstances.

                                                  -7
   According to the concepts as further explained in the following, the above situation may be
   addressed by managing the switching of the connection between the access points 100-1,
   100-2, 100-3, 100-4, in such a way that it can be autonomously performed by the UE 50. For
   this purpose, the current serving access point 100-1 may proactively send a message to the
 5 UE 50 for authorizing the UE 50 to autonomously switch the connection to one or more target
   access points indicated in the message. Accordingly, the overall management of the
   connection is still network based, but the actual switching process may be performed
   autonomously by the UE 50. In the following, the above message will also be referred to as
   switching authorization message. The switching authorization message may be sent at an
10 early point of time, before switching of the connection to another access point becomes
   necessary and while the radio link to the current serving access point 100-1 is still intact. The
   switching authorization message may also include information with respect to the different
   indicated target access points to be used be the UE 50 when switching the connection to one
   or more of these target access points. For example, such information may include
15 configurations of the target access points, switching conditions, usable radio resources,
   configurations to be used by the UE 50 to access the target access points, or the like.The UE
   50 may then decide whether and when to perform the switching and also select the most
   appropriate target access point(s) from the indicated target access points. This is
   accomplished in an autonomous manner, i.e., without requiring further interaction between
20 the UE 50 and the current serving access point 100-1. Accordingly, fast switching of the
   connection is also possible in situations where the radio link to the current serving access
   point 100-1 fails. In this way, the illustrated concepts may allow for avoiding a service
   interruption due to a complete failure of the ongoing connection.
25 Various conditions may be evaluated by the current serving access point for triggering
   sending of the switching authorization message. For example, the current serving access
   point may perform measurements and trigger sending of the switching authorization
   message depending on these measurements. Such measurements may for example pertain
   to the quality of the radio link between the UE 50 and the current serving access point 100-1
30 or to the velocity at which the UE 50 moves.
   Fig. 2 further illustrates the above concepts by referring to an exemplary procedure of
   switching the connection of the UE 50 from the current serving access point 100-1 to another
   access point 100-2.
35
   In the procedure of Fig. 2, the connection between the UE 50 and the wireless
   communication      network is established at step 201. As illustrated, the connection is

                                                 -8
   established by setting up a radio link between the UE 50 and the access point 100-1. The
   access point 100-1 thus becomes the serving access point for the UE 50.
   At step 202, the access point 100-1 detects a triggering event. The triggering event may for
 5 example correspond to the establishment of the connection at step 201. Further, the
   triggering event may be based on certain measurements and/or evaluations performed by
   the access point 100-1. For example, the access point 100-1 could measure and evaluate
   the quality of the radio link between the UE 50 and the access point 100-1, e.g., in terms of a
   channel quality indicator, beacon power level, or achievable bitrate. The triggering event
10 could then correspond to the quality of the radio link being below a given threshold value.
   Further, the access point 100-1 could determine a probability of a failure of the radio link
   between the UE 50 and the access point 100-1. For example, this could be accomplished on
   the basis of statistical information on radio coverage holes in a radio coverage area of the
   access point 100-1 and on information on the position or movement of the UE 50. Further,
15 the access point 100-1 could measure a velocity of the UE 50, e.g., by evaluating radio
   signals transmitted by the UE 50, and the triggering event could correspond to the velocity of
   the UE 50 exceeding a given threshold value. In this case, it can be taken into account that a
   fast moving UE is more likely to require switching to another access point than a slowly
   moving or static UE. Further, the access point 100-1 may evaluate whether a switching
20 authorization message which was previously sent to the UE 50 is still valid or outdated and
   trigger sending the switching authorization message when the previously sent switching
   authorization message is no longer valid. This may for example be accomplished by
   providing a timer which is reset each time when the access point 100-1 sends a new
   switching authorization message to the UE 50 and using expiry of the timer as the triggering
25 event.
   At step 203, the access point 100-1 determines a plurality of target access points which
   constitute candidates to which the connection between the UE 50 and the wireless
   communication network may be switched. In the illustrated exemplary procedure, it is
30 assumed that these target access points are the access points 100-2 and 100-3. The access
   point 100-1 may apply various criteria for determining the target access points 100-2, 100-3.
   For example, the access point 100-1 may select access points which are located in a moving
   direction of the UE 50 or access points which provide radio coverage in radio known
   coverage holes in the coverage area of the access point 100-1.
35
   The access point 100-1 then sends the switching authorization message 204 to the UE 50.
   This may be accomplished over a control channel supported by the radio link between the

                                                   -9
   UE 50 and the access point 100-1. The switching authorization message indicates the target
   access points 100-2, 100-3 determined at step 203. Further, the switching authorization
   message 204 authorizes the UE 50 to autonomously switch the ongoing connection to one or
   more of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated in the switching authorization
 5 message 204, without requiring further interaction between the UE 50 and the access point
   100-1.
   The switching authorization message 204 may carry various kinds of information which may
   be used by the UE 50 for performing the autonomous switching of the connection. For
10 example, the switching authorization message 204 may indicate one or more conditions for
   triggering the switching at the UE 50. Such condition may for example correspond to
   measurements performed by the UE 50 indicating that the expected radio link quality of one
   of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 exceeds the radio link quality of the current serving
   access point 100-1 by a given amount. Further, such condition may correspond to
15 measurements performed by the UE 50 indicating that the radio link quality of the current
   serving access point 100-1 is below a first threshold and the expected radio link quality of
   one of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 is above a second threshold. As a further
   example, such condition may correspond to a failure of the radio link to the current serving
   access point 100-1 or interruption of the connection.
20
   Further, the switching authorization message 204 may indicate information concerning each
   of the indicated target access points 100-2, 100-3. For example, such information may
   include an identity of the target access point 100-2, 100-3, e.g., in terms of an index. Further,
   such information may include a sequence, timing, and/or radio resources used for a beacon
25 or pilot signal transmitted by the target access point 100-2, 100-3. Further, information
   concerning communication protocols used by the target access point may be included. Such
   protocol information may in particular be useful if the access points 100-1, 100-2, 100-2, 100
   3, 100-4, differ with respect to the utilized radio access technology. Further, such information
   may include a radio resource mapping of a control channel of the target access point 100-2,
30 100-3. Further, such information may indicate the radio access technology used by the target
   access point 100-2, 100-3. Further, such information may include system information for
   accessing the target access point 100-2, 100-3, e.g., in the form of a random access
   preamble or in terms of a cell-specific temporary identifier (e.g., a C-RNTI) to be used by the
   UE 50.
35
   Still further, the switching authorization message 204 may include information to be applied
   by the UE 50 for selecting between the different target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated

                                                  - 10
   in the switching authorization message 204, e.g., in the form of a priority order or selection
   policy.
   The switching authorization message 204 may be valid for a given time period. Such time
 5 period may be preconfigured in the UE 50 and the access points 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4
   of the wireless communication network. Further, such time period may be dynamically set for
   each switching authorization message. In the illustrated exemplary procedure, the access
   point 100-1 could set the time period before sending the switching authorization message
   204 and indicate the time period in the switching authorization message 204. The UE 50 is
10 then authorized to autonomously perform the switching while the time period has not yet
   expired. Expiry of the time period may be monitored by providing a corresponding timer in
   the UE 50. The access point 100-1 may set the time period for example depending on the
   current velocity of the UE 50. For example, if the UE 50 is moving at high velocity, a shorter
   time period may be suitable. In certain cases, the switching authorization message 204 could
15 also be valid until a specified event, e.g., receipt of a new switching authorization message or
   release of the connection between the UE 50 and the wireless communication network. In
   certain scenarios, the switching authorization message 204 may override a previously sent
   switching authorization message or may be overridden by a later sent switching authorization
   message.
20
   In addition to sending the switching authorization message 204, the access point 100-1 also
   provides information concerning the UE 50 to the target access points 100-2, 100-3
   determined at step 203, as illustrated by messages 205 and 206. Such information may for
   example include a context of the UE 50 as provided for maintaining the connection between
25 the UE 50 and the wireless communication network. In addition, the access point 100-1 may
   also start forwarding user plane data destined to the UE 50 to the target access points 100-2,
   100-3. In this way, the target access points 100-2, 100-3 may be prepared to immediately
   continue serving the UE 50 after switching the connection. The information provided to the
   target access points 100-2, 100-3 may also indicate the validity time period of the switching
30 authorization message 204. Here, it may be beneficial to indicate a validity time period to the
   target access points which is larger than the validity time period applied by the UE 50,
   thereby ensuring that the target access points 100-2, 100-3 are prepared also in cases
   where the UE 50 attempts switching of the connection at the very end of the validity time
   period indicated to the UE 50. If the access point 100-1 has determined a priority order of the
35 target access points 100-2, 100-3, the access point 100-1 may send the information to the
   different target access points 100-2, 100-3 in the order of decreasing priority.

                                                   - 11
   Upon receiving the switching authorization message 204, the UE 50 may start monitoring
   procedures with respect to the target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated in the switching
   authorization message 204. For example, the UE 50 may perform measurements to
   determine which of the indicated target access points 100-2, 100-3 provides the highest
 5 expected radio link quality. After such determination, the UE 50 may continue monitoring only
   the target access point 100-2, 100-3 with the highest expected radio link quality. In other
   scenarios, the UE 50 may continue to monitor all the indicated target access points 100-2,
   100-3. The monitoring may use information provided in the switching authorization message
   204, e.g., sequence, timing, and/or radio resources used for a beacon or pilot signal
10 transmitted by the target access point 100-2, 100-3.
   However, the UE 50 performs no immediate switching of the connection. Rather, the UE 50
   performs switching of the connection action only in response to detecting a triggering event,
   as illustrated by step 207. Such triggering event may be preconfigured in the UE 50 or may
15 be indicated in the switching authorization message 204. For example, the triggering event
   may correspond to a failure of the radio link between the UE 50 and the current serving
   access point 100-1.       Further, such triggering event may correspond to measurements
   performed by the UE 50 indicating that the expected radio link quality of one of the target
   access points 100-2, 100-3 exceeds the radio link quality of the current serving access point
20 100-1 by a given amount. Further, such triggering event may correspond to measurements
   performed by the UE 50 indicating that the radio link quality of the current serving access
   point 100-1 is below a first threshold and the expected radio link quality of one of the target
   access points 100-2, 100-3 is above a second threshold.
25 In response to detecting the triggering event at step 207, the UE 50 initiates switching of the
   connection to one of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated in the switching
   authorization message 204. For this purpose, the UE 50 may also select between the
   indicated target access points 100-2, 100-3, as indicated by step 208. For example, the UE
   50 may select the target access point 100-2, 100-3 which provides the highest expected
30 radio link quality. In the illustrated exemplary procedure, it is assumed that the UE 50 selects
   the target access point 100-2. As illustrated by step 209, the UE 50 then performs the
   switching of the connection by setting up a new radio link to the target access point 100-2
   selected at step 208, which then becomes the new serving access point for the UE 50.
35 Fig. 3 illustrates a further exemplary procedure of switching the connection of the UE 50 from
   the current serving access point 100-1 to another access point 100-2. The procedure of Fig.
   3 is in many aspects similar to that of Fig. 2. However, in the procedure of Fig. 3 a different

                                                - 12
   process is used for providing the target access point 100-2 with information concerning the
   UE 50.
   In the procedure of Fig. 3, the connection between the UE 50 and the wireless
 5 communication      network is established at step 301. As illustrated, the connection is
   established by setting up a radio link between the UE 50 and the access point 100-1. The
   access point 100-1 thus becomes the serving access point for the UE 50.
   At step 302, the access point 100-1 detects a triggering event. The triggering event may for
10 example correspond to the establishment of the connection at step 301. Further, the
   triggering event may be based on certain measurements and/or evaluations performed by
   the access point 100-1. For example, the access point 100-1 could measure and evaluate
   the quality of the radio link between the UE 50 and the access point 100-1, e.g., in terms of a
   channel quality indicator, beacon power level, or achievable bitrate. The triggering event
15 could then correspond to the quality of the radio link being below a given threshold value.
   Further, the access point 100-1 could determine a probability of a failure of the radio link
   between the UE 50 and the access point 100-1. For example, this could be accomplished on
   the basis of statistical information on radio coverage holes in a radio coverage area of the
   access point 100-1 and on information on the position or movement of the UE 50. Further,
20 the access point 100-1 could measure a velocity of the UE 50, e.g., by evaluating radio
   signals transmitted by the UE 50, and the triggering event could correspond to the velocity of
   the UE 50 exceeding a given threshold value. In this case, it can be taken into account that a
   fast moving UE is more likely to require switching to another access point than a slowly
   moving or static UE. Further, the access point 100-1 may evaluate whether a switching
25 authorization message which was previously sent to the UE 50 is still valid or outdated and
   trigger sending the switching authorization message when the previously sent switching
   authorization message is no longer valid. This may for example be accomplished by
   providing a timer which is reset each time when the access point 100-1 sends a new
   switching authorization message to the UE 50 and using expiry of the timer as the triggering
30 event.
   At step 303, the access point 100-1 determines a plurality of target access points which
   constitute candidates to which the connection between the UE 50 and the wireless
   communication network may be switched. In the illustrated exemplary procedure, it is
35 assumed that these target access points are the access points 100-2 and 100-3. The access
   point 100-1 may apply various criteria for determining the target access points 100-2, 100-3.
   For example, the access point 100-1 may select access points which are located in a moving

                                                 -13
   direction of the UE 50 or access points which provide radio coverage in radio known
   coverage holes in the coverage area of the access point 100-1.
   The access point 100-1 then sends the switching authorization message 304 to the UE 50.
 5 This may be accomplished over a control channel supported by the radio link between the
   UE 50 and the access point 100-1. The switching authorization message 304 indicates the
   target access points 100-2,        100-3 determined at step 303. Further, the switching
   authorization message 304 authorizes the UE 50 to autonomously switch the ongoing
   connection to one or more of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated in the switching
10 authorization message 304, without requiring further interaction between the UE 50 and the
   access point 100-1.
   The switching authorization message 304 may carry various kinds of information which may
   be used by the UE 50 for performing the autonomous switching of the connection. For
15 example, the switching authorization message 304 may indicate one or more conditions for
   triggering the switching at the UE 50. Such condition may for example correspond to
   measurements performed by the UE 50 indicating that the expected radio link quality of one
   of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 exceeds the radio link quality of the current serving
   access point 100-1 by a given amount. Further, such condition may correspond to
20 measurements performed by the UE 50 indicating that the radio link quality of the current
   serving access point 100-1 is below a first threshold and the expected radio link quality of
   one of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 is above a second threshold. As a further
   example, such condition may correspond to a failure of the radio link to the current serving
   access point 100-1 or an interruption of the connection.
25
   Further, the switching authorization message 304 may indicate information concerning each
   of the indicated target access points 100-2, 100-3. For example, such information may
   include an identity of the target access point 100-2, 100-3, e.g., in terms of an index. Further,
   such information may include a sequence, timing, and/or radio resources used for a beacon
30 or pilot signal transmitted by the target access point 100-2, 100-3. Further, information
   concerning communication protocols used by the target access point 100-2, 100-3 may be
   included. Such protocol information may in particular be useful if the access points 100-1,
   100-2, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4 differ with respect to the utilized radio access technology. Further,
   such information may include a radio resource mapping of a control channel of the target
35 access point 100-2, 100-3. Further, such information may indicate the radio access
   technology used by the target access point 100-2, 100-3. Further, such information may
   include system information for accessing the target access point 100-2, 100-3, e.g., in the

                                                - 14
   form of a random access preamble or in terms of a cell-specific temporary identifier (e.g., a
   C-RNTI) to be used by the UE 50.
   Still further, the switching authorization message 304 may include information to be applied
 5 by the UE 50 for selecting between the different target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated
   in the switching authorization message 304, e.g., in the form of a priority order or selection
   policy.
   The switching authorization message 304 may be valid for a given time period. Such time
10 period may be preconfigured in the UE 50 and the access points 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4,
   100-5 of the wireless communication network. Further, such time period may be dynamically
   set for each switching authorization message. In the illustrated exemplary procedure, the
   access point 100-1 could set the time period before sending the switching authorization
   message 304 and indicate the time period in the switching authorization message 304. The
15 UE 50 is then authorized to autonomously perform the switching while the time period has
   not yet expired. Expiry of the time period may be monitored by providing a corresponding
   timer in the UE 50. The access point 100-1 may set the time period for example depending
   on the current velocity of the UE 50. For example, if the UE 50 is moving at high velocity, a
   shorter time period may be suitable. In certain cases, the switching authorization message
20 304 could also be valid until a specified event, e.g., receipt of a new switching authorization
   message or release of the connection between the UE 50 and the wireless communication
   network. In certain scenarios, the switching authorization message 304 may override a
   previously sent switching authorization message or may be overridden by a later sent
   switching authorization message.
25
   Upon receiving the switching authorization message 304, the UE 50 may start monitoring
   procedures with respect to the target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated in the switching
   authorization message 304. For example, the UE 50 may perform measurements to
   determine which of the indicated target access points 100-2, 100-3 provides the highest
30 expected radio link quality. After such determination, the UE 50 may continue monitoring only
   the target access point 100-2, 100-3 with the highest expected radio link quality. In other
   scenarios, the UE 50 may continue to monitor all the indicated target access points 100-2,
   100-3. The monitoring may use information provided in the switching authorization message
   304, e.g., sequence, timing, and/or radio resources used for a beacon or pilot signal
35 transmitted by the target access point 100-2, 100-3.

                                                  -15
   However, the UE 50 performs no immediate switching of the connection. Rather, the UE 50
   performs switching of the connection action only in response to detecting a triggering event,
   as illustrated by step 305. Such triggering event may be preconfigured in the UE 50 or may
   be indicated in the switching authorization message 304. For example, the triggering event
 5 may correspond to a failure of the radio link between the UE 50 and the current serving
   access point 100-1.       Further, such triggering event may correspond to measurements
   performed by the UE 50 indicating that the expected radio link quality of one of the target
   access points 100-2, 100-3 exceeds the radio link quality of the current serving access point
   100-1 by a given amount. Further, such triggering event may correspond to measurements
10 performed by the UE 50 indicating that the radio link quality of the current serving access
   point 100-1 is below a first threshold and the expected radio link quality of one of the target
   access points 100-2, 100-3 is above a second threshold.
   In response to detecting the triggering event at step 305, the UE 50 initiates switching of the
15 connection to one of the target access points 100-2, 100-3 indicated in the switching
   authorization message 304. For this purpose, the UE 50 may also select between the
   indicated target access points 100-2, 100-3, as indicated by step 306. For example, the UE
   50 may select the target access point 100-2, 100-3 which provides the highest expected
   radio link quality. In the illustrated exemplary procedure, it is assumed that the UE 50 selects
20 the target access point 100-2. As illustrated by step 307, the UE 50 then performs the
   switching of the connection by setting up a new radio link to the target access point 100-2
   selected at step 306, which then becomes the new serving access point for the UE 50.
   When switching the connection at step 307, the UE 50 also indicates an identity of the
25 previous serving access point 100-1, e.g., in terms of an index, to the new serving access
   point 100-2. The new serving access point 100-2 may then use this identity to send a request
   308 for information concerning the UE 50 to the previous serving access point 100-1.
   In response to the request 308, the access point 100-1 provides information concerning the
30 UE 50 to the new serving access point 100-2, as illustrated by message 309. Such
   information may for example include a context of the UE 50 as provided for maintaining the
   connection between the UE 50 and the wireless communication network.
   The connection switching procedures as explained above may also be used together with
35 other kinds of connection switching procedures, e.g., a connection switching procedure in
   which the UE 50 is instructed by the current serving access point to immediately switch to a
   certain target access point. In such cases, the autonomous switching procedure could be

                                                  - 16
   used as a backup for cases where an instruction for immediate switching is not possible,
   e.g., due to a failure of the radio link between the UE 50 and the current serving access
   point. Accordingly, if the UE 50 first receives the switching authorization message and then a
   command for immediate switching of the connection, the UE 50 may first attempt to perform
 5 the immediate switching and, if this immediate switching fails, continue with the autonomous
   switching procedure.
   Fig. 4 shows a flowchart for illustrating a method which may be used for implementing the
   above concepts in an access node of a wireless communication network, e.g., in one of the
10 access nodes 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, 100-4. If a processor based implementation of the access
   point is used, the steps of the method may be performed by one or more processors of the
   access point. For this purpose, the processor(s) may execute correspondingly configured
   program code. Further, at least some of the corresponding functionalities may be hardwired
   in the processor(s).
15
   At step 410, the access point serves a connection between a UE, e.g., the UE 50, and the
   wireless communication network. The connection is based on a radio link between the UE
   and the access point. In some scenarios, the connection may further be based on additional
   radio links between the UE and other access points.
20
   At step 420, the access point detects a triggering event. Various kinds of triggering events
   may be used. For example, the access point may send the message in response to
   establishing the connection between the UE and the communication network. Further, the
   access point may determine a failure probability of a radio link between the UE and the
25 access point and send the message in response to the failure probability being above a
   threshold. Further, the access point may measure a quality of a radio link between the user
   equipment and the access point and send the message in response to the quality of the radio
   link being below a threshold. Further, the access point may measure a velocity of the UE and
   send the message in response to the velocity being above a threshold. Further, the access
30 point may send the message in response to determining that a further plurality of target
   access points, which was previously indicated to the user equipment, is no longer valid. In
   the exemplary procedures of Figs. 2 and 3 this is accomplished by considering the validity
   time period of the switching authorization message.
35 At step 430, the access point determines a plurality of target access points. This
   determination may for example be based on measurements performed by the access point.

                                                 - 17
   At step 440, the access point sends a message to the UE. The message indicates the target
   access points determined at step 430 and authorizes the UE to autonomously switch the
   connection to one or more of the target access points. As explained above, this autonomous
   switching does not require further interaction between the UE and the access point. The
 5 above-mentioned switching authorization messages 204 and 304 are examples of such
   message.
   The message may further indicate a condition to be evaluated by the UE for triggering the
   switching to said one or more of the target access points. For example, such condition may
10 be based on measurements performed by the UE, e.g., to determine a radio link qualities.
   For example, the switching may be triggered when a radio link quality expected for one of the
   target access points exceeds a radio link quality of the access point by a given amount.
   Further, the switching may be triggered when a radio link quality expected for one of the
   target access points is above a first threshold and a radio link quality of the access point is
15 below a second threshold. Further, the switching may be triggered if a radio link between the
   UE and the access point fails.
   For each of the target access points, the message may further indicate information to be
   used by the UE for connecting to this target access point. For example, this may include a
20 information on radio configuration, access parameters, radio resources, a cell-specific
   temporary identifier to be used by the UE, or the like. Further, the message may indicate a
   priority order of the target access points.
   Further, the access point may send, to each of the plurality of target access points,
25 information related to the UE. This information may be used by the target access points to
   prepare for a potential switching of the connection. As explained above, this information may
   in particular include a context of the UE, as used for maintaining the ongoing connection
   between the UE and the wireless communication network. As an alternative, the access point
   may also send such information after switching of the connection to one or more of the
30 plurality of target access points. In such cases, the access point may receive a request from
   the target access point to which the connection was switched and send the information
   related to the UE in response to the request to this target access point.
   Fig. 5 shows a flowchart for illustrating a method which may be used for implementing the
35 above concepts in a UE, e.g., in the UE 50. If a processor based implementation of the UE is
   used, the steps of the method may be performed by one or more processors of the UE. For
   this purpose, the processor(s) may execute correspondingly configured program code.

                                                -18
   Further, at least some of the corresponding functionalities may be hardwired in the
   processor(s).
   At step 510, establishes a connection to a wireless communication network, e.g., a wireless
 5 communication network using a deployment as explained in connection with Fig. 1. The
   connection is based on a radio link between the UE and an access point of the wireless
   communication network. In some scenarios, the connection may further be based on
   additional radio links between the UE and other access points.
10 At step 520, the UE receives a message from the access point which currently serves the
   connection. The message indicates a plurality of target access points and authorizes the UE
   to autonomously switch the connection to one or more of the target access points. As
   explained above, this autonomous switching does not require further interaction between the
   UE and the access point. The above-mentioned switching authorization messages 204 and
15 304 are examples of such message. In some scenarios, the UE may receive the message in
   response to establishing the connection between the UE and the communication network.
   For each of the target access points, the message may further indicate information to be
   used by the UE for connecting to this target access point. For example, this may include a
20 information on radio configuration, access parameters, radio resources, a cell-specific
   temporary identifier to be used by the UE, or the like. Further, the message may indicate a
   priority order of the target access points.
   At step 530, the UE determines whether a triggering event occurred. If a triggering event
25 occurred, the method continues with steps 540 and 550, as indicated by branch "Y". If no
   triggering event occurred, the method continues with step 560, as indicated by branch "N".
   The triggering event may be based on a quality of a radio link between the UE and the target
   access points indicated in the message, as measured by the UE. The triggering event may
30 also be based on a quality of a radio link between the UE and the access point, as measured
   by the UE. For example, the triggering event may correspond to a radio link quality expected
   for one of the target access points exceeding a radio link quality of the access point by a
   given amount. Further, the triggering event may correspond to a radio link quality expected
   for one of the target access points being above a first threshold and a radio link quality of the
35 access point being below a second threshold. Further, the triggering event may correspond
   to failure of a radio link between the UE and the access point or interruption of the
   connection. The message of step 520 may also indicate a condition to be evaluated by the

                                                 -19
   UE for triggering the switching to the target access point(s) and the triggering event may be
   based on said indicated condition.
   At step 540, the UE may select one or more target access points from the plurality of target
 5 access points indicated in the message of step 520. This may be accomplished on the basis
   of information indicated in the message of step 520. For example, the message may indicate,
   a priority order of the target access points, and the UE may determine select the target
   access points depending on the indicated priority order. Alternatively, also more complex
   selection policies may be applied by the UE and may also be indicated in the message, e.g.,
10 selection policies which are based on measurements performed by the UE.
   At step 550, the UE switches the connection to the target access point(s) selected at step
   540. This may be accomplished on the basis of information indicated in the message of step
   520. In particular, the message may indicate, for each of the indicated target access points,
15 information to be used by the UE for connecting to this target access point, and the UE may
   performs the switching on the basis of this indicated information. In some scenarios, after
   switching to the target access point, the UE may also indicate information related to the
   access point, e.g., an identity of the access point, to this target access point. If this target
   access point becomes the new serving access point for the UE, it may use this information
20 for obtaining information related to the UE from the previous serving access point.
   At step 560, if no triggering event was detected at step 530, the UE may keep the current
   access point(s) for maintaining the connection.

   As can be seen, the concepts as described above may be used for efficiently managing the
   connection of the UE to the wireless communication network. In particular, by authorizing the
   UE to autonomously switch the connection to one or more from a plurality of target access
   points, it becomes possible to perform the connection switching even if the radio link
35 between the UE and the current serving access point of the UE fails.
