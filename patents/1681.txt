                                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0020]         Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and
the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or
of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and
terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as
limiting.
[0021]         FIGS. 1-2 illustrate a garage door system 50 including a garage door opener 100
operatively coupled to a garage door 104. The garage door opener 100 includes a housing
108 supporting a motor that is operatively coupled to a drive mechanism 116. The drive
mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive chain 120 having a
shuttle 124 configured to be displaced along a rail assembly 128 upon actuation of the motor.
The shuttle 124 may be selectively coupled to a trolley 132 that is slidable along the rail
assembly 128 and coupled to the garage door 104 via an arm member.
[0022]         The trolley 132 is releaseably coupled to the shuttle 124 such that the garage door
system 50 is operable in a powered mode and a manual mode. In the powered mode, the
trolley 132 is coupled to the shuttle 124 and the motor is selectively driven in response to
actuation by a user (e.g., via a key pad or wireless remote in communication with the garage
door opener 100). As the motor is driven, the drive chain 120 is driven by the motor along
the rail assembly 128 to displace the shuttle 124 (and, therefore, the trolley 132), thereby
opening or closing the garage door 104. In the manual mode, the trolley 132 is decoupled
from the shuttle 124 such that a user may manually operate the garage door 104 to open or
close without resistance from the motor. The trolley 132 may be decoupled, for example,
when a user applies a force to a release cord 136 to disengage the trolley 132 from the shuttle
124. In some embodiments, other drive systems are included such that, for example, the drive
mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive belt that is operatively
coupled to the garage door 104 via a rail and carriage assembly.
[0023]         The housing 108 is coupled to the rail assembly 128 and a surface above the garage
door (e.g., a garage ceiling or support beam) by, for example, a support bracket 148. The

garage door opener further includes a light unit 152 including a light (e.g., one or more light
emitting diodes (LEDs)) enclosed by a transparent cover or lens 156), which provides light to
the garage. The light unit 152 may either be selectively actuated by a user or automatically
powered upon actuation of the garage door opener 100. In one example, the light unit 152
may be configured to remain powered for a predetermined amount of time after actuation of
the garage door opener 100.
[0024]         The garage door opener 100 further includes an antenna 158 enabling the garage
door opener 100 to communicate wirelessly with other devices, such as a smart phone or
network device (e.g., a router, hub, or modem), as described in further detail below. The
garage door opener 100 is also configured to receive, control, and/or monitor a variety of
accessory devices or modules, such as a backup battery unit 189, a speaker 192, a fan 194, an
extension cord reel 196, among others.
[0025]         FIG. 3 illustrates a block power diagram of the garage door opener 100. The garage
door opener 100 includes a terminal block 202 configured to receive power from an external
power source 204, such as a standard 120 VAC power outlet. The terminal block 202 directs
power, via a transformer 208, to a garage door opener (GDO) board 210 for supply to
components thereof as well as a motor 211 (used to drive the drive mechanism 116, as
described above), LEDs 214 (of the light unit 152), and garage door sensors 216. The
terminal block 202 further directs power via the transformer 208 to a wireless board 220 and
components thereof, as well as a wired keypad 222 and module ports 223. The terminal block
202 also directs power to a battery charger 224 and AC ports 228. The module ports 223 are
configured to receive various accessory devices, such as a speaker, a fan, an extension cord
reel, a parking assist laser, an environmental sensor, a flashlight, and a security camera. One
or more of the accessory devices are selectively attachable to and removable from the garage
door opener 100, and may be monitored and controlled by the garage door opener 100.
[0026]         The wireless board 220 includes a wireless microcontroller 240, among other
components. The GDO board 210 includes, among other components, a garage door opener
(GDO) microcontroller 244 and a radio frequency (RF) transceiver 246.

communication with a server 250 via a network device 252 and network 254, as well as with a
smart phone 256 (and other similar external devices, such as tablets and laptops). The
network device 252 may be, for example, one or more of a router, hub, or modem. The
network 254 may be, for example, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), another wide area
network (WAN) or a combination thereof. The wireless microcontroller 240 may include, for
example, a Wi-Fi radio including hardware, software, or a combination thereof enabling
wireless communications according to the Wi-Fi protocol. In other embodiments, the
wireless microcontroller 240 is configured to communicate with the server 250 via the
network device 252 and network 254 using other wireless communication protocols. The
network 254 may include various wired and wireless connections to communicatively couple
the garage door opener 100 to the server 250. As illustrated, the wireless microcontroller 240
also includes wired communication capabilities for communicating with the GDO
microcontroller 244 via the multiplexor 260. In some embodiments, the wireless
microcontroller 240 and the GDO microcontroller 244 are directly coupled for
communication. In some embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 240 and the GDO
microcontroller 244 are combined into a single controller.
[0028]         The RF transceiver 246 is wirelessly coupled to various user actuation devices,
including one or more wireless remotes 262 and wireless keypads 264, to receive and provide
to the GDO microcontroller 244 user actuation commands (e.g., to open and close the garage
door 104). The smart phone 256 may also receive user input and, in response, provide
(directly or via the network 254) to the wireless microcontroller 240 user actuation commands
for the garage door opener 100 or commands to control one or more of the accessory devices.
The multiplexor 260 enables communication between and among the wireless microcontroller
240, the GDO microcontroller 244, and the accessory microcontrollers 266 (of the accessory
devices previously noted).
[0029]         With reference to FIG. 5, the housing 108 includes accessory ports 162 that receive
and support accessory devices, as noted above, which are modular, interchangeable accessory
devices and are generically referred to as the accessory devices 200 (see, e.g., FIG. 2) In the
illustrated embodiment, the housing 108 has eight accessory ports 162 with two ports 162
disposed on each side of the housing 108. However, this configuration is merely exemplary
that is, the housing 108 may include more than eight ports 162 or less than eight ports 162,

                                                     -6
and each side of the housing 108 may include more or less than two ports 162. Additionally,
the housing 108 may include more or less than four sides with each having one or more ports
162, and other surfaces of the housing (e.g., the top and bottom) may include one or more
ports 162.
[0030]         With continued reference to FIG. 5, each port 162 includes a communication
interface 166 and a coupling interface 170. The communication interface 166 includes an
electrical connector 174 disposed within a recess 178. The electrical connector 174 is
configured to facilitate electrical communication and data communication between the
accessory device 200 and the garage door opener 100. The electrical connector 174 may be
any type of powered input/output port. Additionally, in further embodiments the electrical
connector 174 may define separate power connectors and data connectors, which may
similarly be any type of power connectors and data connectors. In the illustrated
embodiment, two slots 182 are formed on either side of the electrical connector 174 and
receive a portion of an accessory device 200 to align and mechanically couple the accessory
device 200 with housing 108. The coupling interface 170 is defined by a pair of spaced apart,
raised surfaces 186 defined on either side of the communication interface 166. Each raised
surface 186 includes a chamfered edge and has an aperture 190 defined there through.
However, the raised surfaces 186 may be omitted in other embodiments. The apertures 190
are configured to receive portions of the accessory devices 200 to facilitate mechanical
coupling of the accessory device 200 to the garage door opener 100.
[0031]         FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate an example of one of the accessory devices 200 - an
accessory speaker 212 - that is configured to be detachably coupled to the garage door opener
100. In the illustrated embodiment, the speaker 212 is a wireless speaker 212 (e.g., a
Bluetooth@ speaker) that may be wirelessly coupled to a peripheral device, such as the smart
phone 256 or a tablel. In one embodiment, the speaker 212 receives an audio stream from the
peripheral device communicating with the garage door opener 100, and subsequently drives a
speaker 212 to output the audio stream using power from the garage door opener 100 via an
electrical mounting interface 400. In another embodiment, the wireless speaker 212 receives
an audio stream wirelessly directly from the peripheral device via an integral transceiver, and
drives a speaker 212 to output the audio stream using power from the garage door opener 100
via the electrical mounting interface 400.

[0032]         With reference to FIG. 7, the speaker 212 includes a mechanical mounting interface
300 configured to be coupled to the coupling interface 170 of the housing 108, and the
electrical mounting interface 400 configured to be coupled to the communication interface
166 of the housing 108. The mechanical mounting interface 300 includes a pair of hooks 304
that are received within the apertures 190 of the coupling interface 170, a pair of projections
308 disposed on opposing sides of the electrical mounting interface 400, and at least one
protruding latch member 312 configured to engage a corresponding retention member on the
housing 108. The projections 308 are configured to be received within the slots 182 to assist
with alignment of the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface 166.
When coupled, the speaker 212 receives power from the garage door opener 100 via a
connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface
166. The speaker 212 also sends data to and receives data from the garage door opener 100
via a connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication
interface 166.
[0033]         The speaker 212 further includes a controller (e.g., microcontroller 266) in
communication with the wireless microcontroller 240 of the garage door opener 100. The
controller includes a memory storing an initial data set including a unique identifier, a
predetermined initial status field, and a predetermined initial settings field that is
communicated to the garage door opener 100 each time the speaker 212 is coupled to the port
162. Thereafter, the controller is configured to send and receive data from, for example, the
server 250 via the wireless microcontroller 240. More specifically, the controller receives
updates to the settings field of the data set based on data received from the wireless
microcontroller 240. The controller also updates the status field of the data set, which is sent
to the wireless microcontroller 240 for communication to the peripheral device via the server
250.
[0034]         In one embodiment, the status field includes, for example, on/off state of the speaker,
the pairing status (e.g., Bluetooth@ pairing status), and speaker volume, among others. The
settings field includes an on/off toggle, a pairing toggle (e.g., to turn pairing on/off), and a
volume value, among others. In this example, the user may set the values for the settings field
(e.g., via the smart phone 256 or other peripheral device), which updates the speaker 212 to
turn on/off, turn pairing on/off, or alter the volume of the speaker. For example, the smart

                                                     -8
phone 256 may communicate updated settings for the settings field on the server 250. In turn,
for example, the server 250 sends the updated settings to the speaker 212 via the network 254,
network device 252, and wireless microcontroller 240.
[0035]         Each of the accessory devices 200 may be interchangeably coupled to the ports 162
of the housing 108 due to the common mechanical mounting interfaces 300 and electrical
mounting interfaces 400. In other words, each accessory device 200 may be coupled to any
port 162 on the housing. This modular design allows a user to couple desired accessory
devices 200 to the garage door opener 100 in a preferred location, while removing accessory
devices 200 that the user does not require. This modular design allows the user to customize
the garage door opener 100 to fit their specific needs.
[0036]         FIGS. 8A-B and 9 illustrate a charger 500 that includes a housing 508 defining at
least one battery receiving port 530, at least one accessory device receiving port or accessory
port 562, at least one AC power outlet 516, at least one DC power outlet 520, a user input
524, a light or indicator 528, and a power cord 532 configured to be connected to an external
power source. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing 508 is configured as a rectangular
housing 508 including a lower support face configured to support the housing on a surface
(not shown), four sidewalls 536, and a port face 538 opposite the support face that includes a
port groove 542 defined therein. The port groove 542 includes the battery receiving port 530
disposed in a central location on the port face 538 with two accessory device receiving ports
562 disposed on either side of the battery receiving port 530 (e.g., to the left and to the right in
FIG. 8A). Two DC power outlets 520 are defined in the port groove 542 adjacent the battery
receiving port 530 between the accessory device receiving ports 562. Two AC power outlets
516 are defined in the port groove 542 adjacent the battery receiving port 530 between the
accessory device receiving ports 562, such that the AC power outlets 516 are each defined
between one accessory device receiving port 562 and a DC power outlet 520. A light 528 and
a user input 524 (e.g., a power switch) are also defined in the port groove 542. The spatial
configuration of the charger 500 is exemplary and may be varied in other embodiments.
[0037]         Although one configuration of the charger 500 was described with respect to FIG.
8A above, various modifications may be made to the illustrated charger 500. For example,
the number of battery receiving ports 530, accessory device receiving ports 562, AC power
outlets 516, DC power outlets 520, user inputs 524, and lights 528 may be varied in other
9751505_1 (GHMatters) P107449.AU

                                                     -9
embodiments. That is, the charger 500 may include two or more battery receiving ports 530,
more or less than two accessory device receiving ports 562, more or less than two AC power
outlets 516, more or less than two DC power outlets 520, more than one user input 524, and
more than one light 528. The AC power outlets 516 are illustrated as standard 3-prong AC
outlets 516. However, in other embodiments, the AC power outlets 516 may be any suitable
AC power outlets. The DC power outlets 520 are illustrated as USB ports. However, in other
embodiments, the DC power outlets 520 may be any suitable DC power outlets 520.
[0038] The charger 500, in contrast to the garage door opener 100, is a non-motorized
device. In other words, the charger 500 does not include a motor within or supported by the
housing 508 that supports the charging circuitry. Stated another way, the charger 500 and the
housing 508 are independent of a motor because the charger does not include a motor within
or supported by the housing 508 that supports the charging circuitry. Additionally, the
charger 500 is portable between uses and not fixedly mounted to garage or other structure to
open or close a garage door. For example, the charger 500 may include a carrying handle or
handles in some embodiments, and one or more supporting feet on the lower support face
extending downward from the housing 508 to support the housing 508 when the charger is
resting on a support surface.
[0039]         FIG. 8B illustrates an example of the accessory receiving port 562. As shown in
FIG. 8B, the accessory receiving ports 562 are similar to the ports 162 disposed on the
housing 108 such that the accessory receiving ports 562 can receive the same accessory
devices 200 described above. Accordingly, the accessory port 562 includes a communication
interface 566 and a coupling interface 570. The communication interface 566 includes an
electrical connector 574 disposed within a recess 578 on a planar support surface. The
electrical connector 574 is configured to facilitate electrical communication and data
communication between the accessory device 200 and the charger 500 (e.g., to couple the
accessory device 200 to a power source). The electrical connector 574 may be any type of
powered input/output port. Additionally, in further embodiments the electrical connector 574
may define separate power connectors and data connectors, which may similarly be any type
of power connectors and data connectors. Two slots 582 are formed on either side of the
electrical connector 574 and receive a portion of an accessory device 200 to align and
mechanically couple the accessory device 200 with housing 508.

                                                    - 10
[0040]         The coupling interface 570 is defined by a pair of spaced apart apertures 590
disposed on an upper end of the support surface and a catch 594 defined in a groove. Each of
the apertures 590 is configured to receive portions of the accessory devices 200 to facilitate
mechanical coupling of the accessory device 200 to the charger 500. The catch 594 is
configured to receive, for example, the latch 312 of the accessory device 200 to secure and
maintain engagement of the accessory device 200 to the charger 500. In addition, the groove
defines lower surfaces for supporting the accessory device 200.
[0041]         With reference to FIG. 8A, the battery receiving port 530 includes a recess 546 that
is sized and shaped to receive a battery pack 505. The battery receiving portion 530 includes
charger electrical contacts that are configured to mechanically and electrically engage battery
contacts to communicate electrical power and/or data signals therebetween. In addition, the
battery receiving portion 530 includes two slots 548 disposed on opposed sides of the recess
546 that are configured to receive battery pack latch members 1370 (see FIG. 11) to secure
and maintain engagement of the battery pack 505 to the charger 500. In the illustrated
embodiment, the battery receiving portion 530 is configured to receive a battery pack 505 that
is inserted along a vertical insertion axis. However, in other embodiments, the battery
receiving portion 530 may be configured to receive the battery pack 505 configured as a 'slide
on' battery pack that is inserted along a horizontal insertion axis.
[0042]         With reference to FIG. 8A, the power cord 532 is coupled to the housing 508 via a
power cord housing 534. The power cord housing 534 is pivotally coupled to the charger
housing 508 such that the power cord housing 534 is pivotal about a pivot axis. In some
embodiments, the power cord housing 534 may be configured to support a length of excess
power cord 532. In another embodiment, the power cord housing 534 may include, for
example, a cord reel that automatically retracts and winds a length of excess power cord 532.
In yet another embodiment, the power cord 532 may be directly coupled to the housing 508.
[0043]         The power cord 532 itself includes a standard 3 prong male adapter 560 configured
to be coupled to an external power source (e.g., a standard 120 VAC power outlet). However,
in other embodiments, the power cord 532 may include other suitable adapters for coupling
the charger to an external power source.

[0044]         FIG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of the charger 500. As illustrated, the charger 500
includes the two AC power outlets 516 coupled to the external power source via a switch 604,
a power conditioning circuit 608, two DC power outlets 520, a charger circuit 612 coupled to
the battery receiving port 530, a processor 514, and two accessory device receiving ports 562
each interconnected by one or more bus connections. The switch 604 is configured to direct
AC power from the external power source to the AC outlets 516 when the switch is closed.
The switch 604 may be operated, for example, by user input 524 (e.g., toggle switch) disposed
on the housing 508. In an alternate embodiment, the switch 604 may be two separate
switches, each configured to direct power to an AC outlet 516 when the corresponding switch
is closed.
[0045]         The power conditioning circuit 608 is configured to receive and covert AC input
from the external power source to a DC power output. The power conditioning circuit 608
may include, for example, one or more rectifiers, transformers, filters, etc to accomplish the
conversion. After conversion, the DC power is directed to the DC outlets 520, the charger
circuit 612, the processor 514, and the accessory device ports 562.
[0046]           The charging circuit 612 is configured to control the flow of current to the battery
pack 505 in order to charge the pack 505. The charging circuit 612 may include a processor
that is configured to monitor battery pack properties (e.g., type of battery, charge state,
temperature, number of charge cycles, etc.) to determine and execute a charging protocol
stored in a memory of the charging circuit 612. The charging protocol may include a constant
or variable current application, constant or variable voltage application, a programmed
sequence of constant/variable current and constant/variable voltage, and automatic shut-off in
response to monitored battery pack properties (e.g., at completed charge, a temperature
threshold, etc.).
[0047]         With continued reference to FIG. 9, charger 500 includes the processor 514 that is
coupled to the power conditioning circuit 608, a memory 509, a wireless microcontroller 540,
a user input 510, a display 506, and each of the accessory devices 200 via the accessory
device receiving ports 562. The processor 514 executes software, which may be stored in the
memory 509, to carry out the functionality of the charger 500 described herein. The user
input 510 has at least one actuator (e.g., button, switch, lever, touchscreen, etc.) that is
configured to control operation of the charger 500. In the illustrated embodiment, the user
9751505_1 (GHMatters) P107449.AU

                                                    - 12
input 510 includes two actuators on an outside of the housing 508 (e.g., similar to the switch
524 and located on the port groove 542) that are each configured to operate a first switch 512
and a second switch 513, respectively. For example, the first switch 512 is disposed between
the power conditioning circuit 608 and the processor 514 of the charger 500 as well as the
accessory device 200 such that the first switch 512 controls the on/off state of the processor
(i.e., whether power is supplied from the power conditioning circuit 608 to the processor 514).
When the first switch 512 is closed, the power conditioning circuit 608 supplies DC power to
the processor 514 to turn the charger 500 to an on or active state. The second switch 513 is
disposed between the power conditioning circuit 608 and the accessory device 200 such that
the second switch 513 controls the on/off state of the accessory device 200 coupled to
accessory ports 562 (i.e., whether power supplied to the processor 514 from the power
conditioning circuit 608 is passed to the accessory device 200). When the second switch 513
is closed, the power conditioning circuit 608 supplies DC power (received via the first switch
512 when the first switch 512 is closed) to at least one of the accessory devices 200. In other
words, the charger 500 provides power to the accessory device 200 when both the first switch
512 and the second switch 513 are closed.
[0048]         The first switch 512 and the second switch 513 are configured to be selectively
actuated by the user (e.g., by a button, switch, lever, touchscreen, etc.). The actuators for the
first switch 512 and the second switch 513 may physically open or close the first switch 512
and the second switch 513 upon actuation, or the actuator may communicate a control signal
to the processor 514 of the charger 500 upon actuation, which causes the processor 514 to
control the first switch or second switch to open or close.
[0049]         With reference to FIG. 10, the wireless microcontroller 540 enables wireless
communication similar to the wireless microcontroller 240 described above with respect to
the garage door opener 100. For example, the charger 500 is configured to wirelessly
communicate via a network 554 with a server 550 and a peripheral device 556 (e.g., a smart
phone, tablet, laptop, or the like). The network 554 may be, for example, the Internet, a local
area network (LAN), another wide area network (WAN) or a combination thereof, and may
include one or more network devices similar to the network device 252. The network 554
may also include various wired and wireless connections to communicatively couple the
charger 500 to the server 550 and peripheral device 556. The wireless microcontroller 540
9751505_1 (GHMatters) P107449.AU

                                                    - 13
may include, for example, a Wi-Fi radio including hardware, software, or a combination
thereof enabling wireless communications according to the Wi-Fi protocol. In other
embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 540 is configured to communicate with the server
550 via the network 554 using other wireless communication protocols. Regardless of the
protocol, the wireless microcontroller 540 includes a wireless transceiver to enable wireless
communications. The wireless microcontroller 540 and processor 514 may be collectively
referred to as an electronic controller or processor of the charger 500. The electronic
controller may execute software, which may be stored in the memory 509 or a memory of the
wireless microcontroller 540, to carry out the functionality of the charger 500 described
herein.
[0050]           Although separately labeled and described, the server 550 may be the same server
(in whole or part) as the server 250, the network 554 may be the same network (in whole or
part) as the network 254, and the peripheral device 556 may be the same peripheral device (in
whole or part) as the smart phone 256.
[0051]         Similar to the communications described above between the peripheral device (e.g.,
the smart phone 256) and the accessory device 200 when the accessory device 200 is coupled
with the garage door opener 100, communication may occur between the accessory device
200 and the peripheral device 556 via the charger 500. Such communications may include the
communication of a data set including at least identifier (ID) data, settings data, and status
data, from each of the different accessory devices 200 coupled to the charger 500 to the
peripheral device 556 via the wireless microcontroller 540. In one communication method,
the charger 500 acts as an intermediary communication device or pass through device - that
is, the wireless microcontroller 540 determines the accessory 200 is received in the port and
understands data sets that it sends and receives is divided into categories (e.g., unique
identifier, status, settings), but does not actually process or 'understand' the data contained
within the data set. Rather, it simply routes the data set associated with each connected port
to the peripheral device 556 via the server 550. This, for example, allows the charger 500 to
receive one of multiple different accessories in a single port, and allows each accessory device
200 to be moved from a first port to another port (when the charger 500 includes multiple
accessory device ports).

[0052]         For example, the server 550 may maintain data sets for each accessory device. The
charger 500 receives data from the accessory device 200 and communicates the data to the
server 550 to update the data set. In turn, the server 550 communicates (e.g., based on a push
or pull operation) the updated data set to the peripheral device 556 via the network 554.
Likewise, the peripheral device 556 may generate (e.g., based on user input) data that is
transmitted, via the network 554, to the server 550 to update the data set associated with the
accessory device 200. The server 550, in turn, communicates (e.g., based on a push or pull
operation) the updated data set to the accessory device 200 via the network 554 and the
wireless microcontroller 540. In some embodiments, the charger 500 directly communicates
information between the accessory device 200 and the peripheral device 556 via the network
554, rather than via the server 550.
[0053]         The communications between the peripheral device 556 and the accessory device
200 enable the peripheral device 556 to determine the identity of the accessory device 200
(based on obtained ID data), to determine the status and. settings of the accessory device 200
(based on received status data and settings data), and to control the accessory device 200 (e.g.,
to turn on/off the device and to vary settings and thresholds of the device based on sending
settings data).
[0054]         In other embodiments, however, the charger is not configured to communicate with
the peripheral device 556. For example, the wireless microcontroller 540 may not be included
in some embodiments. In such embodiments, either the accessory device 200 or the charger
500 includes user input devices to control the operating state of the accessory device 200.
The charger 500 may further obtain status information from the accessory device 200 coupled
thereto and provide the status information to a user via the display 506.
[0055]            FIG. 10 also illustrates one exemplary block diagram of the accessory devices 200
in detail. FIG. 10 illustrates two accessory devices 200, each being similarly configured.
Accordingly, the description of one of the accessory devices 200 similarly applies to both
accessory devices 200. The accessory devices 200 may be a speaker (e.g., the speaker 212), a
fan, an extension cord reel, an environmental sensor, a flashlight, or a security camera, among
others. As illustrated, the accessory device 200 includes a controller 1200 having a memory
1205 and an electronic processor 1210, one or more sensors 1215 (e.g., temperature sensors,
humidity sensors, and carbon monoxide sensors, etc.) and one or more loads 1220 (e.g.,
9751505_1 (GHMatters) P107449.AU

                                                   - 15
indicators, speakers, cameras, lights, motors, etc.) coupled by a bus 1225. The controller
1200 is coupled to the charger 500 via the electrical mounting interface 400 to enable data
communications between the controller 1200 and the charger 500 and to provide power to the
accessory 200. The controller 1200 executes software, which may be stored in memory 1205,
to carry out the function of the accessory device 200 described herein (e.g., to receive, store
data from the sensor(s) 1215, to control the load(s) 1220, to communicate data to and receive
data from the charger 500). The particular sensors 1215, loads 1220, and functionality of the
controller 1200 varies depending on the type of accessory 200. The accessory device 200 may
receive settings data from the peripheral device 556 via the charger 500, as described above.
In response, the controller 1200 may store the settings data (e.g., in the memory 1205) and
control the load(s) 1120, sensor(s) 1215, or both, in accordance with the settings data. For
example, when the accessory device 200 is a fan, in response to received settings data from
the peripheral device 556, the electronic processor 1210 may control a fan motor (an example
of the load 1220) to turn on, off, or adjust speed based on the received settings data.
[0056]         The accessory device 200 is configured to interface with the charger 500 in the same
way that the accessory device 200 interfaces with the garage door opener 100. The
mechanical mounting interface 300 of the accessory device 200 (see FIGS. 6-7) is configured
to be coupled to the coupling interface 570 of the housing 508, and the electrical mounting
interface 400 of the accessory device 200 (see FIGS. 6-7) is configured to be coupled to the
communication interface 566 of the housing 508. In particular, the hooks 304 of the
mechanical mounting interface 300 are received within the apertures 590 of the coupling
interface 570, and the pair of projections 308 are received within the slots 582, the latch
member 312 engages the catch 594, and the electrical mounting interface 400
electromechanically engages the communication interface 566. The projections 308 and the
slots 582 assist with alignment of the electrical mounting interface 400 and the
communication interface 566. When coupled, the accessory device 200 receives power from
the charger 500 via a connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the
communication interface 166. The accessory device 200 also sends data to and receives data
from the charger 500 via a connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and
the communication interface 566.

[0057]         FIG. 10 also illustrates one exemplary block diagram of the peripheral device 556 in
further detail. As illustrated, the peripheral device 556 includes a communications interface
1150, a memory 1155, an electronic processor 1160, a display 1165, and user input/output
1170 coupled by bus 1175. The communication interface 1150 is coupled (wired and/or
wirelessly) to the network 554 and enables the electronic processor 1160 (and, thereby, the
peripheral device 556) to communicate with the server 550 (and, thereby, the charger 500 and
the accessory device 200). The electronic processor 1160 executes software, which may be
stored in the memory 1155, to carry out the functionality of the peripheral device 556
described herein (e.g., send data to and from the charger 500 and to control and monitor
operation of the accessory device 200). The user input/output 1170 include one or more push
