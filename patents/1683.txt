                                            ABSTRACT
             A mobile floor cleaning robot (100) includes a body (110) defining a forward
   drive direction (F), a drive system (120), a cleaning system (160), and a controller (150)
   in communication with the drive and cleaning systems. The cleaning system includes a
 5 pad holder (190) having a bottom surface (194b) for receiving a cleaning pad (400), and a
   fluid applicator (162) configured to apply fluid (172) to the floor surface (10). The
   controller controls the drive system and the fluid applicator while executing a cleaning
   routing. The cleaning routine includes applying fluid to a floor surface area substantially
   equal to a footprint area (AF) of the robot and returning the robot to the floor surface area
10 in a movement pattern that moves a center (Pc) and lateral edges (PR and PL) of the
   cleaning pad separately through the floor surface area to moisten the cleaning pad with
   the applied fluid.

                                           BACKGROUND
   [0002]      Tiled floors and countertops routinely need cleaning, some of which entails
   scrubbing to remove dried in soils. Traditionally, wet mops are used to remove dirt and
   other dirty smears (e.g., dirt, oil, food, sauces, coffee, coffee grounds) from the surface of
10 a floor. The fluid for wet cleaning can be distributed with the cleaning brush or pad or
   can be applied ahead of time. An autonomous robot is a robot that performs a specific
   task in unstructured environments without any guidance from a human. Several robots
   are available that can perform floor cleaning functions. An autonomous surface cleaning
   robot that can scrub and remove soils from surfaces traversed by the robot frees up an
15 owner to perform other tasks or leisure.
                                              SUMMARY
   [0003]      One aspect of the disclosure provides a mobile robot having a robot body, a
   drive system, and a cleaning assembly. The cleaning assembly includes a pad holder, a
20 fluid applicator and a controller. The drive system supports the robot body to maneuver
   the robot across a floor surface. The cleaning assembly is disposed on the robot body and
   includes a pad holder, a fluid applicator and a controller in communication with the drive
   system and the cleaning system. The pad holder is configured to receive a cleaning pad
   having a center and lateral edges. The fluid applicator is configured to apply fluid to the
25 floor surface. The controller controls the drive system and fluid applicator while
   executing a cleaning routine. The cleaning routine includes applying fluid to an area
   substantially equal to a footprint area of the robot, and returning the robot to the area in a
   movement pattern that moves the center and lateral edges of the cleaning pad separately
   through the area to moisten the cleaning pad with the applied fluid.
30 [0004]      Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following
   features. In some implementations, the cleaning routine further includes applying fluid to
   2852283vl                                       1

   the surface at an initial volumetric flow rate to moisten the cleaning pad, the initial
   volumetric flow rate being relatively higher than a subsequent volumetric flow rate when
   the cleaning pad is moistened.
   [0005]      In some examples, the fluid applicator applies fluid to an area in front of the
 5 cleaning pad and in the direction of travel of the mobile robot. In some examples, the
   fluid is applied to an area the cleaning pad has occupied previously. In some examples,
   the area the cleaning pad 400 has occupied is recorded on a stored map that is accessible
   to the controller 150.
   [0006]      In some examples, the fluid applicator applies fluid to an area the robot has
10 backed away from by a distance of at least one robot footprint length immediately prior
   to applying fluid. Executing the cleaning routine further comprises moving the cleaning
   pad in a birdsfoot motion forward and backward along a center trajectory, forward and
   backward along a trajectory to the left of and heading away from a starting point along
   the center trajectory, and forward and backward along a trajectory to the right of and
15 heading away from a starting point along the center trajectory.
   [0007]      In some implementations, the drive system includes right and left drive wheels
   disposed on corresponding right and left portions of the robot body. A center of gravity
   of the robot is positioned forward of the drive wheels, causing a majority of an overall
   weight of the robot to be positioned over the pad holder. The overall weight of the robot
20 may be distributed between the pad holder and the drive wheels at a ratio of 3 to 1. In
   some examples, the overall weight of the robot is between about 2 lbs. and about 5 lbs.
   [0008]      In some examples, the robot body and the pad holder both define substantially
   rectangular foot prints. Additionally or alternatively, the bottom surface of the pad
   holder may have a width of between about 60 millimeters and about 80 millimeters and a
25 length of between about 180 millimeters and about 215 millimeters.
   [0009]      One aspect of the disclosure provides a mobile floor cleaning robot having a
   robot body, a drive system, a cleaning assembly, a pad holder, and a controller. The robot
   body defines a forward drive direction. The drive system supports the robot body to
   maneuver the robot across a floor surface. The cleaning assembly is disposed on the
30 robot body and includes a pad holder, a reservoir, and a sprayer. The pad holder has a
   bottom surface configured to receive a cleaning pad and arranged to engage the floor
   2852283vl                                      2

   surface. The reservoir is configured to hold a volume of fluid, and the sprayer, which is
   in fluid communication with the reservoir, is configured to spray the fluid along the
   forward drive direction forward of the pad holder. The controller communicates with
   both the drive system and the cleaning system and executes a cleaning routine. The
 5 controller executes a cleaning routine that allows the robot to drive in the forward drive
   direction a first distance to a first location and then drive in a reverse drive direction,
   opposite the forward drive direction, a second distance to a second location. The
   cleaning routine allows the robot to spray fluid on the floor surface from the second
   location, in the forward drive direction forward of the pad holder but rearward of the first
10 location. After spraying fluid on the floor surface, the cleaning routine allows the robot
   to drive in alternating forward and reverse drive directions while smearing the cleaning
   pad along the floor surface.
   [0010]      Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following
   features. In some implementations, the drive system includes right and left drive wheels
15 disposed on corresponding right and left portions of the robot body. A center of gravity
   of the robot is positioned forward of the drive wheels, causing a majority of an overall
   weight of the robot to be positioned over the pad holder. The overall weight of the robot
   may be distributed between the pad holder and the drive wheels at a ratio of 3 to 1. In
   some examples, the overall weight of the robot is between about 2 lbs. and about 5 lbs.
20 The drive system may include a drive body, which has forward and rearward portions,
   and right and left motors disposed on the drive body. The right and left drive wheels may
   be coupled to the corresponding right and left motors. The drive system may also include
   an arm that extends from the forward portion of the drive body. The arm is pivotally
   attachable to the robot body forward of the drive wheels to allow the drive wheels to
25 move vertically with respect to the floor surface. The rearward portion of the drive body
   may define a slot sized to slidably receive a guide protrusion extending from the robot
   body.
   [0011]      In some examples, the robot body and the pad holder both define substantially
   rectangular foot prints. Additionally or alternatively, the bottom surface of the pad
30 holder may have a width of between about 60 millimeters and about 80 millimeters and a
   length of between about 180 millimeters and about 215 millimeters.

   [0012]       The reservoir may hold a fluid volume of about 200 milliliters. Additionally
   or alternatively, the robot may include a vibration motor, or orbital oscillator, disposed on
   the top portion of the pad holder.
   [0013]       Another aspect of the disclosure provides a mobile floor cleaning robot that
 5 includes a robot body, a drive system, and a cleaning assembly. The robot body defines a
   forward drive direction. The drive system supports the robot body to maneuver the robot
   across a floor surface. . The cleaning assembly is disposed on the robot body and
   includes a pad holder and an orbital oscillator. The pad holder is disposed forward of the
   drive wheels and has a top portion and a bottom portion. The bottom portion has a
10 bottom surface arranged within between about 1/2 cm and about 1        12 cm of the floor
   surface and receives a cleaning pad. The bottom surface of the pad holder includes at
   least 40 of a surface area of a footprint of the robot. The orbital oscillator is disposed on
   the top portion of the pad holder and has an orbital range less than 1cm. The pad holder
   is configured to permit more than 80 percent of the orbital range of the orbital oscillator
15 to be transmitted from the top of the held cleaning pad to the bottom surface of the held
   cleaning pad.
   [0014]       In some examples, the orbital range of the orbital oscillator is less than % cm
   during at least part of a cleaning run. Additionally or alternatively, the robot may move
   the cleaning pad forward or backward while the cleaning pad is oscillating.
20 [0015]       In some examples, the robot moves in a birdsfoot motion forward and
   backward along a center trajectory, forward and backward along a trajectory to the left of
   and heading away from a starting point along the center trajectory, and forward and
   backward along a trajectory to the right of and heading away from a starting point along
   the center trajectory.
25 [0016]       In some examples, the cleaning pad has a top surface attached to the bottom
   surface of the pad holder and the top of the pad is substantially immobile relative to the
   oscillating pad holder.
   [0017]       In some examples, the overall weight of the robot is distributed between the
   pad holder and the drive wheels at a ratio of 3 to 1. The overall weight of the robot may
30 be between about 2 lbs. and about 5 lbs.
   2852283vl                                       4

   [0018]      In some examples, the robot body and the pad holder both define substantially
   rectangular foot prints. Additionally or alternatively, the bottom surface of the pad
   holder may have a width of between about 60 millimeters and about 80 millimeters and a
   length of between about 180 millimeters and about 215 millimeters.
 5 [0019]      The cleaning assembly may further include at least one post disposed on the
   top portion of the pad holder sized for receipt by a corresponding aperture defined by the
   robot body. The at least one post may have a cross sectional diameter varying in size
   along its length. Additionally or alternatively, the at least one post may include a
   vibration dampening material.
10 [0020]      In some implementations, the cleaning assembly further includes a reservoir
   to hold a volume of fluid, and a sprayer in fluid communication with the reservoir. The
   sprayer is configured to spray the fluid along the forward drive direction forward of the
   pad holder. The reservoir may hold a fluid volume of about 200 milliliters.
   [0021]      The drive system may include a drive body, which has forward and rearward
15 portions, and right and left motors disposed on the drive body. The right and left drive
   wheels are coupled to the corresponding right and left motors. The drive system may
   also include an arm that extends from the forward portion of the drive body. The arm is
   pivotally attachable to the robot body forward of the drive wheels to allow the drive
   wheels to move vertically with respect to the floor surface. The rearward portion of the
20 drive body may define a slot sized to slidably receive a guide protrusion that extends
   from the robot body. In one example, the cleaning pad disposed on the bottom surface of
   the pad holder body absorbs about 90% of the fluid volume held in the reservoir. The
   cleaning pad has a thickness of between about 6.5 millimeters and about 8.5 millimeters,
   a width of between about 80 millimeters and about 68 millimeters, and a length of
25 between about 200 millimeters and about 212 millimeters.
   [0022]      In some examples, a method includes driving a first distance in a forward
   drive direction defined by the robot to a first location, while moving a cleaning pad
   carried by the robot along a floor surface supporting the robot. The cleaning pad has a
   center area and lateral areas flanking the center area. The method further includes
30 driving in a reverse drive direction opposite the forward drive direction, a second distance
   to a second location while moving the cleaning pad along the floor surface. The method
   2852283vl
                                                  5

   also includes applying fluid to an area on the floor surface substantially equal to a
   footprint area of the robot and forward of the cleaning pad but rearward of the first
   location. The method further includes returning the robot to the area of applied fluid in a
   movement pattern that moves the center and lateral portions of the cleaning pad
 5 separately through the area to moisten the cleaning pad with the applied fluid 172.
   [0023]      In some examples, the method includes driving in a left drive direction or a
   right drive direction while driving in the alternating forward and reverse directions after
   spraying fluid on the floor surface. Applying fluid on the floor surface may include
   spraying fluid in multiple directions with respect to the forward drive direction. In some
10 examples, the second distance is at least equal to the length of an footprint area of the
   robot.
   [0024]      In still yet another aspect of the disclosure, a method of operating a mobile
   floor cleaning robot includes driving a first distance in a forward drive direction defined
   by the robot to a first location while smearing a cleaning pad carried by the robot along a
15 floor surface supporting the robot. The method includes driving in a reverse drive
   direction, opposite the forward drive direction, a second distance to a second location
   while smearing the cleaning pad along the floor surface. The method also includes
   spraying fluid on the floor surface in the forward drive direction forward of the cleaning
   pad but rearward of the first location. The method also includes driving in an alternating
20 forward and reverse drive directions while smearing the cleaning pad along the floor
   surface after spraying fluid on the floor surface.
   [0025]      In some examples, the method includes spraying fluid on the floor surface
   while driving in the reverse direction or after having driven in the reverse drive direction
   the second distance. The method may include driving in a left drive direction or a right
25 drive direction while driving in the alternating forward and reverse directions after
   spraying fluid on the floor surface. Spraying fluid on the floor surface may include
   spraying fluid in multiple directions with respect to the forward drive direction. In some
   examples, the second distance is greater than or equal to the first distance.
   [0026]      The mobile floor cleaning robot may include a robot body, a drive system, a
30 pad holder, a reservoir, and a sprayer. The robot body defines the forward drive direction
   and has a bottom portion. The drive system supports the robot body and maneuvers the
   2852283vl                                       6

   robot over the floor surface. The pad holder is disposed on the bottom portion of the
   robot body and holds the cleaning pad. The reservoir is housed by the robot body and
   holds a fluid (e.g., 200ml). The sprayer, which is also housed by the robot body, is in
   fluid communication with the reservoir and sprays the fluid in the forward drive direction
 5 forward of the cleaning pad. The cleaning pad disposed on the bottom portion of the pad
   holder may absorb about 90% of the fluid contained in the reservoir. In some examples,
   the cleaning pad has a width of between about 80 millimeters and about 68 millimeters
   and a length of between about 200 millimeters and about 212 millimeters. The cleaning
   pad may have a thickness of between about 6.5 millimeters and about 8.5 millimeters.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0050]       An autonomous robot movably supported can navigate a floor surface. In
   some examples, the autonomous robot can clean a surface while traversing the surface.
   The robot can remove debris from the surface by agitating the debris and/or lifting the
30 debris from the surface by spraying a liquid solution to the floor surface and/or scrubbing
   the debris from the floor surface.
   2852283vl                                       8

   [0051]        Referring to FIGS. 1-12, in some implementations, a robot 100 includes a
   body 110 supported by a drive system 120 that can maneuver the robot 100 across the
   floor cleaning surface 10 based on a drive command having x, y, and 0 components, for
   example. As shown, the robot body 110 has a square shape. However, the body 110 may
 5 have other shapes, including but not limited to a circular shape, an oval shape, or a
   rectangular shape. The robot body 110 has a forward portion 112 and a rearward portion
   114. The body 110 also includes a bottom portion 116 and a top portion 118.
   [0052]        The robot 100 can move across a cleaning surface 10 through various
   combinations of movements relative to three mutually perpendicular axes defined by the
10 body 110: a transverse axis X, a fore-aft axis Y, and a central vertical axis Z. A forward
   drive direction along the fore-aft axis Y is designated F (sometimes referred to
   hereinafter as "forward"), and an aft drive direction along the fore-aft axis Y is
   designated A (sometimes referred to hereinafter as "rearward"). The transverse axis X
   extends between a right side R and a left side L of the robot 100 substantially along an
15 axis defined by center points of the wheel modules 120a, 120b.
   [0053]        The robot 100 can tilt about the X axis. When the robot 100 tilts to the south
   position, it tilts toward the rearward portion 114 (sometimes referred to hereinafter as
   "pitched up"), and when the robot 100 tilts to the north position, it tilts towards the
   forward portion 112 (sometimes referred to hereinafter as "pitched down"). Additionally,
20 the robot 100 tilts about the Y axis. The robot 100 may tilt to the east of the Y axis
   (sometimes referred to hereinafter as a "right roll"), or the robot 100 may tilt to the west
   of the Y axis (sometimes referred to hereinafter as a "left roll"). Therefore, a change in
   the tilt of the robot 100 about the X axis is a change in its pitch, and a change in the tilt of
   the robot 100 about the Y axis is a change in its roll. In addition, the robot 100 may
25 either tilt to the right, i.e., an east position, or to the left i.e., a west position. In some
   examples, the robot tilts about the X axis and about the Y axis having tilt positions, such
   as northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. As the robot 100 is traversing a floor
   surface, the robot 100 may make a left or right turn about its Z axis (sometimes referred
   to hereinafter as a change in the yaw). A change in the yaw causes the robot 100 to make
30 a left turn or a right turn while it is moving. Thus, the robot 100 may have a change in
   one or more of its pitch, roll, or yaw at the same time.
   2852283vl                                          9

   [0054]       In some implementations, the forward portion 112 of the body 110 carries a
   bumper 130, which detects (e.g., via one or more sensors) one or more events in a drive
   path of the robot 100, for example, as the wheel modules 120a, 120b propel the robot 100
   across the cleaning surface 10 during a cleaning routine. The robot 100 may respond to
 5 events (e.g., obstacles, cliffs, walls 20) detected by the bumper 130 by controlling the
   wheel modules 120a, 120b to maneuver the robot 100 in response to the event (e.g., away
   from an obstacle). While some sensors (not shown) are described herein as being
   arranged on the bumper 130, these sensors can additionally or alternatively be arranged at
   any of various different positions on the robot 100. The bumper 130 has a shape
10 complementing the robot body 110 and extends forward the robot body 110 making the
   overall dimension of the forward portion 112 wider than the rearward portion 114 of the
   robot body (the robot as shown has a square shape).
   [0055]       A user interface 140 disposed on a top portion 118 of the body 110 receives
   one or more user commands and/or displays a status of the robot 100. The user interface
15 140 is in communication with a robot controller 150 carried by the robot 100 such that
   one or more commands received by the user interface 140 can initiate execution of a
   cleaning routine by the robot 100. In some examples, the user interface 140 includes a
   power button, which allows a user to turn on/off the robot 100. In addition, the user
   interface 140 may include a release mechanism to release a removable and/or disposable
20 cleaning element, such as a cleaning pad 400, attached to the robot body 110 over a trash
   can without the user touching the pad 400. The release mechanism may be a release
   button (not shown) or a lever (not shown) that a user can pull or push allowing the robot
   body 110 to release the cleaning pad 400 from the pad holder assembly 190.
   Additionally or alternatively, for a cleaning robot, an open button (not shown) may be
25 part of the user interface 140. The open button opens a door to a reservoir 170 allowing a
   user to fill/empty water. The controller 150 includes a computing processor 152 (e.g.,
   central processing unit) in communication with non-transitory memory 154 (e.g., a hard
   disk, flash memory, random-access memory).
   [0056]       In some examples, a handle 119 is disposed on the top portion 118 of the body
30 110. The handle 119 may pivotally flip along the transverse axis X of the robot body
   110. In a closed position, the handle 119 is disposed substantially parallel to the top
   2852283vl
                                                   10

   portion 118 of the body 110. In an open position, the handle 119 is disposed substantially
   perpendicular to the top portion 118 of the body 110. The handle 119 may include a
   friction lock (not shown) in the open position to keep the robot stable when a user is
   carrying the robot 100 or when the user is inserting or removing the battery 102 or
 5 changing the cleaning pad 400.
   [0057]      Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the robot body 110 may support a rear spring 180
   for supporting the top portion 118 of the robot body 110. The rear spring 180 levels the
   robot body 110 parallel to the floor and allows for compression of the robot 100 if weight
   is applied on its top portion 118. If a person steps on the top portion 118 of the robot
10 100, the rear springs 180 and the wheel springs (not shown) compress and allow the
   bottom portion 116 of the robot body 110 to rest on the floor surface. The rear springs
   180 have a stop mechanism 182 that refrains the springs 180 from further compression
   after a predetermined threshold. The mechanism protects the drive assembly 120 from
   damage from an external application of force, such as a person stepping on the robot 100.
15 The rear spring 180 may include a pre-bent strip of spring steel bent down to support the
   spring at a pre-loaded position. In some examples, the robot body 110 includes front
   springs 184 having the same features as the rear springs 180.
   [0058]      Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, the drive system 120 includes right and left driven
   wheel modules 120a, 120b housed by a drive housing 121 having forward and rearward
20 portions 121a, 121b. The wheel modules 120a, 120b are substantially opposed along a
   transverse axis X defined by the body 110 and include respective drive motors 122a,
   122b driving respective wheels 124a, 124b also housed by the drive housing 121. The
   drive motors 122a, 122b may releasably connect to the drive housing 121 (e.g., via
   fasteners or tool-less connections) with the drive motors 122a, 122b optionally positioned
25 substantially adjacent the respective wheels 124a, 124b. The wheel modules 120a, 120b
   can be releasably attached to the drive housing 121 and forced into engagement with the
   cleaning surface 10 by respective springs. In some examples, the wheels 124a, 124b are
   releasably supported by the drive housing 121. The wheels 124a, 124b may have a
   biased-to-drop suspension system, which improves traction of the wheel modules 120a,
30 120b over slippery floors (e.g., hardwood, wet floors). The wheels 124a, 124b define a
   wheel axis W extending from the center of one wheel to the center of the other wheel and
   2852283v1
                                                 11

   substantially parallel to the floor surface 10. The wheels 124a, 124b rotate about the
   wheel axis W when the robot 100 is traversing a floor surface 10. The wheels 124a, 124b
   have enough traction to overcome the friction between the cleaning pad 400 and the floor
   surface 10. In some examples, the friction between the cleaning pad 400 and the floor
 5 surface 10 is different when the cleaning pad 400 is dry than when the cleaning pad 400
   has absorbed the cleaning fluid 172. The robot 100 may increase the volumetric flow rate
   of dispensing of the cleaning fluid 172 and/or the traction force to overcome the increase
   of friction between the cleaning pad 400 and the floor surface 10. In some
   implementation, the robot 100 applies cleaning fluid 172 at an initial volumetric flow rate
10 V initially, while the cleaning pad 400 is dry or mostly dry. As the cleaning pad 400
   absorbs cleaning fluid 172 and friction between the cleaning pad 400 and the floor
   surface 10 decreases, the robot 100 applies fluid at a second volumetric flow rate Vf that
   is lower than the initial volumetric flow rate Vi (Vi> V).
   [0059]       An arm 123 is attached to the forward portion of the drive housing 121. The
15 arm 123 is pivotally attachable to the robot body 110 forward of the drive wheels 124a,
   124b to allow the drive housing 121 to move vertically with respect to the floor surface
   10 via a rubber pivot mount 125. The rearward portion 121b of the drive housing 121
   defines a slot 127. The slot 127 is sized to slidably receive a guide protrusion 111
   defined by or disposed on the robot body 110. The slot 127 allows the robot body 110 to
20 move with respect to the drive system 120 if vertical pressure is applied to the robot body
   110 and the rear springs 180 are compressed due to the pressure. The robot 100 may
   include a caster wheel (not shown) disposed to support a rearward portion 114 of the
   robot body 110.
   [0060]       Referring back to FIG. 3, the robot body 110 supports a power source 102
25 (e.g., a battery) for powering any electrical components of the robot 100. In some
   examples, the power source 102 includes swing out prongs (not shown) to allow direct
   plug into the wall outlets. The robot 100 may include (e.g., on the top portion 118 visible
   to the user) an indicator for indicating when the power source 102 is ready to be used or
   when it is empty and needs to be recharged. In some examples, the power source 102
30 may be releasably connected to the robot body 110 and may be charged separately
   without being connected to the robot body 110. In some examples, the power source 102
   2852283vl                                      12

   is releasably connected to the robot body 110 and is insertably mated into a universal
   plug adapter (not show) for use across a range of voltages, for example 110-220V. The
   power source 102 may include one or more rechargeable batteries (e.g., nickel-metal
   hydride battery (NiMH)). In some implementations, the power source 102 is sized to a
 5 certain weight or includes metal weight plates to provide stability to the rearward portion
   114 of the robot body 110 to achieve a specific weight ratio between the drive wheels
   124a, 124b and the cleaning pad 400.
   [0061]       The robot controller 150 (FIGS.16 and 17), executing a control system 210,
   may execute behaviors 300 that cause the robot 100 to take an action, such as maneuver
10 in a wall following manner, a floor scrubbing manner, or changing its direction of travel
   when an obstacle (e.g., chair, table, sofa, etc.) is detected. The robot controller 150 can
   maneuver the robot 100 in any direction across the cleaning surface 10 by independently
   controlling the rotational speed and direction of each wheel module 120a, 120b. For
   example, the robot controller 150 can maneuver the robot 100 in the forward F, reverse
15 (aft) A, right R, and left L directions.
   [0062]       The robot 100 may include a cleaning system 160 (FIG.15) for cleaning or
   treating a floor surface 10. As shown in FIG. 12, the cleaning system 160 may include a
   fluid applicator 162 that extends along the transverse axis X and dispenses cleaning fluid
   172 onto the floor surface 10. The fluid applicator 162 may be a sprayer having at least
20 one nozzle 164 that distributes fluid 172 over the floor surface 10. In some examples, the
   nozzle 164 sprays forward and downward to cover one robot length I and/or one robot
   width w in front of the robot 100. The outside lengthwise edges of the robot 100 and the
   outside widthwise edges of the robot 100 bound a footprint area AF of the robot 100, or
   the planar surface area occupied by the robot 100. In other implementations, the outside
25 periphery and/or circumference of a non-rectangular robot 100 bounds the footprint area
   AF of the robot 100.
   [0063]       In some implementations, the robot 100 only applies fluid to areas of the floor
   surface 10 that the robot 100 has already traversed. In one example, the fluid applicator
   162 has multiple nozzles 164 each configured to spray the fluid 172 in a direction
30 different than another nozzle 164. The fluid applicator 162 may apply fluid 172
   downward rather than outward, dripping or spraying fluid 172 directly in front of the
   2852283v1                                      13

   robot 100. In some examples, the fluid applicator 162 is a microfiber cloth or strip, a
   fluid dispersion brush, or a sprayer.
   [0064]       Referring to FIGS. 13A-13E, in some implementations, the robot 100 may
   execute a cleaning behavior 300a (FIG. 16) by moving in a forward direction F toward an
 5 obstacle 20, followed by moving in a backward or reverse direction A. As indicated in
   FIGS. 13 A and 13B, the robot 100 may drive in a forward drive direction a first distance
   Fd to a first location L1 . As the robot 100 moves backwards a second distance Ad to a
   second location L2 , the nozzle 164 sprays fluid 172 onto the floor surface 10 in a forward
   and/or downward direction in front of the robot 100 after the robot 100 has moved at least
10 a distance D across an area of the floor surface 10 that was already traversed in the
   forward drive direction F. In one example, the fluid 172 is applied to an area
   substantially equal to the area footprint AF of the robot 100. Because distance D is the
   distance spanning at least the length of the robot 100, the robot 100 determines that it is
   clear floor surface 10 unoccupied by furniture, walls 20, cliffs, carpets or other surfaces
15 or obstacles onto which cleaning fluid 172 would be applied if the robot 100 had not
   already verified the presence of a clear floor surface 10 for receiving cleaning fluid. By
   moving in a forward direction F and then backing up prior to applying cleaning fluid 172,
   the robot 100 identifies boundaries, such as a flooring changes and walls, and prevents
   fluid damage to those items.
20 [0065]       As shown in FIGS. 2 and 11, in some examples, the fluid applicator 162 is a
   sprayer 162 that includes at least two nozzles 164, each spraying the fluid in a fan-like
   shape and distributing the fluid 172 evenly across the floor surface 10. The fluid
   applicator 162 may include a front cover plate 166 that houses the nozzles 164. The front
   cover plate 166 may be removed for cleaning or replacing the nozzles 164.
25 [0066]       Referring to FIGS. 13C-13E, in some examples, the robot 100 may drive back
   and forth to cover a specific portion of the floor surface 10, wetting the cleaning pad 400
   at the start of a cleaning run and/or scrubbing the floor surface 10. As the robot 100
   drives back and forth, it cleans the area it is traversing and therefore provides a thorough
   scrub to the floor surface 10.
30 [0067]       In some examples, the fluid applicator 162 applies fluid 172 to an area in front
   of the cleaning pad 400 and in the direction of travel (e.g., forward direction F) of the
   2852283vl                                       14

   mobile robot 100. In some examples, the fluid 172 is applied to an area the cleaning pad
   400 has previously occupied. In some examples, the area the cleaning pad 400 has
   occupied is recorded on a stored map that is accessible to the controller 150.
   [0068]       In some examples, the robot 100 knows where it has been based on storing its
 5 coverage locations on a map stored on the non-transitory-memory 154 of the robot 100 or
   on an external storage medium accessible by the robot 100 through wired or wireless
   means during a cleaning run. The robot 100 sensors 510 (FIG. 15) may include a camera
   and/or one or more ranging lasers for building a map of a space. In some examples, the
   robot controller 150 uses the map of walls, furniture, flooring changes and other obstacles
10 to position and pose the robot 100 at locations far enough away from obstacles and/or
   flooring changes prior to the application of cleaning fluid 172. This has the advantage of
   applying fluid 172 to areas of floor surface 10 having no known obstacles thereon.
   [0069]       In some examples, the robot 100 moves in a back and forth motion to moisten
   the cleaning pad 400 and/or scrub the floor surface 10 to which fluid 172 has been
15 applied. The robot 100 may move in a birdsfoot pattern through the footprint area AF on
   the floor surface 10 to which fluid 172 has been applied. As depict, in some
   implementations, the birdsfoot cleaning routine involves moving the robot 100 in forward
   direction F and a backward or reverse direction A along a center trajectory 1000 and in
   forward direction F and a backward direction A along left 1010 and right 1005
20 trajectories. In some examples, the left trajectory 1010 and the right trajectory 1005 are
   arcuate trajectories that extend outward in an arc from a starting point along the center
   trajectory 1000. The left trajectory 1010 and the right trajectory 1005 may be straight
   line trajectories that extend outward in a straight line from the center trajectory 1000.
   [0070]       FIGS. 13C and 13E depict two birdsfoot trajectories. In the example of FIG.
25 13C, the robot 100 moves in a forward direction F from Position A along the center
   trajectory 1000 until it encounters a wall 20 and triggers a sensor 510, such as a bump
   sensor, at Position B. The robot 100 then moves in a backward direction A along the
   center trajectory to a distance equal to or greater than the distance to be covered by fluid
   application. For example, the robot 100 moves backward along the center trajectory
30 1000 by at least one robot length I to Position G, which may be the same position as
   Position A. The robot 100 applies fluid 172 to an area substantially equal to the footprint
   2852283vl
                                                  15

   area AF of the robot 100 and returns to the wall 20, the cleaning pad 400 passing through
   the fluid 172 and cleaning the floor surface 10. From position B, the robot 100 retracts
   either along a left trajectory 1010 or a right trajectory 1005 before returning to Position B
   and covering the remaining trajectory. Each time the robot 100 moves forward and
 5 backward along the center trajectory 1000, left trajectory 1010 and right trajectory 1005,
   the cleaning pad 400 passes through the applied fluid 172, scrubbing dirt, debris and
   other particulate matter from the floor surface 10 to which the fluid 172 is applied and
   absorbing the dirty fluid into the cleaning pad 400 and away from the floor surface 10.
   The scrubbing motion of the moistened pad combined with the solvent characteristics of
10 the cleaning fluid 172 breaks down and loosens dried stains and dirt. The cleaning fluid
   172 applied by the robot 100 suspends loosened debris such that the cleaning pad 400
   absorbs the suspended debris and wicks it away from the floor surface 10.
   [0071]       In the example of FIG. 13D, the robot 100 similarly moves from a starting
   position, Position A, through applied fluid 172, along a center trajectory 1000 to a wall
15 position, Position B. The robot 100 backs off of the wall 20 along the center trajectory
   1000 to Position C, which may be the same position as Position A, before covering left
   and right trajectories 1010, 1005, extending to positions D and F, with the cleaning fluid
   172 distributed along the trajectories 1010, 1005 by the cleaning pad 400. In one
   example, each time the robot 100 extends along a trajectory outward from the center
20 trajectory 1000, the robot 100 returns to a position along the center trajectory as indicated
   by Positions A, C, E and G, as depicted in FIG. 13D. In some implementations, the robot
   100 may vary the sequence of backward direction A movements and forward direction F
   movements along one or more distinct trajectories to move the cleaning pad 400 and
   cleaning fluid 172 in an effective and efficient coverage pattern across the floor surface
25 10.
   [0072]       In some examples, the robot 100 may move in a birdsfoot coverage pattern to
   moisten all portions of the cleaning pad 400 upon starting a cleaning run. As depicted in
   FIG. 9B, the bottom surface 400b of the cleaning pad 400 has a center area Pc and right
   and left lateral edge areas PR and PL. When the robot 100 starts a cleaning run, or
30 cleaning routine, the cleaning pad 400 is dry and needs to be moistened to reduce friction
   and also to spread cleaning fluid 172 along the floor surface 10 to scrub debris therefrom.
   2852283vl                                       16

   The robot 100 therefore applies fluid at a higher volumetric flow rate initially at the start
   of a cleaning run such that the cleaning pad 400 is readily moistened. As FIG. 13E
   depicts, in some examples, at the start of a cleaning run, the robot 100 drives the cleaning
   pad 400 through applied fluid 172 such that the center area Pc of the bottom surface 400b
 5 of the cleaning pad 400 and the left and right lateral edge areas PR and PL of the cleaning
   pad 400 each pass through the applied fluid separately, thereby moistening the entire
   cleaning pad 400 along the entire bottom surface 400b of the cleaning pad 400 in contact
   with the floor surface 10.
   [0073]       In the example of FIG. 13E, the robot 100 moves in a forward direction F and
10 then backward direction A along a center trajectory 1000, passing the center of the pad
   400 through the applied fluid 172. The robot 100 then drives in a forward direction F and
   backward direction A along a right trajectory 1005, passing the left lateral area PL of the
   cleaning pad 400 through the applied fluid 172. The robot 100 then drives in a forward
   direction F and backward direction A along a left trajectory 1010, passing the right lateral
15 area PR of the cleaning pad 400 through the applied fluid 172. At the start of the cleaning
   run, the robot applies fluid 172 at a relatively high initial volumetric flow rate Vi,
   applying a larger quantity of fluid 172 to the surface 10 to moisten the cleaning pad 400
   quickly. Once the cleaning pad 400 is moistened, the robot 100 continues its cleaning
   run and subsequently applies fluid 172 at a second volumetric flow rate Vf. This second
20 volumetric flow rate Vf is relatively lower than the initial flow rate V at the start of the
   cleaning run because the cleaning pad 400 is already moistened and effectively moves
   cleaning fluid across the surface 10 as it scrubs. The robot 100 adjusts the volumetric
   flow rate Vsuch that a cleaning pad 400 of specified dimensions is moistened on the
   exterior (i.e. the bottom surface 400b) without being fully wetted to capacity internally.
25 The bottom surface 400b of the cleaning pad 400 is initially moistened without the
   absorbent interior of the pad 400 being water logged such that the cleaning pad 400
   remains fully absorbent for the remainder of the cleaning run.
   [0074]       The back and forth movement of the robot 100 breaks down stains 22 on the
   floor surface 10. The broken down stains 22 are then absorbed by the cleaning pad 400.
30 In some examples, the cleaning pad 400 picks up enough of the sprayed fluid 172 to
   avoid uneven streaks.     In some examples, the cleaning pad 400 leaves a residue of the
   2852283vl
                                                  17

   solution to provide a nice sheen look on the floor surface 10 being scrubbed. In some
   examples, the fluid 172 contains antibacterial solution; therefore, a thin layer of residue is
   purposely not absorbed by the cleaning pad 400 to allow the fluid 172 to kill a higher
   percentage of germs.
 5 [0075]       Referring to FIGS. 3 and 11, a reservoir 170 housed by the robot body 110
   holds the fluid 172 (i.e. cleaning solution) and is connected to the nozzle 164 by a tube
   168. The reservoir 170 may be housed in the rearward portion 114 of the robot 100. The
   cleaning system 160 may also include a pump motor 174 for transferring the fluid 172
   from the reservoir 170 to the nozzle 164 via the tubes 168. The tube 168 runs from the
10 reservoir 170 through the pump motor 174 and ends at the fluid applicator 162. The tube
   168 connects to the reservoir 170 at a lowest point in the reservoir 170 to allow draining
   of almost all the fluid 172 in the reservoir 170. In some examples, the pump motor 174 is
   a peristaltic pump having a rotor with a number of rollers attached to an external
   circumference of the rotor and compressing the flexible tube 168. As the rotor turns, the
15 part of the tube 168 being compressed is pinched closed, which leads to forcing the fluid
   172 to be pumped and moved through the tube 168.
   [0076]       The reservoir 170 may hold a fluid 172 having a volume between 200 ml and
   250 ml or more. The reservoir 170 may have a semi-transparent portion or may be fully
   transparent to allow a user to know how much fluid 172 is left in the reservoir 170. The
20 transparent portion may include an indication that allows the user to identify the volume
   of fluid 172 remaining and if the reservoir 170 needs to be refilled. In some examples,
   where the robot 100 carries a cleaning pad 400, the cleaning pad 400 may absorb 85% to
   95% of the fluid volume contained in the reservoir 170.
   [0077]       The reservoir 170 includes a cap 176 for allowing a user to empty or fill the
25 reservoir 170 with fluid 172. The cap 176 may be made of rubber to improve sealing the
   reservoir 170 after being filled with fluid 172. The cap 176 may include a retainer post
   (not shown) that connects the cap 176 to the robot 100 when a user opens the cap 176 to
   fill the tank 170. In some examples, an air release valve (not shown) is incorporated into
   the cap 176 to allow air to enter the reservoir 170 as the pump draws out cleaning
30 solution to off-set the void left. In some examples, the air release valve is a tubular
   2852283v1
                                                  18

   opening with a soft undercut flap molded into the cap 176. The handle 119 may fully or
   substantially cover the cap 176, in its closed position.
   [0078]       Referring to FIGS. 4 and 9-12, the robot 100 may include a pad holder
   assembly 190 disposed on the bottom portion 116 of the robot body 110 and supported by
 5 the robot body 110. The pad holder assembly 190 holds a cleaning pad 400. The pad
   holder assembly 190 includes a pad holder body 194 having a top portion 194a and a
   bottom portion 194b. The bottom portion 194b may be arranged within between about            12
   cm and about 1    12 cm of the floor surface. In some examples, the bottom portion 194b
   makes up at least 40% of a surface area of a footprint of the robot. In some examples, the
10 pad holder assembly 190 is a solid rectangular plastic part that connects with all other
   parts within the robot body 110.
   [0079]       A vibration motor 196 is disposed on the top portion 194a of the pad holder
   body 194 (e.g., mounted vertically with respect to the floor surface 10). The vibration
   motor 196 vibrates the pad holder body 194, which in turn vibrates the cleaning pad 400
15 and provides a scrubbing action when the robot 100 is traversing the floor surface 10 for
   cleaning. In some examples, the vibration motor 196 is an orbital oscillator having less
   than 1 cm of orbital range, and having less than   12 cm of orbital range during at least part
   of the cleaning run, for example during parts of the run when the robot 100 is moving the
   cleaning pad 400 in a scrubbing motion. The combination of the back and forth
20 movement of the robot 100 (previously discussed) and the vibration movement improves
   the scrubbing action of the robot 100, which removes resistant stains 22 including dried
   stains, like mud and coffee, and sticky stains, like jelly and honey. In some examples, a
   cylindrical tube 197 protrudes away from the top portion 194a of the pad holder body
   194, and may be located in the center of the holder body 194. The cylindrical tube 197
25 houses the vibration motor 196 and any oscillating components or counter weights 198
   allowing them to slide in place. In some examples, counter weights 198 are disposed on
   the top portion of the pad holder body 194 attached to the motor's rotational shaft. The
   counter weights 198 provide an off-centered weight and cause the motor to wobble. This
   in turn causes the vibrating and oscillating motion of the pad holder assembly 190. The
30 weight of the robot 100 may be distributed between the drive wheels 124a, 124b and the
   pad holder assembly 190 at a ratio of 3 to 1, where the heaviest portion of the robot body
   2852283v1
                                                  19

   110 is either above the drive wheels 124a, 124b or above the pad holder assembly 190.
   In some examples, the center of gravity CGr of the robot 100 is positioned forward the
   drive wheels124a, 124b, therefore causing a majority of an overall weight of the robot
   100 to be positioned over the pad holder body 194. The overall weight of the robot 100
 5 may be between about 2 lbs. to about 5 lbs. Positioning the majority of the overall
   weight of the robot 100 over the pad holder body 194 has the advantage of concentrating
   the application downward force at the cleaning pad 400 of this lightweight robot 100 and
   keeping the cleaning pad 400 in contact with the floor surface 10.
   [0080]      Referring to FIGS. 4 and 10, a retainer 193 is disposed on the bottom portion
10 194b of the pad holder body 194 for retaining the cleaning pad 400. The retainer 193
   may include hook-and-loop fasteners. Other types of retainers may be used to connect
   the cleaning pad 400 to the pad holder body 194, such as brackets, which, as previously
   discussed, may be configured to allow the release of the cleaning pad 400 upon activation
   of a pad release mechanism located on the top portion 118 of the robot body 110.
15 [0081]      In some examples, the pad holder assembly 190 includes at least one post 192
   disposed on the top portion 194a of the pad holder body 194. The post 192 may have a
   cross sectional diameter varying in size along its length and is sized to fit in an aperture
   113 defined by the robot body 110. As shown, the pad holder assembly 190 includes four
   posts 192. The robot body 110 includes four apertures 113 for receiving the four posts
20 192, attaching the pad holder assembly 190 to the robot body 110. Once assembled, the
   four posts 192 are inserted into the four apertures 113 of the robot body 110, interlocking
   the robot body 110 and the pad holder assembly 190. In some examples, the posts 192
   are of a vibration dampening material to allow the pad holder assembly 190 to oscillate in
   the horizontal plane under the power of the motor 196 and allows for scrubbing. In
25 addition, the posts 192 control the vibration in the vertical direction thereby controlling
   the spacing between the pad holder assembly 190 and the robot body 110.
   [0082]      The cleaning pad 400 is configured to absorb the fluid 172 that the sprayer
   162 sprays on the floor surface 10 and any smears (e.g., dirt, oil, food, sauces, coffee,
   coffee grounds) that are being absorbed. Some of the smears may have viscoelastic
30 properties, which exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristic (e.g., honey). The
   cleaning pad 400 is absorbent and has an outer surface that is abrasive. As the robot 100
   2852283vl                                     20

   moves about the floor surface 10, the cleaning pad 400 wipes the floor surface 10 with
   the abrasive side (i.e., the abrasion layer) and absorbs cleaning solution sprayed onto the
   floor surface 10 with only a light amount of force.
   [0083]       The cleaning pad 400 is designed, therefore, to wipe and absorb solution
 5 sprayed onto the floor surface 10 with very little application of downward force. The
   cleaning pad 400 may include an abrasive outer layer (not shown) and an absorbent inner
   layer for absorbing and retaining the fluid 172 that the robot 100 sprays on the floor
   surface 10. The abrasive outer layer is in contact with the floor surface 10, while the
   absorbent inner layer is attached to the bottom portion 194b of the holder pad 194. The
10 abrasion layer helps scrub the surface floor 10 and remove stubborn stains 22 while the
   absorbent layer absorbs the fluid 172 and the dirt and debris. The cleaning pad 400 may
   leave a thin sheen on the floor surface 10 that will air dry and not leave marks. If the
   cleaning pad 400 absorbs too much fluid 172, the cleaning pad 400 may be suctioned to
   the floor due to the friction between the cleaning pad 400 and the floor surface 10. The
15 abrasive outer liner is an absorbent material that picks up dirt and debris and leaves a thin
   sheen on the surface that will air dry and not leave marks.
   [0084]       The cleaning pad 400 is designed to be strong enough to withstand the
   vibration of the pad holder body 194, which causes the cleaning pad 400 to move back
   and forth and/or oscillate, thereby scrubbing as the robot 100 traverses the floor surface
20 10. The cleaning pad 400 has a top surface 400a attached to the bottom surface 194b of
   the pad holder body 194. The top surface 400b of the pad 400 is substantially immobile
   relative to the oscillating pad holder body 194 and more than 80 percent of the orbital
   range of the orbital oscillator is transmitted from the top surface 400a of the held cleaning
   pad 400 to the bottom surface 400b of the held cleaning pad 400 in contact with the floor
25 surface 10. Moreover, the back and forth movement of the robot 100 alone, and/or in
   combination with oscillation of the pad, breaks down stains 22 on the surface floor 10,
   which the cleaning pad 400 absorbs.
   [0085]       In some implementations, as the cleaning pad 400 is cleaning a floor surface
   10, it absorbs the cleaning fluid 172 applied to the floor surface 10. The cleaning pad 400
30 may absorb enough fluid 172 without changing its shape. The cleaning pad 400 has
   substantially similar dimensions before cleaning the floor surface 10 and after cleaning
   2852283vl                                      21

   the floor surface. This characteristic of the cleaning pad 400 prevents the robot 100 from
   tilting backwards or pitching up if the cleaning pad 400 expands. In some examples, the
   cleaning pad 400 absorbs up to 180 ml or 90% of the total fluid 172 contained in the
   robot tank 170. The cleaning pad 400 is sufficiently rigid to support the front of the
 5 robot.
   [0086]      Referring to FIG. 14, the robot 100 has a clearance distance C from the floor
   surface 10 to the bottom portion 116 of the robot 100. Therefore, the cleaning pad 400
   may have a minimal expansion rate to prevent the robot 100 from tilting. In some
   examples, the robot 100 may tilt about the wheel axis W due to the minimal increase in
10 total pad thickness TT. The robot 100 may have a threshold tilt angle a about the wheel
   axis W where the robot 100 may tilt without interference in its normal cleaning behavior.
   [0087]      Referring to FIGS. 15 and 16, to achieve reliable and robust autonomous
   movement, the robot 100 may include a sensor system 500 having several different types
   of sensors 510, which can be used in conjunction with one another to create a perception
15 of the robot's 100 environment sufficient to allow the robot 100 to make intelligent
   decisions about actions to take in that environment. The sensor system 500 may include
   one or more types of sensors 510 supported by the robot body 110, which may include
   obstacle detection/obstacle avoidance (ODOA) sensors, communication sensors,
   navigation sensors, etc. For example, the sensor system 500 may include, but not limited
20 to, proximity sensors (e.g. infrared sensors), contact sensors (e.g., bump switches),
   imaging sensors (e.g., volumetric point cloud imaging, three-dimensional (3D) imaging
   or depth map sensors, visible light camera and/or infrared camera), ranging sensors (e.g.,
   sonar, radar, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging, which can entail optical remote
   sensing that measures properties of scattered light to find range and/or other information
25 of a distant target), LADAR (Laser Detection and Ranging)), etc.
   [0088]      In some examples, the sensor system 500 includes an inertial measurement
   unit (IMU) 512 in communication with the controller 150 to measure and monitor a
   moment of inertia of the robot 100 with respect to the overall center of gravity CGR of the
   robot 100. The controller 150 may monitor any deviation in feedback from the IMU 512
30 from a threshold signal corresponding to normal unencumbered operation. For example,
   if the robot 100 begins to pitch away from an upright position, it may be impeded, or
   2852283vl                                     22

   someone may have suddenly added a heavy payload. In these instances, it may be
   necessary to take urgent action (including, but not limited to, evasive maneuvers,
   recalibration, and/or issuing an audio/visual warning) in order to assure proper continued
   operation of the robot 100.
 5 [0089]       When accelerating from a stop, the controller 150 may take into account a
   moment of inertia of the robot 100 from its overall center of gravity CGR to prevent the
   robot 100 from tipping. The controller 150 may use a model of its pose, including its
   current moment of inertia. When payloads are supported, the controller 150 may
   measure a load impact on the overall center of gravity CGR and monitor movement of the
10 robot 100 moment of inertia. If this is not possible, the controller 150 may apply a test
   torque command to the drive system 120 and measure actual linear and angular
   acceleration of the robot using the IMU 512, in order to experimentally determine
   operating limits.
   [0090]       The IMU 512 may measure and monitor a moment of inertia of the robot 100
15 based on relative values. In some implementations, and over a period of time, constant
   movement may cause the IMU 512 to drift. The controller 150 executes a resetting
   command to recalibrate the IMU 512 and reset it to zero. Before resetting the IMU 512,
   the controller 150 determines if the robot 100 is tilted, and issues the resetting command
   only if the robot 100 is on a flat surface.
20 [0091]       In some implementations, the robot 100 includes a navigation system 600
   configured to allow the robot 100 to navigate the floor surface 10 without colliding into
   obstacles 20 or falling down stairs, and to intelligently recognize relatively dirty floor
   areas for cleaning. Moreover, the navigation system 600 can maneuver the robot 100 in
   deterministic and pseudo-random patterns across the floor surface 10. The navigation
25 system 600 may be a behavior based system stored and/or executed on the robot
   controller 150. The navigation system 600 may communicate with the sensor system 500
   to determine and issue drive commands to the drive system 120. The navigation system
   600 influences and configures the robot behaviors 300, thus allowing the robot 100 to
   behave in a systematic preplanned movement. In some examples, the navigation system
30 600 receives data from the sensor system 500 and plans a desired path for the robot 100
   to traverse. In some examples, the navigation system 600 includes a map stored on the
   2852283vl                                     23

   non-transitory-memory 154 of the robot 100 or on an external storage medium accessible
   by the robot 100 through wired or wireless means during a cleaning run. The robot 100
   sensors 510 (FIG. 15) may include a camera and/or one or more ranging lasers for
   building a map of a space. In some examples, the robot controller 150 uses the map of
 5 walls, furniture, flooring changes and other obstacles to position and pose the robot 100
   at locations far enough away from obstacles and/or flooring changes prior to the
   application of cleaning fluid 172. This has the advantage of applying fluid 172 to areas
   of floor surface 10 having no known obstacles thereon.
   [0092]      In some implementations, the controller 150 (e.g., a device having one or
10 more computing processors 152 in communication with non-transitory memory 154
   capable of storing instructions executable on the computing processor(s)152) executes a
   control system 210, which includes a behavior system 210a and a control arbitration
   system 210b in communication with each other. The control arbitration system 210b
   allows robot applications 220 to be dynamically added and removed from the control
15 system 210, and facilitates allowing applications 220 to each control the robot 100
   without needing to know about any other applications 220. In other words, the control
   arbitration system 21 Ob provides a simple prioritized control mechanism between
   applications 220 and resources 240 of the robot 100.
   [0093]      In the example shown, the behavior system 210a includes an obstacle
20 detection/obstacle avoidance (ODOA) behavior 300b for determining responsive robot
   actions based on obstacles 20 perceived by the sensor (e.g., turn away; turn around; stop
   before the obstacle, etc.). Another behavior 300 may include a wall following behavior
   300c for driving adjacent a detected wall (e.g., in a wiggle pattern of driving toward and
   away from the wall). The behavior system 210a may include a dirt hunting behavior
25 300d (where the sensor(s) detect a dirty spot on the floor surface 10 and the robot 100
   veers towards the spot for cleaning). Other behaviors 300 may include a spot cleaning
   behavior (e.g., the robot 100 follows a comrow pattern to clean a specific spot), and a
   cliff behavior (e.g., the robot 100 detects stairs and avoids falling from the stairs).
   [0094]      FIG. 17 provides an exemplary arrangement of operations for a method 1700
30 of operating an autonomous mobile robot 100. Referring also to FIGS. 13A-13E, the
   method 1700 includes driving 1710 a first distance Fd in a forward drive direction F
   2852283vl                                      24

   defined by the robot 100 to a first location L 1, while smearing applied fluid 172 with a
   cleaning pad 400 carried by the robot 100 along a floor surface 10 supporting the robot
   100. The method 1700 further includes driving 1720 in a reverse drive direction A,
   opposite the forward drive direction F, a second distance    Ad to a second location L2 while
 5 smearing applied fluid 172 with the cleaning pad 400 along the floor surface 10. The
   method 1700 also includes spraying 1730 fluid 172 on the floor surface 10 in the forward
   drive direction F forward of the cleaning pad 400 but rearward of the first location L1 ,
   and driving 1740 in alternating forward and reverse drive directions F, A, while smearing
   the cleaning pad 400 along the floor surface 10 after spraying 1730 fluid 172 on the floor
10 surface 10 (see FIGS. 13A-13E).
   [0095]       In some examples, the method 1700 includes driving a first distance Fd in a
   forward drive direction F defined by the robot 100 to a first location L 1, while moving a
   cleaning pad 400 carried by the robot 100 along a floor surface 10 supporting the robot
   100. The method 1700 further includes driving in a reverse drive direction A, opposite
15 the forward drive direction F, a second distance   Ad  to a second location L 2 while moving
   the cleaning pad 400 along the floor surface 10. The method 1700 also includes applying
   fluid 172 on the floor surface 10 in an area substantially equal to a footprint area AF of
   the robot in the forward drive direction F forward of the cleaning pad 400 but rearward of
   the first location L1 . The method 1700 further includes returning the robot 100 to the
20 area of applied fluid in a movement pattern that moves the center area Pc and left and
   right lateral edge areas  PR and PL of the cleaning pad 400 separately through the area to
   moisten the cleaning pad 400 with the applied fluid 172. In some examples, the method
   1700 includes applying fluid 172 on the floor surface 10 while driving in the reverse
   direction or after having driven in the reverse drive direction the second distance which is
25 at least equal to the length of one footprint area AF of the robot 100. In some examples,
   the fluid applicator 162 applies fluid 172 to an area in front of the cleaning pad 400 and
   in the direction of travel of the mobile robot 100. In some examples, the fluid applicator
   162 applies fluid 172 to an area that the cleaning pad 400 has occupied previously. In
   some examples, the area that the cleaning pad 400 has occupied is recorded on a stored
30 map that is accessible to the controller 150.
   2852283vl
                                                  25

   [0096]      The method 1700 may include driving in a left drive direction or a right drive
   direction while driving in the alternating forward and reverse directions after applying
   fluid 172 on the floor surface 10. Applying fluid 172 on the floor surface 10 may include
   spraying fluid 172 in multiple directions with respect to the forward drive direction F. In
 5 some examples, the second distance is greater than or equal to the first distance.
   [0097]      The mobile floor cleaning robot 100 may include a robot body 110, a drive
   system 120, a pad holder assembly 190, a reservoir 170, and a fluid applicator 162, such
   as for example a microfiber cloth or strip, a fluid dispersion brush, or a sprayer. The
   robot body 110 defines the forward drive direction and has a bottom portion 116. The
10 drive system 120 supports the robot body 110 and maneuvers the robot 100 over the floor
   surface 10. The pad holder assembly 190 is disposed on the bottom portion 116 of the
   robot body 110 and holds the cleaning pad 400. The reservoir 170 is housed by the robot
   body 110 and holds a fluid 172 (e.g., 200ml). The applicator162, here a sprayer, which is
   also housed by the robot body 110, is in fluid communication with the reservoir 170 and
15 sprays the fluid 172 in the forward drive direction forward of the cleaning pad 400. The
   cleaning pad 400 disposed on the bottom portion 116 of the pad holder assembly 190
   may absorb about 90% of the fluid 172 contained in the reservoir 170. In some
   examples, the cleaning pad 400 has a width of between about 80 millimeters and about 68
   millimeters and a length of between about 200 millimeters and about 212 millimeters.
20 The cleaning pad 400 may have a thickness of between about 6.5 millimeters and about
   8.5 millimeters.
   [0098]      A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be
   understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and
   scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the
25 following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a
   different order and still achieve desirable results.
