                                              FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The invention relates to devices, in particular, bone screws, washers and bone screw manifolds
   and methods of use thereof for the treatment of bone defects.
 0                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Fixation tools and devices, which are available in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes,
   have long been used in the repair of bone defects, such as bone fractures. A physician typically sets the
   bone to be repaired in the proper position and then uses the fixation tools and devices to secure the bone
   in that position during the healing process.
 5           A fixation device, such as a bone plate or rod, can be secured to the bone by a fixation tool, such
   as a bone screw. Alternatively, a bone screw can be used by itself to repair a bone defect. One
   drawback associated with prior art bone screws is the potential for the bone screw to back out after
   implantation. To inhibit back out, bone screws have been modified with various thread designs and
   locking features, with some success.
 o           When installing a bone anchor or screw, a surgeon will typically tap a hole, remove the tap and
   then install the screw into the hole while maintaining the alignment of the bone with another bone or
   prosthesis. The bone screw can be secured in the bony bed by filling the hole before installation of the
   screw with a bone cement, such as polymethylmethacrylate or other fillable and flowable materials.
             The use of a solid screw with a bone cement or other fillable material may increase the initial
 5 stiffness and strength of the repair, but may not significantly decrease loosening of the screw at the repair
   site. The substitution of solid screws with cannulated screws that can extrude a bone cement or other
   fillable material may improve the strength of the repair while at the same time reducing the likelihood that
   the screw will loosen and pull out, but distribution of the bone cement or fillable material through the
   screw and throughout the repair site remains a problem. In particular, self-hardening bone cements
30 change viscosity after formulation and the even distribution along the length of the bone screw is
   challenging for such materials. Another challenge is providing adequate distribution of a bone cement or
   fillable material while maintaining sufficient screw mechanical strength. Often increasing the number of
   delivery channels or ports in the screw body can weaken the bone screw. Thus, there remains a need for
   a cannulated bone screw for use with a bone cement or fillable material that is capable of securing bone
35 at a repair site while also preventing loosening and pull-out of the bone screw following the repair.

   does not rise to the level of pathogenesis.
              The term "bioresorbable" is meant the ability of a material to be resorbed by the body in vivo. The
   resorption process involves elimination of the original bioresorbable implant materials through the action
   of body fluids, enzymes, or cells. "Strongly bioresorbable" means that at least 80% of the total mass of
 0 material implanted in vivo is resorbed within one year.
              By "bone defect" is meant any bone deficient region, such as a void, gap, recess, or other
   discontinuity in a bone. A bone defect can be artificially or naturally established, and can occur, for
   example, due to disease or trauma. Thus, a bone defect can occur as a consequence of pathologic or
   inflammatory diseases, formation and/or removal of a bone tumor, a surgical intervention, a congenital
 5 defect, or a bone fracture, and the like. For example, in the case of certain diseases, such as bone
   tumors, the bone defect may be artificially established due to removal of the tumor tissue. The bone
   screws of the invention can be applied, for example, in the repair of periodontal defects, in craniofacial or
   maxillofacial surgery or reconstruction, in hand surgery, in joint reconstruction, in fracture repair, in
   orthopedic surgical procedures, and in spinal fusion. The term "bony defect" is also intended to include
30 anatomical sites where augmentation to a bony feature is desired by the patient in the absence of disease
   or trauma, such as in elective cosmetic surgery. Thus, the "defect" can be one that is subjectively
   perceived by the patient, and where augmentation of the bone deficient region is desired.
              By "bone fill material" or "infill material" is meant any material for infilling a bone that includes an
   in-situ hardenable material, including, e.g., a flowable medium. The fill material also can include other
35 "fillers," such as filaments, microspheres, powders, granular elements, flakes, chips, tubules and the like,
   autograft or allograft materials, as well as other chemicals, pharmacological agents, or other bioactive
   agents.
              By "flowable medium" is meant, generally, a formulation of a resorbable or non-resorbable
   biocompatible agent, e.g., a polymer, such as a thermoset polymer or a thermoplastic polymer, e.g.,
40 PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), a bone void filler material, a cement, or a pharmaceutical agent. In
   particular, the flowable medium may be a resorbable calcium phosphate or calcium sulphate cement,
   which is typically self-hardening and, once hardened, may allow for the gradual replacement of the
                                                                6

   commercially available cements such as BETA-BSMTM injectable paste and CARRIGEN@ porous bone
   substitute material (Etex Corporation, Cambridge, MA).
 0           By "major diameter" of a bone screw is meant the longest diameter of the screw body, in a
   threaded portion, including its threads.
             By "minor diameter" of a bone screw is meant the shortest diameter of the screw body, in a
   threaded portion, including its threads.
             By "osteoplasty" is meant any procedure in which bone fill material and/or a flowable medium is
 5 delivered into the interior of a bone.
             By "self-cutting edge" is meant an edge, flute or angle of a groove or thread of a bone screw that
   allows the screw to be removed from bone after hardening of the flowable medium that has been
   extruded from one or more delivery channels (e.g., fenestrations) of the bone screw. Removal of a bone
   screw having a self-cutting edge may occur without significant torque, e.g. less than 2,500 Newton
 0 millimeters (Nmm). A self-cutting edge is active when rotating in the direction where the self-cutting edge
   is the trailing edge and can scrap material into the groove.
             By "treating" or "treatment" is meant the medical management of a patient with the intent that an
   amelioration, repair, or prevention of an injury or disease, pathological condition, or disorder associated
   with a bone defect will result. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically
 5 toward improvement of the injury or disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal
   treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the injury or disease, pathological
   condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for
   the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the injury or disease, pathological condition, or disorder;
   preventive treatment, that is, treatment directed to prevention of the injury or disease, pathological
30 condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another
   specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the injury or disease, pathological condition, or
   disorder.
             "Vertebroplasty" includes its ordinary meaning and means any procedure in which fill material is
   delivered into the interior of a vertebra, e.g., in conjuction with, or using a bone screw of the invention.

   Bone Screws
             In particular, bone screws of the invention allow passage of a flowable medium (e.g., a bone
   cement, such as a resorbable calcium phosphate-based bone cement) through an interior channel of the
   screws (i.e., a cannula) and extrusion of the flowable medium through a plurality of delivery channels (i.e.,
 5 fenestrations) that connect the internal channel to the exterior of the screws. Extrusion of the flowable
   medium to a position around the exterior of bone screws of the invention promotes anchorage of the bone
   screws in bone after implantation of the screws and upon hardening of the flowable medium. The screws
   are designed in particular, for fixation of bone fractures using compression. One advantage of bone
   screws of the invention is that injection of a flowable medium (e.g., a self-hardening calcium phosphate
30 based bone cement) can be achieved using manual pressure (i.e, injection by hand, e.g., using a force of
   < 20 Kgf, such as less than 10 Kgf).
            The bone screws are designed to achieve a substantially uniform rate of flow of the flowable
   medium through substantially all (or at least a plurality of) the delivery channels along the body of the
   screws with the use of manual pressure and to achieve a substantially uniform distribution of the flowable
35 medium around the exterior surface of the bone screw, thereby anchoring it in the bone. A substantially
   uniform flow rate of a flowable medium through the delivery channels of the bone screw is achieved by,
   e.g., varying the number and location of delivery channels along helical exterior grooves (e.g., at least two
   helical grooves). In particular, the bone screw may have fewer delivery channels at the proximal end than
   at the distal end. The helical grooves also aid in the distribution of flowable medium to the exterior of the
40 screw, thereby allowing for the medium to flow both axial and radially along the screw in the groove.
             Bone screws of the invention have more delivery channels along the exterior groove (e.g., helical
   groove) in the distal end relative to the proximal end which provides several advantages with respect to
                                                           9

        WO 2014/149746                                                                   PCT/US2014/020678
   the delivery of a flowable medium through and around the cannulated and fenestrated screws. For
   example, during injection of the flowable material, the material flows from the proximal end of the screw
   towards the distal end. Extrusion of the flowable medium preferentially out of the proximal most delivery
   channels, as opposed to equally through the proximal and distal delivery channels, results in voids of
 5 bone cement around the bone screw. The bone screw of the invention achieves substantially uniform
   distribution of the flowable medium along the entire longitudinal axis by reducing the number of and
   increasing the spacing of the delivery channels at the proximal end of the screw shaft, thereby promoting
   delivery of the flowable material along the the entire length of the screw, including to the distal end of the
   screw. Increasing the number of delivery channels at the distal end, relative to the proximal end of the
 0 bone screw shaft also results in a reduction of the resistance of the flow of a flowable medium along the
   entire length of the bone screws, including the distakl end. The inventive screw solves this problem by
   having a larger number of delivery channels at the distal end, thus reducing the resistance to flow.
             The reduction in flow resistance at the distal end of the screw provides another important benefit;
   the flowable medium can be injected into the screw of the invention using manual pressure. In this
 5 context, manual pressure includes any method of injecting a flowable medium (e.g., an injectable self
   hardening calcium phosphate bone paste) by hand (i.e., without the aid of a mechanical, electrical, or
   motorized pump or hydraulic) into the bone screw of the invention. This improves the ease of use of the
   bone screw and minimizes the risk of any potential over-pressurization of the flowable medium during
   screw installation. The manifold of the invention provides an effective and stable way to provide a
 o flowable medium to the bone screw interior channel. The use of manual pressure is greatly simplified by
   the use of a sheath and sheath adapter, which combine to produce the manifold and create a reliable and
   efficient system for transferring the flowable material into the bone screw.
             The bone screws of the invention also exhibit improved mechanical properties and help avoid a
   loss of mechanical intergrity of the screw, which can result in a number of medical complications. For
 5 example, the length of the bone screw is increased by varying the length of the non-threaded portion of
   the screw. This portion of the screw has fewer delivery channels, which provides additional strength to
   the screw.
             The bone screws of the invention also include two anti-parallel helical grooves that, in
   combination with an asymmetric distribution of delivery channels along the screw body, provide a
30 mechanically strong, highly efficient bone screw for use with flowable medium at manual pressures.
             The bone screws of the invention can be used even with bones of reduced quality (e.g.,
   osteoporotic bone) or in revision surgeries (e.g., they can be used to replaced previously inserted bone
   screws).
             The bone screws of the invention can be used, for example, in osteosynthesis to internally
35 stabilize and/or join bones, e.g., fractured (broken) bones, either in conjunction with other mechanical
   devices, such as metal plates, pins, rods, or wires, or individually. Without limitation, the bone screws of
   the invention can be used as, e.g., small fragment screws, cortex screws, cancellous screws, dynamic hip
   screws, lag screws, non-self-tapping and self-tapping screws, and malleolar screws. The size and
   function of the bone screw of the invention may vary depending on its intended use (e.g., depending on
40 the length necessary to provide fixation in the cortex of a longe bone above and below a fracture). The
   head of the bone screw may be modified in order to operate with any of a number of appropriate drivers
   and drills known in the art (e.g., Robertson driver, a slotted driver, a Phillips driver, a Torx driver, a triple
                                                           10

             Bone screw 100 has non-threaded portion 112 that may have a length in the range of about 16
   mm to 86 mm, e.g., 16 mm, 32mm, 48 mm, 64 mm, 80mm, and 86 mm, or a value in a range spanning
   any of the preceeding values. Non-threaded portion 112 may have about 2 delivery channels for about
   every 21 mm length of helical groove 114, 115.
 5           Delivery channels 120 may have a diameter of about 0.5 to 2 mm, preferably about 1.2 mm. The
   delivery channels are coincident with the anti-parallel substantially helical grooves 114, 115. Delivery
   channel 120 may have a spacing along the helical groove(s) of between 5 to 7 mm within third threaded
   portion 118 and may have a spacing within non-threaded portion 112 of between 18 to 24 mm.
   Preferably, delivery channels 120 in third threaded portion 118 have a separation of about 6 mm along
 0 the helical grooves 114, 115. Preferably, delivery channels 120 in non-threaded portion 112 have a
   separation of about 21 mm along the helical grooves 114, 115.
            The bone screw tip 122 can provide a self-tapping configuration (see Fig. 2C).
             Functional design
 5          The length of a bone screw of the invention may varied by increasing the length of non-threaded
   portion 112 (see Fig. 1), while the lengths of second and third threaded portions, 110 and 118, may
   remain constant (see, Fig. 1).
             Bone screw 100 contains screw head 108 with first threaded portion 104, second threaded
   portion 110, non-threaded portion 112, third threaded portion 118, interior channel 124 and tip 122 (see
 0 Fig. 1). Screw body 102 of bone screw 100 also contains two substantially, anti-parallel helical exterior
   grooves 114 connecting delivery channels 120 to the exterior of the screw body.
            Screw head 108 is circular and includes screw head threads 104 on its exterior (Fig. 1), to which,
   e.g., sheath 200 of a delivery manifold of the invention may be attached. In particular, first attachment
   portion 202 of sheath 200 is sized and shaped to engage screw head threads 104 of bone screw 100 (Fig
 5 6). Screw head 108 additionally contains hexagonal opening 128 internal to screw head 108, viewed in
   Fig. 2B from proximal end 106, in which a rotational driver may be inserted. Opening 128 for coupling a
   driver can have other shapes, such as a hexagonal shape, square shape, pentagonal shape, diamond
   shape, etc., that allow mating of a driver or other instrument to screw head 108. Screw head 108 can
   provide a self-tapping configuration (see Figs. 2A and 2B).
30           For example, screw head 108 may be shaped for engagement with, and driven by, a variety of
   drivers, such as a Robertson driver, a slotted driver, a Phillips driver, a Torx driver, a triple square driver,
   a polydrive driver, a one-way clutch driver, a spline drive driver, a double hex driver, or a Bristol driver.
   Rotational drivers may turn clockwise or counter-clockwise (depending on the thread direction) to tighten
   a bone screw into final or near-final position.
35           Interior channel 124 (Fig. 1) may have a diameter that facilitates the transfer and delivery of a
   flowable medium, such as a bone void filler, cement, or pharmaceutical agent substantially throughout the
   length of a bone screw and through tip 122 when bone screw 100 is fully cannulated.
             First threaded portion 108 allows for the attachment of a manifold or other threaded device to
   proximal end of the bone screw 106 of the bone screw 100 (Fig. 1).        Second threaded portion 110 allows
40 for anchoring of the proximal end bone screw 100 into bone. A portion of at least one exterior groove
   (e.g., exterior helical groove 114, 115) may extend into second threaded portion 110. Also, second
   threaded portion 110 may have one or more delivery channels coincident with the exterior groove(s). In
                                                           13

        WO 2014/149746                                                                  PCT/US2014/020678
   one embodiment, second threaded portion 110 has a length of 8.5 mm, about three thread revolutions
   and at least 1 delivery channels coincident with a first exterior helical groove 114 and at least 1 delivery
   channel coincident with a second helical groove 115.
             Third threaded portion 118 is adjacent to tip 122 at distal end 107 of bone screw 100. Third
 5 threaded portion 118 contains a portion of at least one, and preferably at least two, exterior grooves (e.g,
   at least a portion of substantially anti-parallel exterior grooves 114 and 115). Third threaded portion may
   have one or more delivery channels 120 coincident with the exterior groove(s). Third threaded portion has
   more delivery channels, e.g., a ratio of at least about 1.25:1, than the two more proximal portions: the
   non-threaded and second threaded portions.
 0           The length of bone screw 100 may be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing, e.g.,
   the length of non-threaded portion 112. Non-threaded portion 112 is designed with fewer delivery
   channels relative to the third threaded portion 118 in order to facilitate the flow of a flowable medium to
   the distal end of bone screw 100 and to promote a substantially uniform delivery of the flowable medium
   around the exterior of the bone screw. The ratio of the delivery channels in non-threaded portion 112 to
 5 the third threaded portion 118 depends on the length of both portions. For example, if third threaded
   portion 118 has a length of 32 mm and a spacing of delivery channels about every 6 mm, then the ratio of
   delivery channels in third threaded portion 118 to non-threaded portion 112 ranges from about 6.7:1 to
    1.25:1 for screws up to about 130 mm in length.
             Exterior grooves 114, 115 are substantially helical and anti-parallel. Exterior grooves 114, 115
 0 are coincident with delivery channels 120. Exterior grooves 114, 115 provide a path for a flowable
   medium to move around the exterior of bone screw 100. Exterior grooves 114, 115 may have a periodicity
   of about 50.8 mm. In some embodiments, bone screw 100 may have one 114 or two 114, 115 external
   grooves or more (e.g., more than three external grooves). Also exterior grooves of bone screw 100 may
   be parallel, anti-parallel, semi-parallel, oscialating, or overlapping.
 5           Delivery channels 120 allow for a flowable medium to be distributed to the exterior of bone screw
   100. Delivery channels 120 are coincident with exterior grooves 114, 115. Third threaded region 118 has
   more delivery channels 120 than non-threaded portion 112 and second threaded portion 110. In general,
   the ratio of delivery channels in third threaded portion 118 to non-threaded portion 112 is at least 1.25:1
   (e.g., at least 2:1). In one embodiment, third threaded portion 118 has ten delivery channels (5 in each
30 helical groove in the third threaded portion 118), second threaded portion 110 has 2 delivery channels (1
   in each helical groove), and non-threaded portion 112 has a length of about 86 mm (for a full screw body
   length of 130 mm) and 8 delivery channels (4 delivery channels in each groove). This configuration
   achieves a substantially uniform flow rate of a flowable medium through delivery channels 120. In this
   configuration, the distance 150 from proximal end 106 of bone screw 100 to the first delivery channel in
35 second threaded portion 110 is about 8 mm. The distance from proximal end 106 of bone screw 100 and
   the first delivery channel in non-threaded portion 112 is about 16.5 mm.
             Bone screw tip 122 can provide a self-tapping configuration (see Fig. 2C). A self-tapping
   configuration allows for easier entry into the bone and more efficient installation.
40  Bone Screw Manifolds
             The invention also features a manifold which, in combination with the bone screw, provides
   efficient and effective transfer of a flowable medium into the bone screw. The bone screw manifold of the
                                                            14

        WO 2014/149746                                                                 PCT/US2014/020678
   invention is formed of two parts: a sheath and a sheath adapter. Sheaths of the invention are cylindrical
   bodies with attachment portions on both the distal and proximal ends (i.e., first and second attachment
   portions, respectively). The first attachment portion of the sheath attaches to the bone screw head, while
   the second attachment portion attaches to the sheath adapter. Sheath adapters of the invention are
 5 cylindrical bodies with two attachment portions: a third attachment portion that connects the sheath
   adapter to the sheath and a fourth attachment portion that attaches the sheath adapter to an injection
   device.
            Manifolds of the invention have several advantages. The sheath portion of the manifold provides
   a guiding cylindrical body for accessing the screw head of the bone screw. The sheath can act like a
 0 guidewire during bone repair surgical procedures by assisting the surgeon to locate the screw head (e.g.,
   for contact with a rotational driver or other instrument, as well as with the sheath adapter). The sheath
   also provides a stable anchoring point for the sheath adapter, thereby making the process of injecting the
   flowable medium more efficient. Sheath adapters of the invention provide a reduced manifold volume for
   injection because the internal channel of the sheath adapter can be smaller than a single manifold design
 5 in which the sheath internal diameter is similar to the screw head diameter. Sheath adapters of the
   invention also provide a seal for injecting the flowable medium within the bone screw head, thereby
   isolating the flowable medium from the sheath and preventing the sheath from filling with the flowable
   medium, which can make accessing the screw head more difficult.
 o          Structure
            Referring to Figs. 6 and 7, sheath 200 (Fig. 6) and sheath adapter 300 (Fig. 7) are used in
   combination to form a delivery manifold of the invention, which facilitates introduction of a flowable
   medium into a cannulated and fenestrated bone screw (e.g., a bone screw of the invention, such as bone
   screw 100 of Figs. 1-5). Attachment of sheath 200 to screw head 108 of bone screw 100 provides a
 5 channel for insertion and stabilization of the sheath adapter 300. Sheath 200 has a cylindrical body 204
   and distal end 250 containing first attachment portion 202 for attachment to bone screw 100 (Fig. 6A).
   Sheath 200 has second attachment portion 210 at proximal end 252 of cylindrical body 204 for
   attachment to sheath adapter 300 (Fig. 6A). A series of raised ridges 218 (Fig. 6E) comprising first
   handling portion 254 (Fig. 6A) can be located on the outside of second attachment portion 210 (side view
30 in Fig. 6A, view down longitudinal axis in Fig. 6E).
            Sheath adapter 300 has cylindrical body 344, (Fig. 7B), and tapered portion 304 (Fig. 7A) and
   fluid communication channel 356 (internal channel; Fig. &C), for converying a flowable medium into bone
   screw 100. Tapered portion 304 is adjacent distal end 346. Sheath adapter 300 has third attachment
   portion 326 (Fig. 7B) that is shaped and sized to be reversibly, threadingly engaged with second
35 attachment portion 232 of sheath 200. Second handling portion 352 is adjacent to third attachment
   portion 326 and includes at least 4 raised ridges that facilitate handling and tightening to sheath 200
   during installation of bone screw 100. Adjacent to second handling portion 352 is fourth attachment
   portion 318 (Fig. &A) adjacent to proximal end 348.
            Sheath cylindrical body 204 defines a longitudinal axis and has a length of about 60 mm to 90
40 mm, exterior diameter 208 of at least about 8 mm, and interior channel 256 with a diameter 230 of 5.7
   mm (see, Figs. 6A and 6B).

   about 4 to 7 mm. Internal channel 356 (Fig. 7C) may have a diameter of about 1 mm to 3 mm.
   Cylindrical body 344 may have a length of about 50 mm to 80 mm, or a value in a range spanning any of
   the preceeding values, preferably about 67.1 mm.
            Sheath adapter third attachment portion 326 (Fig. 7B) at proximal end 350 of sheath adapter
 0 cylindrical body, may have a length of about 6 mm to 10 mm and contains exterior threaded portion 354
   with a length of about 4 mm to 7 mm and at least 2 thread revolutions.
            Sheath adapter second handling portion 352 is adjacent to the third attachment portion 326.
   Second handling region 352 has a length of about 10 mm to 15 mm and has at least four (e.g., 4, 5, or 6)
   raised ridges on an exterior portion thereof.
 5          Sheath adapter fourth attachment portion 318 (Fig. 7A) is adjacent to second handling portion
   352 and is located at the proximal end of sheath adapter 300. Fourth attachment portion 318 may have a
   length of about 3 mm to 5 mm and has an exterior threaded portion 328 (Fig. 7B) that may have at least 2
   thread revolutions.
            Sheath adapter tapered portion 304 (Fig. 7A) is located at the end of the distal end of the sheath
30 adapter body. Tapered portion 304 may have a length of about 5 mm to 7 mm and an exterior diameter of
   about 2.5 mm to 7 mm. Tapered portion may have a chamfer at the distal end.
            Functional design
            First attachment portion 202 of sheath 200 is sized and shaped to be threadingly engaged to
35 bone screw 100 (see Fig. 6). Sheath 200 provides a conduit for, and stabilizes, sheath adapter 300 and
   provides a stable manifold for sealing tapered portion 304 of sheath adapter 300 with interior channel 124
   of bone screw 100.
            Second attachment portion 210 of sheath 200 is located at proximal end 252 and provides a
   threaded region 234 (Fig. 6B) for threadingly engaging with third attachment portion 326 of the sheath
40 adapter 300, thereby reversibly lockingly coupling sheath 200 to sheath adapter 300 (see Figs. 6-7).
   Once the sheath adapter has been secured to the sheath, the tapered portion of the sheath adapter is
   sealed into the interior channel of bone screw 100.

             First handling portion 254 has a plurality of raises ridges 218 (Fig. 6E) that are substantially
   parallel to cylindrical body 204 of sheath 200. First handling portion 250 facilitates the attachment of the
   sheath 200 onto bone screw head 108 by making cylindrical body 204 easier to grip and turn.
              Cylindrical body 302 has distal 346 and proximal 348 ends: distal end 346 has tapered end 304
 5 that seals into bone screw interior channel 124 when sheath 200 and sheath adapter 300 are engaged,
   which allows for transfer of a flowable medium from an injection device into bone screw 100.
            Third attachment portion 326 of sheath adapter 300 is at proximal end 350 of the sheath adapter
   cylindrical body. The third attachment portion threadingly engages the second attachment portion 210 of
   the sheath 200 to form a reversible union between the sheath and the sheath adapter.
 0          Second handling portion 352 of sheath adapter 300 assists in the coupling of third attachment
   portion 326 to second attachment portion 210, thus easing the joining the sheath and sheath adapter by
   hand. Second handling portion allows for easy installantion or removal of the sheath adapter, thereby
   improving the efficiency of bone defect repair.

 0 portion 304 may have a tapered diameter and a chamfered end to allow the joining and sealing of sheath
   adapter 300 into screw head 108 producing a continuous interior channel by the combination of interior
   channels of the bone screw 124 and internal channel 356 of sheath adapter 300.
   Bone Screw Washers
 5          The invention also includes a washer for use with the bone screw of the invention. The
   combination of a mechanically strong fenestrated screw with a washer allows for compression
   applications in the treatment and repair of a large range of bone defects and fractures, e.g., fractures that
   require compression. The bone screw washers have a proximal end with a circumferential lip, a
   cylindrical body, and a distal end with a diameter restriction.

             Structure
             Referring to Fig. 8, bone screw washer 400 has cylindrical body 430 that defines a longitudinal
   axis or shaft having outer diameter 418 of about 7 to 12 mm (Fig. 8c), a length of about 5 to 8 mm and
   internal diameter 404 of about 7 to 10.5 mm. Washer 400 has proximal end 422 and distal end 424 (Fig.
35 8C). Distal end 424 has radial constriction 406 that facilitates engagement of washer 400 with bone screw
   100. Radial constriction 406 has an internal diameter of about 6 to 9 mm. Washer 400 has
   circumferential lip 412 that engages the exterior surface of bone when used with a bone screw, e.g., bone
   screw 100 (see Figs. 8A, 8C). Circumferential lip 412 extends radially outward from body 430 (Fig. 8C) to
   engage a bone surface and to facilitate compression when used in fracture fixation. Circumferential lip
40 412 has a diameter of about 10 to 15 mm and a thickness of about 1 to 2 mm. Proximal end 422 of
   washer 400 is sized and shaped to allow for insertion of, and engagement with, a bone screw (e.g., bone
   screw 100 of Figs. 1-5). Opening 402 of washer 400 has a diameter of about 7.5 to 12 mm. Bone screw
                                                            17

        WO 2014/149746                                                                   PCT/US2014/020678
   washer 400 may have fenestrations (e.g. on the circumferential lip 412) that facilitate suture attachment
   for securing ligaments and tendons.
             Functional design
 5           Bone screw washer 400 (Fig. 8) is sized and shaped to accept bone screw head 108 of bone
   screw 100 by passing the distal end 107 of bone screw 100 through proximal end 422 and into shaft 404.
   Bone screw 100 is conveyed through washer 400 until screw head 108 engages distal constriction 406 of
   bone screw washer 400 (see Figs. 16 and 17, showing assembly of bone screw and washer). Bone
   screw washer 400 contains proximal opening 402 that allows screw head 108 to fit inside washer 400,
 0 such that screw head 108 does not extend substantially above the surface of proximal opening 402 when
   used in compression fixation (see Fig. 16). During injection of a flowable medium into bone screw 100,
   e.g., using a manifold of the invention, washer 400 can be moved towards the distal end of bone screw
   100 to provide access to the threads of first attachment portion 108 by sheath 200 (see Fig. 17).
 5 Methods of Treatment Using a Bone Screw of the Invention
             The bone screws of the invention may be used to treat a bone defect in a patient in need thereof.
   In particular, the bone screws of the invention, when used with a bone screw washer, such as the washer
   of the invention, can be used to provide compressive fixation in a patient with a fracture requiring
   compression.
 o           Particular bone defects that may be treated using the bone screws of the invention include, e.g.,
   any bone deficient region, such as a void, gap, recess, or other discontinuity in a bone. The bone defect
   may be due to, for example, disease or trauma. The bone screws of the invention can be applied, for
   example, in the repair of periodontal defects, in craniofacial or maxillofacial surgery or reconstruction, in
   hand surgery, in joint reconstruction, in fracture repair, in orthopedic surgical procedures, and in spinal
 5 fusion. The bone screws of the invention may also be used, for example, in osteosynthesis to internally
   stabilize and/or join bones, e.g., fractured (broken) bones, either in conjunction with other mechanical
   devices, such as washers (e.g., a washer of the invention), metal plates, pins, rods, or wires, or
   individually. For example, the bone screws of the invention can be used with a bone screw washer (e.g.,
   a washer of the invention) to provide compressive fixation of bone defects and bone fractures. In
30 particular, the bone screws are useful for the treatment of defects or breaks in large bones. Non-limiting
   examples of bone fractures include, e.g., stable fractures, transverse fractures, oblique fractures, spiral
   fractures, comminuted fractures and open and displaced fractures. Exemplary large bones that may
   require fracture fixation include, e.g., the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, ulna, radius, 7th and 8th ribs,
   innominate bone (hip bone) and sternum.
35           The method of treating a patient having a bone defect (e.g., subarticular fracture, a defect of the
   spine or vertebra, or a defect of the radius, ulna, fibula, clavicle, humerus, pelvis, femur, patella, tibia,
   talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuneiforms, metatarsals, metacarpals, phalanges, scapula, ankle, teeth, or
   mandible) includes the following: a) positioning the bone screw of the invention in proximity to the bone
   defect (e.g., positioning the bone screw so that it contacts the intraosseous space of a bone, and/or, in
40 the treatment of a fracture, spans the fracture line); b) introducing a flowable medium (e.g., a bone void
   filler material, a cement, or a pharmaceutical agent, such as by use of a manifold of the invention (see
   below)) into the interior channel of the bone screw; c) allowing the flowable medium to be extruded
                                                            18

       WO 2014/149746                                                                    PCT/US2014/020678
   through the delivery channels (e.g., the flowable medium is extruded through substantially all or a plurality
   of the delivery channels, e.g., in substantially equal volumes), and d) allowing the flowable medium to
   harden, thereby fixing the bone screw in place. The bone screw of the invention may be used, e.g., for
   maxillomandibular or craniofacial fixation, temporary fixation for repairing a bone defect in a staged
<5 reconstruction, glenoid or humeral fixation, patellar fixation, or spine fixation.
             For vertebral fixation, the bone screw may be placed within a pedicle, used to anchor an
   interbody device, used to anchor spinal fusion plates and spacer replacement, used in an osteoporotic
   vertebra, or positioned in proximity to the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae.
            The method of treatment using a bone screw of the invention may also include the insertion of a
 0 rod, pin, nail, or bone plate in proximity to the bone defect. One or more of these devices may be used in
   conjunction with the bone screw or separate from the bone screw.
            When the method is performed to provide compressive fixation, the method may include, prior to
   step a), i) positioning a washer (e.g., a washer of the invention) over the proximal end of the bone screw
   (near the screw head), ii) inserting the distal end of the bone screw into the bone so that it passes through
 5 the fracture line, and iii) tightening the bone screw such that the distal threads of the bone screw provide
   compressive force that pulls the bone screw head (and the washer) against the surface of the patient's
   bone (e.g., contact of the circumferential lip of the washer (see, e.g., Fig. 8) to the surface of the patient's
   bone holds the proximal end of the bone screw in place).
            When the method is performed using a manifold of the invention, the method may, prior to step b)
 0 above, further include i) fluidically coupling the screw head to the sheath portion of a delivery manifold of
   the invention, ii) fluidically coupling an injection device, such as a syringe, that includes a flowable
   medium (e.g., a bone cement, such as a self-setting, injectable calcium phosphate-based bone cement
   (e.g., BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN           TM)) to the sheath adapter portion of a delivery manifold of the
   invention, iii) inserting the sheath adapter into the sheath, iv) threading the third attachment portion of the
 5 sheath adapter to the second attachment portion of the sheath to form a fluid tight seal, and v) injecting
   the flowable medium into the interior channel of the bone screw using, e.g., manual pressure, which
   results in extrusion of the bone cement through delivery channels in the bone screw. The flowable
   medium flows substantially evenly around the bone screw exterior (along the exterior grooves (e.g.,
   helical grooves)) and into the bone defect. The flowable medium subsequently hardens to provide
30 substantially fixation of the bone screw and the patient's bone. The manifold is removed from the bone
   screw and the surgical site is closed.
            The method may also, optionally, include, prior to step d) above, i) inserting a rotational driver into
   the screw head (e.g., through the sheath of the manifold after removal of the sheath adapter); ii) engaging
   the screw head with the rotational driver; and iii) tightening the bone screw into final position by rotating
35 the rotational driver.
            Kits
            The invention also features a kit that includes one or more of i) a bone screw of the invention, iii)
   a manifold of the invention (e.g., the sheath and sheath adapter portions), and iii) a washer of the
40 invention. The kit may, optionally, include one or more of an injection device (e.g., a syringe), a powder
   of a flowable medium (e.g., a self-hardening bone cement powder), and a physiologically acceptable fluid
   for hydrating the bone cement powder. The flowable medium may be provided in the form of a powder
                                                            19

        WO 2014/149746                                                                  PCT/US2014/020678
   that may be hydrated with a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid (e.g., water, serum, or saline) prior to use,
   or in a ready to use form (e.g., a paste, putty, or slurry). The kit may further include instructions for use of
   the bone screw, manifold, and/or washer to treat a bone defect (e.g., subarticular fracture, a defect of the
   spine or vetebra, or a defect of the radius, ulna, fibula, clavicle, humerus, pelvis, femur, patella, tibia,
 5 talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuneiforms, metatarsals, metacarpals, phalanges, scapula, ankle, teeth, or
   mandible).
   Operation
             The operation of bone screw 100 in combination with sheath 200 and sheath adapter 300
 0 portions of the bone screw manifold allows for several advantages. Bone screw 100 provides an even
   distribution of bone cement throughout the delivery channels and along screw body 102 upon injection of
   bone cement into bone screw 100. Use of the manifold of the invention with the bone screw of the
   invention allows for the reliable injection of a flowable medium into bone screw 100 with manual pressure.
   Once the flowable medium has hardened, a self-cutting edge that is present along the edge of one or
 5 more of the exterior groove(s) (i.e., the edge is not radiused), as well as a self-cutting edge in the threads
   of the first attachment portion 110, facilitates removal of bone screw 100 without substantial damage to
   the newly hardened material or the bone screw itself.
             In one exemplary method, bone screw 100 is provided in proximity of the bone defect. Self
   tapping tip configuration 132 facilitates installation of bone screw 100 into the bone defect, e.g., with a
 o pilot hole or with a hole smaller than the diameter of bone screw 100. A rotational driver can be used to
   move a bone screw into final or near-final position. The rotational driver can be disconnected and sheath
   200 then attached to screw head 108 by turning first handling portion 210 manually. Sheath adapter 300
   is then inserted into sheath 200 and manually tightened into place by engaging second attachment
   portion 210 of sheath 200 to third attachment portion 326 of sheath adapter 300. An injection device,
 5 such as a syringe, filled with a flowable medium may be attached to fourth attachment portion 318 and
   the injection device manually tightened into place (attachment of the injection device may also precede
   insertion of sheath adapter 300 into sheath 200). The stable assembly (see Figs. 12-15 for examples of
   assembly of bone screw 100, sheath 200, and sheath adapter 300) of bone screw 100, sheath 200,
   sheath adapter 300, and an injection device facilitates injection of a flowable medium, such as a bone
30 cement, into, through, and to the exterior of, the bone screw body 102, thereby repairing the bone defect
   or fracture. After injection, the injection device, sheath adapter and sheath may be disassembled to
   provide access to screw head 108 for further adjustment. Alternatively, the injection device and sheath
   adapter 300 may be disassembled and a rotational driver inserted into screw head 108 through sheath
   200. If necessary, after the flowable medium has been allowed to harden, bone screw 100 can be
35 removed, aided by a self-cutting edge of helical groove(s) 114, 115 and the self-cutting edge of the
   threads of first attachment portion 110.
             In another exemplary method, bone screw 100 is provided in proximity to a bone defect. Prior to
   insertion into the bone, bone screw 100 is inserted through internal diameter 404 of bone screw washer
   400. Bone screw washer 400 engages screw head 108. Self-tapping tip configuration 132 facilitates
40 entrance of bone screw 100 into the bone defect. Threads of third threaded portion 118 and washer lip
   412 provide oppositional forces as the screw is tightened in place, thereby compressing the bone defect
   or fracture together. A rotational driver can be used to move the bone screw into final or near-final
                                                           20

        WO 2014/149746                                                                    PCT/US2014/020678
   position and achieve optimal compression of the bone defect. The injection of a flowable medium and
   disassembly of the bone screw 100, sheath 200, sheath adapter 300, and injection device can occur as
   described above.
             The bone screws of the present invention provide numerous advantages over other bone screws
 5 known in the art. For example, in some embodiments of the bone screws of the present invention, the
   diameter of the interior channel is smaller than in cannulated bone screws in the art, resulting in improved
   strength and the option of reduced overall screw size. In addition, by having a smaller interior channel
   diameter, bone screws of the present invention are optimized for use with state-of-the-art bone cements,
   e.g., fourth-generation self-hardening calcium phosphate-based bone cements, which have reduced
 0 viscosity, and thus require application of less pressure than older bone cements. In additional
   embodiments, the threaded screw head allows for airtight attachment of a removable delivery manifold,
   e.g., a plastic manifold, which, in turn, facilitates loading of flowable medium by allowing a surgeon or
   other user to apply manual pressure rather than hydraulic pressure. This reduces the likelihood of
   unwanted introduction of air embolisms into the bone cavity or other surgical site. In addition, unlike prior
 5 art screws that require connection of a delivery manifold inside the rotational driver, producing very small
   orifices and correspondingly high operating pressure, bone screws of the present invention have no
   restriction in the flow path of the flowable medium, reducing the necessary operating pressure.
             It is also significantly easier to remove, or to adjust the position of, a bone screw of the present
   invention that has been placed in a surgical site, in comparison to bone screws of the prior art. Because
 0 the rotational driver is inserted inside the screw head, it is not necessary to grasp the external surface of
   the screw head in order to remove an implanted screw prior to hardening of the cement.
             Upon hardening of the cement around a bone screw of the present invention, the bone screw is
   more stable and secure than a conventional screw because of the even distribution of cement that covers
   a large percentage of the surface area of the screw body and contacted bone. This increased stability
 5 reduces the likelihood of "backout" of a screw from the surgical site, which may occur with a conventional
   screw.
             In additional embodiments, the presence of exterior grooves facilitates equalized distribution of
   flowable medium along the exterior surface of the screw. For example, if one exterior opening is blocked,
   flowable medium from an adjacent exterior opening may flow along an exterior groove to "back-fill" or
30 compensate for the blocked opening. The presence of exterior grooves, in particular, straight exterior
   grooves, can also increase the strength characteristics of the screw body.
             In additional embodiments, use of an adjustable interior plug allows for selective delivery of
   flowable medium to desired delivery channels while blocking off other delivery channels. Such a plug
   may be designed to be pushed in or screwed in and may be either permanent or removable. In addition,
35 in some embodiments, the tip or distal end of the screw body, i.e., the end of the screw body distal to the
   screw head, may be manufactured to be open or closed; in open embodiments, a removable tip plug may
   be added as needed according to the surgical indication. The inclusion of such adjustable plugs
   significantly increases the flexibility of use of bone screws of the present invention.
40 Examples
             The following examples are to illustrate the invention. They are not meant to limit the invention in
   any way.
                                                             21

   Example 1: Use of a bone screw of the invention to repair a fracture or other bone defect.
             A bone screw of the invention (e.g., a bone screw of Figs. 1-5) can be used to provide fracture
   support, e.g., for a subarticular fracture, in conjunction with conventional fixation. The site to be
   supported can be accessed using either a percutaneous or open technique. The extraction technique
 5 preferably ensures maximal bone conservation.
   Example 2: Use of a bone screw of the invention for compression fixation.
             A bone screw of the invention can be used for compression fixation in combination with a washer
   of the invention to repair a hip fracture. The fractured bone is aligned and held in the proper position by
 0 traction.
             A bone screw of the invention is inserted into a washer of the invention. The surgical site is
   prepared (e.g., by reaming or drilling) to accept the bone screw and body of the washer. The bone screw
   tip is inserted into the bone such that the threaded portion at the distal end of the body of the bone screw
   passes beyond the fracture line and into the femoral head. Tightening of the bone screw forces the
 5 circumferential lip of the washer against the exterior surface of the bone, which compresses the bone
   above and below the fracture line, thereby providing compression fixation. A bone cement is injected into
   the head of the bone screw (e.g., using a manifold of the invention), and hardening of the bone cement
   fixes the bone screw in place.
 o           Example 3: Use of a bone screw of the invention to repair a fracture or other bone defect
   with manual pressure.
                      A bone model system was used to experimentally determine the forces required to inject
   a flowable material into a bone screw of the inventive method.
             The clinical objective of bone screws of the invention is to provide secure fixation across a
 5 fracture and to enable delivery of a Bone Void Filler (BVF) to the surrounding defect area. It is standard of
   care to reduce fractures with 4 mm diameter fixation screws. These screws are often used together with
   BVF material injected around the screw into the fracture site to fill voids.
             We created bone void models (BVM) to simulate a 4.5 milliliter (mL) defect. We used a closed
   cell 12.5 PCF bone foam to represent typical metaphyseal cancellous bone. Foam blocks were split in
30 half and a hole drilled into each side to form a 4.5 mL hollow cavity when assembled together (Fig. 9).
             The distal end of the bone screw is typically embedded into the distal fragment by approximately
   10 mm. Screws are placed through the center of the void such that the distal end of the screw was
   located approximately 10 mm past the void. Four smaller (1.5 mL) bone void models were constructed
   similarly to the 4.5 mL models. BVF was also tested in these models to verify the ability to fill smaller
35 voids through the screw even if fewer holes are exposed to the void.
             Static extraction torque testing was performed to demonstrate the bone screw can be removed
   without damaging the screw or the surrounding BVF. Testing was also performed using CARRIGENTM to
   evaluate static extraction torque with this BVF.
40           Delivery of BVF through 11 gauge Cannula
             A test set up was constructed as shown in Figs. 9 and 10 consisting of a 50 mm length by 4 mm
   diameter fixation screw, an injection needle, foam test block construct, insertion syringe, and BVF. This

       WO 2014/149746                                                               PCT/US2014/020678
   test set up simulated the current standard of care method for delivery of BVF during a bone void filling
   procedure. Test blocks were constructed from foam mimicking cancellous bone (PCF 12.5 polyurethane).
   A 44 mm x 64 mm x 41 mm block was split in half and a 16mm diameter hole drilled into each side to total
   depth of 22 mm to form a 4.5 mL hollow cavity when assembled together. The two halves of the model
 5 were clamped together using 2" sheetrock screws, external to the void. The fixation screw was inserted
   through the center of the defect to a depth of approximately 10 mm fixation in the distal block.
            The injection needle was then inserted into the specimen adjacent to the screw into the void. The
   BVF was prepared according to the manufacturer's Instructions for Use. The BVF was loaded into the
   syringes. To simulate worst case handling of the materials, each was left at room temperature in a mixed
 0 condition for the maximum allowed per the manufacturer's Instructions for Use (BETA-BSMTM        -2
   minutes; CARRIGEN        - 15 minutes). Each was then attached to the luer lock of the needle and injected
   under finger pressure into the needle/test block assembly. Injection pressure was measured according to
   the protocol according to Example 4. The stylet was inserted into the needle to expel residual BVF within
   the needle. The test samples were then placed in a 372 C incubator for two hours to allow the BVF to
 5 harden. Mass of the specimen was measured before and after BVF injection to determine amount of fill of
   the BVF into the specimen. The specimens were imaged using C-arm fluoroscopy.
            The static torque extraction tests were performed by hand using calibrated torque wrench. The
   peak torque required to loosen each screw from the foam test blocks was recorded. The specimens were
   then sectioned to assess the fill of the void and any damage to the BVF after screw removal.

   Delivery of BVF through the Bone Screw
            A test set up was constructed as shown in Figs. 9 and 10 consisting of a 50 mm length N-force by
   4mm diameter fixation screw, screw sheath, foam test block construct, insertion syringe, and BVF. This
 5 test set up simulated delivery of BVF during a bone void filling procedure through the bone screw. Test
   blocks were constructed from foam mimicking cancellous bone (PCF12.5 polyurethane). A 44 mm x 64
   mm x 41 mm block was split in half and a 16 mm hole drilled into each side for a total depth of 22 mm to
   form a 4.5 mL hollow cavity when assembled together. The halves of the model were clamped together
   using 2" sheetrock screws, external to the void. The fixation screw was inserted through the center of the
30 defect to a depth of approximately 10mm fixation in the distal block. The BVF was prepared according to
   the manufacturer's Instructions for Use. The BVF was loaded into the syringes. To simulate worst case
   handling of the materials, each was left at room temperature in a mixed condition for the maximum
   allowed per the manufacturer's Instructions for Use (BETA-BSMTM - 2 minutes; CARRIGENTM -15
   minutes). Each was then attached to the luer lock of the sheath and injected under finger pressure into
35 the screw/test block assembly. Delivery pressure was measured per the protocol described in Example
   4. The hex driver was inserted through the sheath into the screw to expel residual BVF within the sheath.
   The test samples were then placed in a 372 C incubator for two hours to allow the BVF to harden.
            Mass of the specimen was measured before and after BVF injection to determine amount of fill of
   the BVF into the specimen. The specimens were imaged using C-arm fluoroscopy. The static torque
40 extraction tests were performed by hand using calibrated torque wrench. The peak torque required to

   assess the fill of the void and any damage to the BVF after screw removal. The results are shown in
   Table 1 below.
            Delivery force measurement procedure
 5          The force required to deliver BVF throughout the length of a bone screw of the invention was
   compared to a simple cannula. Twelve kits containing the respective bone void fillers BETA-BSMTM and
   CARRIGENTM were used to conduct the experiments. The simple cannula used was a 63.5 mm x 11
   Gauge cannulae (Hamilton Corp, Part #: 7750-02).
            The bone screws had were 4mm (internal diameter) x 50mm in length. The bone void models
 0 (BVM) were used as described in Example 3. Four smaller 1.5 mL simulated bone void models were
   constructed similarly to the 4.5 mL models but the 16 mm holes were drilled to a depth of 3.75 mm.
            The bone void fillers, BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN TM, were prepared using commercial kit
   components per the mixing instructions from the manufacturers. BETA-BSMTM was left in the 10 mL
   mixing/delivery syringe which is supplied with the kit. The resulting material from each CARRIGEN           kit
 5 was transferred into five 1 mL syringes. The filled syringes were attached to bone screws or cannulae
   which had been placed in the bone models as shown in Fig. 9 and 10. Injectability testing was performed
   by placing the syringe with the BVM attached into a support frame. The syringe plunger was moved
   using the measurement end of a force measuring device. The Average and maximum injection force was
   measured using a uniaxial load frame. Delivered mass was measured by weighing the bone model
 0 before and after delivery. Delivered volume was calculated by dividing the delivered mass by the
   appropriate material density (I .8g/mL for CARRIGEN     TM, 1.6g/mL for BETA-BSMTM). For each product
   (BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN TM) five of the kits were delivered through a cannula and five delivered
   through a bone screw. Statistical analysis was performed on the resulting data using STATGRAPHICS
   Plus 4.1 for Windows. An additional 2 kits of each product were delivered through bone screws into the
 5 small defect models to verify the defect size did not impact the results .
   Results
            Acceptance criteria for delivery pressure (digital pressure) was set at 10 kgf based on previous
   design criteria for BETA-BSM TM and product release. Delivery force values for all samples were well
30 below this limit as seen in the Table 1. All samples exhibited 100% injection and were delivered into the
   void by digital pressure (<1 0 Kgf) through both the 11 gauge cannula and the bone screws.
            The bone fillers, BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN TM, both filled the 4.5 mL BVM regardless of
   whether delivered through an 11 gauge Cannula or the bone screw. Table 1 shows that both delivery
   methods delivered at least 4.5 mL of BVF to the bone void model. All samples exhibited delivered
35 volumes greater than 4.5 mL, the volume of the defect. In addition to the void fill measurement, visual
   inspection was made of the samples through fluoroscopy images and digital images after sectioning. The
   fluoroscopy images, in Fig. 11, showed that BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN               achieved proper fill of the
   4.5 mL defect regardless of delivery through an 11 gauge cannula or through the bone screw. Visual
                                                                                                                   TM
   inspection of the sectioned samples also showed the voids were filled with BETA-BSMTM or CARRIGEN
40 regardless of delivery through an 11 gauge cannula or the bone screw.
            Screw removal testing (Table 1) showed that the bone screws could be removed from hardened
   BETA-BSMTM and hardened CARRIGENTM at clinically acceptable torques (mean peak removal torque)

   regardless of delivery through an 11 gauge cannula or the bone screw. All of the removal torques were
   well below the mean torque to failure (screw fracture) of the screw of 2,960±27 Nmm. Visual inspection
   showed that screw removal did no damage to the hardened BVF. The thread forms were still visible after
   screw removal.
 5           Results from sampling (n=2) small void models (1.5 mL) showed that both BVF's were able to fill
   a small void through the N-Force screws even with fewer fenestrations contacting the void. Also, delivery
   pressures and screw removal torques were well within limits described in Table 1.
            No difference was seen in the performance of BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN                  BVF's delivered
   via the bone screws with respect to their ability deliver with digital pressure and to fill a bone void relative
 0 to delivery through an 11 gauge cannula. Screws of this invention could be removed from defects filled
   with hardened BETA-BSMTM and CARRIGEN               BVF without damaging the screws or BVF.

            Mechanical Testing Methodology
             Bone screws of the invention were tested to confirm the retention of mechanical properties after
   being fenestrated. Five screws with the dimensions 7 mm x 130 mm were tested in accordance with
20 ASTM method ASTM F1264-03(2012). Specifically, the static 4-point bend tests were completed as
   outlined in ASTM F1 264-03(2012). They were performed in stroke control at a rate of 6 mm per minute
   starting at zero load and continuing until failure. Force vs. displacement data were recorded throughout
   test duration. The support span was 114 mm, the span between loading points was 38 mm, the load to
   support span was 38 mm, and the roller diameter was 12.6 mm.

             Results
            The results show that the bone screws exhibit a mean bending stiffness of 172 N/mm, a mean
   bending yield force of 886 N, a mean bending yield moment of 16.8 Nm, a mean bending structural
   stiffness of 3.93 Nm2, a mean bending ultimate force of 1,173 N and a mean bending ultimate moment of
