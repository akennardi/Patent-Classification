Technical Field
      The present invention relates to the field of ancient bone resourceprotection,
   inparticular, to an ancient bone resource protective agent.
Background
      China has a long history of more than 5000 years. The ancient relic is one of the
most important Chinese cultural resources left for future generations and is also
precious national wealth. The cultural value and the consequent call to national
consciousness are much higher than that the value of material wealth. The ancient
bone resource unearthed in ruins and relics is an important cultural heritage reflecting
the origin and development of the Chinese nation. It is a precious material evidence of
the history of civilization and cultural development of the Chinese nation. It is also an
important carrier of Chinese history for thousands of years. As the "treasure" of
Chinese historical and cultural heritage, the ancient bone resource is unique,
irreplaceable and non-renewable with urgent need for proper preservation.
      At present, there are various protective agents used in ancient bone resource,
which are mostly resin protective agents including natural resins and varnish, acrylic
colloidal dispersions, acrylic emulsion products, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral,
acrylic   resins,   and   Sanjia  Resin   (copolymers    of methyl    methacrylate-butyl
methacrylate-methacrylic     acid), as well as polyethyleneglycol      (PEG) protective
agents. However, they have disadvantages such as poor reversibility and toxicity.
      Natural resins and nitrocellulose nitrocellulose varnish have poor reinforcement,
with certain color themselves, which are not conducive to protection and viewing of
the bone and have not been put into use; acrylic colloidal dispersions have not been
produced in domestic, and the usage is small; the acrylic emulsion products have poor
reversibility, and again are infrequently used; and polyvinyl acetate does not only have
                                                1

poor reversibility, its anti-aging effect cannot meet the needs of people; polyvinyl
butyral has better reversibility than above two materials, however, it has poor anti
aging effect, and the aging is irreversible, which causes damages to the bones; acrylic
resin will affect the value of 61 5N and6 3 C, and is not conducive to the identifying the
age of the bones, which is only used after sampling; Sanjia Resin is the mostly widely
used protective agent, which will not affect the identification of the sample, however,
it also has poor reversibility, in addition, due to the use of toluene, chloroform and
other toxic organic reagents to dissolve, it poses a certain threat to the health of
operators and visitors, and to cause damage to the environment as well. Other than
resinous materials, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is also used for the protection of ancient
bone resource, but it is easy to adhere to dust in high humidity environment and is not
put into use at present.
      Poor reversibility refers to that after resin protective agent is applied to the
ancient bone by spraying or dripping, the curing effect of resin protective agent can
strengthen the ancient bone, but at the same time will cause caking between ancient
bones and between ancient bone and soil, which make it difficult to remove the resin
protective agent and unable to return the ancient bones to its original bone state. By
using resin as the protective measure, the disadvantage of poor reversibility of the
resin protective agent limits the re-acquisition and subsequent study of ancient bone
samples.
      Toxicity is the result of the use of toluene or chloroform as a solvent for the resin
protective agent. For the operator's body: mild contact with chloroform will cause
conjunctival hyperemia, skin edema, and long-term exposure can lead to fetal toxicity,
teratogenicity, liver necrosis or liver cancer and many other diseases. Therefore, the
resin protective agent is highly toxic to the operator. As for the archeological sites of
Lajia Site in Minhe County, Qinghai, Liuwan Cemetery in Ledu, Qinghai, and Hamin
Mangha Site in Neimenggu with a high degree of attention and long-term external
display, the resin protective effect is also harmful to the body of the visitor: resin
                                                 2

   solvents chloroform and toluene can enter the body of the visitor by inhalation or
   transdermal absorption, which will stimulate the mucous membrane and
   anesthetize the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as dizziness,
   headache, vomiting, weakness of limbs, confusion and the like.
 5        The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like
   is included in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for
   the present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these
   matters formed part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in

                                               5

      The ancient bone resource protective agent provided herein comprises the
following components: 10-25 parts of adhesive, 10-25 parts of propylene glycol, 0.0 1
0.3 parts of an antioxidant enzyme mimic, 0.01-0.05 parts of a plant extracted
antioxidant, 0.00 1-0.003 parts of a preservative, 0.1-0.3 parts of a lysozyme and water
as the remainder for 100 parts by weight of the protective agent.
      As to the ancient bone resource protective agent provided by the invention, the
adhesive comprises any one of the water-soluble protein and the water-soluble starch.
Any one of the water-soluble protein and the water-soluble starch can be used as the
substrate material with propylene glycol by mixing together to form the substrate
component for the ancient bone resource protective agent, wherein those two substrate
materials have low toxicity, good water-solubility, and also certain adhesive effect,
which can form a film after spraying onto the surface of the ancient bones so as to
achieve the reversibility and prevention by the agent. By adding the no-toxic or less
toxic antioxidant component, the antioxidant enzyme mimic and plant extracted
antioxidant, the ancient bone resource protective agent is conferred with antioxidant
ability, which will decrease the oxidative damage by the oxygen molecules in the air
through excavation, transportation, display. By adding specific amount of preservative
component (lysozyme and preservative), the ancient bone resource protective agent is
endowed with antiseptic ability so as to decrease the erosion of ancient bone resource
by environmental microbes in excavation, transport and display environments. The
obtained ancient bone resource protective agent has an rj of 5-300 mPa.s (measured by
rotary viscometer NDJ-1), and it has good reversibility, as well as protective,
antioxidant, and antibacterial effects.
      Preferably, the ancient bone resource protective agent provided by the present
invention comprises the following components: 12-22 parts of adhesive, 12-23 parts of
propylene glycol, 0.02-0.25 parts of antioxidant enzyme mimic, 0.02-0.05 parts of
antioxidant, 0.0015-0.0025 parts of preservative, 0.15-0.28 parts of lysozyme and
                                               6

water as the remainder for 100 parts by weight of the protective agent.
      Through multiple validations by experiments, any one of the water-soluble
protein and the water-soluble starch can be used as the substrate material with
propylene glycol by mixing together to form the substrate component for the ancient
bone resource protective agent, wherein those two substrate materials have low
toxicity, good water-solubility, which can form a film after spraying onto the surface
of the ancient bones so as to achieve the prevention by the agent. The good water
solubility of the two substrate materials also allows the protection film to be washed
conveniently by water so that to return the ancient bone resource to the original bone
state, which achieves the reversibility of the ancient bone resource protective agent.
      During the excavation, transportation, display of the ancient bone resource, the
oxidation will cause great damage to it. In order to avoid the destruction of ancient
bone resource caused by oxidation, after several tests, we added the ancient bone
resource protective agent with non-toxic or less toxic anti-oxidant, anti-oxidative
enzyme mimics and plant extract antioxidant, which endows the ancient bone resource
protective agent with antioxidant ability and significantly decreases the oxidative
damage during the excavation, transportation, display of the ancient bone resource.
The antioxidant enzyme mimic is selected from any one or more of selenium
containing cyclodextrin and selenium-containing peptide. Selenium is an essential
trace element of the human body and has long been regarded as an important
antioxidant. At the same time, selenium is a component of an important antioxidant
enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which can ensure the glutathione peroxidase to clear
the reactive oxygen species so as to achieve the anti-oxidative effect thereof and
effectively prevent the biomolecules from oxidation reaction. Selenium-containing
cyclodextrins are polysaccharide molecules containing selenium, and after oral
administration, LD50 in mice = 3.6g / kg (low toxicity). Selenium-containing peptides
are selenium-containing polypeptide molecules, and after oral administration, LD50 in
mice = 2.8-4.lg     / kg (low toxicity). Molecules such as selenium-containing
                                                7

cyclodextrins and selenium-containing peptides have glutathione peroxidase activity
(known as antioxidant enzyme mimics), and they do not only have antioxidant activity,
but also better stability than natural enzymes, which are more applicable to the ancient
bone resource protective agent. The plant extract antioxidant is selected from any one
or more of tea polyphenol and rosemary extract. The tea polyphenol is the main active
substance in tea and a non-toxic natural antioxidant with strong anti-oxidative activity.
As early as 1995, China National Light Industry Council approved it as an antioxidant
in food industry, and now it is also a food additive approved by Ministry of Health. It
is widely used in food preservation. Rosemary extract is a natural anti-oxidant with the
function of protecting biomolecules against oxidation. The anti-oxidant components of
the extract are mainly rosmanol, rosmarinic acid, ursolic acid and carnosol. Rosemary
extract has been widely used in air cleaners, perfumes, soaps, lotions and can also be
used in beverages, skin care oils, hair growth agents. The use of the above antioxidant
components in the ancient bone resource protective agent will not only protect the
ancient bone resource from oxidative damage but also ensure the safety of the
operator.
      Further, the selenium-containing peptide is any one or more of Arg-Gly-Sec-Arg
Asn and Sec-Arg-Gly-Asp, and Sec is selenocysteine in the selenium-containing
peptide. Preferably, the selenium-containing peptide is Arg-Gly-Sec-Arg-Asn, and the
selenium-containing peptide takes 0.025-0.045 part for 100 parts by weight of the
protective agent. Further, the selenium-containing peptide takes 0.03-0.04 part. It has
been proved that the ancient bone resource protective agent shows superior anti
oxidation effect with above part by weight of the selenium-containing peptide.
      Preferably, the selenium-containing peptide is Sec-Arg-Gly-Asp,           and the
selenium-containing peptide takes 0.03-0.05 part for 100 parts by weight of the
protective agent. Furthermore, the selenium-containing peptide takes 0.035-0.045 part.
It has been proved that the ancient bone resource protective agent shows superior anti
oxidation effect with above part by weight of the selenium-containing peptide.
                                                8

      Because of the environmental limitation during the excavation, transportation
and display of the ancient bone resource, it is impossible to be sterilized, and the
ancient bone resource can be eroded by various environmental microorganisms,
resulting in the change or loss of traits of the ancient bone resource. This is a
significant loss to the non-regenerable ancient bone resource. After several tests, non
toxic or less toxic preservative components, the preservative and lysozyme, are added
to the ancient bone resource protective agent so as to confer the ancient bone resource
protective agent antiseptic ability and reduce the environmental bacteria erosion of the
ancient    bone resourcein excavation,       transport and display environments.      The
combinational preservative is selected from the preservatives which have the activity
of inhibiting mold, yeast and aerobic bacteria, and have been widely used as
preservatives in the fields of food, beverage, pickles, tobacco, medicine and cosmetics.
Lysozyme is a non-toxic protein with no side effect and has natural antibacterial
activity, such as decomposition effect on Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis,
radiation-resistant Micrococcus, and dissolving effect on Gram-negative bacteria
Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. It has been widely
used in preservation of aquatic products, meat products, cakes, milk powder and
beverages. The preservatives described above do not require heating during the
sterilization process and therefore can be applied to the protection of ancient bone
resource without damaging the ancient bone resource.
      After extensive trials on the ratio, the ancient bone resource protective agent with
three major components including substrate component, antioxidant component and
preservative component displays enhanced synergic effect among those components. It
shows good reversibility and superior protective, anti-oxidative and anti-bacterial
effects after spraying to the ancient bones. Among them, the adhesive is selected from
the nutritional components of human daily diet, which is non-toxic after oral
administration.
                                                 9

of a preservative, 0.18-0.25 parts of a lysozyme and water as the remainder for 100
parts by weight of the protective agent.
      Furthenore, the water-soluble protein is selected from bovine serum albumin
and soybean water-soluble protein, which has good adhesion effect and is easy to wash
away. Preferably, the water-soluble protein is any one or more of bovine serum
albumin and soybean water-soluble protein, and the water-soluble protein takes 14-19

of the water-soluble protein.
      Additionally, the adhesive is water-soluble starch, and the water-soluble starch
takes 15-18 parts by weight of 100 parts of the protective agent. It has been proved

     Reversibility Test
      1. The ancient bone resource protective agents prepared in Examples 1-3 and 10
were tested forreversibility by fluorescent labeling.
     (1) The adhesive is fluorescently labeled with a protein-fluorescence labeling kit.
     (2) The ancient bone resource protective agents provided by the invention were
proportionally formulated and sprayed on the ancient bone, with the sprayed thickness
of 100± 10 pm.
     (3) After drying, the fluorescence coverage of the bone was examined on a box
UV-visible transmission reflectometer, and the fluorescence was imaged and
quantified by using the Image-Pro Plus software, and the data was defined as m.
     (4)Then the same bone was sufficiently washed with flowing water for 5
minutes, dried, fixed in the same position following by repeat of step (3), and the data
obtained was further defined as n.
     (5) Fluorescence reduction rate X = (m-n) / m x 100%.
     2. Reversibility of the ancient bone resource protective agents prepared in
Examples 4-6 was determined by iodine water method.

                Example 6                                      96.38%
     It can be seen from Table 2 that when the soluble protein or starch is used as one
of the material for the ancient bone resource protective agents prepared by the
examples, the value of X ranges from 95.2%           X 5 1.0, which indicates that the
protective agent can be easily washed off with water. Furthermore, after another round
of wash and measurement, X= 1.0 for all experimental groups, indicating that all the
protective agents were washed off and the superior reversibility of the ancient bone
resource protective agents.
     Test for protective and anti-oxidative effects
                                               18

      (1) Draw a line on the surface of the ancient bone. Bone hardness measured by a
portable durometer was a.
      (2) Divided by the line, one side of the ancient bone was evenly sprayed with the
ancient bone resource protective agents prepared in examples and referred as
protective side, and the other side was referred as non-protective side. After drying,
bone hardness was measured as b. 8 sites were selected randomly and the thicknesses
of the protective film formed by the protective agents at the 8 sites were measured by a
micrometer. Meanwhile, the ratio of the bone hardness increased was calculated as <1
 =(b-a)/ax100%. The ancient bone was sprayed three times, wherein the film
thickness was 45-55pm for the first spray, 75-95ptm for the second, and 115-135pm for
the third.
      (3) After three times of spray, the ancient bone was placed at room temperature to
avoid direct sunlight for display for 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The bone
hardness was measured as c for the protective side and d for the non-protective side.
The ratio of the bone hardness reduced for the protective side was calculated as Y =
(b-c)/bx 100%, and for the non-protective side Z=(a-d) / a x 100%. The result is shown
in Table 3.

resource protective agent provided by the examples of the present invention, after
single or multiple times of spray, effective protection films were formed on the surface
of the bone and the bone hardness was improved.
      The ratio of bone hardness decreased at 6 and 12 months after spraying was
measured. 6 months: Y value was 8% ! Y 5 6.5%; Z value was 18.0% 5 Z ! 24.5%.

      As can be seen from the above data, the ancient bones that were not treated with
ancient bone resource protective agent was significantly reduced in hardness at room
temperature and after 6 and 12 months of exposure to direct sunlight, as a result of the
damage caused by oxidation to ancient bones. Avoiding direct sunlight for 6 months
and 12 months, the ancient bone sprayed with the protective agent described herein did
not show significant decrease in hardness at room temperature, indicating the anti
                                               20

oxidant substances (antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants) contained in the ancient
bone resource protective agent can effectively reduce the oxidative damage to ancient
bones and thus effectively protect the precious ancient bone resource.
      In addition, the excavation of archeology is a process causing dramatic
environmental change for ancient bone resource. There is an abrupt change in the
environment. As the balance system between the ancient bones and the buried
environment is broken, the ground environment (including temperature, humidity,
light, bacteria, etc.) may cause serious damage to the ancient bone resource. According
to the different requirements of the ancient bone in situ display, shift display and
scientific research, the protection of ancient bone resource can be divided into "in situ
protection" and "extraction protection".
       "In situ protection" means on site protection without changing the position of the
ancient bone; "extraction protection" means the protection of ancient bones in the
process of stripping ancient bones from buried soil. It is the first move after the
excavation, and the quality of the protection directly affects future exhibition and
research work.
      The in-situ protection is relatively simple and the ancient bone resource
protective agent provided by the present invention needs to be sprayed on the ancient
bone exposed on the surface of the ground to a thickness of 40-140 pim and infiltrate
the ancient bone resource protective agent in the soil to an area that is 1.5 times of the
area of the ancient stone exposure on the ground, and to a depth of more than 0.3m so
as to protect the ancient bone below the surface of the ground. As to the extraction
protection, the fragmentation degree (integrity, rupture, looseness, spoilage, chalking,
etc.) and hardness of the extracted ancient bone resource need to be evaluated first,
and for the ancient bone with better integrity and hardness, it can be stripped out from
the soil first, and then sprayed with the ancient bone resource protective agent
provided herein of 40-140prm following by subsequent exhibition and scientific
                                                21

research. For the ancient bone with poor integrity and hardness, the bone needs to be
bonded and reinforced first, and the ancient bone resource protective agent herein is
infused to the ancient bone by in situ dripping and penetration method so as to meet
the extraction purpose. By the adhesive property of the ancient bone resource
protective agent, the ancient bone can be bonded together, and after drying the
hardness of the bone will be improved as well, which is advantageous for further
exhibition and scientific research. The protective effect of the ancient bone resource
protective agent varies with different storage conditions. 3 months or 6 months can be
the time unit for evaluating of the protection effect of the ancient bone and additional
spray of the protective agent.
      Antibacterial Test
      Because there is no standard for testing the antibacterial effect of the archeology
protective agent, reference was made only to the standard of daily chemicals. The
ancient bone resource protective agents prepared in Examples 1-10 of the present
invention were entrusted to "China Research Institute of Daily Chemical Industry" and
"Guangdong Microbial Analysis and Testing Center" by employing "QBT 2738-2012
method for evaluating antibacterial effect for daily chemicals" as test standard, with
reference to the method for testing the antibacterial effect of antibacterial daily
chemical products as described in 7.5 (bacteriostatic ring method) in the standard.
Antibacterial effects of the ancient bone resource protective agent against bacteria
(Escherichia coli) and fungi (Candida albicans) were tested, respectively. From the
standard, "when the antibacterial ring has a diameter greater than 7mm, the product
has antibacterial effect". The ancient bone resource protective agents of Examples 1
10 all displayed antibacterial rings having diameters greater than 12mm, indicating the
significant antibacterial effect.
      In addition, from the formula of the ancient bone resource protective agent
provided by the present invention, it can be indicated that the agent can also be used to
                                              22

inhibit mold.
      The ancient bone resource protective agent provided by the examples of the
present invention uses one or more of water-soluble protein and water-soluble starch,
as well as propylene glycol as the substrate materials of the ancient bone resource
protective agent. Those substrates have low toxicity and superior water solubility.
After spraying on the ancient bone resource, the ancient bone resource protective
agent with specific proportion can form a protection film so as to achieve the
protective effect. Since both of the two substrates have good water-solubility, the
protection film is easy to be wash off, which allows the ancient bone resource to return
to the original state to achieve the reversibility. By adding the non-toxic or less toxic
natural antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase), natural antioxidants (plant
extracted antioxidant), the ancient bone resource protective agent is endowed with
anti-oxidative effect, which can decrease the oxidation damage during excavation,
transport and display.
      The foregoing descriptions are merely preferred examples of the present
invention and are not intended to limit the present invention. For those skilled in the
art, the present invention may have various modifications and changes. Any
modification, equivalent replacement, improvement, etc. within the spirit and principle
of the present invention should be included in the protection scope of the present
invention.
