                     Sleep Disorder Compositions and Treatments Thereof
Field
[0001]        The invention relates to a method for treating a sleep disorder. The invention also
relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an extract from a Cannabis plant, and its
use in the treatment of the sleep disorder.
Background
[0002]        The biological activity of Cannabis is well known, and has led it to become a
"recreational" drug. However, with the discovery of a class of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and
the relaxation of laws regulating Cannabis use - in some jurisdictions decriminalisation - there
now exists the opportunity to explore the potential of Cannabis as a source of new therapeutics.
[0003]        There is also a growing movement of patients suffering from chronic diseases, such
as sleep disorders, to seek natural remedies as alternative or complementary therapy.
[0004]       Accordingly, there is a continuing need to develop new treatments for sleep
disorders, which are derived, at least in part, from a natural source.
Summary
[0005]        The invention provides a method of treating a sleep disorder comprising
administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a Cannabis extract. Accordingly, also provided is a pharmaceutical composition
comprising the Cannabis extract and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients or any combination thereof.
[0006]        The Cannabis extract comprises a cannabinoid fraction and a terpene fraction. In
some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises a cannabinoid fraction comprising
A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabinol (CBN) and a terpene
fraction in an amount of at least 3% by weight of the extract. The cannabinoid fraction typically
comprises THC as the primary cannabinoid, and the CBD and CBN as secondary cannabinoids.
The terpene fraction typically comprises beta-myrcene, linalool and nerolidol. Preferably the
Cannabis extract does not contain (or contains very low levels, such as not more than about
0.001wt%) A 9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, terpinolene,
caryophyllene, humulene and limonene.
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                   -2
[0007]       In a further aspect, there is provided use of the Cannabis extract in the preparation
of a medicament for treating a sleep disorder.
[0008]       In yet another aspect, there is provided a medicament comprising an effective
amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the Cannabis extract and optionally one or
more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients or any combination
thereof.
Description of Embodiment(s)
[0009]       The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
Cannabis extract and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents,
adjuvants, excipients or any combination thereof.
[0010]       Cannabis plants produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including
cannabinoids, terpenes and terpenoids, sterols, triglycerides, alkanes, squalenes, tocopherols,
carotenoids and alkaloids. The mix of these secondary metabolites varies depending on
several factors, including Cannabis variety, part of the Cannabis plant extracted, method of
extraction, processing of the extract, and season.
[0011]       There are several varieties of Cannabis plant, which have been described under two
distinct naming conventions. One of these conventions identifies three distinct species of
Cannabis plant, namely Cannabis sativa Linnaeus, Cannabis indica LAM., and Cannabis
ruderalis. Another convention identifies all Cannabis plants as belonging to the Cannabis sativa
L. species, with the various varieties divided amongst several subspecies, including: Cannabis
sativa ssp. sativa and ssp. indica. As used herein, the term "Cannabis" refers to any and all of
these plant varieties.
[0012]       The extracts may be formed from any part of the Cannabis plant containing
cannabinoid, terpene and terpenoid compounds. Extracts may be formed by contacting an
extractant with a leaf, seed, trichome, flower, keif, shake, bud, stem or a combination thereof. In
some embodiments, the extract is formed from the flowers and shake of a Cannabis plant.
Suitable extractants include, for example, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,
propylene glycol, etc.), water, hydrocarbons (e.g., butane, hexane, etc.), oils (e.g., olive oil,
vegetable oil, essential oil, etc.), a solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate, polyethylene glycol, etc.) or a
supercritical fluid (e.g., liquid C02).
[0013]       The extractant may be completely or partially removed prior to incorporation of the
                                                                            10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                  -3
Cannabis extract into the pharmaceutical composition, or it may be included in the
pharmaceutical composition as a carrier. The extractant may be removed by heating the extract
optionally under reduced pressure. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition
comprises a residual amount of an extractant (such as ethanol). In some embodiments, the
residual amount of extractant may be up to about 10mg/g or about 5mg/g. It will be appreciated
that some of the more volatile plant metabolites (such as terpenes) may also be removed with
the extractant. Accordingly, in some embodiments, removing the extractant may enrich the
cannabinoid fraction of the extract.
[0014]       The Cannabis extract comprises a cannabinoid fraction comprising
A-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), and Cannabinol (CBN). Of these
cannabinoids, THC and CBD do not occur in significant concentrations in Cannabis plant
material and are formed during the extraction process through decarboxylation of corresponding
carboxylic acid derivatives of these cannabinoids (or cannabinoid acids), which are
biosynthesised by the Cannabis plant. The precise concentration of neutral THC or CBD in a
Cannabis plant is difficult to quantify due to the potential for decarboxylation of the
corresponding cannabinoid acids during analysis. Accordingly, when the pharmaceutical
compositions of the invention comprise THC or CBD derived from a Natural source, the
composition comprises decarboxylated THC or CBD.
[0015]       The extraction process typically comprises a decarboxylation step. Decarboxylation
refers to the loss of a carboxyl group during conversion of a carboxylic acid derivative of a
cannabinoid into the cannabinoid itself. A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THC-A) and
cannabidiolic acid (CBD-A) are not thermally stable and may be decarboxylated by exposure to
light or heat. Some studies have also shown that THC-A and CBD-A can be decarboxylated
upon exposure to cofactors or certain solvents. Typically, decarboxylation is carried out by
heating the extract in the presence of extractant to a temperature of at least 600C (e.g. at least
80cC). This heating step may be maintained for 30 minutes or longer. In some embodiments,
the decarboxylation occurs during extractant removal.
[0016]       In addition, THC has been shown to oxidise to cannabinol (CBN) when exposed to
oxygen and light, including during decarboxylation. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the
extraction comprises exposing the extract to light under an oxygen atmosphere. In other
embodiments, the extraction is carried out in the absence of oxygen, for example under an
atmosphere of nitrogen.
[0017]       In some embodiments, the extract is filtered to remove particulate material, for
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                  -4
example, by passing the extract through filter paper or a fine sieve (e.g., a sieve with pore sizes
of 5 tm). The Cannabis composition may comprise up to about 5% by weight (e.g., up to about
2% by weight) visible particles.
[0018]      In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is formed by applying heat and
pressure to the plant material. Typically, in these embodiments, no extractant is required.
[0019]      In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract is a Cannabis oil. As used herein, a
"Cannabis oil" is an extract formed by contacting at least a part of a Cannabis plant with an oil.
The extracting oil may optionally be removed. Extracting oils may be selected from olive oil,
sunflower oil, hemp oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, grape seed oil, almond
oil, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and any other edible oil, or a combination thereof.
[0020]      The term "cannabinoid" as used herein relates to any molecule that has been
isolated from a Cannabis plant or synthetically created to have activity involving the
endocannabinoid system.
[0021]      The term "cannabinoid fraction" is used to describe the combination of cannabinoid
compounds present in the Cannabis extract.
[0022]      The terms "terpenes" and "terpenoids" as used herein refer to a class of
hydrocarbon molecules, which often provide a unique smell. Terpenes are derived from units of
isoprene, which has the molecular formula C5H8 . The basic molecular formula of terpenes are
multiples of the isoprene unit, i.e. (C5 H8), where n is the number of linked isoprene units.
Terpenoids are terpene compounds that have been further metabolised in the plant, typically
through an oxidative process, and therefore usually contain at least one oxygen atom.
[0023]      The term "terpene fraction" is used to describe the combination of terpene and
terpenoid compounds present in the Cannabis extract.
[0024]      The inventors have observed that the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition is
enhanced when the terpene fraction has a certain profile, i.e. a certain proportion of particular
terpenes/terpenoids are present in the extract. It is believed that the increase in efficacy may
be synergistic (i.e. non-additive). It is also believed that the presence of specific components in
the terpene fraction may enhance the patient's tolerance to cannabinoid therapy.
[0025]      In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract contains high amounts (e.g., greater
than 50% by weight) of a main cannabinoid, typically THC. In some embodiments, the
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                              -5
Cannabis extract may comprise the cannabinoid fraction in an amount of about 50% to about
99.999% by weight, for example, about 55% to about 99.999%, about 60% to about 99.999%,
about 70% to about 99.999%, about 80% to about 99.999%, about 90% to about 99.999%,
about 90% to about 99.99%, about 90% to about 99.9%, or about 90% to about 99.5% by
weight of the Cannabis extract. In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises about
0.001% to about 50% by weight of non-cannabinoids, for example, about 0.001% to about 20%
by weight or about 0.001% to about 10% by weight non-cannabinoids.
[0026]      In some embodiments, the cannabinoid fraction is present from about 0.001 to about
60% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition, for example, about 5% to about 55% or
about 10% to about 50% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments,
the pharmaceutical formulation consists of the Cannabis extract.
[0027]      In some embodiments, one or more additional compounds (e.g., cannabinoid,
terpene or terpenoid compounds) may be added to the Cannabis extract. The addition of the
one or more additional compounds may compensate for natural variations in the relative
amounts of certain compounds being expressed in the Cannabis plant. The added compounds
may be synthetic versions of the desired compounds, they may be purified compounds obtained
from other Cannabis extracts, or they may be added by blending two or more extracts.
[0028]      To date, over 100 cannabinoids have been identified in Cannabis extracts. A
comprehensive list of these cannabinoids may be found in Mahmoud A. El Sohly and Waseem
Gul, "Constituents of Cannabis Sativa." In Handbook of Cannabis Roger Pertwee (Ed.) Oxford
University Press (2014) (ISBN: 9780199662685). Cannabinoids that have been identified in

[0029]         The Cannabis extract may comprise 0.005-99% by weight of a main cannabinoid
based on the total weight of the extract, for example, from 0.005-90%, 0.005-65%, 0.005-40%,
0.005-10%, 0.005-2%, 0.005-0.1%, 0.005-0.05%, 0.01-0.05%, 0.01-99%, 0.01-90%, 0.01-10%,
0.01-2%, 0.01-0.1%, 0.01-0.05%, 0.015-0.03% 5-90%, 10-90%, 20-90%, 25-85%, 50-99%, 40
90%, 50-90% or 55-85% by weight based on the total weight of the extract. The main
cannabinoid may be A 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In some embodiments, the Cannabis
extract comprises the main cannabinoid in an amount of 5-90%, 10-90%, 20-90%, 25-85%, 50
99%, 55-95%, 70-95%, 75-95% or 80-90% by weight of the cannabinoid fraction. Typically, the
Cannabis extract further comprises one or more secondary cannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD)
and/or cannabinol (CBN) may also be present in the Cannabis extract as secondary
cannabinoids. Typically, each secondary cannabinoid is present in an amount from about
                                                                        10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

0.001% to about 30% by weight of the cannabinoid fraction, for example, from 0.001-10%, 1
10%, 2-10%, 3-5% or 8-10% by weight based on the total weight of the cannabinoid fraction.
Other cannabinoids may also be present, but typically these do not form part of the active
ingredients.
[0030]       The pharmaceutical composition may comprise THC in a concentration of about
1mg/ml to about 100mg/ml, for example, from about 5mg/ml to about 50mg/ml, about 5mg/ml to
about 30mg/ml, about 10mg/mi to about 30mg/ml or about 18mg/ml to about 22mg/ml.
[0031]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises 0.001-20% by weight of
cannabidiol (CBD) as a secondary cannabinoid, for example, from 0.0001-20%, 0.001-10%, 1
20% or 1-10% by weight of the extract or cannabinoid fraction. The pharmaceutical
composition may comprise CBD in a concentration of about 0.5mg/ml to about 10mg/ml, for
example, from about 0.5mg/ml to about 5mg/ml, about 0.5mg/ml to about 2.5mg/ml or about
0.9mg/ml to about 1.1mg/ml.
[0032]       The ratio by weight of THC to CBD may be from 10:1 to 50:1, for example from 10:1
to 30:1, 15:1 to 25:1 or about 20:1.
[0033]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises 0.0001-20% by weight of
cannabiniol (CBN), for example, from 0.001-20%, 0.001-10%, 1-20% or 1-10% by weight of the
extract or cannabinoid fraction. The pharmaceutical composition may comprise CBN in a
concentration of about 0.5mg/ml to about 10mg/ml, for example, from about 0.5mg/ml to about
5mg/ml, about 1mg/ml to about 5mg/ml or about 1.8mg/ml to about 2.2mg/ml.
[0034]       The ratio by weight of THC to CBN may be from 5:1 to 20:1, for example from 5:1 to
15:1 or about 10:1.
[0035]       The ratio by weight of CBN:CBD may be from about 1:1 to about 10:1, for example
from about 1:1 to about 5:1, about 1.5:1 to about 3:1 or about 2:1.
[0036]       Typically, the Cannabis extracts also comprise other cannabinoids in addition to
THC, CBN and CBD. These cannabinoids include A-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), (-)
Cannabidivarin (CBDV) and Cannabigerol (CBG). Each of these cannabinoids may be present
in an amount from 0.001% to 30% by weight of the extract or cannabinoid fraction.
[0037]       In some embodiments, certain cannabinoids may be absent, or present in non
detectable amounts (e.g., less than 0.001% by weight of the analyte). In some embodiments,
                                                                      10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                   -8
the Cannabis extract may exclude (or comprise in an amount of less than or equal to 0.5% by
weight of the cannabinoid fraction) one or more of the following cannabinoids:
A 9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), Cannabigerolic acid (CBGA)
and (-)-Cannabidivarin (CBDV).
[0038]        The Cannabis extract comprises a non-cannabinoid fraction, which typically includes
a terpene fraction. The terpene fraction comprises terpenes and terpenoids. The Cannabis
extract comprises a terpene fraction in an amount of at least about 3% by weight of the extract,
for example, at least about 3.5%, 4%, or 4.5% by weight. In some embodiments, the Cannabis
extract comprises a terpene fraction in an amount of less than 50% by weight, for example, less
than 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, or 4% by weight of
the extract. In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract comprises about 3% to about 50% by
weight of terpene and terpenoid compounds, for example, about 3% to about 20% by weight,
about 3% to about 10% by weight, about 3% to about 6% by weight or about 3 to about 5% by
weight of the extract or composition.
[0039]        The ratio by weight of the cannabinoid fraction to the terpene fraction may be from
about 8:1 to about 33:1, for example, from about 10:1 to about 30:1, about 10:1 to about 25:1 or
about 15:1 to about 25:1. In some embodiments, the ratio by weight of the main cannabinoid to
the terpene fraction may be from about 5:1 to about 30:1, for example, about 10:1 to about 25:1
or about 15:1 to about 20:1.
[0040]        Typically, the terpene fraction in the plant material used to form the extract may
have a different terpene/terpenoid profile than the terpene profile of the final extract, both in
terms of the amounts of specific compounds in the terpene fraction and the weight of the
terpene fraction relative to the other components. For example, a Cannabis flower may
comprise about 20% by weight cannabinoids and about 3% by weight terpenes, corresponding
to a ratio of cannabinoid fraction:terpene fraction of about 20:3 (about 7:1). Following extraction
and concentration (i.e., removal of the extractant), the amount of cannabinoids may increase to
about 50-90% by weight and the terpene fraction may amount to about 0.1-6% by weight of the
Cannabis extract, corresponding to a significant increase in the ratio of cannabinoid
fraction:terpene fraction. This typical scenario shows that while the cannabinoids are
concentrated when the extractant is removed, the relative amount of the terpene fraction is
reduced, likely due to the volatility of many of the terpenes/terpenoids present in the terpene
fraction. Therefore, the profile of the terpene fraction present in the Cannabis extract is
significantly different from the profile of the terpene fraction that exists in Nature.

[0041]       A variety of terpenes and terpenoids have been identified in Cannabis extracts,
including monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids. For example,
the following terpenes and terpenoids have been identified in Cannabis extracts:
Alloaromadendrene, allyl hexanoate, benzaldehyde, (Z)-a-cis-bergamotene, (Z)-a-trans
bergamotene, B-bisabolol, epi-a-bisabolol, B-bisabolene, borneol (camphol), cis-y-bisabolene,

[0042]       It is believed that the presence of the particular terpenes/terpenoids in the terpene
fraction is associated with beneficial effects of the pharmaceutical composition in use.
[0043]       The terpene fraction typically comprises beta-myrcene. It is believed that beta
myrcene enhances the bioavailability of the cannabinoids present in the extract and/or assists in
allowing the cannabinoids to pass the blood-brain-barrier. Beta-myrcene may be present in an
amount of from 0% to about 40% by weight of the extract. In some embodiments, beta-myrcene
is present in an amount of about 0-50% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from
about 0.001% to about 45%, about 0.001% to about 25%, 5.1% to 29%, about 5.5% to about
25%, about 20% to about 50%, about 20% to about 45% or about 30% to about 45% by weight
of the terpene fraction. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises beta
myrcene in a concentration of up to about 10mg/ml, for example, up to about 5mg/ml, about
1mg/ml or about 0.5mg/ml.
[0044]       In some embodiments, the ratio by weight of THC to beta-myrcene may be from
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

20:1 to about 55:1, for example, from about 30:1 to about 50:1 or from about 35:1 to about 45:1.
[0045]        The terpene fraction may further comprise one or more of linalool and nerolidol.
[0046]        Linalool is a terpenoid that is found in many flower and spice plants having the
molecular formula C10 H180. It is believed that when linalool is present in a Cannabis extract, it
provides a sedative effect. In some embodiments, linalool may be present in an amount of at
least 0.05% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some preferred embodiments, linalool is
present in an amount of 0-50% by weight of the terpene fraction. In other embodiments, linalool
is present in amount of from about 0.05% to 50% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example,
from about 0.1% to about 20%, about 0.05 to about 25%, about 0.001% to about 45%, about
0.001% to about 25%, about 20% to about 50%, about 20% to about 45% or about 30% to
about 45% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical
composition comprises linalool in a concentration of up to about 10mg/mi, for example, up to
about 5mg/ml, about 1mg/ml or about 0.5mg/ml.
[0047]        In some embodiments, the ratio by weight of THC to linalool may be from 20:1 to
about 55:1, for example, from about 30:1 to about 50:1 or from about 35:1 to about 45:1.
[0048]        Nerolidol is a sesquiterpenoid having the molecular formula of C15 H2 60 . It exists in
Nature in two isomeric forms, namely nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2, which differ in the geometry
around a central olefin, i.e., either cis or trans isomers. The extract may comprise nerolidol (i.e.,
both nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2) in an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene
fraction, for example, from about 0.01% to about 30% or 0.01% to 20% by weight of the terpene
fraction. Typically, nerolidol 1 is present in greater amount relative to nerolidol 2. In some
embodiments, nerolidol 1 may be absent (or present in an amount below the limit of detection).
In some embodiments, nerolidol 2 may be absent (or present in an amount below the limit of
detection). In some embodiments, nerolidol 1 and nerolidol 2 are absent (or present in an
amount below the limit of detection). Nerolidol 1 may be present in the extract in an amount of
at least about 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.001% to 20% or
0.001 to 15% by weight of the terpene fraction. Nerolidol 2 may be present in the extract in an
amount of at least about 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example, from 0.001% to
20% or 0.001 to 15% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some embodiments, the
pharmaceutical composition comprises nerolidol in a concentration of up to about 5mg/ml, for
example, up to about 3mg/ml, about 1mg/ml or about 0.25mg/ml.
[0049]        In some embodiments, the ratio by weight of THC to nerolidol may be from 50:1 to
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

about 100:1, for example, from about 60:1 to about 95:1 or from about 70:1 to about 90:1.
[0050]       The terpene fraction may also comprise beta-caryophyllene. Beta-caryophyllene
may be present in an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example,
from 0.001% to 20% or 0.001% to 15% of the terpene fraction. In some embodiments, the
pharmaceutical composition comprises beta-caryophyllene in a concentration of up to about
1mg/ml, for example, up to about 0.5mg/ml or about 0.25mg/ml.
[0051]       In some embodiments, the extract further comprises humulene. It is believed that
that humulene enhances the sedative properties of the extract. Humulene is also sometimes
called alpha-caryophyllene. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises
humulene in a concentration of up to about 1mg/ml, for example, up to about 0.5mg/ml or about
0.25mg/ml.
[0052]       In some embodiments, the Cannabis extract further comprises ocimene. Ocimene
may be present in an amount of at least 0.001% by weight of the terpene fraction, for example,
from 0.001% to 20% or 0.001% to 5% by weight of the terpene fraction. In some embodiments,
the pharmaceutical composition comprises ocimene in a concentration of up to about 1mg/ml,
for example, up to about 0.5mg/ml or about 0.25mg/ml.
[0053]       In some embodiments, the terpene fraction comprises beta-myrcene, linalool and
nerolidol 1. The ratio by weight of beta-myrcene to linalool may be about 1:1 (e.g. from 1:2 to
2:1). The ratio by weight of beta-myrcene to nerolidol may be about 2:1 (e.g., from 1:1 to 3:1).
The ratio by weight of linalool to nerolidol may be about 2:1 (e.g., from 1:1 to 3:1). In some
embodiments, the ratio by weight of beta-myrcene:linalool:nerolidol is about 2:2:1.
[0054]       In some embodiments, the terpene fraction may be present in the composition in an
amount from 3% to 6% by weight of the extract and may comprise:
            " beta-myrcene in an amount of from 0% to 50% by weight of the terpene fraction;
            *    linalool in an amount of from 0% to 50% by weight of the terpene fraction;
            *    nerolidol 1 in an amount of from 0% to 20% by weight of the terpene fraction; and
            *    nerolidol 2 in an amount of from 0% to 20% by weight of the terpene fraction.
[0055]       In some embodiments, specific terpenes or terpenoids may be absent, or present in
non-detectable amounts (e.g., less than 0.001% by weight of the analyte or less than or equal to
0.5mg/ml of the pharmaceutical composition). In some embodiments, one or more of the
following terpenes or terpenoids are absent, or present in non-detectable amounts: alpha
                                                                        10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, p-cymene, camphene, alpha-terpinene, gamma-terpinene,
delta-s-carene, terpinolene, isopulegol, geraniol, and guaiol.
[0056]      The amounts of cannabinoids can be determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), including ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and
amounts of terpenes can be determined by HPLC and/or gas chromatography (GC). It will be
appreciated that, as for all plant extracts, the amount of each component in the Cannabis
extract may vary in some cases by +/- 10%, +/- 25% or +/- 50%. In some embodiments, the
amount of a cannabinoid and/or a terpene may be determined by UPLC using a Waters Acquity
UPLC system equipped with a Waters photodiode array detector (PDA) or detection by mass
spectrometry. Using UPLC the limit of quantitation (LoQ) of THC, CBD and/or CBN or related
substances may be less than 1pg/ml, for example, the LoQ of CBD may be 5 0.086 1g/ml, CBN
may be 5 0.038tg/ml and/or THC may be < 0.089 tg/ml may be detected in an analyte.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise CBD in an
amount greater than 0.086pg/ml, CBN in an amount greater than 0.038ptg/ml and/or THC in an
amount greater than 0.089pg/ml.
[0057]      The Cannabis extract is preferably free of toxins associated with plant extracts. For
example, preferably the Cannabis extract is free of aflatoxins (such as aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and
G2), mycotoxins (such as ochratoxin A), heavy metals (such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and
mercury) and pesticides. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises less
than 4pg/ml total aflatoxins and/or less than 2pg/ml aflatoxin A. In some embodiments, the
pharmaceutical composition may comprise less than 20pg/ml ochratoxin. In some
embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises <0.3ppm arsenic, 50.5ppm cadmium,
55ppm lead andior 50.5ppm mercury.
[0058]      In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise not more
than 20% by weight total ash.
[0059]      The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients or any combination thereof.
[0060]      The term "pharmaceutical composition" relates to a composition comprising at least
one active ingredient that is in a pharmaceutically acceptable form. The term "pharmaceutical
composition" may encompass compositions intended to be sold as nutraceutical products (e.g.
supplements that provide a health benefit). In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical
composition is a nutraceutical composition.
                                                                       10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

amount of up to 99wt% of the pharmaceutical composition, for example, up to 95wt%, 90wt%,
85wt%, 80wt%, 75wt%, 70wt%, 65wt%, 60wt%, 55wt%, 50wt%, 45wt%, 40wt%, 35wt%, 30wt%,
25wt%, 20wt%, 15wt%, lOwt%, 5wt%, 4wt%, 3wt%, 2wt%, 1wt% or lower. The minimum
amount of Cannabis extract in the pharmaceutical compositions may be at least 0.001wt%,
0.005wt%, 0.Olwt%, 0.05wt%, 0.lwt%, 0.5wt%, 1wt%, 5wt%, lOwt%, 15wt%, 20wt%, 25wt%,
30wt%, 35wt%, 40wt%, 45wt%, 50wt% or higher. The pharmaceutical compositions may
comprise the Cannabis extract in amount between any of these minimum and maximum
amounts, such as 0.001wt% to 99wt%, 0.1wt% to 65wt% or 1wt% to 50wt%. In some
embodiments, the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants,
excipients or any combination thereof provides the balance of weight of the pharmaceutical
composition.
[0062]       The carrier, diluent, adjuvant and/or excipient are "pharmaceutically acceptable"
meaning that they are compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and are not
deleterious to a subject upon or following administration. The pharmaceutical compositions may
be formulated, for example, by employing solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as well as
pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (for
example, excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilisers, flavours, etc.) according to techniques
such as those well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation (See, for example,
Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., 2005, Lippincott Williams &
Wilkins). The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be any carrier included in the United
States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF), the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), the
European Pharmacopoeia (EP), or the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP). In some embodiments,
the carrier, diluent, adjuvant and/or excipient may be non-natural (e.g., synthetically produced).
[0063]       The pharmaceutical composition includes those suitable for oral, sublingual, buccal,
rectal, nasal, topical, vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous and
intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.
[0064]       The Cannabis extract, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, excipient or
diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages
thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or
liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules filled with the same, all for
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable
solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use.
[0065]       Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise
conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active
compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective
amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be
employed.
[0066]       For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the Cannabis extract described
herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form
preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispensable
granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents,
flavouring agents, solubilisers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet
disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.
[0067]       Suitable carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar,
lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is
intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as
carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is
surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are
included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms
suitable for oral administration.
[0068]       Liquid form preparations include solutions, dispersions, suspensions, and
emulsions, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable oil, water or water-propylene glycol
solutions. For example, a sublingual preparation can be prepared in a carrier comprising a
pharmaceutically acceptable oil, and parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated
as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.
[0069]       Sterile liquid form compositions include sterile solutions, suspensions, emulsions,
syrups and elixirs. The Cannabis extract can be suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both.
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

[0070]         Other liquid form preparations include those prepared by combining the Cannabis
extract with one or more oils (e.g., an essential oil) or waxes. An "essential oil" is an oil
extracted from a material, such as a plant material (e.g., steam extraction, or contacting the
plant material with an extractant) or pressing, which contains primarily hydrophobic, and
generally fragrant, components of the plant material. Suitable oils and waxes include Sesame
oil, Olive oil, Sunflower oil, Arnica essential oil, Lavender essential oil, Lavender Spike essential
oil, Frankincense essential oil, Lemongrass essential oil, Cinnamon Leaf essential oil,
Rosemary Cineole essential oil, Rosemary essential oil, Bergamot essential oil, Myrrh essential
oil, Sage essential oil, Coconut oil, Bees wax and Hemp oil.
[0071]         The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration
(e.g., by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in
unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers
optionally with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions,
solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulation agents such as
suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in
powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilisation from solution, for
constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.
[0072]         Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile injectable solutions
or dispersions, and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable
solutions. They should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and may be
preserved against oxidation and the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria or
fungi.
[0073]         The solvent or dispersion medium for the injectable solution or dispersion may
contain any of the conventional solvent or carrier systems, and may contain, for example, water,
ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the
like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.
[0074]         Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use may be delivered by any
appropriate route including intravenous, intramuscular, intracerebral, intrathecal, epidural
injection or infusion.
[0075]         Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the Cannabis extract in the
required amount in the appropriate carrier with various other ingredients such as those
                                                                           10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilisation. Generally, dispersions are prepared
by incorporating the various sterilised active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the
basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In
the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, preferred methods
of preparation are vacuum drying or freeze-drying of a previously sterile suspension of the
active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredients.
[0076]        The active ingredients may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent
or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule,
or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet.
For oral therapeutic administration, the active may be incorporated with excipients and used in
the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups,
wafers, and the like.
[0077]        The amount of active ingredient in therapeutically useful compositions should be
sufficient that a suitable dosage will be obtained.
[0078]        The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the components
as listed hereafter: a binder such as gum, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as
dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and
the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such a sucrose,
lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen,
or cherry flavouring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to
materials of the above type, a liquid carrier.
[0079]        In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for sublingual
administration. Sublingual administration relates to administration of a formulation under the
tongue of a subject. In some instances, sublingual administration may be considered to be a
form of oral administration or topical administration. Sublingual administration may be
considered a form of oral administration as the formulation is taken "by mouth" and in some
instances, after application under the tongue, the subject may swallow the formulation which
may allow for at least a portion of the active ingredients to be absorbed through the digestive
tract. Subligual administration may be considered a form of topical administration as it may
include administration of the active ingredient(s) in the formulation through the mucus
membrane under the tongue. Formulations suitable for sublingual administration include tablets
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

(e.g. dissolvable, dispersible, effervescent and multi-purpose tablets), strips, drops, sprays,
lozenges and combinations thereof.
[0080]       Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the
physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with
shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a
sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavouring such as
cherry or orange flavour. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should
be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the
active compound(s) may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations,
including those that allow specific delivery of the active peptide to specific regions of the gut.
[0081]       Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active
component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilising and thickening agents,
as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely
divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums,
resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending
agents.
[0082]       Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all solvents,
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying
agents and the like.
[0083]       Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly
before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include
solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the
active component, colorants, flavours, stabilisers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners,
dispersants, thickeners, solubilising agents, and the like.
[0084]       For topical administration to the epidermis the active ingredients may be formulated
as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for
example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening
and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in
general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents,
suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

[0085]        Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges
comprising active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles
comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and
acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.
[0086]        Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional
means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single
or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient
administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension.
[0087]        In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering
atomising spray pump. To improve nasal delivery and retention the compounds according to the
invention may be encapsulated with cyclodextrins, or formulated with other agents expected to
enhance delivery and retention in the nasal mucosa.
[0088]       Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol
formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable
propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane,
trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas.
[0089]        The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of
drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.
[0090]       Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for
example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch,
starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
Conveniently the powder carrier may form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition
may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g. gelatin, or
blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.
[0091]        In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including
intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of
the order of 5 to 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in
the art, for example by micronisation.
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

[0092]        When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active
ingredient may be employed.
[0093]        The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form,
the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
discrete quantities of preparation, such as packaged tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or
ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it
can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.
[0094]        It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein
refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each
unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for
the dosage unit forms are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of
the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations
inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of a sleep disorder.
[0095]        Also described herein are compositions absent a carrier where the compositions are
in unit dosage form. Accordingly, also provided is a medicament comprising the Cannabis
extract.
[0096]        In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an active
agent other than the Cannabis extract. Any suitable active agent may be used provided that the
activity of the active agent and/or the Cannabis extract is not diminished when combined.
Methods of treatment
[0097]        In another aspect, also provided is a method for treating a sleep disorder. The
method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of the
pharmaceutical composition described herein.
[0098]        The pharmaceutical compositions may be used to treat a sleep disorder. Sleep
disorders are described in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICDS). ICDS-3
was published in 2014 and characterises sleep disorders as belonging to one of the following
classes: (1) Insomnias; (2) Sleep Related Breathing Disorders; (3) Central Disorders of
Hypersomnolence; (3) Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders; (4) Parasomnias; (5) Sleep
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                 - 20
Related Movement Disorders. Accordingly, the sleep disorders to be treated by the
pharmaceutical composition may include any sleep disorders from the classes (1) Insomnias;
(2) Sleep Related Breathing Disorders; (3) Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence; (3) Circadian
Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders; (4) Parasomnias; (5) Sleep Related Movement Disorders. In
particular, the pharmaceutical compositions may be effective in the treatment of a sleep disorder
selected from: insomnia, narcolepsy, hypersomnia, sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement
disorder, restless legs syndrome, nocturnal eating (drinking) syndrome, jet lag, shift work sleep
disorder, irregular sleep-wake pattern, confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, sleep
talking, nightmares, sleep paralysis, REM sleep behaviour disorder, snoring, sleeping sickness,
a sleep disorder associated with another disease or condition, or any other sleep disorder.
[0099]        By "effective amount" it is meant an amount sufficient that when administered to the
patient an amount of the drug is provided to achieve an effect. In the case of a therapeutic
method, this effect may be the treatment of the sleep disorder. Therefore, the "effective
amount" may be a "therapeutically effective amount". By "therapeutically effective amount" it is
meant an amount sufficient that when administered to the patient an amount of drug is provided
to treat the disease or a symptom of the disease.
[0100]        In some embodiments, the methods comprise administration of THC in an amount
from 1mg/day to 50mg/day, for example, from 5mg/day to 40mg/day, 5mg/day to 30mg/day,
5mg/day to 25mg/day or 10mg/day to 20mg/day. In some embodiments, the methods may
comprise administering THC in an amount of 10mg/day or 20mg/day. The methods may
comprise administering CBD in an amount from 0.001 mg/day to 10mg/day, for example, from
0.01mg/day to 1Omg.day or 0.1mg/day to 5mg/day. In some embodiments, the methods may
comprise administering CBD in an amount of 1mg/day. The methods may comprise
administering CBN in an amount from 0.001mg/day to 10mg/day, for example, from 0.01mg/day
to 1Omg.day or 0.1mg/day to 5mg/day. In some embodiments, the methods comprise
administering CBN in an amount of 1mg/day or 2mg/day. The methods may comprise
administering THC, CBD and/or CBN in any combination of these daily dosage amounts. The
pharmaceutical compositions preferably comprise amounts of THC, CBD and CBN suitable for
administration of any of these daily dosage amounts.
[0101]       As used herein, the terms "treating", "treatment", "treat" and the like mean affecting
a subject, tissue or cell to obtain a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect. The
effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing, or reducing the severity
of, a disease or associated symptom, and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or
complete cure of a disease. A reference to "treating" a sleep disorder therefore encompasses:
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                     - 21
(a) assisting the patient to fall asleep; (b) assisting the patient remain asleep once sleep has
been achieved; (c) relieving or ameliorating the effects of the sleep disorder, e.g. enhancing
wakefulness during non-sleep periods; or (d) preventing the sleep disorder from occurring in a
subject predisposed to, or at risk of, the sleep disorder, so that the sleep disorder does not
develop or occur in the subject, or develops in a less severe form.
[0102]        In some embodiments, the sleep disorder is insomnia. Symptoms and severity of
insomnia may be measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire. Typically the ISI
is administered by a clinician, nurse or researcher or may be self-administered by the patient.
The ISI assesses both night-time and daytime components of insomnia and is available in
several languages. The ISI asks seven questions each to be scored on a scale of 0-4 relating to
(1) the difficulty in falling asleep, (2) difficulty staying asleep, (3) problems waking too early, (4)
satisfaction relating to current sleep patterns, (5) perception as to how noticeable the sleep
problem may be to others, (6) degree of concern regarding the sleep problem, and (7) the
extent to which the sleep problem interferes with daily functioning. The methods may provide an
improvement in one or more of these seven aspects of insomnia. In some embodiments of the
methods of treatment, the patient to be treated may have an initial ISI score of 7 or more, in
some cases, the initial ISI score may be 10 or more. In some embodiments, a method of
treating insomnia may provide a reduction of the ISI score of the patient relative to an initial ISI
score. This reduction in ISI score may be by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more units on the ISI scale, and
preferably results in the patient having an ISI score of 7 or less after treatment.
[0103]        The ISI may be used alone to assess the severity of the patient's insomnia or it may
be used together with one or more other questionnaires, such as quality of life enjoyment and
satisfaction questionnaire (Q-les-Q), work and social adjustment scale (WSAS), depression
anxiety stress scale (DASS) questionnaire, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (DBAS)
questionnaire, multidimensional fatigue inventory questionnaire, and any other recognised
questionnaire known in the field.
[0104]        Typically the patient is assessed by one or more questionnaires prior to receiving
treatment and then at regular intervals (e.g. an interval of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 weeks) during
the course of treatment. The assessment during treatment may begin 2 weeks after
commencement of treatment.
[0105]        In some embodiments, the treatment may be maintained for up to 14 days, for
example, the treatment may be maintained for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 days.
In some embodiments, the treatment is maintained for longer than 14 days, for example, for 3
                                                                              10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                  - 22
weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 months or longer.
[0106]        Typically, the pharmaceutical composition is administered once daily preferably a
short time before the patient attempts to sleep. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical
composition is administered within about 2 hours of the patient attempting to sleep, for example,
within about 1.5 hours, within about 1 hour or within about 30 minutes prior to sleep.
[0107]        In some embodiments, the administration is sublingual administration. In such
embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be presented as sublingual drops.
[0108]        In some embodiments, the insomnia may be assessed by measuring one or more
objective measures of sleep. Objective measures of sleep may be measured by
polysomnography (PSG) and/or actigraphy. The objective measures of sleep may include
measuring: Sleep Onset Latency (SO); Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO); Total Sleep Time
(TST); Sleep Efficiency (SE); REM versus NREM sleep patterns including slow-wave sleep
patterns and percentage of time in all sleep stages; sleep apnea; periodic limb movements; and
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a method of treating insomnia may provide an
improvement in one or more objective measures of sleep, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of
the objective measures of sleep.
[0109]        The patient in need of therapy for insomnia may be any patient suffering from
insomnia, for example, as assessed by ISI. However, in some embodiments, not all patients
may be suitable. For example, in some embodiments, a patient who satisfies one or more of the
following factors may be excluded:
a.      Untreated cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias (other than well controlled atrial
        fibrillation), hypertension or severe heart failure: or
b.      History of allergies particularly to plant-based products containing terpenes. ie flavours
        and aromatic natural oils for example citrus, mango, lavender, thyme, cedarwood and

        opioids, benzodiazepines) for at least one week prior to treatment: or
f.      Inability to refrain from use of Cytochrome P450 inhibitors for at least one week prior to
        treatment. Examples include macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin), azole
        antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), protease inhibitors
                                                                        10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

 [0110]      The method may also comprise administering an active agent other than the
 Cannabis extract. This active agent may be administered simultaneously or consecutively with
the Cannabis extract. By consecutively it is meant that each of the Cannabis extract and the
other active agent are administered separately and may be at different times. Typically, when
the Cannabis extract and the other active agent are administered consecutively they are
administered within 24 hours, or within 12, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 hour(s) of each other. The
 Cannabis extract may be administered before or after the other active agent. Further, the route
of administration for the Cannabis extract and the other active agent may be the same or
different.

Limonene levels were low e.g. < 0.2%.
THCV was at low levels (< 0.5%).
[0117]      The formulation was completed using sunflower oil as the carrier oil.
Example 2 - A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Sublingual Cannabinoid Based Medicine
Extract Compared with Placebo for the Treatment of Sleep Disorders Due to Insomnia.
[0118]      This study is a randomised double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study
evaluating the efficacy of a medicinal Cannabis extract containing THC for improving sleep in
people with insomnia. Efficacy is evaluated using subjective sleep quality measures using the
standard Insomnia Severity Index, objective measures of sleep determined using PSG and
actigraphy, and subjective measures of sleep outcome and quality of life using daily sleep diary
and standard questionnaires for quality of life, mood, stress, anxiety, fatigue including
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Dysfunctional Belief About Sleep (DBAS),
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI).
[0119]      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a sublingual cannabinoid
extract (composition 1 of the present invention) containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC)
for improving sleep in people with insomnia.
[0120]      The secondary aim is to evaluate sleep quality and quality of life improvements in
people with insomnia when using composition 1 of the present invention as compared with a
placebo. A further secondary aim is to determine patient safety of composition 1 as measured
by incidence of adverse events during course of the study.
[0121]      Composition 1 comprises delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) 20 mg/ml, cannabinol
(CBN) 2 mg/ml and cannabidiol (CBD) 1 mg/ml as an extract of Cannabis plant with excipient
sunflower oil. The sunflower oil is used as the excipient to stabilise the formulation including the
cannabinoids and as a diluent of the plant extract.
[0122]      Each dose is delivered sublingually with 0.5 ml cannabinoid extract (THC 10 mg,
CBN 1 mg and CBD 0.5 mg).
[0123]      Participants (between ages 25 and 70 years of age) male or female with chronic
insomnia will be screened on Day 1 of the study.
                                                                         10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

[0124]       Each qualifying subject admitted into the study meets all of the inclusion and none of
the exclusion criteria. 24 participants are enrolled in the study. This study is conducted over 9
12 months. The study requires participants to spend 3 overnight stays in clinic at The University
of Western Australia, Centre for Sleep Science. Participants will be required to take the
Investigational Product for 2 weeks and placebo for 2 weeks at home.
[0125]       This study conforms to the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human
Research and meets the relevant requirements of the ICH Note for Guidance on Good Clinical
Practice (CPMP/ICH-1 35/95) and the TGA.
[0126]       Unless the context requires otherwise, all percentages referred to herein are
percentages by weight of the pharmaceutical composition. Similarly, unless the context requires
otherwise, all ratios referred to herein are ratios by weight.
[0127]       Various features of the invention are described and/or claimed with reference to a
certain value, or range of values. These values are intended to relate to the results of the
various appropriate measurement techniques, and therefore should be interpreted as including
a margin of error inherent in any particular measurement technique. Some of the values referred
to herein are denoted by the term "about" to at least in part account for this variability. The term
"about", when used to describe a value, preferably means an amount within ±25%, ±10%, ±5%,
±1% or ±0.1% of that value.
[0128]       Various values are described in terms of their percentage relative to the total weight
of (i) the pharmaceutical composition, (ii) Cannabis extract or (iii) fraction of the extract (e.g. the
cannabinoid fraction or the terpene fraction). The percentages of components included in the
Cannabis extract or a fraction thereof (e.g. the cannabinoid fraction or terpene fraction) are
intended to denote the percentage by weight of the specified compound relative to the
percentage by weight of the other compounds present in the extract or specified fraction, for
example, absent the carriers, diluents, adjuvants and excipients or any combination thereof. For
example, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis extract comprising a terpene
fraction in an amount of at least 3% by weight of the extract is intended to denote a
pharmaceutical composition wherein the cumulative weight of terpenes and terpenoids is 3% by
weight or more when compared to the cumulative weight of compounds present in the extract
including cannabinoids, terpenes, terpenoids and extractant/residual extractant. Further, a
Cannabis extract comprising THC in an amount of about 85% by weight of the cannabinoid
                                                                          10385918_1 (GHMatters) P106152.AU.2 19/06/18

                                                   - 27
fraction is intended to denote an extract comprising THC in an amount of 85% by weight relative
to the cumulative weight of all cannabinoids present in the extract.
[0129]        The terms "a", "an", "and" and/or "the" and similar referents in the context of
describing the invention and the claims which follow are to be construed to cover both the
singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
[0130]        It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common
general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
[0131]        In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention, except
where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the
word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of
further features in various embodiments of the invention.

Claims
1.   A pharmaceutical composition comprising a Cannabis extract and optionally one or more
     pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients or any combination
     thereof, the Cannabis extract comprising a cannabinoid fraction comprising
     A 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), and Cannabinol (CBN) and a
     terpene fraction in an amount of at least 3% by weight of the extract.
2.   Use of a Cannabis extract in the preparation of a medicament for treating a sleep
     disorder, wherein the Cannabis extract comprises a cannabinoid fraction comprising
     A-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabinol (CBN) and a terpene
     fraction in an amount of at least 3% by weight of the extract.
3.   The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 or the use of claim 2, wherein the cannabinoid
     fraction comprises THC, CBD and CBN in one or more of the following ratios:
           a. the ratio of THC to CBD is from about 10:1 to about 50:1;
            b. the ratio of THC to CBN is from about 5:1 to about 20:1; and
           c. the ratio of CBD to CBN is from about 1:1 to about 10:1.
