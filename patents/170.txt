[038] Figure 3 illustrates a perspective view of the stand 100, in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 3, the stand 100 comprises a cable holding
assembly 300 to hold a cable, for example, a cable of an electrical tool such as an electrical
drill used at the construction site. One end of the cable is connected to the electrical tool, and
another end of the cable has a plug, which is plugged into the switchboard for power supply.
The cable holding assembly 300 comprises a first support bar 305 and a first cable holding
means 310. The first support bar 305 is an elongated structure and the first cable holding
means 310 extends from the first support bar 305 to hold a cable. Particularly, the first cable
holding means 310 is a U-shaped bar such that the cable can be held in the U-shaped bar.
The first cable holding means 310 is able to hold the cable in the air such that the cable does
not disturb the worker working near the construction site, for example, causing the worker to

                                                  8
fall over.. Further, a V-shaped and/or W-shaped or any other shapes of the first holding
means 310 can also be used to hold the cable in the air. In accordance with an embodiment
of the invention, the material of the cable holding assembly 300 has non-conducting
properties. In another embodiment, a non-conducting paint and/ or coating may be applied to
the cable holding assembly 300, particularly, the first cable holding means 310.
[039] The stand 100 further includes a first connection means 315 configured to adjustably
connect the first support bar 305 of the cable holding assembly 300 to the first support arm
102, namely, the first angle iron structure 102. Particularly, the first connection means 315
allows adjusting the height of the cable holding assembly 300, i.e. the distance from the top
of the cable holding assembly 300 to the ground. As a result, the cable holding assembly 300
may be raised to a desired height such that the cable does not disturb the worker working at
the construction site. The first support bar 305 of the cable holding assembly 300 includes a
third angle iron structure. The third angle iron structure has an L-shaped cross-section with a
first leg and a second leg. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the two legs
may be equal or unequal in length and the angle between two legs is about 90 degrees. Each
of the first leg and the second leg of the third angle iron structure has a length of 20 mm and a
thickness of 3 mm. The first support bar 305 is also referred to as the third angle iron
structure 305. The third angle iron structure 305 is adapted to be mounted onto the first angle
iron structure 102 using first pair of holding members 250 and the first connection means
305.
[040]     Further, the first pair of holding members 250 and the two legs (the first leg 205 and
the second leg 210) of the first angle iron structure 102 are configured to be able to surround
the third angle iron structure 305 of the cable holding assembly 300 when the third angle iron
structure 305 is positioned between the first pair of holding members 250 and the two legs
(the first leg 205 and the second leg 210) of the first angle iron structure 102. For example,
when assembling the stand 100, the third angle iron structure 305 is slid along the first angle
iron structure 102 such that the third angle iron structure 305 is held between the first pair of
holding members 250 and the two legs (the first leg 205 and the second leg 210) of the first
angle iron structure 102. The position to which the third angle iron structure 305 is slid along
the first angle iron structure 102 can be changed in order to adjust the height of the cable
holding assembly 300, i.e., the distance from the top of the cable holding assembly 300 to the
ground. In an embodiment, to connect the third angle iron structure 305 of the cable holding

                                                  9
assembly 300 to the first angle iron structure 102, the first connection means 315 of the cable
holding assembly 300 is a first location bolt. The first location bolt is configured to engage
with the third end connection hole 245 via the threads on the first location bolt and the third
end connection hole 245. As the first location bolt is rotated in a direction manually or by a
torque wrench, the first location bolt extends through the third connection hole 245 and
firmly presses the third angle iron structure 305 of the cable holding assembly 300 against the
first pair of holding members 250 of the first angle iron structure 102. As a result, the first
location bolt connects the third angle iron structure 305 to the first angle iron structure 102 at
a certain height. If the height of the cable holding assembly 300 needs to be changed, the first
connection means 315 (particularly, the first location bolt) is rotated in an opposite direction
in order to detach the third angle iron structure 305 from the first angle iron structure 102.
Then the third angle iron structure 305 is moved along the first angle iron structure 102 to a
different position, resulting in an adjusted height of the cable holding assembly 300,. and can
be connected to the first angle iron structure 102 by the first location bolt at the adjusted
height. This way, the first location bolt is able to adjustably connect the third angle iron
structure 305 of the cable holding assembly 300 to the first angle iron structure 102. In
accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the first connection means 315 is an eye
bolt. Further, other types of bolts may also be used such as, but not limited to, triangular head
handle bolts, circular head bolts, pigtail bolts, T-bolts etc.
[041] Figure 4 illustrates a perspective view of the stand 100, in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 4, the stand 100 further comprises a lamp
installation assembly 400. The lamp holding assembly 400 includes a second support bar 405
and a lamp installation means 410. The lamp installation assembly 400 is generally an
elongated structure and capable of holding a lamp (not shown in Fig. 4), which allows fixing
a lighting lamp to illuminate the area around the stand 100.
[042] The lamp installation assembly 400 includes a second support bar 405 and a lamp
installation means 410. As shown in Fig. 4, the lamp installation means 410 extends from the
second support bar 405 such that lamp can be mounted on the lamp installation means 410.
The second support bar 405 of the lamp installation assembly 400 includes a fourth angle iron
structure. The fourth angle iron structure has an L shaped cross-section with a first leg and a
second leg. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the two legs may be equal
or unequal in length and the angle between two legs is about 90 degrees. Each of the first leg

                                                 10
and the second leg of the fourth angle iron structure has a length of 20 mm and a thickness of
3 mm. The second support bar 405 is also referred to as the fourth angle structure 405.
[043] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the lamp installation means 410
is a straight bar with at least one hole such that the lamp can be installed on the straight bar
via at least one bolt through the at least one hole. However, the stand 100 further includes a
second connection means 415 configured to adjustably connect the second support bar 405 to
the second support arm 104, namely, the second angle iron structure 104.
[044] As shown in Fig. 4 the second angle iron structure 104 includes the second pair of
holding members 260. The second pair of holding member and the two legs of the second
angle iron structure surround the fourth angle iron structure 405 of the lamp installation
assembly 400. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the second connection means 415 of the
stand 100 is a second location bolt. Similar to the first location bolt, the second location bolt
is configured to engage with the fourth end connection hole 255 via the threads on the second
location bolt and the fourth end connection hole 255. As the second location bolt is rotated
manually or by a torque wrench, the second location bolt extends through the fourth end
connection hole 255 and firmly presses the fourth angle iron structure 405 of the lamp
installation assembly 400 against the second pair of holding members 260 of the second angle
iron structure 104. This way, similar to the first location bolt and the first pair of holding
members 250, the second location bolt adjustably connects the fourth angle iron structure 405
of the lamp installation assembly 400 to the second angle iron structure 102. The second
location bolt is an eye bolts. Further, other types of bolts may also be use such as, but not
limited to, triangular head handle bolt, circular head bolts,. pigtail bolts, T- bolt etc.
[045] Figure 5 illustrates a perspective view of the stand 100, in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 5, the first beam 106 includes a first pair
of connection holes 510, 520, such that the first beam 106 detachably connects to the first end
1022 of the first angle iron structure 102 and the first end 1042 of the second angle iron
structure 104 via a first connection bolt 505 and a second connection bolt 515.            The first
connection bolt 505 extends through the first end connection hole 225 of first angle iron
structure 102 and one (i.e., the connection hole 510) of the first pair of connection holes of
the first beam 106. The second connection bolt 515 extends through the second end
connection hole 230 of the second angle iron structure 104 and another one (i.e., the
connection hole 520) of the first pair of connection holes of the first beam 106. The first

                                                 11
connection bolt 505 and second connection bolt 515 are hexagonal head bolts with washers.
Moreover, the hexagonal head bolt includes a nut to fasten the first beam 106 with the stand
100. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the first connection bolt 505 and
second connection bolt 515 is one of, but not limited to, T-bolts, hex-socket bolts and
elevator bolts. Further, any other types of fastening means can also be used to detachably
connect the first beam 106 to the first angle iron structure 102 and the second angle iron
structure 104.
[046] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the second beam 108 further
includes a cable winding means 525. The cable winding means 525 extends from a first
position 530 on the second beam 108 and ends at a second position 535 on the second beam
108. As described above, the cable is held by the cable holding means 310 (particularly, the
U-shaped bar) of the cable holding assembly 300 in the air and extends down to the cable
winding means 525. The cable can be wound around the cable winding means 525 between
the first position 530 and the second position 535. Therefore, the cable will not become
tangled and the plug on the other end of the cable can be easily accessed and plugged into the
switchboard. Moreover, the cable winding means 525 of the second beam 108 is covered by
an electrical insulation material. This is to avoid an electric shock if there is an electric
current flowing through the cable winding means 525 due to a worn or torn cable, thus
providing a safety feature to the stand 100.
[047] Further, the second beam 108 includes a second pair of connection holes 540, 541,
such that the second beam 108 detachably connects the first angle iron structure 102 and the
second angle iron structure 102 via a third connection bolt 545 and a fourth connection bolt
550. The third connection bolt 545 extends through the first middle connection hole 235 of
the first angle iron structure 102 and one (i.e., the connection hole 540) of the second pair of
connection holes of the second beam 108. The fourth connection bolt 550 extends through the
second middle connection hole 240 of the second angle iron structure 104 and another one
(i.e., the connection hole 541) of the second pair of connection holes of the second beam 108.
[048] Coming back to Figure 1. As shown in figure 1, the first support foot 110 includes a
fifth angle iron structure and the second support foot 112 includes a sixth angle iron structure.
Further, each of the fifth angle iron structure and the sixth angle iron structure has an L
shaped cross-section with two legs. The two legs may be equal or unequal in length and the

                                                12
angle between two legs is about 90 degrees. Each of the two legs has a length of 40 mm and a
thickness between 3mm and 5mm.
[049] As described above, angle iron structures are used to make the stand 100. However, in
other embodiments of the invention, other metallic structure such as rods, bars, channels may
also be used.
[050] As described above, since the connections between the parts of the stand 100 are
detachable, when the stand 100 is used, a user only needs to assemble these parts to form the
stand 100 as shown in the figures. If the stand 100 is not in use, the stand 100 can be
disassembled into the parts, this allows the parts of the stand 100 to be stored and transported
separately. Further, the selected specifications of the angle iron structures provide the stand
100 with sufficient strength to perform their respective functions and also make the stand 100
lightweight.
