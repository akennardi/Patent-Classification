                     Multi-row sugarcane harvester feed section
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
                           of performing it known to me/us:-

                                    Field of the Disclosure
[001]     The present disclosure relates to a multi-row sugarcane harvester, and,
more particularly, to a feed section therefor.
                                Background of the Disclosure
[002]     A sugarcane harvester comprises a feed section for feeding a severed mat
of sugarcane from a basecutter to a chopping section where the sugarcane stalk is
cut into segments called "billets." The feed section has a plurality of feed rollers for
feeding the mat toward the chopping section.
                                 Summary of the Disclosure
[003]     According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a feed section for a multi
row sugarcane harvester is disclosed. The harvester is configured to harvest a first
row of sugarcane and a second row of sugarcane simultaneously. The feed section
comprises a first feed train configured to advance a first mat of sugarcane received
from the first row of sugarcane, a second feed train configured to advance a second
mat of sugarcane received from the second row of sugarcane, and a third feed train.
The first and second feed trains merge into the third feed train. The third feed train is
configured to advance the first and second mats received respectively from the first
and second feed trains. Each of the first feed train and the second feed train
comprises a first feed roller and a second feed roller. Each of the first and second
feed rollers has an axis of rotation. With respect to the first feed train, the axes of
rotation of the first and second feed rollers are positioned at different acute angles
relative to a fore-aft axis of the feed section. The axes of rotation of the first and
second feed rollers of the second feed train may also be positioned at different acute
angles relative to the fore-aft axis. It is to be understood that the feed section may
be configured for use with two or more rows of sugarcane.
[004]     According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in one or both of the
first and second feed trains, the axis of rotation of the first feed roller forms an acute
angle relative to the fore-aft axis, and the axis of rotation of the second feed roller is
positioned downstream from the first feed roller in a feed direction toward the third
feed train and forms a more acute angle relative to the fore-aft axis, promoting a
smooth transition of the sugarcane mat(s) toward the third feed train.

                            Detailed Description of the Drawings
[013]     Referring to FIG. 1, a multi-row sugarcane harvester 10 is configured to
harvest a first row 12 of sugarcane and a second row 12 of sugarcane
simultaneously. The harvester 10 is configured to process the harvested sugarcane
into billets.
[014]     The harvester 10 has a fore-aft axis 14 and comprises an inlet section 15 for
each row 12. Each inlet section 15 comprises relative to the fore-aft axis 14 a
laterally outer crop divider scroll 16 and a laterally inner crop divider scroll 16. The
scrolls 16 are configured to lift sugarcane stalks before being severed. The

harvester 10 may also comprise a separator scroll (not shown) for each row 12
laterally outward from the respective scroll 16, such separator scroll being configured
to separate an adjacent row of uncut sugarcane from the respective row to be cut.
[015]     Each inlet section 15 comprises a set 18 of knockdown rollers and a
basecutter 20. Each set 18 comprises an upper knockdown roller (not shown) and a
lower knockdown roller 24 (FIG. 2). The set 18 is positioned ahead of the basecutter
20 and configured to lean the sugarcane over enough to expose the base of the stalk
to the basecutter 20. Each basecutter 20 comprises a pair of counter-rotating cutting
disks driven by a motor (e.g., hydraulic motor shown, for example, in FIG. 2) and
comprising knives spaced about their periphery. The cutting disks cooperate with
one another to sever the sugarcane stalk at the base thereof near the ground. The
harvester 10 may comprise a single topper (not shown) for both rows 12 or one
topper (not shown) for each row 12 to cut off leafy material from the sugarcane
before engagement with the knockdown roller sets 18.
[016]    The harvester 10 comprises a feed section 26, a chopping section 28, a
primary extractor 30, an elevator 32, and, in some embodiments, a secondary
extractor 34. The feed section 26 is configured to receive from each basecutter 20 a
mat of severed sugarcane and to feed the mats rearwardly and merge them into a
single mat. The chopping section 28 is configured to receive the merged mat from
the feed section 26 and cut the sugarcane stalk into billets. The primary extractor 30
is positioned downstream from the chopping section 28 and is configured to separate
crop residue (e.g., leafy material) from the billets and remove that crop residue from
the harvester 10. The elevator 32 is positioned at the rear of the harvester 10 to
receive the cleaned flow of billets and is configured to convey the billets to an
elevated position where they are discharged into a wagon to be hauled away. The
secondary extractor 34 (if present) is positioned near the top of the elevator 32 and
is configured to separate further crop residue from the billets and remove the crop
residue from the harvester 10.
[017]    The harvester 10 comprises an operator's station (not shown) and traction
elements (not shown). A human operator can operate the harvester 10 from an
operator's station. The traction elements are positioned on opposite sides of the
harvester 10 for engaging the ground and propelling the harvester 10. Each traction
element may be, for example, a track unit or a ground-engaging wheel (e.g., one

track unit on each side of the left and right sides of the harvester 10).
[018]     Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the feed section 26 comprises a first feed train
38, a second feed train 40, and a third feed train 42. The first feed train 38 is
configured to advance a first mat of sugarcane received from the first row 12 of
sugarcane in a first feed direction toward the third feed train 42. The first basecutter
20 is configured to sever the first mat, and the first feed train 38 is configured to
receive the severed first mat from the first basecutter 20 into a mouth of the first feed
train 38 such that the first basecutter 20 is positioned between the first set 18 of
knockdown rollers and the mouth of the first feed train 38. The second feed train 40
is configured to advance a second mat of sugarcane received from the second row
12 of sugarcane in a second feed direction toward the third feed train 42. The
second basecutter 20 is configured to sever the second mat, and the second feed
train 40 is configured to receive the severed second mat from the second basecutter
20 into a mouth of the second feed train 40 such that the second basecutter 20 is
positioned between the second set 18 of knockdown rollers and the mouth of the
second feed train 40. The first and second feed trains 38, 40 merge into the third
feed train 42. The third feed train 42 is configured to advance the first and second
mats received respectively from the first and second feed trains 38, 40 to the
chopping section 28.
[019]    The harvester 10 comprises a frame 44, a first frame 47, and a second
frame 48. The frame 44 is, for example, the main frame of the harvester 10. The
first and second frames 47, 48 are coupled pivotally to the frame 44 for pivotal
movement about a pivot axis 50 in response to operation of respective actuators
(e.g., hydraulic cylinders).
[020]     Each of the first frame 47 and the second frame 48 comprises a frame inlet
portion 52 included in the respective inlet section 15 and a frame feed portion 54
included in the respective feed train 38, 40. Mounted to the frame inlet portion 52
are a respective basecutter 20 and a respective lower knockdown roller 24. The
basecutter 20 and the lower knockdown roller 24 are mounted to (e.g., bolted) and
between a first side wall 56 of the frame inlet portion 52 and a second side wall 58 of
the frame inlet portion 52. The basecutter 20 and the lower knockdown roller 24 are
mounted to the frame inlet portion 52 in that their axes of rotation are stationary
relative thereto.

[021]    The frame inlet portion 52 is coupled to the frame feed portion 54. The first
and second side walls 56, 58 are fixed (e.g., bolted) to the feed portion 54.
[022]     Referring to FIG. 4, the frame feed portions 54 are coupled pivotally to the
frame 44. The frame feed portions 54 are coupled pivotally to the frame 44 laterally
outwardly at a respective side pivot joint 60 (e.g., pinned joint) and a common center
pivot joint 62 (e.g., pinned joint). The basecutter 20 is thus coupled to the frame 44
for pivotal movement about the pivot axis 50 in response to operation of the
respective actuator such that the basecutter 20 may be raised or lowered to
accommodate row profile variation in order to sever the sugarcane at its base. In
other embodiments, the first and second frames 47, 48 are fixed to the frame 44, and
may thus be formed as part of the frame 44.
[023]     Referring to FIG. 3, a beam 64 is fixed to the center pivot joint 62 and the
housing of a drive axle 66 to transmit load from the joint 62 to the axle 66, the
housing of which is fixed to the frame 44. The center pivot joint 62 comprises a
frame side included in the frame 44. The beam 64 is fixed (e.g., bolted) to the frame
side of the joint 62. The beam 64 is curved to pass under the third feed train 42.
[024]     Referring back to FIGS. 2 and 3, the feed section 26 comprises feed rollers
68 driven to advance the sugarcane to the chopping section 28. The feed rollers 68
in each feed train 38, 40, 42 are arranged in an upper rank 70 of feed rollers 68 and
a lower rank 72 of feed rollers 68. Each of the first and second feed trains 38, 40
comprises, for example, four feed rollers 68 in each rank 70, 72, and the third feed
train 42 comprises, for example, three feed rollers 68 in the upper rank 70 and four
feed rollers 68 in the lower rank 72.
[025]     Each feed roller 68 has an axis of rotation 74 about which the feed roller 68
is rotatable. Each feed roller 68 is driven to rotate about its axis 74 by a respective
motor, which is a hydraulic motor, although in other embodiments it could take the
form of, for example, an electric motor or other suitable drive device.
[026]     Each feed roller 68 is mounted to one of the frames 44, 47, 48. With respect
to each of the first and second feed trains 38, 40, the first three feed rollers 68 of
each of the upper rank 70 and the lower rank 72 (starting from the front near the
respective basecutter 20) are mounted to the respective frame 47, 48 so as to pivot
therewith about the pivot axis 50, and the fourth feed rollers 68 of each of the upper
rank 70 and the lower rank 72 (i.e., the feed rollers 68 closest to the third feed train

42) are mounted to the frame 44 so as not to pivot about the pivot axis 50. With
respect to the third feed train 42, the feed rollers 68 of the upper rank 70 and the
lower rank 72 are mounted to the frame 44 so as not to pivot about the pivot axis 50.
[027]     The feed rollers 68 of the lower rank 72 are mounted to the respective frame
44, 47, 48 such that their axes of rotation 74 are stationary relative to that frame 44,
47, 48. The feed rollers 68 of the upper rank 40 are pivotally coupled to the
respective frame 44, 47, 48 in order to pivot about a respective pivot axis relative to
that frame 44, 47, 48 in response to the size of the mat passing between the upper
and lower ranks 70, 72. The feed rollers 68 of the upper rank 70 are biased by
gravity to assume their lowest position within their pivot range, and to pivot upwardly
in response to larger mat sizes. As such, the axes of rotation 74 of the feed rollers
68 of the upper rank 70 are pivotable relative to the respective frame 44, 47, 48.
[028]     Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, illustratively the first and second feed trains 38,
40 are symmetrical relative to the fore-aft axis 14. The fore-aft axis 14 is, for
example, a fore-aft axis and centerline of the harvester 10 and the feed section 26.
[029]     Referring momentarily to FIGS. 2 and 3, with respect to each of the first and
second feed trains 38, 40, each feed roller 68 of the upper rank 70 is paired with a
feed roller 68 of the lower rank 72. The axes of rotation 74 of the feed rollers 68 of a
given pair of feed rollers 68 are positioned at the same angle relative to the fore-aft
axis 14.
[030]     Referring again to FIGS. 5 and 6, the first and second feed trains 38, 40
illustratively exhibit a progressive angling of axes 74 relative to the fore-aft axis 14 in
the respective feed direction 45, 46 toward the third feed train 42. Such progressive
angling promotes a smooth transition of the sugarcane mats toward the third feed
train 42 so as to reduce the potential for sugarcane damage and losses that might
result from an abrupt transition due to an extreme angle between axes of rotation of
adjacent pairs of feed rollers. Instead, the angle difference between the axes 74 of
the first pair of feed rollers 68 and the axes 74 of the final pair of feed rollers 68 is
spread across a number of feed roller pairs. The axes of rotation 74 of the first pair
of feed rollers 68 (closest to the respective basecutter 20) are, for example,
perpendicular to the fore-aft axis. The other pairs of feed rollers 68 are positioned
downstream from the first pair of feed rollers 68 in the respective feed direction 45,
46 toward the third feed train 42.

[031]     With respect to the other pairs of feed rollers 68 in the first and second feed
trains 38, 40, the axes of rotation 74 are positioned at different acute angles relative
to the fore-aft axis 14. Illustratively, the axes of rotation 74 of the pairs of feed rollers
68 are progressively acutely angled relative to the fore-aft axis 14 in the respective
feed direction 45, 46 toward the third feed train 42. As such, the axes of rotation 74
form angles of increasing acuteness relative to the fore-aft axis 14 in the respective
feed direction 45, 46.
[032]     With respect to the third feed train 42, the feed rollers 68 are centered on the
fore-aft axis. The axes of rotation 74 of the feed rollers 68 are perpendicular to the
fore-aft axis 14.
[033]     The configuration of the feed rollers 68 may vary depending, for example, on
the position of a given feed roller 68 within the feed section 26. The feed rollers 68
of the first and second feed trains 38, 40 may be configured in a variety of ways to
shift the first and second mats of sugarcane toward the third feed train 42, including,
for example, vertical, spiraled, and tapered feed rollers 68.
[034]     The feed rollers 68 of the upper rank 70 of the first and second feed trains
38, 40 are similar to one another in configuration, and the feed rollers 68 of the upper
rank 70 of the third feed train 42 are similar to one another in configuration.
[035]     With respect to the feed rollers 68 of the upper rank 70 and the first feed
roller 68 of the lower rank 72 of the third feed train 42 (the one positioned
immediately adjacent to a junction 76 at which the first and second feed trains 38, 40
merge into the third feed train 42), the feed roller 68 comprises axial rows of teeth
spaced circumferentially evenly about a drum of the feed roller 68 (the roller 68
comprising a single drum), each row of teeth formed as a linear plate of teeth
mounted to the drum (e.g., welded). With respect to each feed roller 68 of the upper
rank 70, the profile of the radial height of the peaks of the teeth relative to the
respective axis 74 ("tooth height profile") is uniform. Each axial row of teeth is
configured to have the uniform tooth height profile of the respective feed roller 68 of
the upper rank 70.
[036]     With respect to the first feed roller 68 of the lower rank 72 of the third feed
train 42, the feed roller 68 radially bulges axially centrally relative to its axis of
rotation 74. For example, the tooth height profile radially bulges axially centrally
relative to the axis 74. Each axial row of teeth is configured to have such a tooth

height profile.
[037]     With respect to the feed rollers of the lower rank 72 of the first and second
feed trains 38, 40, each feed roller 68 comprises two coaxial drums 44 spaced along
the respective axis 74 so as to be positioned at opposite end portions of the feed
roller 68. The first feed roller 68 of the lower rank 72 of each of the first and second
feed trains 38, 40 is called a butt lifter because it is configured to lift the sugarcane
severed by the respective basecutter 20 into the mouth of the respective feed train
38, 40, the mouth defined between the butt lifter and the first feed roller 68 of the
upper rank 70 of the respective feed train 38, 40. The butt lifter comprises a number
of bars (e.g., four) spaced evenly about and mounted to the two drums (e.g.,
welded).
[038]     With respect to the other feed rollers 68 of the lower rank 72 of the first and
second feed trains 38, 40, the feed rollers 68 taper along their respective axes of
rotation 74 in laterally opposite directions relative to the fore-aft axis 14 to guide the
respective mat of sugarcane to the third feed train 42. Each of the second and third
feed rollers 68 (the two intermediate feed rollers 68 between the butt lifter and the
fourth feed roller 68) tapers along its axis of rotation 74 laterally inwardly relative to
the fore-aft axis 74. The fourth feed roller 68 is positioned downstream from the butt
lifter and the second and third feed rollers 68 in the respective feed direction 45, 46
and tapers along its axis of rotation 74 laterally outwardly relative to the fore-aft axis.
[039]     Such tapering is achieved, for example, by the tooth height profile of the
respective feed roller 68 of the lower rank 72 of the first and second feed trains 38,
40. Each feed roller 68 comprises a number of mounting plates mounted to the two
drums 44 (e.g., welded). In an example, each feed roller 68 comprises a first
mounting plate, a second mounting plate, and a third mounting plate, the second and
third mounting plates similar to one another in configuration and smaller than the first
mounting plate. The first, second, and third mounting plates are spaced
circumferentially evenly about the two drums and the axis 74. The first mounting
plate comprises along its midline three slots arranged along the axis 42 of the feed
roller 68. Each of the second and third mounting plates comprises three tabs, each
of which is received in a respective one of the slots, such that each of the second
and third mounting plates is fixed to the first mounting plate (and one another)
between the two drums (e.g., welded with tab-and-slot joints). The feed roller 68

also comprises a number of axial rows of teeth (e.g., four), each row of teeth formed
as a linear plate of teeth mounted (e.g., bolted) to the first, second, or third mounting
plate. Two of the axial rows of teeth are mounted to diametrically opposite sides of
the first mounting plate, and the other two axial rows of teeth are mounted
respectively to the second mounting plate and the third mounting plate. The tooth
height profile of the second and third feed rollers 68 tapers along the respective axis
of rotation 74 laterally inwardly relative to the fore-aft axis 14, and the tooth height
profile of the fourth feed roller 68 tapers along the respective axis of rotation 74
laterally outwardly relative to the fore-aft axis 14. Each axial row of teeth is
configured to have the tooth height profile of the respective feed roller 68.
[040]     With respect to the second, third, and fourth feed rollers 68 of the lower rank
72 of the third feed train 42, the feed rollers 68 are similar to one another in
configuration. Each feed roller 68 comprises two coaxial drums 44 spaced along the
respective axis 74 so as to be positioned at opposite end portions of the feed roller
68, and comprises a number of axial rows of teeth (e.g., four) spaced
circumferentially evenly about the two drums, each row of teeth included in a linear
plate mounted to the two drums (e.g., welded). In an example, each feed roller 68
comprises a first linear plate comprising two diametrically opposite axial rows of
teeth, a second linear plate comprising an axial row of teeth, and a third linear plate
comprising an axial row of teeth diametrically opposite to the axial row of teeth of the
second linear plate. The first linear plate comprises along its midline three slots
arranged along the axis 74 of the feed roller 68. Each of the second and third plates
comprises three tabs, each of which is received in a respective one of the slots, such
that each of the second and third linear plates is fixed to the first linear plate (and
one another) between the drums (e.g., welded with tab-and-slot joints). The tooth
height profile of each feed roller 68 is uniform. Each axial row of teeth is configured
to have the uniform tooth height profile.
[041]     Referring to FIG. 6, the lower rank 70 of the third feed train 42 comprises a
number of vanes. With respect to the first feed roller 68, an annular vane is aligned
with the fore-aft axis 14, each linear plate of teeth of that feed roller 68 passing
through a respective slot in the vane such that the vane is centrally mounted to the
feed roller 68 (e.g., welded to the drum and the linear plates of teeth at the slots).
That vane helps to spread the sugarcane laterally relative to the fore-aft axis 14 by

preventing bunching of the mats, and may help to guide the sugarcane from the third
feed train 42 back to the first and second feed trains 38, 40 during a reverse
operation (e.g., in the case of a stall).
[042]     With respect to the second feed roller 68 of the third feed train, there are a
first pair of semi-circular vanes mounted (e.g., welded) to a first side of the first linear
plate and a second pair of semi-circular vanes mounted (e.g., welded) to an opposite
second side of the first linear plate. The second linear plate passes through and is
coupled (e.g., welded) to a slot in the vanes of the first pair, and the third linear plate
passes through and is coupled (e.g., welded) to a slot in the vanes of the second
pair. Each vane has two tabs that fit within and are mounted (e.g., welded) to a
respective slot in the first linear plate. The vanes of the second feed roller 68 are
angled relative to the fore-aft axis 14. The vanes of the third feed roller 68 of the
third feed train 42 are similar to the vanes of the second feed roller 68 of the third
feed train 42, except that the vanes of the third feed roller 68 are angled so as to
have an opposite sense to that of the vanes of the second feed roller 68. The vanes
of the second and third feed rollers 68 help to spread the sugarcane laterally relative
to the fore-aft axis 14.
[043]     The harvester 10 and its feed section 26 may be configured for use with two
or more rows 12 of sugarcane. While the feed section 26 of the illustrated
embodiment is configured for use with two rows 12, it is to be understood that that
this is a non-limiting example of a multi-row feed section for a multi-row sugarcane
harvester. The feed section 26 may comprise one or more additional feed trains for
one or more additional rows 12. For example, the feed section 26 may comprise a
fourth feed train configured for use with a third row 12 and positioned laterally
between the first and second feed trains 38, 40, such that the first and second feed
trains 38, 40 and the fourth feed train merge into the third feed train 42 (with the first,
second, and third feed trains 38, 40, 42 modified accordingly).
