                              SPRINKLER WITH BRAKE ASSEMBLY
                                              FIELD
[00011          This invention relates to irrigation sprinklers and, more particularly, to rotary
sprinklers.
                                         BACKGROUND
100021          There are many different types of sprinkler constructions used for irrigation
purposes, including impact or impulse drive sprinklers, motor driven sprinklers, and rotating
reaction drive sprinklers. Included in the category of rotating reaction drive sprinklers are a
species of sprinklers known as spinner or a rotary sprinklers which are often used in the
irrigation of agricultural crops and orchards. Typically, such spinner type sprinklers comprise a
stationary support structure or frame which is adapted to be coupled with a supply of pressurized
water, and a rotatable deflector supported by the frame for rotation about a generally vertical
axis. Most rotary type sprinklers employ either a rotating reaction drive nozzle or a fixed nozzle
which ejects a stream of water vertically onto a rotating deflector. The deflector redirects the
stream into a generally horizontal spray and the deflector is rotated by a reaction force created by
the impinging stream from the fixed nozzle.
100031          One shortcoming that has been encountered with rotary-type sprinklers is that due
to a very high rate of rotation of the rotary devices, the distance the water is thrown from the
sprinkler may be substantially reduced. This has created a need to control or regulate the
rotational speed of the deflector and thereby also regulate the speed at which the water streams
are swept over the surrounding terrain area. A relatively slow deflector rotational speed is
desired to maximize throw-distance, and therefore a variety of brake devices have been
developed to accomplish this end.
[00041          In one approach, a viscous brake device is used to control rotation of the
deflector. The viscous brake device utilizes drag produced by rotation of a brake rotor within a
viscous fluid.   While suitable for some sprinklers, the viscous brake device may not provide
constant rotation speed when the ambient temperature or supply pressure changes.
[00051          Another shortcoming encountered with rotary-type sprinklers is that the sprinklers
have frame supports that interfere with the water stream after it has been redirected by the
                                                -I -

deflector. There have been a number of attempts to minimize this interference including utilizing
supports with different cross-sectional shapes. However, even with these approaches, the water
stream still impacts the supports every time the deflector completes a rotation. 'This produces a
reduced, but still present, shadow in the spray pattern of the sprinkler.
[00061          Yet another shortcoming of some prior rotary-type sprinklers is the serviceability
of the sprinkler. Rotary-type sprinklers often have two typical types of failures that require the
sprinkler to be removed from the water supply in order to be fixed.          The first type of failure
occurs when the nozzle becomes plugged with debris from the water supply.                    For some
sprinklers, the nozzle is installed from the underside of the sprinkler such that the sprinkler needs
to be removed from the water supply in order to remove and clean the nozzle. The second type
of failure occurs when the deflector of the sprinkler stops rotating or spins out of control. In this
case, the braking system has failed and the entire sprinkler will be replaced.
[00071          Some prior sprinklers utilize viscous braking to control the rotational speed of the
deflectors of the sprinklers. One problem with this approach is that the viscosity of the working
fluid changes inversely with temperature.     As a result, the deflector rotates faster as temperature
increases, and slower as the temperature decreases. This change in rotational speed may
negatively affect the area that is covered by the sprinkler, or it may cause the deflector to stall
during low temperature conditions when coupled with low pressure operation.

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00861          With reference to FIGS. 1-5, an improved rotary sprinkler 10 is provided having a
fitting 12 for connecting to a standpipe or other fluid supply conduit, such as by using threads 13.
The sprinkler 10 has a frame 14 with an upper portion 16 and a lower portion 18 connected to the
fitting 12. A spinner assembly 15 is connected to the frame upper portion 16 and a nozzle 20 is
                                                  -51-

removably connected to a socket 21 defined by the frame lower potion 18. In one approach, the
nozzle 20 is secured to the frame 14 by a pair of releasable connections 23 and can be replaced
with another nozzle 20 having flow characteristics desired for a particular application. Fluid
travels through the fitting 12, into the nozzle 20, and is discharged from the nozzle 20 as a jet.
The spinner assembly 15 includes a deflector 22 disposed above the nozzle 20 which receives the
jet of fluid from the nozzle 20. The spinner assembly 15 further includes a brake device 24
removably coupled to the frame tipper portion 16 and configured to limit the rate of rotation of
the deflector 22.     The brake device 24 is secured to the frame 14 with a pair of releasable
 connections 25. It should be noted that although the sprinkler 10 is illustrated as being disposed
 in an upright position, the sprinkler can also be mounted in, for example, an inverted position.
 [00871         The frame 14 comprises a pair of horizontal lower support mrnembers 26 extending
radially from opposite sides of the nozzle socket 21. A pair of upper support members 28 are
 attached in a similar manner to the upper portion 16 as those attached to the lower portion 18.
The support members 26 outwardly terminate at arms or supports 29 of the frame 14. The upper
portion 16 has a yoke 27 with opening 30 defined by a wall 32 of the yoke 27, as shown in FIG.
 5. The brake device 24 is disposed within the opening 30 and is supported by the support
members 28. Preferably, the upper and lower portions 16 and 18, members 26 and 28, and
 supports 29 forming the frame 14 are formed as a single unit, such as by molding the frame 14
 from a suitable plastic material. Although the frame 14 is illustrated with two supports 29, the
 frame 14 may alternatively have one, three, four, or more supports 29 as desired.
 [00881         Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the fitting 12 defines an inlet 34 through which fluid
 flows into the sprinkler 10. The inlet 34 leads to an opening 36 of the nozzle 20 defined by a
nozzle inner wall 38. The nozzle inner wall 38 has a tapered configuration that decreases in
thickness until reaching an upstream lip 37 of the nozzle 20. The fitting 12 includes a cup
portion 41 with a tapered surface 43 that is inclined relative to the longitudinal axis 52 of the
 sprinkler 10. During assembly, the upstream lip 37 of the nozzle 20 is advanced in direction 45
 into nozzle socket 21 until the upstream lip 37 engages the tapered surface 43 (see FIGS. 5 and
 6). This engagement causes the fitting tapered surface 43 to slightly compress the upstream lip
 37, which provides a positive leak-proof seal between the nozzle 20 and the fitting 12.
 [00891         The nozzle 20 has a nozzle body 40 that houses a nozzle portion 42, defining a
 fluid passageway 44 through the nozzle portion 42, and terminating at a nozzle exit 46. The
                                                  -6-

nozzle portion 42 increases the speed of the fluid as it travels through the passageway 44. The
fluid leaves the nozzle 20 through the exit 46 as a jet and travels into an inlet opening 47 of the
deflector 22 and along a channel 48 of the deflector 22, before exiting the deflector 22 through a
deflector outlet opening 50.       The exiting fluid causes the deflector 22 to rotate about a
longitudinal axis 52 of the sprinkler 10 and disperses the fluid outward from the sprinkler 10, as
discussed in greater detail below.
[00901          Referring to FIGS. 5-15., the brake device 24 connects the deflector 22 to the
frame 14 and permits rotational and vertical movement of the deflector 22 within an opening 14a
of the frame 14. The brake device 24 utilizes friction between surfaces to restrict and control the
rate of rotation of the deflector 22. More specifically, the brake device 24 is formed as a self
contained module which is releasably and removably attached to the frame 14 so that the brake
device 24 can be easily replaced. The brake device 24 is top serviceable and can be removed
from above the sprinkler 10 while the frame 14 and lower end fitting 12 remain connected to the
fluid supply. This simplifies maintenance of the sprinkler 10 and permits the brake device 24 to
be easily removed from the frame 14, such as if the brake device 24 locks up and prevents
rotation of the deflector 22 or if the brake device fails and permits the deflector 22 to spin out of
control, Another advantage provided by the brake device 24 is that the deflector 22 can be easily
replaced or serviced by removing the brake device 24 from the frame 14, Further, the removable
brake device 24 provides access to the nozzle 20 for removal and maintenance, such as cleaning
the nozzle 20.
[0091]          The brake device 24 includes a housing cap 54, a brake member 56, a brake plate
58, a brake shaft 60, and a base member 62, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 7. The cap 54 has a body
63 with a sleeve 64 extending longitudinally downward and defining a recess 66 for receiving
components of the brake device 24, shown in FIGS. 7-8a. Inside of the recess 66, the cap 54 has
a lower cap surface 67, a groove 68, and a blind bore 70. The brake device 24 and frame upper
portion 16 have interlocking portions that permit the brake device 24 to be releasably secured to
the upper portion 16. In one form, the interlocking portions form a bayonet-style connection
between the brake device 24 and the frame upper portion 16. The interlocking portions include a
pair tabs 72 depending from opposite sides of the body 63, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 8. The tabs
72 have a protrusion 74 and a detent 76 that engage corresponding features of the frame 14.
Referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, a pair of coupling members 122 are disposed on opposite sides of

the upper portion 16 of the frame 14. Each coupling member 122 has a recess 124 and an
opening 126 adapted to frictionally engage the detent 76 and protrusion 74, respectively, of the
brake device 24 and restrict turning and longitudinal movement of the brake device 24 relative to
the frame upper portion 16.
[00921          To connect the brake device 24 to the frame 14, a distal end 77 of the cap 54 (see
FIG. 5) is advanced into the frame opening 30, with the cap 54 rotationally positioned about the
axis 52 so the depending tabs 25 do not pass over the coupling members 122, but are instead
positioned laterally to the coupling members 122. Wien the protrusions 74 of the brake device
24 are axially aligned with the openings 126 of the coupling members 122, the cap 54 and tabs
72 thereof are turned in direction 130 to a locked position, which causes the protrusion 74 to
slide into the opening 126 (see FIGS. 1 and 19). The detents 76 cam over the coupling members
 122, which causes the tabs 72 to bias outward, and engage the recesses 124. The biasing action
produces a reaction force that maintains the detents 76 in the recesses 124 against unintentional
dislodgement. The opening 126 has walls 126A, 126B that engage the protrusion 74 and restrict
longitudinal movement of the brake device 24 along the axis 52.          Further, the brake device
detents 76 have convex outer surfaces 76A that engage complimentary concave surfaces 124A of
the frame recesses 124 (see FIGS. 8A and 19). The engagement between the detents 76 and the
recesses 124 restricts rotary movement of the tabs 72 away from the locked position. The cap
54, restricted from rotary or longitudinal displacement, is thereby releasably secured to the frame
 14. To disengage the brake device 24 from the frame 14, the cap 54 is turned in direction 132
which unseats the detents 76 from the recesses 124 and disengages the brake device tabs 72 from
the frame coupling members 122 (see FIG. 1).
100931           With reference to FIGS. 5 and 19, the nozzle 20 is releasably coupled to the lower
portion 18 of the frame 14 with interlocking portions of the nozzle 20 and the frame nozzle
socket 21. In one form, the interlocking portions of the nozzle 20 and the nozzle socket 21 are
similar to the releasable connection of the brake device 24 to the frame upper portion 14. Further,
the nozzle 20 is connected to the nozzle socket 21 in a manner similar to the process of installing
the brake device 24 on the frame upper portion 16.          The nozzle 20 has a collar 140 with
depending tabs 142 configured to engage coupling members 144 disposed on an outer wall 146
of the nozzle socket 21 (see FIGS. 2 and 19).
                                                -8-

100941           As shown in FIG. 2, the deflector 22 is positioned above and closely approximate
the nozzle 20. The brake device 24 may be disengaged from the frame 14 (and the deflector 22
moved upwardly) to provide clearance for removal of the nozzle 20. It will be appreciated that
both the brake device 24 and the nozzle 20 are top serviceable and can be removed without
removing the sprinkler 10 from the fluid supply.
[0095]           The sprinkler 10 may be configured to receive different nozzles 20 having a
variety of flow rates, etc. for a desired sprinkler application. 'The collar 140 and depending tabs
 142 are similar between the different nozzles 20 in order to permit the different nozzles 20 to be
releasably engaged with the nozzle socket coupling member 144.
[0096]           The brake assembly 24 includes a brake member 56 and a clamping device, such
as a brake plate 58 and a brake surface 67, which clamp the brake member 56 and slow the
rotation of the deflector 22 as shown in FIG. 7. The brake plate 58 is positioned below the brake
member 56 and is coupled to a shaft 60 which carries the deflector 22 such that the brake plate
58 turns with rotation of the deflector 22. The brake surface 67 is disposed on an underside of
the cap 24 (on an opposite side of the brake member 56 from the brake plate 58) and is stationary
relative to the rotating brake member 56. As discussed in greater detail below, fluid striking the
deflector 22 rotates the deflector 22 and brake plate 58, shifts the brake plate 58 upward, and
compresses the brake member 56 between the brake plate 58 and the brake surface 67. This
produces frictional resistance to turning of the deflector 22.
[0097]           The brake member 56 may be conically shaped and defined by a lower friction
surface 78 and an upper friction surface 80 (see FIGS. 7, 10, 11). The surfaces 78 and 80 each
have grooves 82 extending radially outward from a central opening 84 (which receives the shaft
60 therethrough), with each groove 82 having an inner recess 86 and an outer recess 88 as shown
in FIGS. 9 and 10. The grooves 82 may function to direct dirt and debris that become lodged
between the brake member 56, brake plate 58, and brake surface 67 radially outward and away
from the shaft 60.     This operation inhibits the dirt and debris from gumming up the rotation of
brake plate 58 (and deflector 22 connected thereto). In one approach, a lubricant such as grease
may be used within the brake assembly 24 to increase the ease with which the deflector 22 can
rotate. In this approach the grooves 82 serve to trap excess grease that could affect the frictional
quality of the contact surfaces.

100981          With reference to FIG. 10A. another brake member 56A is shown. The brake
member 56A is substantially similar to the brake member 56 and includes upper and lower
friction surfaces 80A, 78A with grooves 82A thereon. 'The brake member 56A, however, is flat
rather than the conical shape of brake member 56.
[00991          With reference to FIGS. 5, 7, 12, and 13, the brake plate 58 has an tipper plate
portion 90 with a friction surface 91 for engaging the brake member 56 and a socket 92
extending longitudinally downward from the plate portion 90. The socket 92 has a hexagonal
shaped opening 94 and a through-opening 96 for receiving the shaft 60 therethrough. Referring
to FIGS. 5 and 7, the shaft 60 has an upper portion 98, a lower portion 100, a hexagonal collar
 102, and splines 104 of the lower portion 100. The upper portion 60 resides within the openings
84 and 96 of the brake member 56 and the brake plate 58, respectively. The socket 92 has a
mating, hexagonal configuration to engage the shaft hexagonal collar 102 and restrict rotary
movement therebetween.      An upper surface 102A of the collar 102 faces a bottom 92A of the
socket 92, so that upward, longitudinal movement of the shaft 60 engages the upper surface
 102A of the shaft collar 102 with the socket bottom 92A and shifts the brake plate 58 upward.
[001001         The shaft 60 has a lower end portion 100 sized to fit within a recess 105 of the
deflector 22. The shaft lower end portion 100 has splines 104 that engage cooperating splines in
the recess 105. The interengagement of the splines keeps the deflector 22 mounted on the shaft
lower end portion 100 and restricts relative rotary motion of the deflector 22 about the shaft
lower end portion 100. In another approach, the recess 105 has a smooth bore and the shaft
lower end portion 100 is press-fit therein.
1001011         Referring now to FIGS. 7, 14, and 15, the brake base 62 has resilient tabs 112 that
releasably connect the brake base 62 within the brake cap 54.          The resilient tabs 112 are
upstanding from a disc 110 and include protuberances 114 which bear against an internal surface
54A of the brake cap 54 (see FIG. 8) and deflect the tabs 112 radially inward as the base 62 is
inserted into the cap 54 and the tabs 112 are advanced into the brake cap recess 66.           The
protuberances 114 snap into the groove 68 of the brake cap 54 to secure the brake base 62 within
the brake cap 54.
[001021         In another approach, the brake base 62 may be ultrasonically welded or adhered to
the brake cap 54 rather than utilizing resilient tabs 112. In yet another approach, the brake base
62 may be permanently connected to the brake cap 54 using structures that make disassembly
                                                - 10-

nearly impossible without damaging the sprinkler 10. For example, the resilient tabs 112 could
have protuberances 114 with sharp profiles that permit the tabs 112 to snap into brake cap 54 in
an insertion direction but require deformation of the protuberances 114 in a reverse direction.
[001031          With the brake base 62 mounted within the brake cap 54, the brake base 62 is
secured to the frame 14 during operation of the sprinkler 10. The brake base 62 has a sleeve 108
with a through opening 106 sized to receive the shaft 60, as shown in FIGS. 7, 14, 15. The
sleeve 108 permits both rotational and longitudinal movement of the sleeve 108 within the
opening 108. Further, the sleeve has an tipper end 108A which contacts the bottom of the shaft
collar 102 and restricts downward longitudinal movement of the shaft 60 beyond a
predetermined position, as shown in FIG. 7. The sleeve upper end 108A functions as a lower
stop for the shaft 60.
[001041         Referring to FIGS. 16-18, the channel 48 of the deflector 22 may have an open
configuration with an opening 48A extending along a side of the channel 48. The channel 48 has
walls 118 on opposite sides of the channel 48, with one of the walls l l8A having an axially
inclined surface 116 to direct the flow of fluid through the deflector 22 and the other wall I I 8B
having a ramp 120 that directs the flow tangentially from the outlet 50 of the deflector 22. As a
result of water flow through the channel 48 and against the ramp 120, a reaction force tangent to
the axis of rotation 52 of the deflector 22 is created, causing the deflector 22 and the attached
shaft 60 to rotate relative to the frame 14 in direction 150 (see FIGS. I and 21).
[00105]         The channel 48 also has a curved surface 122 that redirects an axial flow of fluid
from the nozzle 20 into a flow travelling radially outward from the deflector 22.       The inclined
surface 116 directs the fluid flow towards the wall 1 18B as the fluid travels along the curved
surface 122. The inclined surface 116 and the curved surface 122 operate to direct fluid toward
the ramp 120 and cause the fluid to exit the deflector outlet 50 at a predetermined angle
sufficient to cause the deflector 22 to turn.       The shape of the surfaces of the channel 48,
including surfaces 116, 120, and 122, can be modified as desired to provide a desired, uniform
fluid stream as it leaves the deflector 22. It will be appreciated that the channel 48 can have one,
two, three, or more flat surfaces, as well as other features such as one or more grooves, in order
to achieve a desired fluid distribution uniformity from the deflector 22.
[00106]         With reference to FIGS. 37-39, a deflector 500 is shown having an inner channel
502, steps 504, and grooves 506 extending along an interior surface of the channel 502. The
                                                 - 11 -

grooves 506 near the upper end (as viewed in FIG. 37) direct the upper portion of the fluid flow
to provide far-field watering 508 while the steps 504 near the lower end direct the lower portion
of the fluid flow to provide near-field watering 510. The deflector 500 can be used with the
sprinkler 10. and is generally shown in operation in FIG. 39. By directing the upper portion of
the flow farther, the deflector 500 restricts the upper portion of the flow from pushing the lower
portion of the flow downward.        This functions to increase the throw distance and spray
uniformity of the sprinkler 520.
[001071         When fluid travels into the deflector 22 from the nozzle 20, the fluid strikes the
curved surface 122 and shifts the deflector 22 and shaft 60 connected thereto upward through a
short stroke. The upward movement of the shaft 60 shifts the upper friction surface 91 (see
FIG. 5) of the brake plate 58 into engagement with the lower friction surface 78 of the brake
member 56. The brake member 56 is also shifted axially upwardly through a short stroke
sufficient to move the upper friction surface 80 of the brake member 56 (see FIG. 7) into
engagement with the brake surface 67 of the cap 54. With this arrangement, the brake member
56 is axially sandwiched between the rotatably driven brake plate 58 and the nonrotating brake
surface 67. The brake member 56 frictionally resists and slows the rotational speed of the brake
plate 58 and the deflector 22 connected to it.
[00108]         The higher the fluid flow through the nozzle 20, the greater the impact force of
the fluid against the curved surface 122 of the deflector 22. This translates into a greater upward
force being exerted on the deflector 22 and shaft 60 and brake plate 58 connected thereto. As the
fluid flow increases, this upward force causes the brake member 56 to gradually flatten out and
bring a larger portion 160 of the brake member friction surface 80 into engagement with the cap
brake surface 67, as shown in FIG. 7. Further, flattening out of the brake member 56 also causes
a larger portion 162 of the brake member lower friction surface 78 to engage the brake plate 58.
Thus, rather than the deflector 22 spinning faster with increased fluid flow from the nozzle 20,
the brake device 24 applies an increasing braking force to resist the increased reaction force on
the deflector ramp 120 from the increased fluid flow.
1001091         The flat brake member 56A provides a similar increase in braking force with
increased impact force of the fluid against the curved surface 122 of the deflector 22. More
specifically, the frictional engagement between the brake upper frictional surface 80A, the brake
surface 67, and the brake member 58 is increased with an increase in fluid flow against the
                                                - 12 -

curved surface 122 (see FIG. 7). This increase occurs because frictional force is a function of the
force applied in a direction normal to the friction surface 67, with the normal force in this case
resulting from the impact of fluid against the curved surface 122 of the deflector 22.
[00110]          With reference to FIG. 21, the sprinkler 10 has additional features that improve
efficiency of the sprinkler 10.     In one form, the sprinkler 10 has supports 29 with an airfoil
shaped cross section that minimizes the shadow created by the supports 29 in the spray pattern of
the sprinkler 10. More specifically, the supports 29 have a leading end portion 170, an enlarged
intermediate portion 172, and a tapered trailing end portion 174. The leading and trailing end
portions 172, 174 gradually divert fluid flow 169 from the deflector 22 around the supports 29
and cause the fluid flow 169 to re-join near the trailing end 174.        The fluid flow 169 then
continues radially outward from the supports 29 substantially uninterrupted by the presence of
the supports 29, which reduces the shadow of the supports 29 over conventional sprinklers.
[001111          The supports 29 have cross-sectional midlines 180 that are oriented at an angle
 182 relative to a radius 184 of the sprinkler 10. As shown in FIG. 21, fluid 169 travels outwardly
from the deflector 22 tangentially to the deflector outlet opening 50 due to the fluid 169 striking
the ramp 120.      The support midlines 180 are oriented substantially parallel to this tangential
direction of fluid travel, which causes the fluid 169 traveling outward from the deflector outlet
opening 50 to contact the leading end portion 170 head-on. This maximizes the ability of the
support cross-section to redirect flow 169 around the support 29 and rejoin the flow 169 once it
reaches the trailing end portion 174.
[00112]          The components of the sprinkler 10 are generally selected to provide sufficient
strength and durability for a particular sprinkler application. For example, the brake shaft 60
may be made of stainless steel, the brake member 56 may be made of an elastomeric material,
and the remaining components of the sprinkler 10 may be made out of plastic.
1001131          With reference to FIGS. 22 and 23, a sprinkler 200 is shown that is similar to the
sprinkler 10. The sprinkler 200, however, has a nozzle 210 integrally formed with a frame 212
of the sprinkler 200, rather than the removable nozzle 20 of the sprinkler 10. The sprinkler 200
may cost less to manufacture and be desirable over the sprinkler 10 in certain applications, such
as when a removable nozzle 20 is not needed.
[001141          With reference to FIGS. 24-29, another sprinkler 300 is shown. 'The sprinkler 300
is similar in many respects to the sprinkler 10 such that differences between the two will be
                                                 - 13 -

highlighted.    One difference is that the sprinkler 300 includes a body 302 having a base portion
304 rotatably mounted on a nozzle 306, a support portion 308 to which a spinner assembly 310 is
connected, and arms 312 connecting the base potion 304 to the support portion 308. The body
302 and spinner assembly 310 can thereby rotate relative to the nozzle 304 during use., whereas
the frame 14 and spinner assembly 15 of sprinkler 10 are generally stationary during use.
Because the body 300 can rotate about the nozzle 306, fluid flow from a deflector 320 of the
spinner assembly 310 strikes the arms 312 and causes the body 302 to rotate incrementally a
short distance about the nozzle 306. This incremental rotation of body 302 moves the arms 312
to a different position each time the deflector 320 travels by the arms 312 which continually
moves the spray shadow produced by the arms 312. In this manner, the sprinkler 300 has an
uninterrupted spray pattern over time.
[001151         More specifically, the body base portion 304 includes a collar 330 with an
opening 332 sized to fit over a neck 334 of a retention member such as a nut 336.          During
assembly, the collar 330 is slid onto the neck 334 and the neck 334 is threaded onto an
upstanding outer wall 340 of the nozzle 306. The nut 336 has a flange 342 and a sleeve 344 that
capture the collar 330 on the nozzle 306 between the flange 342 and a support 350 of the nozzle
306. Further, the nut 336 has wings 354 that may be grasped and used to tighten the nut 336
onto the nozzle 306.
[00116]         The collar 330 has internal teeth 351 with grooves 353 therebetween and the neck
334 of the nut 336 has a smooth outer surface 355. When the body 302 rotates relative to the nut
336 and the nozzle 306, the teeth 351 slide about the outer surface 355. The grooves 353 direct
dirt and debris caught between the body 302 and the nut 336 downward and outward from the
connection between the body 302 and the nut 336. This keeps dirt and debris from gumming up
the connection and keeps the body 302 rotatable on the nut 336.
1001171          With reference to FIGS. 28 and 28A, the spinner assembly 310 includes a brake
device 360 releasably connected to the body support portion 308 in a manner similar to the brake
device 24 and frame upper portion 16. However, the brake device 360 includes a cap 362 with
depending tabs 364 having different coupling features than the tabs 72.        The tabs 364 have
rounded members 370 that engage coupling members 371 of the body support portion 308 and
restrict longitudinal and rotational movement of the brake device cap 362. More specifically, the
tab rounded member 370 has an inclined outer surface 372 that is rotated into engagement with
                                                - 14 -

inclined surface 374 of the coupling member 371, in a manner similar to turning the brake cap 54
to lock the cap 54 to the frame upper portion 16. The tab rounded member 370 also has a convex
surface 376 which engages a concave surface 378 of the coupling member 371. The engagement
of the surfaces 372, 374 and 376, 378 restricts rotary and longitudinal movement of the cap 362
away from its locked position. However, it will be appreciated that the sprinkler 300 could
alternatively utilize the locking mechanisms of sprinkler 10.
[001181         Another difference between the sprinklers 10, 300 is that the sprinkler 300 has
arms 312 with cross-sections shaped to produce rotary movement of the arms 312 in response to
fluid striking the arms 312. With reference to FIG. 29, water flow 380 from the deflector 320
travels toward an inner portion of the arm 312, strikes a curved intermediate surface 384, and is
redirected outward from an outer portion 386 of the arm 312. The impact of the water flow 380
against the curved surface 384 imparts a force offset from the radial direction which creates a
torque on the arm 312 and the body 302. This torque advances the body 312 in direction 390,
which is generally opposite the direction of rotation of the deflector 320.
[001191         It will be appreciated that the fluid stream 380 strikes the arm 312 only
momentarily before the rotation of the deflector 320 moves the fluid stream 380 out of alignment
with the arm 312. Eventually, the fluid stream 380 strikes the other arm and a similar torque is
applied to further incrementally rotate the body 302 and arms 312.          Thus, the deflector 320
moves at a generally constant speed (due at least in part to brake assembly 360) in direction 392
while the body 302 and arms 312 rotate intermittently and incrementally in direction 390 when
the fluid stream 380 contacts either one of the arms 312.
1001201         With reference to FIGS. .30-36, a sprinkler 1000 is shown that is similar in a
number of ways to the sprinkler 300 of FIGS. 24-29. The sprinkler 1000 has a nozzle 1002 with
a lower threaded portion 1004 for mounting to a water supply line and an upper threaded portion
 1006 for engaging a retention member such as a nipple 1008.            The nozzle 1002 has two
protuberances 1010, 1012 that can be used to hand tighten/loosen the sprinkler 1000.
1001211         The sprinkler 1000 is different from the sprinkler 300 in that the sprinkler 1000
has a rotator 1020 with a stationary deflector 1022 mounted thereon. The sprinkler includes a
snap-in feature 1023 that releasably connects the deflector 1022 to the rotator 1020. The
deflector 1022 diverts a jet of water from the nozzle 1002 and redirects it at two angles. One
angle turns the stream from vertical to horizontal and spreads the jet for even watering. As
                                                - 15 -

discussed below, redirecting the stream imparts a vertical force to the deflector 1022 which
causes the rotator 1020 to compress a brake 1032 and slow rotation of the rotator 1020. The
deflector 1022 imparts a second angle channels the jet of water sideways creating a moment arm
about an axis of rotation 1033 causing the rotator 1020 to turn clockwise (as viewed from above
the sprinkler 1000). The shapes and configurations of the nozzle 1002 and deflector 1022 can be
varied to produce different throw distances and volumes.
[001221        The nipple 1008 has clips 1030 that are configured to permit the brake 1032 and
the rotator 1020 to be pressed onto the nipple 1008. However, once the brake 1032 and the
rotator 1020 are mounted on the nipple 1008, the clips 1030 restrict the brake 1032 and the
rotator 1020 from sliding off of the nipple 1008 even if the nozzle 1002 has been removed from
the nipple 1008.
[00123]        The brake 1032 is a compactable rubber dual-contact O-ring which when
compressed will result in an increased frictional force which keeps the rotator 1020 from rotating
ever faster. When water from the nozzle 1002 strikes the deflector 1022, the impact force from
the water shifts the rotator 1020 away from the nozzle 1002 and causes the rotator 1020 to
compress the brake 1032 between brake surfaces 1040, 1042 of the rotator 1020 and nipple 1008.
[00124]        The rotator 1020 has a collar 1050 with internal teeth 1052 that slide along a
smooth outer surface 1054 of the nipple 1008. The teeth 1052 direct dirt and other debris along
grooves 1056 between teeth 1052 and outward from the connection between the rotator 1020 and
the nipple 1008.    This reduces the likelihood of the sprinkler 1000 stalling due to debris
gumming up the connection between the rotator 1020 and the nipple 1008.
1001251        With reference to FIGS. 40-47, a sprinkler 1200 having a brake assembly 1202
that is responsive to environmental conditions is shown. The sprinkler 1200 is substantially
similar to the sprinkler 10 discussed above such that differences between the two will be
highlighted. The brake assembly 1202 has a cap 1204 that forms a sealed chamber 1210 in
conjunction with a brake base member 1212, as shown in FIG. 47. The chamber 1210 houses a
fluid 1214 and a brake shaft 1216 connected to a deflector 1218 of the sprinkler 1200. The
chamber 1210 can include a seal between the brake shaft 1216 and a shaft bearing surface 1213
of the brake base member 1212 to seal the fluid 1214 within the chamber 1210, as shown in
FIG. 47.
                                               - 16-

1001261          With reference to FIG. 41, the cap 1204 is removed to show a brake rotor 1230 of
the brake assembly 1202. The brake rotor 1230 includes a reactive brake device 1232 that is
configured to change the braking force applied to the deflector brake shaft 1216 in response to
changes to the environment in which the sprinkler 1200 is located. For example, the reactive
brake device 1232 may include a bi-material coil 1240 that has two sheets of material laminated
together. With reference to FIG. 46, a cross-section of the coil 1240 is shown. The coil 1240
includes an active component 1250 having a higher coefficient of thermal expansion and a
passive component 1252 having a lower coefficient of thermal expansion. As the environmental
temperature increases, the active component 1250 expands more than the passive component
 1252 such that the coil 1240 expands.
[001271          With reference to FIGS. 41 and 42, the coil 1240 has a fixed end 1260 engaged in
a slot of the brake shaft 1216, such as by welding, and a free end 1262 disposed radially outward
from the fixed end 1260. With reference to FIGS 41 and 42, the coil 1240 is shown in a fully
contracted position at a low environmental temperature where the sections of the coil 1240 are in
a tightly wrapped orientation around each other. With reference to FIGS. 43 and 44, the coil
 1240 is shown in a fully expanded configuration at an elevated temperature. When the coil 1240
is in the expanded configuration, the winds of the coil 1240 are spaced apart by larger gaps 1270
th an when the coil 1240 is at the low temperature.
[00128]          The change in the coil 1240 from the fully contracted to the fully expanded
configuration increases the resistant torque generated by the coil 1240 as the coil 1240 rotates
within the fluid 1214. More specifically, the resistant torque generated by the expanded coil
 1240 is higher than the torque generated by the contracted coil. This increase in torque tends to
offset the decrease in the viscosity of the fluid 1214 due to the increase in environmental
temperature. Thus, the coil 1240 can provide a more consistent torque and resulting speed of
rotation of the deflector 1218 despite changes in the temperature of the surrounding environment.
1001291          Another impact of the change in the shape of the coil 1240 from the contracted
expanded configuration is that the fully expanded coil has a larger moment of inertia than the
contracted coil 1240. Stated differently, the coil 1240 is more difficult to turn when it is fully
expanded than when it is fully contracted. This increase in the moment of inertia also helps to
offset the decrease in viscosity of the fluid 1214 due to elevated environmental temperatures.
                                                - 17 -

1001301         With reference to FIGS. 46 and 47, the fluid 1214 may be a silicone-based grease
of a desired viscosity. For the active component 1250, metals or metal alloys with a high
coefficient of thermal expansion may be used including non-ferrous metals such a copper, brass,
aluminum, or nickel. For the passive component 1252, ferrous alloy such as stainless steel may
be used.
[001311         With reference to FIG. 48, another reactive brake device 1290 is shown including
a coil 1292 having a fixed end 1294 connected to the brake shaft 1216. The coil 1292 is similar
to the coil 1240, except that the coil 1292 has a relaxed configuration (see FIG. 48) and a
stressed configuration (see FIG. 49) where the coil 1292 has an undulating shape.              The
undulating profile of the coil 1292 when the coil 1292 is in the stressed configuration increases
the drag of the coil 1292 through the fluid 1214 in the brake chamber 1210.
[001321         With reference to FIGS. 50 and 51, another reactive brake device 1300 is shown.
The reactive brake device 1300 includes a beam 1302 extending radially outward from the brake
shaft 1216 when the reactive brake device 1300 is at a low environmental temperature.
Increasing the temperature, however, causes the beam 1302 to bend, as shown in FIG. 51. The
bent beam 1302 produces a higher amount of drag as the beam 1302 travels in direction 1304
within the fluid 1214 in the chamber 1210.         Thus, the reactive brake device 1300 provides
another approach for compensating for the decrease in viscosity of the fluid 1214 as the
environmental temperature changes. Although only one beami 1302 is shown, the reactive brake
device 1300 could include one, two, three, or more beams 1302 depending on the amount of
resistance needed for a particular application.
1001331         With reference to FIG. 52, another coil 1400 is shown. The coil 1400 is similar to
the coil 1240 except that the coil 1400 has an outwardly projecting lip 1402 that can magnify the
resistant torque generated by the expanded coil 1400.
1001341         With reference to FIGS. 53-55, another brake assembly 1500 is shown. The brake
assembly 1500 may be releasably connected to a sprinkler frame, such as a frame 1203 (see
FIG. 40) in place of the brake assembly 1202.         The brake assembly 1500 includes a housing
 1502 having a chamber 1504 filled at least partially with a viscous fluid 1507 (see FIG. 54) and a
rotor 1506 disposed in the chamber 1504. In one form, the rotor 1506 has a drum shape, the
chamber 1504 is filled with the viscous fluid, and the drum-shaped rotor 1506 is completely
submerged in the viscous fluid within the chamber 1504. The viscous fluid 1507 may be grease
                                                - 18-

or another fluid having a viscosity in the range of approximately 450,000 cP) to approximately
970,000 cP). For example, the viscous fluid 1507 may be dampening grease having a viscosity in
the range of approximately 450,000 cP to approximately 550,000 cP. Companies like Nusil and
Shin-Etsu sell grease that may be used as viscous fluid 1507.
[001351          With reference to FIG. 53, the housing 1502 has a cap 1503 similar to the cap
 1204 (see FIG. 40), which encloses the chamber 1504 and includes depending tabs 1505 for
connecting to a sprinkler frame. However, an upper portion of the cap 1503 is not shown in
FIG. 53 in order to show the internal components of the brake assembly 1500. The cap 1204 in
FIG. 40 illustrates the upper portion of the cap 1503.      More specifically, the rotor 1506 is
connected to a shaft 1510 at one end of the shaft 1510, and a deflector 1512 is connected to an
opposite end of the shaft 1510. In response to the deflector 15 12 receiving fluid, the deflector
 1512 and shaft 1510 rotate which rotates the rotor 1506 in the chamber 1504. The viscous fluid
 1507 in the chamber 1504 produces drag on the rotor 1506, slowing the rotation of the rotor 1506
to produce a rotational velocity of the rotor 1506 generally within a predetermined range as the
fluid strikes the deflector 1512.
[001361          The brake assembly 1500 further includes a reactive brake device 1520 that, in
one form, includes bimetallic fins 1522 submerged at least partially in the viscous fluid 1507 of
the chamber 1504. The fins 1522 have free ends 1552 separated from the rotor 1506 by openings
or gaps 1524, as shown in FIG. 54, As the rotor 1506 turns in direction 1582 due to turning of
the deflector 1512, the viscous fluid 1507 in the chamber 1504 travels through the gaps 1524 in
direction 1580.
1001371          The fin free ends 1552 change position within the chamber 1504 in response to
changes in temperature of the bimetallic fins 1522, which changes the size of the gaps 1524
through which the viscous fluid 1507 travels. The changes in the temperature of the bimetallic
fins 1522 may be due to changes in ambient temperature in the environment about the brake
assembly 1500. The changes in ambient temperature may change the temperature of the viscous
fluid 1507 in which the bimetallic fins 1522 are at least partially submerged, which changes the
temperature of the fins 1522. Alternatively or in addition to the ambient temperature changes,
the temperature of the viscous fluid 1507 may change in response to rotation of the rotor 1506 in
the viscous fluid 1507 (e g., the friction of the rotor 1506 rotating in the fluid 1507 at a high
speed for a long period of time may increase the temperature of the fluid 1507). In some
                                               - 19-

approaches, changes in ambient temperature (and the associated changes in the temperature of
the fluid 1507) is the primary driver of temperature change in the bimetallic fins 1522 while
changes in the temperature of the fluid 1507 in response to rotation of the rotor 1506 in the fluid
 1507 contributes only slightly to temperature change of the fins 1522. In yet another approach, a
portion of the bimetallic fins 1522 may be exposed to the surrounding environment such that
changes in the ambient temperature directly change the temperature of the fins 1522 and the
positions of the fin free ends 1552.
[001381         With reference to FIG. 54, the viscous fluid 1507 in the chamber 1504 generally
travels in direction 1580 through the gaps 1524 along a path 1584 as the rotor 1506 rotates.
When the temperature of the bimetallic fins 1522 increases such as due to increased ambient
temperature, the free ends 1552 shift toward the rotor 1506 in direction 1525 which narrows the
gaps 1524 (as shown in the movement of the fins 1522 from their positions in FIG. 54 to their
positions in FIG. 55). This causes the viscous drag produced by the fluid 1507 in the narrowed
gaps 1524 to increase which compensates for the decreased viscosity of the viscous fluid 1507
due to the higher ambient temperature. When the temperature of the bimetallic fins 1522
decreases such as due to decreased ambient temperature, the free ends 1552 shift away from the
rotor 1506 in direction 1527 and toward a stator 1530 (see FIG. 53)) of the brake housing 1502
which widens the gaps 1524 (as shown in the movement of the fins 1522 from their positions in
FIG. 55 to their positions in FIG. 54). This causes the viscous drag produced by the fluid 1507
to decrease which compensates for the increased viscosity of the fluid 1507 due to the lower
ambient temperature,       The temperature-dependent movement of the bi-metallic fins 1522
therefore functions to maintain a more consistent rotational velocity of the rotor 1506 and
deflector 1512 connected thereto despite changes in ambient temperature.
1001391         With respect to FIG. 53, the brake housing 1502 includes pockets 1540 and
openings 1542 in the stator 1530 that open into the pockets 1540. Each fin 1522 has a curved
end 1544 rigidly mounted in a respective cylindrical pocket 1540. In one form, the fin curved
end 1544 is held tightly in the housing pocket 1540 by frictional engagement between the curved
end 1544 and the pocket 1540. In other approaches, the fin curved end 1544 may be secured in
the pocket 1540 using welds, fasteners, or adhesives, for example. In yet another approach, the
fin curved ends 1544 may be molded into the stator 1530 during molding of the housing 1502.
                                               - 20 -

1001401         Each fin 1522 extends outward from its respective pockets 1540 through the
opening 1542 and into the chamber 1504. Each fin 1522 has a base portion 1550 engaged with
the pocket 1540 and the fin free end portion 1552 is positioned in the brake housing chamber
 1504. The fins 1522 have a shape complimentary to the rotor 1506 such that the fins 1522 avoid
interfering with the rotor throughout the operating range of ambient temperatures experienced by
the sprinkler 1500.    For example, the fins 1522 may have concave inner surfaces 1560 with
curvatures similar to a convex outer surface 1562 of the rotor 1506, as shown in FIGS. 54
and 55.
[001411         The reactive brake device 1520 may have a variety of forms. For example, the
fins 1522 may be configured to move between a first position where the fin free end portions
 1552 are spaced from the rotor 1506 when the sprinkler 1500 is at a low ambient temperature
(similar to the position in FIG. 54) and a second position where the free end portions 1522 come
in close proximity or even directly contact the rotor 1506 to slow rotation of the rotor 1506 when
the sprinkler 1500 is at a high ambient temperature.
[001421         The brake housing stator 1530 positions the fins 1522 about the housing 1502 so
that there are openings 1590 between adjacent fins 1522 which open into slots 1592 between the
fins 1522 and the brake housing stator 1530, as shown in FIGS. 53 and 54. When the fin free
end portions 1552 shift toward the rotor 1506, the fins 1522 shift away from the housing stator
 1530 which draws fluid 1507 into the slots 1592 in direction 1594.        When the fin free end
portions 1552 shift away from the rotor 1506, the fins 1522 shift toward the housing stator 1530
which squeezes fluid 1507 outward from the slots 1592.
1001431         With reference to FIGS. 56-58, another sprinkler deflector 1600 is shown. The
deflector 1600 may be used with the brake assembly 1200 and the brake assembly 1500, for
example. The deflector 1600 includes an inlet 1602 for receiving fluid from a sprinkler nozzle
and an outlet 1604 for discharging the fluid outwardly from the sprinkler as the deflector 1600
rotates. The deflector 1600 includes a body 1606 having an outlet opening 1608 and a channel
 1620 that includes a duct 1610. The duct 1610 redirects a portion of the fluid received at the
inlet 1602 laterally from the deflector 1600 to cause rotation of the deflector 1600. The fluid
discharged from the duct 1610 additionally provides close-in and intermediate watering of the
surrounding terrain, as discussed in greater detail below.     The deflector 1600 discharges the
remaining fluid outward from the outlet opening 1608 with a spray pattern defined by the
                                               -21  -

channel 1620 and the outlet opening 1608. The fluid discharged from the outlet opening 1608
provides far-away watering of the surrounding terrain as defined by the configuration of the
channel 1620 and the outlet opening 1608.
[001441          With reference to FIGS. 57 and 58, the deflector channel 1620 has an inner
surface 1622 that redirects fluid received in a first direction 1624 toward a transverse second
direction 1626. The deflector channel 1620 maximizes the throw of the fluid outward from the
outlet opening 1608 by providing a smooth redirection of fluid flow within the deflector 1600.
Specifically, the channel inner surface 1622 is configured to minimize turbulence imparted to the
fluid stream as it travels from the inlet 1602 to the outlet opening 1608. The reduced turbulence
provided by the channel 1620 increases the efficiency of the re-redirection of the stream from
direction 1624 to direction 1626 and provides the maximized throw distance because less energy
in the fluid stream is lost to turbulence. This improved efficiency permits the sprinkler 1600 to
water a larger area of surrounding landscape with a smaller volume of fluid supplied to the
sprinkler than in some prior approaches.
[001451          With reference to FIG. 58, the duct 1610 includes an opening 1630 that permits
fluid to travel in direction 1632 into the duct 1610. With reference to FIGS. 56 and 58, the duct
 1610 further includes a close-in watering ramp 1640 and an intermediate watering rarnp 1642.
The duct 1610 siphons a portion of the fluid stream traveling between the inlet 1602 and the
outlet opening 1608 and the ramps 1640, 1642 redirect the portion of the fluid stream laterally
which widens the spray pattern of the deflector 1600 and permits the deflector 1600 to water a
greater range of locations about the sprinkler. More specifically, the ramps 1640, 1642 redirect
the fluid laterally which causes the fluid traveling along the ramps 1640, 1642 to travel
outwardly a shorter distance than fluid exiting the outlet opening 1608 and provides intermediate
and close-in watering from the deflector 1600. As shown in FIG. 58, the close-in watering ramp
 1640 curves laterally a greater amount than the intermediate watering ramp 1642. The greater
lateral curvature of the close-in watering ramp 1640 imparts a greater lateral redirection to the
fluid traveling along the ramp 1640 than the lateral redirection imparted by the ramp 1642. Thus,
the water exiting the duct 1610 along the ramp 1640 does not travel as far outward from the
deflector 1600 as does the water traveling along the intermediate watering ramp 1642.         The
deflector 1600 thereby provides close-in and intermediate watering by directing fluid along the
                                                - 22 -

ramps 1640, 1642. In this manner, the ramps 1640, 1642 and outlet opening 1608 provide
varying throw distances for the fluid exiting the deflector 1600.
[001461          Further, the portion of the fluid stream siphoned by the duct 1610 has a lower
velocity compared to the remainder of the fluid stream because the fluid stream portion was
traveling near a wall 1643 of the deflector 1600 before entering the duct 1610.          Due to the
viscosity of the fluid (which may be water), the fluid stream has a lower velocity near the wall
 1643 and a higher velocity away from the wall 1643. The lower initial velocity of fluid entering
the duct 1610 contributes to lower fluid velocities as the fluid exits the ramps 1640, 1642 than
the fluid exiting the outlet 1608 and reduces the throw distance of fluid exiting the ramps 1640,
 1642.
[001471          With reference to FIG. 59, another sprinkler 1700 is shown. The sprinkler 1700
includes a frame 1702 having an upper socket 1704 that receives a brake assembly 1706 and a
lower socket 1708 that receives a nozzle 1710. The sprinkler 1700 further includes a deflector
 1712 mounted on a shaft 1714 of the brake assembly 1706.             With reference to FIG. 60, the
deflector 1712 has an inlet 1750 for receiving fluid from the nozzle 1710, an outlet opening 1724
for discharging the fluid outward from the deflector 1712, and a channel 1720 connecting the
inlet 1750 to the outlet opening 1724. With reference to FIG. 62, the deflector 1712 includes a
funnel 1752_S  that functions to direct fluid from the nozzle 1710 into the channel 1720 of the
deflector 1712 and eventually outward from the outlet opening 1724.
[00148]          The channel 1720 has steps or ramps 1722 that function to impart different throw
distances and patterns to different portions of the water exiting the outlet opening 1724, as shown
in FIG. 61. The ramps 1722 provide a more even distribution of water from the outlet opening
 1724 to the surrounding landscape which improves efficiency by reducing overwatering or
underwatering of the surrounding landscape. The ramps 1722 include fan watering ramps 1730,
 1732 on opposite sides of the outlet opening 1734.         The close-in watering ramps 1730, 1732
cause the fluid exiting the opposite sides of the deflector opening 1734 to fan laterally outward
and provide even watering of the surrounding landscape. The ramps 1722 also include a primary
flow channel 1740 that directs fluid generally straight outward with a relatively small component
of tangential motion. Further, the ramps 1722 include an intermediate watering ramp 1742 that
causes fluid to fan slightly laterally (but less laterally than the ramps 1730, 1732) and contribute
to even watering from the deflector 1712. In this manner, the deflector 1700 provides an even
                                                  - 23 -

distribution of fluid to regions of the surrounding environment which improves efficiency by
reducing overwatering and underwatering.
[001491          The primary flow channel 1740 is configured to provide a partially vertical
trajectory to the fluid stream traveling along the channel 1740 and outward from the outlet
opening 1724. In one form, the fluid traveling along the channel 1740 has a trajectory in the
range of approximately 5 to approximately 24 degrees relative to the horizon upon installation of
the sprinkler 1700 (with the fluid flow out of the nozzle 1710 being vertical).
[001501          As shown in FIG. 59, the deflector 1700 redirects a vertical fluid stream from the
nozzle 1710 to a more horizontal stream traveling outward from the deflector 1712. To achieve
this redirection, the channel 1720 of the deflector 1712 curves generally along an arc between the
inlet 1750 and the outlet 1722. With respect to FIG. 62, this forced change in the direction of the
fluid stream causes portions of the fluid stream to disperse toward walls 1755, 1757 of the
channel 1720 (which include the ramps 1722).           The ramps 1730, 1732, 1742 capture the
dispersed fluid and redirect the fluid laterally outward relative to the deflector outlet opening
 1724, as shown in FIG. 61.
[001511          With reference to FIG. 62, the ramps 1722 include an initial ramp 1745 and a
drive ramp 1747 that produce rotation of the deflector 1712 as fluid travels through the channel
 1720. More specifically, the initial ramp 1745 receives at least a portion of the fluid from the
inlet 1750 and directs the fluid against the drive ramp 1747. The drive ramp 1747 is oriented so
as to generate a reaction torque as the fluid impacts the drive ramp 1747. This impact causes the
deflector 1712 to rotate.
1001521          With reference to FIGS. 59 and 60, the deflector 1712 has a fin 1749 configured
to limit objects in the surrounding environment, such as long grass, from becoming lodged in a
gap 1751 between the frame 1702 and the deflector 1712 and inhibiting rotation of the deflector
 1712. In one aspect, the fin 1749 has a height (as shown in FIG. 59) that narrows the gap 1751
which reduces the potential items that can fit into the gap 1751.      Further, the fin 1749 has an
angled nose 1753 that may push away objects such as long grass trapped between struts 1754A,
 1754B of the frame 1702.
[001531          The rotational speed of the deflector 1712 relative to the sprinkler frame 1702 is
controlled by the brake assembly 1706        With reference to FIG. 64, the brake assembly 1706
includes a rotor 1760 connected to or even integral with the shaft 1714 and a housing 1762 to
                                                - 24 -

which the rotor 1760 is mounted. The rotor 1760 rotates inside of a chamber 1764 defined by
the housing 1762 filled with a viscous fluid 1766. The viscous fluid 1766 inside the chamber
 1764 imparts a drag force on the rotor 1760 to establish a predetermined rotational speed of the
rotor 1706 (and connected deflector 1712) within a particular range of supply line pressures for
the sprinkler 1700.
[001541         The brake assembly 1706 has a seal 1770 that seals the viscous fluid in the
chamber 1766 and provides protection from debris entering a bearing surface between the
bearing plate 1772 and the shaft 1714 while permitting rotation of the shaft 1714. The seal 1770
is mounted to the bearing plate 1772, which is in turn secured to a wall 1774 of the housing
 1762. The seal 1770 may be made of silicone rubber, and the housing 1762, may be made of
plastic.  To assemble the brake assembly 1706, the viscous fluid 1766 is positioned in the
chamber 1764, the rotor 1760 advanced into the chamber 1764. an opening 1771 of the seal 1770
(which is mounted on the bearing plate 1772) passed along the shaft 1714, and the bearing plate
 1772 secured to the wall 1744. The bearing plate 1772 may be secured to the wall 1744 using,
for example, adhesive, fasteners, snap-on or ultrasonic welding techniques.
[00155]        With reference to FIG. 65, the brake housing 1762 includes a cylindrical wall
 1780 defining in part the chamber 1764 and supports 1782 extending outwardly that connect the
wall 1780 to the housing wall 1774. In this manner, the brake housing 1762 provides a rigid and
durable environment for the rotor 1760 and the viscous fluid 1766, while facilitating an efficient
assembly process.
[00156]        With reference to FIG. 59, the sprinkler 1700 has a locking mechanism 1784 for
releasably securing the nozzle 1710 in the frame lower socket 1708. As shown in FIG. 66, the
lower socket 1708 includes a wall 1786 with coupling members 1788 extending outwardly
therefrom.   Each coupling member 1788 has an underside with a can portion 1790, a stop
portion 1792, and a recessed portion 1794 formed on an underside of the coupling member 1788.
Turning to FIG. 67, the nozzle 1710 has a cap 1796 with a skirt 1798 and a tube 1800 depending
from the cap 1796. The skirt 1798 has members 1802 (see FIG. 68) extending inwardly and
having detents 1803 that are configured to engage the coupling members 1788 of the frame
lower socket 1708. Opposite the members 1802, the skirt 1798 has projections 1804 extending
outwardly that provide gripping surfaces for a user to grasp the nozzle 1710 as the user inserts
and turns the nozzle 1710 in the lower socket 1708.
                                              - 25  -

1001571         With reference to FIG. 66, a user inserts the nozzle tube 1800 in direction 1810
into an opening 1812 of the socket 1708 until a cap underside surface 1814 (see FIG. 67) seats
against a rim 1816 of the socket wall 1786. Then, the user turns the nozzle 1710 in direction
 1820 which engages the nozzle members 1802 and detents 1803 thereof with the socket coupling
members 1788.       Initially, each detent 1803 engages the cam portion 1790 of a respective
coupling member 1788 and shifts downwardly in direction 1810 with turning of the nozzle in
direction 1820 due to the camming engagement of the detent 1803 and the cam portion 1790.
Because the cap underside surface 1814 rests upon the socket rim 1816, the downward shifting
of the detent 1803 due to the camming engagement of the detent 1803 and the cam portion 1790
applies tension to the nozzle skirt 1798 and compresses the cap underside surface 1814 against
the socket rim 1816.
[00158]         Continued turning of the nozzle 1710 in direction 1820 slides the detent 1803
along the coupling member 1788 until the detent 1803 contacts the stop portion 1792. The user
then releases the nozzle 1710 and the tension in the nozzle skirt 1798 draws the detect 1803 in
direction 1832 against the recessed portion 1794 of the coupling member 1788 and seats the
detent 1803 against the recessed portion 1794.        The recessed portions 1794 of the coupling
members 1788 permit the detents 1803 to shift upwardly slightly in direction 1832 which
relieves some tension in the skirt 1798, although the cap underside surface 1814 remains
compressed against the socket rim 1816.       At this point, the detents 1803 are generally held
against the recessed portion 1794 between the stop portion 1792 and the cam portion 1790 of the
respective coupling members 1788.        The engagement of the detents 1803 and the coupling
members 1788 holds the cap underside surface 1814 tightly against the socket rim 1816 and
functions to seal the nozzle 1710 in the socket 1708. Further, the nozzle detents 1803 and socket
recessed portions 1794 are configured to engage and resist turning of the nozzle 1710 in
direction 1830.
1001591         To release the nozzle 1710 from the socket 1708, the user grasps the cap 1796 and
turns the nozzle 1710 in direction 1830 which overcomes the engagement of the detents 1803
and recessed portions 1794. Turning of the nozzle 1710 in direction 1830 slides the detents 1803
out of the recessed portions 1794 and along the cam portion 1790 of the respective coupling
member 1788 until the detents 1803 are clear of the coupling members 1788. The user may then
                                               - 26 -

remove the nozzle 1710 from the socket 1708 by lifting the nozzle 1710 upward in direction
 1832 which withdraws the tube 1800 from within the socket 1708.
[001601         With reference to FIGS. 69-73, another sprinkler 2000 is shown having a
deflector 2002, a frame 2004, a socket 2006 of the frame 2004, and a nozzle 2008 releasably
secured in the socket 2006. The nozzle 2008 is threadingly engaged with the socket 2006 such
that the nozzle 2008 may be readily connected and disconnected from the socket 2006. The
sprinkler 2000 may be packaged with several nozzles 2008. each having a different flow rating,
so that the sprinkler 2000 may be readily tailored to a particular application.
[001611         More specifically, the socket 2006 includes an opening 2010 for receiving the
nozzle 2008 and a wall 2012 extending about the opening 2010, as shown in FIG. 70. The wall
2012 has outer threads 2014 formed thereon with multiple leads 2016.            Similarly, the nozzle
2008 includes a cap 2030 (see FIG. 71) having a skirt 2032 with inner threads 2034 and multiple
leads 2036.    In one form, the socket threads 2014 have four leads 2016, and the nozzle cap
threads 2034 have six leads 2036. By utilizing multiple leads 2016, 2036, the sprinkler 2000 has
a higher strength for holding the nozzle 2008 in place within the socket 2006 during high
pressure conditions in an associated supply line.
[001621         The fewer number of leads 2016 on the socket 2006 is attributable to flats 2040
on the wall 2012.      The flats 2040 are diametrically opposed across the opening 2010 and
interrupt the threads 2014. The flats 2040 provide a gripping area for a wrench so that a user
may connect a wrench to the socket 2006 and turn the frame 2004 to thread the sprinkler 2000 on
to a stand pipe, for example. The flats 2040 are optional and may be used to improve the ease of
molding.
1001631          With reference to FIG. 73, the sprinkler 2000 includes a sealing mechanism 2050
for forming a watertight seal between the socket 2006 and the nozzle 2008. In one form, the
sealing mechanism 2050 includes an annular protrusion 2052 that extends inwardly from an
inner surface 2054 of the socket wall 2012, as shown in FIG. 72. The protrusion 2052 defines a
narrower diameter 2056 across the opening 2012 than a diameter 2058 across the opening 2012
immediately downstream of the protrusion 2052. With reference to FIG. 71, the nozzle 2008
includes a tube 2060 with an upstream end portion 2062 having a diameter 2064 thereof The
upstream end portion diameter 2064 of the nozzle 2008 is larger than the diameter 2056 defined
by the protrusion 2052 within the socket 2006. The larger diameter 2064 of the nozzle tube 2060
                                                - 27 -

and the smaller diameter 2056 of the socket protrusion 2052 makes an interference fit between
the nozzle tube 2060 and the socket protrusion 2052. The interference fit functions to form a
watertight seal between the nozzle tube 2060 and the socket protrusion 2052 when the nozzle
2008 is secured in the socket 2006. Unlike some conventional sprinkler seals, the seal between
the nozzle tube 2060 and the socket protrusion 2052 is generally not affected by high supply line
pressures or by the plastic deformation (or material set, or creep) that a material undergoes when
it is under continuous preload.
[001641         To secure the nozzle 2008 in the socket 2006, the user first positions the nozzle
tube 2060 in the socket opening 2012 and advances the nozzle tube 2060 in direction 2066 into
the socket 2006 until the nozzle threads 2034 reach socket threads 2014 (see FIGS. 72 and 73).
The user turns the nozzle 2008 to engage the nozzle and socket threads 2014, 2034 and continues
turning the nozzle 2008 to fully tighten the nozzle 2008 into the socket 2006. As the user turns
the nozzle 2008, the engagement between the threads 2014, 2034 draws the nozzle 2008 farther
in direction 2066 into the socket 2006. Further, turning the nozzle 2008 advances the nozzle
tube upstream end 2062 in direction 2066 into contact with the annular protrusion 2052 within
the socket 2006. Continued turning of the nozzle 2008 causes the protrusion 2052 to cam the
upstream end portion 2062 inwardly in directions 2070, 2072 and compress the nozzle tube
upstream end portion 2062. The nozzle 2008 is preferably made from a polymer-based material,
and has resilient properties that tend to resist the compression of the tube 2060 due to the
protrusion 2052 and bias the tube upstream end portion 2062 outwardly in directions 2074, 2076.
This operation firmly engages the nozzle tube 2060 with the socket wall protrusion 2052, forms
an interference fit between the socket 2006 and the nozzle 2008, and functions to form a seal
between the nozzle tube 2060 and the protrusion 2052. Further, as the fluid pressure upstream of
the nozzle 2008 increases (which increases pressure within a cavity 2081 of the tube 2060, as
shown in FIG. 73), the tube 2060 presses outward in direction 2074, 2076 with greater force,
which increases the sealing pressure.
1001651         With reference to FIG. 74, another nozzle 2100 is shown.          The nozzle 2100
includes a flow controller 2110 having an opening 2112 with a diameter that changes in response
to changes in fluid pressure within an upstream area 2114 of the nozzle 2100.             The flow
controller 2110 is configured to compensate for variation in supply line pressure by constricting
the opening 2112 (at higher supply line pressure) or enlarging the opening 2112 (at lower supply
                                              - 28 -

line pressure) which adjusts the volume flow rate of fluid striking the deflector 2002 and causes
the deflector 2002 to rotate at a generally constant rotational velocity despite variation in the
supply line pressure. In one approach, the supply line pressure varies within the range of fifteen
pounds per square inch and fifty pounds per square inch during operation of the sprinkler 2000.
[001661         Specifically, the nozzle 2100 includes a cap 2102 with a rim 2104 and a grommet
2116 having an outer region 2118 engaged with the nozzle rim 2104. The grommet 2116 has an
inner region 2120 with the opening 2112 formed therein. The grommet 2 116 permits outward
flexing of the inner region 2 120 in response to pressure increases within the upstream area 2114.
When the fluid pressure upstream of the nozzle 2008 increases, the increased fluid pressure
causes the grommet inner region 2120 to bow downstream to a position 2122 generally as shown
in dashed lines in FIG. 74. In the deflected position 2122, the inner region 2120 has an opening
2 112A with a constriction having a smaller diameter than the opening 2112 when the grommet
inner region 2120 is in the undeflected position shown in solid in FIG. 74.        The constricted
opening 2112A permits a reduced volume of fluid to exit the opening 2112 in direction 2130.
This operation of the grommet 2116 functions to compensate for increases in supply line
pressure by reducing the volume of fluid that strikes the associated deflector, such as deflector
2002. For example, if there is a spike in the upstream fluid pressure, the grommet 2116 responds
by bowing downstream, which forms a constriction in the opening 2112 and the volume of water
impacting the deflector 2002 such that the deflector 2002 continues to rotate at a generally
constant speed despite the higher upstream water pressure. The grommet 2116 may be made of a
flexible material, such as a silicone rubber having a durometer range of about 50 to about 70
Shore A.
1001671         Another nozzle 2200 is shown in FIG. 75. The nozzle 2200 includes a cap 2202
with a rim 2204 and a tube 2206 depending from the cap 2202. The nozzle tube 2206 has an
upstream area 2210 sized to permit an elastomeric disc 2212 to be inserted in direction 2214 and
seated against an underside 2216 of the rim 2204. The tube 2206 further includes an annular
recess 2220 extending about the tube 2206 upstream of the elastomeric disc 2212 and a ring 2224
configured to snap into the tube recess 2220 and retain the elastomeric disc 2212 within the
nozzle 2200. As shown in FIG. 75, the disc 2212 has an opening 2230 and the disc 2212 deflects
to a position 2232 in response to increased fluid pressure in the upstream area 2210. In the
deflected position 2232, the disc 2212 has an opening 2230A with a constriction having a smaller
                                               - 29 -

diameter than opening 2230 which reduces the flow rate through the disc 2212 in response to the
increased supply line pressure upstream of the nozzle 2200.
