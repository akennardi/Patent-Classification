ABSTRACT
        The present disclosure relates to a spinal implant (100C). The spinal implant may be
used for lateral insertion into an intervertebral disc space. For example, the spinal implant may
include a spacer body (102) to which a plate (106) is fixed. The intervertebral spacer body
may include a pair of opposite sides (104) having a pyramid-shaped teeth (118) to fuse to
bone. The plate defines at least one upper and lower borehole (11 OF1, 11 0F2) that each
receives a screw (108). Each screw attaches the plate to a vertebral body between which the
intervertebral spacer body is inserted. The boreholes may include locking threads (112) that
are adapted to lock the screws into place by engaging complementary locking threads of head
of the screw.

                          LATERAL INSERTION SPINAL IMPLANT
BACKGROUND
[0001]     Spondylolisthesis is a term used to describe when one vertebrae slips forward on the
vertebrae below it. This usually occurs because there is a spondylolysis in the superior
vertebrae. There are two main parts of the spine that keep the vertebrae aligned, which include
the disc and the facet joints. When spondylolysis occurs, the facet joint can no longer hold the
vertebrae back. The intervertebral disc may slowly stretch under the increased stress and
allow the upper vertebra to slide forward. In the vast majority of cases, stretching of the
intervertebral disc only allows for a small amount of forward slip.
[0002]     Surgical treatment for spondylolisthesis needs to address both the mechanical
symptoms and the compressive symptoms, if they are present. The goals of surgery are to
remove pressure on spinal nerves (i.e., decompression) and to provide stability to the
thoracic/lumbar spine. In most cases of spondylolisthesis, decompression should be
accompanied by uniting one spinal vertebrae to the next (i.e., spinal fusion) with spinal
instrumentation (i.e., implants that are often used to help aid the healing process).
[0003]     In other cases, the spinal disc and/or vertebral bodies may be displaced or damaged
due to trauma, disease, degenerative effects, or wear over an extended period of time. This
displacement or damage often causes chronic back pain. In order to alleviate the chronic back
pain, a spinal disc is removed, along with all or part of at least one of the neighboring
vertebrae. An implant is then inserted to promote fusion of the remaining bony anatomy. The
success of spinal fusion is limited, however, due to several factors. For example, the spacer or
implant or cage used to fill the space left by the removed disc may not be strong enough to
support the spine. Furthermore, the spacer must be able to remain in the position in which it is
placed by the surgeon. The space must also be comprised of such a material to promote bony
growth around the spacer and within the spinal region.
SUMMARY
[0004]     In one aspect, the present invention provides a spinal implant for insertion into an
invertebral disc space between a superior and inferior vertebral bodies, the spinal implant,
comprising: a spacer body comprising a proximal base portion, a distal end, a first side wall
and an opposing second side wall; and a plate having a first side, a second side, a front

                                                 -2
surface, a rear surface and a pair of opposing coupling flanges that extend from the rear
surface, the front facing surface defining a first radius of curvature proximate the first side of
the plate and a second radius of curvature proximate the second side of the plate, the plate
forming an upper borehole and a lower borehole that are respectively positioned about a
lateral center plane of the plate, wherein the plate is secure to the spacer body by a
mechanical coupling of the opposing coupling flanges, wherein the upper borehole and the
lower borehole are adapted to each receive a bone screw to secure the spinal implant within
the invertebral disc space, wherein the first radius of curvature and second radius of curvature
are different.
[0005]     Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the
claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
"including, but not limited to".
[0006]     The present disclosure relates to spinal implants. For example, the spinal implants
may be used for insertion into the intervertebral disc space. The spinal implants may also be
used for alleviating chronic back pain and promoting bony growth around the spinal implants.
The spinal implants may also be positioned between two vertebral bodies and secured with at
least two locking screws.
[0007]     An example spinal implant includes an intervertebral spacer body, a plate, and at
least two screws. The intervertebral spacer body includes a pair of opposite sides. The plate
comprises a front surface and a rear surface. The plate is configured to attach to vertebral
bodies by at least two screws. For example, the plate includes at least one upper borehole and
at least one lower borehole for attachment of the plate to the vertebral bodies. The plate may
comprise at least two lower boreholes and the at least two upper boreholes, which are off
centered about the centerline of the plate.
[0008]     The plate is configured to mate with the intervertebral spacer body. A portion of the
rear surface of the plate is adapted to contact a wall of a vertebral body. Each borehole
comprises a threaded region adapted to engage a complementary threaded region of a head
of a screw inserted therethrough at a fixed angle relative to the plate. Further, the screws
inserted into the at least two upper boreholes and the at least two lower boreholes have
divergent angles. The screws diverge asymmetrically about a transverse midline of the plate.

                                                -3
[0009]     The pair of opposite sides of the intervertebral spacer body may also contact two
vertebral bodies. The anterior portion of the intervertebral spacer body optionally curves
medially. The screws may include at least two anterior screws and at least two posterior
screws.
[0010]     The spinal implant may also include screws that are locking screws. The plate
optionally has conical locking threads in the boreholes. The locking screws may be screwed
into the plate and locked into the conical locking threads in the boreholes. The screws, locking
or non-locking, may also be inserted into the first and second vertebral bodies at divergent
angles, or where the screws diverge either symmetrically or asymmetrically about the
transverse midline.
[0011]     The intervertebral spacer body may also include a plurality of protrusions. These
protrusions optionally secure the intervertebral spacer body between the first and second
vertebral bodies. The plate of the spinal implant may also include at least three boreholes, and
in other embodiments, it may contain at least two boreholes.
[0012]     These and other features and advantages of the implementations of the present
disclosure will become more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of
the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, which describe both the
preferred and alternative implementations of the present disclosure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0033]      Implementations of the present disclosure now will be described more fully
hereinafter. Indeed, these implementations can be embodied in many different forms and
should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein; rather, these
implementations are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements.
As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and
"the," include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term
"comprising" and variations thereof as used herein is used synonymously with the term
"including" and variations thereof and are open, non-limiting terms.
[0034]      In performing a wide range of back surgeries, surgeons are often required to make
use of pedicle screws and rods. These pedicle screws and rods are components of rigid
stabilization systems, which tend to be intrusive to surrounding tissue and vasculature
systems. The present disclosure is less intrusive because this spinal implant not only is
conformable to the spinal anatomy, but also is strong enough to allow surgeons to avoid using
pedicle screws and rods. The present disclosure also allows for less invasive surgery and
quicker surgery time.
[0035]      FIGS. 1-18 illustrate the different views of an embodiment of the present disclosure.
An example spinal implant 100A is shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 serves as an introduction to the
components and features of the spinal implant 1OOA. Details of the various components of the
spinal implant 1OOA are illustrated in FIGS. 2-11. The spinal implant 1OOA includes an
intervertebral spacer body 102 and a plate 106. The intervertebral spacer body 102 includes a
pair of opposite sides 104. Each opposite side 104 optionally has pyramid-shaped teeth 118
that are provided to frictionally engage top and bottom surfaces of a vertebral body. The
intervertebral spacer body 102 may include a central window 117 and side windows 116.
Tantalum markers may be provided proximate to the central and side windows 116. A surgeon
or any other medical professional may take radiographs of the area in which a spinal implant

                                                -6
100A is placed to view the tantalum markers to insure proper placement of the implant 100A in
a patient's body. The intervertebral spacer body 102 may include a self-distracting bulletnose
120. The intervertebral spacer body 102 is optionally made of polyether ether ketone (PEEK),
any other biocompatible materials appropriate for medical implants.
[0036]     The plate 106 is comprised of a front surface and a rear surface. The plate 106 may
include at least two upper boreholes 110 and at least two lower boreholes 110, respectively
positioned about a centerline and through the front surface and the rear surface of the plate
106. The at least two upper boreholes 110 and the at least two lower boreholes 110 may have
one or more alignments within the plate 106 and with respect to the centerline of the plate 106.
A further discussion of the boreholes 110 is provided below with reference to FIGS. 6-9. The
plate 106 further includes coupling flanges 114 that are adapted to be coupled to the spacer
body 102. The plate 106 may also define a region to mate with the intervertebral spacer body
102. For example, a portion of the rear surface of the plate 106 is adapted to contact a wall of
the vertebral body. A central hole 124 is provided as an insertion region into which a screw
(not shown) may be inserted to secure the plate 102 to the spacer body 102 and/or attachment
of an appropriate insertion device. The plate 106 may comprise TAN, any other titanium alloy
appropriate for surgical or medical devices, or any other appropriate material.
[0037]     One or more screws 108 attach the plate 106 to the vertebral bodies and to secure
the intervertebral spacer body 102 therein between. The screws 108 optionally comprise a
titanium-6 aluminum-7 niobium alloy (TAN), any other titanium alloy appropriate for surgical or
medical devices, or any other appropriate material.
[0038]     As will be described with reference to FIGS. 2-7, the first embodiment of the spinal
implant 1OOA include many different combinations of spacer bodies 102A-1 02D and plates
106A-106D. In particular, the various spacer bodies 102A-102D are illustrated in FIGS. 2 - 5,
which may be interchangeably attached with the plates 106A-106D illustrated in FIGS. 6-9 to
create a spinal implant 1OOA having a configuration adapted for use in a specific regions of the
spinal column.
[0039]     FIGS. 2A-2F illustrate a first embodiment of a spacer body 102A that may be used to
construct the spinal implant 100A of the present disclosure. As illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2D,
the spacer body 102A includes a generally rounded distal end 128A and a proximal end 129A
that defines a base 138A that is adapted to engage the coupling flanges 114 of the plate 106.

                                                 -7
The spacer body 102A has either straight or non-straight sides 130A and 132A and a central
window 11 7A. The central window 11 7A is generally an oval shape, but can be any shape or
shapes, such as one or more circular regions, rectangular regions, polygon-shaped regions,
etc. The central window 117A may promote the growth of a bony bridge between adjacent
vertebral bodies within which the spacer body 102A is inserted. In accordance with the first
embodiment, the spacer body 102A may have a width W of approximately 18 mm and a length
L of approximately 35 to 55 mm. Thus, the spacer body 102A may have a length to width ratio
of approximately 1.8 - 3.2 when used for, e.g., lateral procedures.
[0040]     As shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 2B and the magnified view of FIG. 2C,
the top surface 134A and the bottom surface 136A have a radius of curvature denoted         R1A  and
R2A, respectively between the sides 130A and 132A. Thus, the top surface 134A and the
bottom surface 136A are slightly curved in a lateral direction of the spacer body 102A. The
radius of curvature  R1A and   R2A may be the same or different to achieve a secure fit with an
adjacent vertebral body. FIGS. 2B and 2C illustrate pins 126A, which may be viewed using an
appropriate imaging device to confirm the location of the spinal implant 100A when inserted
into a patient's body. The pins 126A may have a width of approximately 0.8 mm and may be
made from, e.g., stainless steel or other material that is visible when exposed to, e.g., x-rays.
[0041]     As shown in FIGS. 2D and 2E, the top surface 134A and the bottom surface 136A of
spacer body 102A also have a radius of curvature     R3A   and R4A, respectively, between the distal
and 128A and the proximal end 129A. As such, the top surface 134A and the bottom surface
136A are slightly curved in the longitudinal direction of the spacer body 102A. The radius of
curvature  R3A  and R4A  may be the same or different to achieve a secure fit with an adjacent
vertebral body. The curvature of the top surface 134A and bottom surface 136A in the lateral
and/or longitudinal directions provides a shape that may be received within natural contours of
the vertebral bodies.
[0042]     FIGS. 2D and 2E also illustrate the side windows 11 6A and the pyramid-shaped
teeth 11 8A in greater detail. The side widows 11 6A may have any suitable geometry,
including but not limited to, oval, oblong, rectangular, triangular, circular, polygonal and/or any
combination thereof. The teeth 118A may have other shapes suitable for engaging the
vertebral bodies. Recesses 140A are defined in the sides 130A and 132A receive inward
pointing projections 150A/150B and 152A/152B (see, FIGS. 6-7) of the coupling flanges 114 in
order to snap the plate 106 securely into place on the spacer body 102A. In some

                                                -8
implementations, the recess 140A extend along only a portion of the side walls 130A and
132A. In accordance with the present disclosure, the spacer body 102A may have a height H
of approximately 6 mm to 17 mm.
[0043]     FIG. 2F illustrates view of the proximal end 129A of the spacer body 102A. The
base 138A is defined having a width that is narrower than the overall width of the spacer 102A
(see, FIG. 2A), such that when the coupling flanges 114 are joined thereto, the overall width of
the base 138A and the coupling flanges 114 is approximately equal to the width of the spacer
body 102A. For example, the width of the base 138A may be sized such that may be securely
grasped between the coupling flanges 114 of the plate 106. The base 138A may further define
a hole 139A which may receive a screw (not shown) used to secure the plate 106 to the
spacer body 102A, either solely for insertion or for long term connection.
[0044]     Thus, as shown in FIGS. 2A-2F and described above, a medical specialist can select
an appropriately sized spacer body 102A in accordance with the void between adjacent
vertebral bodies into which the spacer body will be inserted.
[0045]     FIGS. 3A-3F illustrate a second embodiment of a spacer body 102B that may be
used to construct the spinal implant 100A of the present disclosure. Aspects of the spacer
body 102B that are substantially similar to the first embodiment of the spacer body 102A will
not be repeated.
[0046]     As shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 3B and the magnified view of FIG. 3C,
the top surface 134B and the bottom surface 136B each are substantially flat. As shown, the
side 132B has a height of h1 and the side 130B has a height of h2 . Thus, the top surface 134A
and the bottom surface 136A form an angle a that is defined by the heights h1 and h2. In
accordance with the present disclosure the heights h1 and h2 may range from approximately 5
mm to 17 mm.
[0047]     As shown in FIG. 3E, a recess 140B defined in the side 130B extends along the
entirety of the side wall 130B, where a recess 140B formed in the side 132B extends along a
portion of the side 132B (see, FIGS 3A and 3D).
[0048]     FIG. 3F illustrates view of the proximal end 129B of the spacer body 102B. The
base 138B is defined having a width that is narrower than the overall width of the spacer 102B
(see, FIG. 3A), such that when the coupling flanges 114 are joined thereto, the overall width of

                                               -9
the base 138B and the coupling flanges 114 is approximately equal to the width of the spacer
body 102B. The base 138B may further define a hole 139B which may receive a screw (not
shown) used to secure the plate 106 to the spacer body 102B. As illustrated, the base 138B is
formed having at the same angle a that is defined by the heights h1 and h2 of the sides 132B
and 130B, respectively.
[0049]    Thus, as shown in FIGS. 3A-3F and described above, a medical specialist can select
an appropriately sized spacer body 102B in accordance with the void between adjacent
vertebral bodies into which the spacer body will be inserted.
[0050]     FIGS. 4A-4F illustrate a third embodiment of a spacer body 102C that may be used
to construct the spinal implant 100A of the present disclosure. Those aspects of the third
embodiment of the spacer body 102C that are substantially similar to the first embodiment of
the spacer body 102A will not be repeated below. As illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4D, the
spacer body 102C includes a generally rounded distal end 128C and a proximal end 129C that
defines a base 138C that is adapted to engage the coupling flanges 114 of the plate 106. The
spacer body 102C has curved sides 130C and 132C and a central window 117C. In
accordance with the third embodiment, the spacer body 102C may have a width W of
approximately 22 mm (as measured between the widest points) and a length L of
approximately 35 to 55 mm. Thus, the spacer body 102C may have a length to width ratio of
approximately 1.59 - 2.5 when used for, e.g., lateral procedures.
[0051]    Thus, as shown in FIGS. 4A-4F and described above, a medical specialist can select
an appropriately sized spacer body 102C in accordance with the void between adjacent
vertebral bodies into which the spacer body will be inserted.
[0052]     FIGS. 5A-5F illustrate a fourth embodiment of a spacer body 102D that may be used
to construct the spinal implant 100A of the present disclosure. Aspects of the spacer body
102D that are substantially similar to the second embodiment of the spacer body 102B will not
be repeated.
[0053]    As illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5D, the spacer body 102C includes curved sides 130C
and 132C and a central window 117C. In accordance with the fourth embodiment, the spacer
body 102D may have a width W of approximately 22 mm (as measured between the widest

                                                -10
points) and a length L of approximately 35 to 55 mm. Thus, the spacer body 102D may have a
length to width ratio of approximately 1.59 - 2.5 when used for, e.g., lateral procedures.
[0054]     Thus, as shown in FIGS. 5A-5F and described above, a medical specialist can select
an appropriately sized spacer body 102D in accordance with the void between adjacent
vertebral bodies into which the spacer body will be inserted.
[0055]     FIGS. 6A-6H illustrate a plate 106A in accordance with a first embodiment of the
present disclosure. The first embodiment illustrates a so-called "asymmetric plate" in
accordance with the present disclosure. FIGS. 6A and 6B, respectively, illustrate front and
rear perspective views of the plate 106A. The plate 106A includes sides 158A and 160A, a
rear surface 162A and a front surface 164A. Circular recesses 157A may be formed in the
sides 158A and 160A of the plate 106A. A central hole 124A is provided into which a screw
(not shown) may be inserted to secure the plate 106A to the various spacer bodies described
above. The central hole 124A may be formed within a keyed recess 163A.
[0056]     In FIG. 6B, there is shown the coupling flanges 114A and their associated inward
pointing projections 150A and 152A. As noted above, the projections 150A and 152A are
received within the recesses 140 of the base 138 of the spacer bodies 102, as described
above. The coupling flanges 114A extend from a substantially flat wall 166A that abuts the
base 138 of the spacer body 102 when the plate 106A is attached thereto. As shown in FIGS.
6A and 6B, the boreholes 11 OA1 to 11 OA4 may include locking threads 11 2A that are adapted to
receive complementary threads of the screws 108.
[0057]     Referring now to FIG. 6C, there is shown a side view of the plate 106A showing the
side 160A. The lower boreholes 11 0A2 and 11 0 A4 may be have a central axis 153A that is
formed at an approximately 5' angle with respect to a first horizontal axis 154A passing
through the center of the boreholes 11 0 A2 and 11 0 A4 that parallels a lateral center plane 161A
of the plate 106A. As shown in the side view of FIG. 6D illustrating the side 158A, the upper
boreholes 11 OA1 and 11 OA3 may have a central axis 155A that is formed at an approximately
20' angle with respect to a second horizontal axis 156A passing through the center of the
boreholes 11 OA1 and 11 0 A3 that parallels the lateral center plane 161A.
[0058]     As will be shown in FIGS. 15A-1 6B the above offsets of the central axis causes the
screws 108 inserted therein to diverge at asymmetric angles about the lateral center plane

                                                   - 11
161A of the plate 106A. It is noted that central axis 153A and 155A of the lower and upper
boreholes may be offset at any angle between 5' and 20' with respect to the horizontal axis
154A and 156A. It is also noted that central axis of the upper boreholes and lower boreholes
may be at the same angle with respect to the horizontal axis 154A and 156A, thus causing the
screws inserted therein to diverge at symmetrically angles about the lateral center plane 161A
of the plate 106A.
[0059]      FIG. 6E illustrates a cross-sectional view of the lower boreholes 1 10 A2 and 1    A4
shown in FIG. 6C. FIG. 6F illustrates a cross-sectional view of the upper boreholes 11 OA and
1 10 A3 shown in FIG. 6D. As illustrated in FIGS. 6E and 6F, locking threads 112A are defined
within the boreholes 11 OA1-1 10 A4 to threadedly engage with complementary locking threads of
the head of the screw 108. In accordance with the first embodiment, the upper and lower
boreholes 11 OA and 11 0 A2 may have a central axis 155A and 153A that are laterally offset at
approximately a 3' angle with respect to the second horizontal axis 156A and first horizontal
axis 154A, respectively, passing through the center of the boreholes 11 OA and 11 0 A2. The
upper and lower boreholes 11 0 A3 and 1       A4  formed proximate to the side 158A may have a
central axis 155A and 153A that are laterally offset at approximately a 1' angle with respect to
the second horizontal axis 156A and first horizontal axis 154A, respectively, passing through
the center of the boreholes 11 0 A3 and 11  0
                                              A4.   The first horizontal axis 154A and the second
horizontal axis 156A parallel a longitudinal central plane 165A (see, also FIG. 6H) of the plate
106A.
[0060]      Each of the boreholes 11 OA1-1 10 A4 may be tapered such that it is wider proximate to
the front surface 164A than proximate to the rear surface 162A forming a conical surface
therein. As such, a screw inserted having a complementary taper will stop at a predetermined
position within the plate 106A. As shown, the centers of boreholes 11 0 A1 and 1 1 0 A2 may be
positioned 5.3 mm from a center of the plate 106A, whereas the boreholes 11 0A3 and 11 0 A4
may be positioned 5.5 mm from the center of the plate 106A, as defined by the longitudinal
central plane 165A.
[0061]      Referring now to FIG. 6G, there is illustrated a top view of the plate 106A. The rear
surface 162A forms a curved surface moving longitudinally from a top 170A of the plate 106A
to the flat wall 166A (see, also FIG. 6B). Although not shown in FIG. 6G, the rear surface
162A forms a similar curved surface moving longitudinally from a bottom 172A of the plate
106A to the flat wall 166A. As illustrated, the top surface 170A is generally medially curved

                                                - 12
from the side 158A to the side 160A, forming a region 174A that substantially matches a
curvature an outer wall of a superior vertebral body. A similar curved region is formed from the
side 158A to the side 160A proximate to the bottom 172A that substantially matches a
curvature an outer wall of an inferior vertebral body. In particular, the curved region 174A (and
lower curved region (not shown)) may have a portion thereof having a radius of curvature      R6A
formed proximate to the edge of the front surface 164A and the side 160A. In addition, the
edge formed by the front surface 164A and the side 158A may be formed having a radius of
curvature  R5A
[0062]     As shown in FIG. 6G, in some implementations, the coupling flanges 114A may be of
unequal length. The coupling flanges 114A may each have the inward pointing projections
150A and 152B, respectively, as described above, for engaging the recesses 140 of the
spacer body 102. For example, a flange extending alongside 158A may have a length of 15
mm, as measured from the front surface 164A. A flange extending alongside 160A may have
a length of 13 mm, as measured from the front surface 164A. The flanges may be formed
having equal lengths, or any combination of lengths between 12 mm and 16 mm. The inner
walls of the flanges may be separated by distance     HF of 14 mm. The distance     HF may be any
value that is substantially equal to a width of the base 138 of the spacer bodies described
above. The width W of the plate 106A is approximately 19 mm.
[0063]     FIGS. 6H illustrates a front view of the plate 106A. As illustrated, the upper
boreholes 1 10 A1 and 11 0 A3 may be located a distance Du from the lateral center plane 161A
and about the longitudinal center plane 165A. Lower boreholes 11 0A2 and 11 0 A4 may be
located a distance DL from a lateral center plane 161A and about the longitudinal center plane
165A. The distance Du may range from approximate 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm. The distance DL
may range from approximately 6 mm to 10 mm. Thus, the ratio of DL:Du is approximately 1.4 to
2.2. The plate 106A may have a height H that ranges from approximately 18 mm to 26 mm.
The distance Q between the outer edges of the boreholes in a vertical direction may range
from approximately 15 mm to 23 mm, thus providing approximately 1.5 mm of material
between the outer edge of the borehole and the edge of the plate 106A. The distance U
between the inner edges of the boreholes may range from approximately 2.5 mm to 10.5 mm.
Also as shown in FIG. 6H, the front surface 164A defines a substantially rectangular region
having dimples 176A and 178A formed along the outer edges of the plate 106A between the
boreholes. The plate 106A may have a width of approximately 18 mm, as measured between

                                                 -13
the dimples formed in the sides 158A and 160A. Thus, the dimples 176A and 178A remove
approximately 1 mm of material, reducing the weight of the plate 106A.
[0064]     Thus, as shown in FIGS. 6A-6H and described above, a medical specialist can
select an appropriately sized plate 106A in accordance with a location of the spine into which
the spinal implant 100A is to be implanted and an access window to perform the spinal implant
procedure.
[0065]     FIGS. 7A-7H illustrate a plate 106B in accordance with a second embodiment of the
present disclosure. The second embodiment illustrates a so-called "symmetric plate" in
accordance with the present disclosure. Those aspects of the second embodiment of the plate
106B that are the same as the first embodiment of the plate 106A will not be repeated below.
[0066]     FIGS. 7A and 7B, respectively, illustrate front and rear perspective views of the plate
106B. The plate 106B includes sides 158B and 160B, a rear surface 162B and a front surface
164B. A central hole 124B is provided into which a screw (not shown) may be inserted to
secure the plate 106B to the various spacer bodies described above.
[0067]     Referring now to FIG. 7C, there is shown a side view of the plate 106B showing the
side 160B. The lower boreholes 11 0 B2 and 11 0 B4 may have a central axis 153B that is formed
at an approximately 20' angle with respect to a first horizontal axis 154B passing through the
center of the boreholes 11 0 B2 and 11 0 B4 that parallels a lateral center plane 161 B of the plate
106B. As shown in the side view of FIG. 7D illustrating the side 158B, the upper boreholes
11 0B and 11  0
                B3 may have a central axis 155B that is also formed at an approximately 20'
angle with respect to a second horizontal axis 156B passing through the center of the
boreholes 11 0B and 11 0 B3 that parallels the lateral center plane 161 B.
[0068]     As will be shown in FIGS. 14A-14B the above offsets of the central axis causes the
screws 108 inserted therein to diverge at symmetric angles about the lateral center plane 161B
of the plate 106B. It is noted that central axis 153B and 155B of the lower and upper
boreholes may be offset at any angle between 5' and 20' with respect to the horizontal axis
154B and 156B.
[0069]     FIGS. 7H illustrates a front view of the plate 106B. As illustrated, the upper
boreholes 11 OB1 and 11 OB3 may be located a distance Du from the lateral center plane 161 B
and about the longitudinal central axis 165B. Lower boreholes 11 OB2 and 11 OB4 may be

                                                - 14
located a distance DL from a lateral center plane 161 B and about the longitudinal central axis
165B. The distance Du may range from approximate 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm. Similarly, the
distance DL may range from approximately 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm. Because of the symmetric
shape of the plate 106B, the ratio of DL:Du is maintained at 1, thus DL and Du are equal for all
sizes of DL and Du implemented in the plate 106B. The plate 106B may have a height H that
ranges from approximately 15 mm to 23 mm. The distance Q between the outer edges of the
boreholes in a vertical direction may range from approximately 12 mm to 20 mm, thus
providing approximately 1.5 mm of material between the outer edge of the borehole and the
edge of the plate 106B. The distance U between the inner edges of the boreholes may range
from approximately 0.5 mm to 8.5 mm. Also as shown in FIG. 7H, the front surface 164B
defines a substantially rectangular region having dimples 176B and 178B formed along the
outer edges of the plate 106B between the boreholes. The plate 106B may have a width of
approximately 18 mm, as measured between the dimples formed in the sides 158B and 160B.
Thus, the dimples 176B and 178B remove approximately 1 mm of material, reducing the
weight of the plate 106B.
[0070]    Thus, as shown in FIGS. 7A-7H and described above, a medical specialist can
select an appropriately sized plate 106B in accordance with a location of the spine into which
the spinal implant 100A is to be implanted and an access window to perform the spinal implant
procedure.
[0071]     FIG. 8 illustrates a plate 106C in accordance with a third embodiment of the present
disclosure. The plate 106C features a reduced height DL as compared to the plate 106A. For
example, the height reduction may be approximately 2 mm to 4 mm. As illustrated, the upper
boreholes 11001 and     1 10 c3 may be located a distance Du from the lateral center plane 161C.
Lower boreholes 11 OC2 and 11 0 C4 may be located a distance DL from a lateral center plane
161A. The distance Du may range from approximate 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm. The distance DL
may range from approximately 3 mm to 7 mm. Thus, the ratio of DL:Du is approximately 0.92 to
1.0. The plate 106C may have a height H that ranges from approximately 15 mm to 23 mm.
The distance Q between the outer edges of the boreholes in a vertical direction may range
from approximately 12 mm to 20 mm, thus providing approximately 1.5 mm of material
between the outer edge of the borehole and the edge of the plate 106c. The distance U
between the inner edges of the boreholes may range from approximately 2.5 mm to 10.5 mm.
In other aspects, the plate 106C has substantially the same dimensions and features as the
plate 106A.

                                                -15
[0072]     The plate 106C enables a surgeon or any other medical professional working in the
spinal region may avoid interference with the iliac crest when working near the sacrum using
the assembled spinal implant having the plate 106C. The plate 106C also allows for the
removal of less bone in the event that osteophyte is present. Still further, the plate 106C
allows the screws 108, when inserted into the boreholes 11 O-      10 C4 to penetrate bone that is
closer to the disc space, thus reducing exposure of the screws 108 and lessening the risk of
the screws 108 protruding into the disc space.
[0073]     FIG. 9 illustrates a plate 106D in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the
present disclosure. The plate 106D is similar to the plate 106C; however the plate 106D is
configured to be mounted flush to certain portions of the anatomy in the medial-lateral plane,
as well as the cranial-caudal plane. As shown, the plate 106D provides for a portion 902 in
which material associated with the plate 106C that may cause irritation to a patient is removed.
[0074]     FIGS. 1OA-1 0C illustrates a first embodiment of a screw 108A of the present
disclosure. The screw 108A includes a threaded head 180A and a threaded body 186A.
Thus, the threaded body 186A has relatively course pitch to provide for sufficient screw
purchase into cortical bone of a vertebral body. The screw 108A has a variable angled screw
point 188A where the point is initially angled at approximately 18' and then angled at
approximately 22' proximate to a first thread thereof. The head of the screw 108A defines a
star-shaped recess 181A, into which a complementary star-shaped driver may be inserted to
drive the screw. The recess may be formed having other shapes, such as a line, a plus sign, a
square or other polygon shape to receive a complementary drive. The screw 108A may have
a length that may range from 20 mm to 50 mm.
[0075]     FIGS. 11 A-11 B illustrate a second embodiment of a screw 108B. The screw 108B
shares similar features with the screw 108A in size and shape, however has a hollow center
189B into which bone cement or other adhesive may be injected. The screw 108B may be
used in situations where the receiving bone is structurally unsound and may not retain the
screw 108B. The screw 108B may provide for e.g., luer locking of an injection mechanism
within the recess 181B. Bone cement or other adhesive may be injected into the screw 108B
such that it flows within the central hollow region 189B of the screw 108B and out of the holes
182B into the threads and surrounding bone to secure the screw 108B within, e.g., a vertebral
body.

                                                 -16
[0076]     Referring now to FIGS. 12A-12B, there is shown an example sequence of assembly
of the spinal implant 100A using, e.g., spacer body 102C and plate 106B. As illustrated, the
plate 106B and the spacer body 102C are cooperatively configured to mate with one another.
In the sequence of FIGS. 12A-12B the coupling flanges 114 are pressed into the recesses
140A defined in the sides 130A and 132A to receive the inward pointing projections 150B and
152B of the coupling flanges 114 in order to snap the plate 106B securely into place on the
spacer body 102C.      Thus, the spinal implant 100A is ready for use by a medical specialist as
part of a spinal repair procedure.
[0077]     Referring now to FIG. 13, there is illustrated the assembled spinal implant 100A
together with screws 108 inserted therein. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the inserted screw heads
are partially contained within a space 1102 defined by the height of the spacer 102 between
the top surface 134 and the bottom surface 136. Such an arrangement provides for a more
compact access window area as the screws are position closer together in a vertical
orientation. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, the engagement of the
threaded head 180 and the locking threads 112 fixes the angles of the screws 108 with respect
to the plate 106.
[0078]     As will now be described with reference to FIGS. 14-18, the spinal implant 100 may
be laterally inserted into an intervertebral space between two vertebral bodies. For example,
the spinal implant 100 may be used to impart superior stability to a lytic spondylolisthesis or
provide structural stability in skeletally mature individuals following discectomies. Embodiments
of the present disclosure may be used for work in, around, or within the lumbar sections Li to
L4 or thoracic sections T9 to T1 2. Alternatively, the implant 100 (of varying length to width
ratios) may be implanted anteriorly into an intervertebral space between two vertebral bodies.
[0079]     Referring now to FIGS. 14A-14C, there is illustrated an example spinal implant as
generally positioned in the intervertebral disc space between two vertebral bodies 202 and
204. The spinal implant 1OOA may include any of the spacer bodies 102A-102D and the plate
106B, thus providing a symmetric divergence of the screws 108. The boreholes 11 OB1-1 1OB4 of
the plate 106 are located near the corners of the plate 106B, thus positioning the screws 108
to coincide with the portion of the vertebral bodies 202 and 204 that is strongest. The corner
portion of the plate 106 aligns with the Cortical Rim, thus providing a sufficient amount of
cortical bone for the screws 108 to engage to retain the implant 100 in a desired position.

                                                -17
[0080]      As shown in FIG. 14B, the upper screws 108 and lower screws 108 diverge at a
symmetric angle from a midline 109 of the implant 100. As noted above, where the screws
108 diverge symmetrically from the midline 109, the screws may diverge at an angle between
10' and 30' for a lateral approach and between 20' and 450 for an anterior approach with
respect to the centerline 109. As shown in FIG. 14C, the anterior screw may angle posteriorly
at an angle that is approximately 0' and 30 and the posterior screw may angle anteriorly at an
angle which may be approximately 0' and 30, as illustrated in FIGS. 7E and 7F and discussed
in detail with regard to FIGS. 6E and 6F and boreholes 11 OB1-1 1OB4. The divergent angles of
the screws are fixed because of the aforementioned engagement of the screw head 180 and
locking threads 112, thus increasing the stability of the spinal implant 100 within the body,
while avoiding any concerns of the ends of the screws 108 penetrating the wall of the vertebral
body 202 or 204 from the inside out.
[0081]      Also shown in FIG. 14C, the top surface 170B of the plate 106 is generally medially
curved such that it substantially matches a curvature an outer wall of a superior vertebral body.
A similar curved region is formed from the side the bottom of the plate 106 that substantially
matches a curvature an outer wall of an inferior vertebral body. Thus, the plate 106 achieves a
better fit with the outer surface of vertebral bodies. For example, the curvature of the plate 106
reduces or eliminates any gap that may exist between the rear surface 162 of the plate 106
and an outer wall of the vertebral bodies 202 and 204, thus providing more stability (see,
region 111).
[0082]      Referring now to FIGS. 15A-1 5B, there is illustrated the spinal implant 1OOA as
implanted between two vertebral bodies. The spinal implant 1OOA may include any of the
spacer bodies 102A-1 02D and the plate 106A, thus providing an asymmetric divergence of the
screws 108. As illustrated, upper screws 108 and lower screws 108 diverge at an asymmetric
angle from a midline 109 of the implant 100. As shown, the upper screws 108(a) may diverge
at an angle between 0' and 10' with respect to the centerline 109, whereas the lower screws
108(b) may diverge at an angle between 10' and 30' with respect to the centerline 109. The
implementation of FIGS. 15A-15B is useful when working near the iliac crest because the
'flatness' or small angle of the upper screws 108 does not interfere with the iliac crest.
Although not shown, the anterior screw may angle posteriorly and the posterior screw may
angle anteriorly, as discussed above with regard to FIG. 14C.

[0083]     FIGS. 16A-16D illustrate an example spinal implant as generally positioned in the
intervertebral disc space between two vertebral bodies 202 and 204. For example, the spinal
implant 100 shown in FIGS. 16A-1 6D may be used when working in lumbar or thoracic section
of the spine. The spinal implant 100 may include any of the spacer bodies 102A-102D, as
modified (see discussion with reference to FIG. 16D below) and the plate 106C, thus providing
an asymmetric divergence of the screws 108. As shown in FIG. 16B, the upper screws 108
and lower screws 108 diverge at an asymmetric angle from a midline 109 of the implant 100.
As shown, the upper screws 108(a) may diverge at an angle between 0' and 10' with respect
to the centerline 109, whereas the lower screws 108(b) may diverge at an angle between 100
and 30' with respect to the centerline 109. Although not shown, the anterior screw may angle
posteriorly and the posterior screw may angle anteriorly, as discussed above with regard to
FIG. 14C.
[0084]     As shown in FIGS. 16D, to provide the height reduction of the plate 106C described
in FIG. 8, the bottom surfaces 136A-1 36D of the spacer bodies 102A-1 02D may be modified to
define guide grooves 1600 that align with the boreholes 11 OC2 and 11 OC4 of the plate 106C. As
such, when the screw 108 is inserted into the boreholes 11 OC2 or 110C4, the screw will pass
through an interior of the boreholes 11 OC2 or 11 OC4 and through the guide groove 1600 before
penetrating into the cortical bone of the vertebral body (e.g., vertebral bodies 202 and 204).
[0085]     The spinal implant 100 including the plate 106C enables a surgeon or any other
medical professional working in the spinal region may avoid interference with the iliac crest
when working near the sacrum using the assembled spinal implant having the plate 106C.
The plate 106C also allows for the removal of less bone in the event that osteophyte is
present.
[0086]     FIGS. 17A-1 7C illustrate another example spinal implant as generally positioned in
the intervertebral disc space between two vertebral bodies 202 and 204. The spinal implant
100 may include any of the spacer bodies 102A-102D, as modified in FIG. 16D, and the plate
106D, thus providing an asymmetric divergence of the screws 108. As shown in FIG. 17B, the
upper screws 108 and the lower screws 108 diverge at an asymmetric angle from a midline
109 of the implant 100. As shown, the upper screws 108(a) may diverge at an angle between
0' and 10' with respect to the centerline 109, whereas the lower screws 108(b) may diverge at
an angle between 10' and 30' with respect to the centerline 109. Although not shown, the

                                                -19
anterior screw may angle posteriorly and the posterior screw may angle anteriorly, as
discussed above with regard to FIG. 14C.
[0087]      In the example of FIGS. 17A-17C, the spinal implant 100, and in particular, the plate
106D is optionally configured to be mounted flush to certain portions of the anatomy in the
medial-lateral plane, as well as the cranial-caudal plane. As shown, the plate 106D provides
for a portion 902 in which material associated with the plate 106D is removed.
[0088]      Referring to FIGS. 18A-1 8B, there is illustrated a comparison of access windows that
may be opened during a spinal implant procedure. FIG. 18A illustrates the access window
when one of plates 106C or 106D are utilized. The spinal implant 100 allows for an equivalent
access window when the placement of screws 108 is carried out through 0'. As shown, the
plate 106C or 106D has an approximately 1 mm-2 mm overhang with respect to the outer wall
of the vertebral body 202. However, there is no overhang with respect to the vertebral body
204. In FIG. 18B, in contrast, illustrates the spinal implant using the plate 106A. The access
window in FIG. 18B, is slightly larger to accommodate insertion of the screws 108 through the
boreholes in the slightly larger plate 106A.
[0089]      FIGS. 19A-1 9C illustrate another spinal implant 1OOB of the present disclosure. The
spinal implant 1OOB is depicted in which the boreholes 110 and screws 108 are aligned along
the midline 125 of a plate 106E in accordance with a fifth embodiment. The centralized
location of the boreholes 110 and screws 108 presents less risk of the screws 108 breaking
through the anterior cortex, thus reducing the likelihood of causing vessel damage. In FIG.
19A, there is shown a side view of the plate 106E showing a side 160E. The lower borehole
11   E2 may be formed at an approximately 20' angle with respect to a lateral center plane 161 E
of the plate 106E. The upper borehole 11 OE1 may be formed at an approximately 20' angle
with respect to the lateral center plane 161 E.
[0090]      In the front view of FIG. 19C, the upper borehole 11 OE1 may be located a distance Du
from the lateral center plane 161 E. The lower borehole 11 OE2 may be located a distance DL
from a lateral center plane 161 E. The distance Du may range from approximate 2.75 mm to
6.75 mm. Similarly, the distance DL may range from approximately 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm.
Because of the symmetric shape of the plate 106E, the ratio of DL:Du is maintained at 1, thus
DL and Du are equal for all sizes of DL and Du implemented in the plate 106E. The plate 106E
may have a height H that ranges from approximately 15 mm to 23 mm. The distance Q

                                                 - 20
between the outer edges of the boreholes in a vertical direction may range from approximately
12 mm to 20 mm, thus providing approximately 1.5 mm of material between the outer edge of
the borehole and the edge of the plate 106E. The distance U between the inner edges of the
boreholes may range from approximately 0.5 mm to 8.5 mm.
[0091]      As shown in FIG. 19B, the above offsets of the central axis causes the screws 108
inserted therein to diverge at symmetric angles about the lateral center plane 161 E of the plate
106E. It is noted that central axis 153E and 155E of the lower and upper boreholes may be
offset at any angle between 5' and 20' with respect to the horizontal axis 154E and 156E.
Although not shown, the plate 106E may provide for asymmetric divergence of the screws, as
described with regard to the plate 106A. Other aspects of the plate 106E maybe similar to the
plate 106A, for example, the rear surface of the plate 106E may be curved to provide a better
fit with the outer walls of the vertebral bodies 202 and 204.
[0092]      Referring now to FIG. 20, there is illustrated another spinal implant 100C having a
plate 106F in accordance with a sixth embodiment to provide for alternative screw positions.
The spinal implant 100C allows the surgeon or medical professional to minimize the opening
required for placement of the screws 108, as the plate 106F comprises boreholes 110 that are
proximate to a centerline 107F of the plate 106F.
[0093]      In particular, the plate 106F may be configured similarly as the plate 106B with
boreholes 11 OB2 and 11 OB3 removed from the plate 106B. The lower borehole 11 OF2 may be
formed at an approximately 20' angle with respect to a lateral center plane 161F of the plate
106F. The upper borehole 11 0 F1 may be formed at an approximately 20' angle with respect to
the lateral center plane 161 F. This causes the screws 108 inserted therein to diverge at
symmetric angles about the lateral center plane 161F of the plate 106F. It is noted that central
axis 153F and 155F of the lower and upper boreholes may be offset at any angle between 5'
and 20' with respect to the horizontal axis 154F and 156F. Although not shown, the plate 106F
may provide for asymmetric divergence of the screws, as described with regard to the plate
106A.
[0094]      The upper borehole 11 OF1 may be located a distance Du from the lateral center plane
161F. the lower boreholes 11 OF2 may be located a distance DL from a lateral center plane
161F. The distance Du may range from approximate 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm. Similarly, the
distance DL may range from approximately 2.75 mm to 6.75 mm. Because of the symmetric

                                               -21
shape of the plate 106B, the ratio of DL:Du is maintained at 1, thus DL and Du are equal for all
sizes of DL and Du implemented in the plate 106F. The plate 106F may have a height H that
ranges from approximately 15 mm to 23 mm. The distance Q between the outer edges of the
boreholes in a vertical direction may range from approximately 12 mm to 20 mm, thus
providing approximately 1.5 mm of material between the outer edge of the borehole and the
edge of the plate 106B. The distance U between the inner edges of the boreholes may range
from approximately 0.5 mm to 8.5 mm. Optionally, the boreholes 11 OF2 and 11 0 F2 of plate
106F may be configured to enable the anterior screw to angle posteriorly, while and the
posterior screw's trajectory may be straight or angled anteriorly.
[0095]     FIGS. 21A-21D illustrate another spinal implant 100D having a plate 106G in
accordance with a seventh embodiment the present disclosure. The plate 106G is configured
to enable the use of three screws 108 with the spinal implant 1OOG when inserted into an
intervertebral space between two vertebral bodies. The plate 106G may be configured with
two upper boreholes 11 OG1 and 11 OG3 and a lower borehole 11 OG2. As show in FIGS. 21A and
21C, the upper boreholes may have similar characteristics as boreholes 11 OB and 11 OB3-     In
particular, the upper boreholes 11 OG and 11 OG3 may be formed having an approximately 5'
angle with respect to the lateral center plane 161G. The lower borehole 11 OG2 may be formed
having an approximately 20' angle with respect the lateral center plane 161G of the plate
106G. As show in FIG. 21 B, the upper boreholes 11 OG and 11 OG3 may be formed having an
approximately 20' angle with respect to the lateral center plane 161G. The lower borehole
11 0G2 may be formed having an approximately 20' angle with respect the lateral center plane
161G of the plate 106G.
[0096]      As shown in FIGS. 21A and 21C, the above offsets of the central longitudinal plant
causes the screws 108 inserted therein to diverge at asymmetric angles about the lateral
center plane 161G of the plate 106G, whereas in FIG. 21B the screws 108 inserted therein to
diverge at symmetric angles about the lateral center plane 161G of the plate 106G. It is noted
that the lower and upper boreholes may be offset at any angle between 5' and 20' with
respect to the lateral center plane 161G.
[0097]     As shown in FIG. 21 D, in accordance with the discussion of FIG. 14C, the upper
borehole 110G1 may be formed such that it is laterally offset at approximately a 3' angle. The
upper boreholes 11 OG3 may be formed having a laterally offset at approximately a 10 angle.

                                                - 22
The divergence of the screws inserted into the boreholes 11    OG  and 11 OG3 is shown in FIG.
21D.
[0098]      FIGS. 22A-22C illustrate views of another embodiment of a spinal implant 100 of the
present disclosure. The spinal implant 200 may be anteriorly inserted into an intervertebral
space between two vertebral bodies 222 and 220. For example, the spinal implant 200 may be
used for L5-S1 and impart stability to a lytic spondylolisthesis. The spinal implant 200 includes
an intervertebral spacer body 202. The intervertebral spacer body 102 includes a pair of
opposite sides 204. Each opposite side 204 optionally has pyramid-shaped teeth 218 that are
provided to frictionally engage top and bottom surfaces of a vertebral body. The spinal implant
200 also includes a plate 206. The plate 206 has a width of 20 mm to 40 mm and a height of
10 mm to 50 mm. The plate 206 is comprised of a front surface and a rear surface, and may
be contoured to optimally engage the vertebral bodies 222 and 220. The plate 206 may include
at least two upper boreholes 210 and at least two lower boreholes 210, respectively,
asymmetrically positioned about a centerline 207.
[0099]      As shown in FIG. 22B, the upper screws 108(a) and the lower screws 108(b) may
diverge at an asymmetric angle from a midline 209 of the implant 200. The screws 108 attach
the plate 206 to the vertebral bodies (e.g., L5 and S1), between which the intervertebral spacer
body 202 may be inserted. The plate 206 is shaped such that the insertion angles of the
screws 108 are such that a surgeon may use a straight screwdriver to the insert the screws
108 into the boreholes 210 of the plate 206. The plate 206 provides for ease of insertion and
biomechanical integrity. The plate 206 defines a region to mate with the intervertebral spacer
body 202. A portion of the rear surface of the plate 206 is adapted to contact a wall of the
vertebral body (e.g., body 222).
[00100]     With reference to FIG. 2C, the spacer body 202 includes a flange 221 and defines a
recess 223 that is adapted to engage a coupling 224 of the plate 206. The engagement of the
flange 221 and the coupling 224 prevents lateral and rotational movement of the plate 206 with
respect to the intervertebral spacer body 202. A screw (not shown) may be inserted into a
central hole of the plate 206 to secure the plate 206 to the spacer body 202. The lower screws
108(b) may from an angle 6 with respect to longitudinal axis of the implant 200. The angle 6
may be approximately 20'. The divergent angles of the lower screws 108(b) increases the
stability of the implant 200. In general, the top set of screws may be parallel and bottom set
may be at an angle such that in multiple levels, the bottom (diverging) set of screws do not

                                                 - 23
interfere with the top (parallel) set of screws. The angle 6 may be fixed by the aforementioned
engagement of the locking threads within the boreholes with the complementary locking
threads of the screw heads. The spacer body 202 may have a length to width ratio of
approximately between 0.3 and 0.5 when used for, e.g., anterior procedures.
[00101]    Many modifications and other embodiments of the disclosure set forth herein will
come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this disclosure pertains having the benefit of the
teachings presented in the foregoing description. Therefore, it is to be understood that the
