Abstract
A groove cutting assembly 10 for a turret punch 300 comprises an upper (first) section 20 and
a lower (second) section 30. The lower section 30 comprises a housing 32 adapted to be
positioned within a load station of the lower turret 304. The housing 32 comprises an internal
space 33 within which a cutting wheel 100 is disposed. The cutting wheel 100 is oriented in a
generally vertical manner and is actively rotatably driven in use about its central horizontal
rotation axis 37 by a motor 38, which is also disposed within the internal space 33. The cutting
wheel 100 comprises a plurality of spaced cutting elements 110 disposed about its periphery.
The housing 32 comprises a top cover plate 42 having an elongated opening 44 formed
therein, through which the cutting periphery of the cutting wheel 100 partially protrudes. The
amount that the cutting wheel 100 protrudes from the cover plate 42 will determine the depth
of the cut into the workpiece 310 in use. The upper section 20 also comprises a housing 22
adapted to be positioned within a load station 301 of the upper turret 302. The housing 22
provides a rotation seat 23 for a roller 60 which is passively rotatable about its horizontal
rotation axis 62, which is parallel and generally vertically aligned with the rotation axis 37 of
the cutting wheel 100. The roller 60 can be adapted for omnidirectional or indexed rotation.

           Complete Specification For The Invention Entitled:
IMPROVEMENT TO MULTIPLE TOOL STATION CNC TURRET PUNCH PRESS
          The invention is described in the following statement:

                                                    2
Field of the Invention
[1]      The present invention relates to an improvement to a multiple tool station CNC turret
punch press.
Background of the Invention
[2]      Figures 1 and 2 show an example of a computer numerical control (CNC) punch press
machine 300 having rotatable upper turret 302 and lower turret 304. The upper turret 302
carries a plurality of punch tools of various sizes and shapes in its load stations 301, while the
lower turret 304 carries a plurality of dies in its load stations which respectively correspond to
the tools carried by the upper turret 302. Corresponding rotation of the turrets 302 and 304
under control of a CNC processor 308 brings a selected pair of tool and die into registry under
the ram 303 of the punch press 300 to perform a multitude of functions including (but not
limited to) punching, pinching, tapping, forming, offsetting, ribbing and shearing.
[3]      The primary function of a CNC turret punch press is that of a vertical striker driven by
the ram 303 imparting sharp blows to one end of a punch tool, causing the shaped opposite
end of the punch tool to rapidly and forcefully impact the sheet material workpiece 310. This
punches a hole or creates a shaped contour in the sheet material workpiece 310 having a
desired configuration roughly corresponding to the configuration of the shaped punch end.
[4]      The sheet metal workpiece 310 is held in place with hydraulic sheet clamps 320 and
is moved by the CNC processor.
[5]      The turret punch 300 is however limited to a punching action.
[6]      The present invention seeks to overcome or substantially ameliorate at least some of
the deficiencies of the prior art, or to at least provide an alternative.
[7]      It is to be understood that, if any prior art information is referred to herein, such
reference does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the common
general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.

Description of Embodiments
[35]     It should be noted in the following description that like or the same reference numerals
in different embodiments denote the same or similar features.
[36]     Figures 2 and 3 show a groove cutting assembly 10 for a turret punch 300 in
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.                The assembly 10
comprises an upper (first) section 20 and a lower (second) section 30.
[37]     The lower section 30 comprises a housing 32 adapted to be positioned within a load
station of the lower turret 304. The housing 32 comprises an internal space 33 within which a
cutting wheel 100 is disposed. The cutting wheel 100 is oriented in a generally vertical manner
and is actively rotatably driven in use about its central horizontal rotation axis 37 by a motor
38, which is also disposed within the internal space 33. The cutting wheel 100 comprises a
plurality of spaced cutting elements 110 disposed about its periphery. Alternatively, the cutting
wheel can comprise a continuous abrasive periphery edge to perform the grooving.
[38]     The housing 32 comprises a top cover plate 42 having an elongated opening 44 formed
therein, through which the cutting periphery of the cutting wheel 100 partially protrudes. The
amount that the cutting wheel 100 protrudes from the cover plate 42 will determine the depth

                                                  5
of the cut into the workpiece 310 in use. Alternatively, control can be provided for moving the
cutting wheel 100 within the internal space 33 for varying the resulting depth of cut.
[39]    The upper section 20 also comprises a housing 22 adapted to be positioned within a
load station 301 of the upper turret 302. The housing 22 provides a rotation seat 23 for a roller
60 which is passively rotatable about its horizontal rotation axis 62, which is parallel and
generally vertically aligned with the rotation axis 37 of the cutting wheel 100. The roller 60 can
be adapted for omnidirectional or indexed rotation.
[40]    The present invention thus provides an active motorised grooving wheel tool 100
locatable within a lower turret 304 of a CNC turret punch press 300. The assembly 10 is one
of the possible tools provided for the punch press 300. If a groove is required to be formed in
a workpiece 310, the assembly 100 is selected and the workpiece 310 is moved by the CNC
processor 308 as above.
[41]    The cutting wheel 100 is actively rotatably driven by the motor 38.           The cutting
elements 110 groove and remove material from the workpiece 310, without fully penetrating
the workpiece 310. The corresponding roller 60 located in the upper turret 302 simultaneously
engages the workpiece 310 at its opposite (non-work) face to provide resistance to the sheet
material when the motorised grooving wheel tool 100 is cutting material from the workpiece
310. The roller 60 ensures the depth of the formed groove is accurate and consistent.
[42]    The housing 32 within the load station of the lower turret 304 is rotatably indexed about
the vertical axis along the entire 360 degrees (as indicated by arrows 80). This allows the
horizontal rotation axis 37 of the cutting wheel 100 to be oriented at any required angle around
the vertical axis (and retained at that orientation), to cut a groove in the workpiece 310 in any
required direction. In the example shown, the cutting wheel 100 is at 900 orientation in Figure
4 relative to the orientation shown in Figure 3. The roller 60 in the upper turret 302 is also
correspondingly oriented around the vertical axis. A CNC processor is used to control both
the orientation of the motorised groove cutting wheel 100 and also to accurately control the
depth of the cut groove.
[43]     Figure 5 shows examples of a rounded (radius) cutting profile 140 and an edged
(squared) cutting profile 150 for the cutting elements 110 of the cutting wheel 100.          Also
shown therein are examples of deep depth (141, 151) and shallow depth (142, 152) of groove
cut into the workpiece 310. The depth and shape of the groove will determine the bending
properties of the workpiece 310 at the groove locations. The workpiece 310 in the example is
a composite panel comprising an outer skin 101, an inner skin 121 and an intermediate core
131. The cutting wheel 100 allows grooves to be cut into the inner skin 121 and core 131, but
not the outer skin 101.

                                                   6
[44]     The CNC processor 308 incrementally controls the height of the groove wheel tool 100
in use, which determines the depth of the formed groove folding lines and bending radius of
the folds. The groove wheel tool 100 can also be provided with various shaped teeth for
grooving of different sheet materials.
[45]     As the groove folding lines are formed from the underside of the composite sheet
material 310, all swarf material is collected below the workpiece and the surface is kept clear
and clean.
[46]     The preferred embodiment thus allows large panels, in the example being composite
panels, to be processed on one machine for both punching and grooving operations. This
eliminates relocating the very large workpiece (up to 2m x 2.1m sheet size) to a separate
grooving machine from a punch machine.
[47]     Whilst preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be
apparent to skilled persons that modifications can be made to the embodiments described.
For example, the cutting wheel can be embodied in other forms, such as a cutting tool rotatable
about a vertical axis, for example a router bit. The upper and side edges of such a cutting tool
can then form the grooves in the workpiece.
[48]     It is also possible to reverse the positions of the upper and lower sections, to have the
cutting wheel on top and the support roller on the bottom relative to the workpiece.
[49]     It is also possible to omit the support roller, for example in cases where the workpiece
has a thick cross-section and is heavy. The support roller can also be replaced by a different
support means, such as a solid stationary item with a slide surface thereon which engages
the workpiece.
[50]     The motor for driving the cutting wheel can be electric, pneumatic, hydraulic or any
suitable driving means.
[51]     The preferred embodiment thus provides a CNC turret punch press machine and
method for secondary machining of accurate groove folding lines in large composite sheet
panel material.
[52]     The preferred embodiment also provides a CNC turret punch press machine and
method that accurately grooves from the underside of the composite sheet material without
having to reposition or relocate the workpiece to a separate machining facility.
[53]     The preferred embodiment also provides an assembly for a motorised grooving wheel
tool disposed within a lower turret of a CNC turret punch press with a corresponding upper
roller simultaneously engaged to provide resistance to the composite sheet material. In the

                                                 7
embodiment, the motorised grooving wheel tool is automatically power activated via a
command from the CNC processor.
[54]     The preferred embodiment provides an integrated CNC turret punch press capable of
providing complete machining functions to process composite sheet materials without
requiring relocation to separate or additional machining facilities.
[55]     The preferred embodiment provides a motorised grooving wheel tool located in a lower
tool station of a CNC turret punch press for grooving lines in a composite sheet material, for
folding the sheet material, whereas otherwise the sheet material would require to be relocated
to another machine.
[56]     The preferred embodiment provides a motorized tool (routing/grooving) being located
within a tool station of a turret punch press.
[57]     The preferred embodiment provides a tool for use with a rotatable CNC turret punch
press provided with a plurality of upper and lower tool holders, said tool is an electric motor to
drive a grooving wheel tool which is mounted within a lower turret tool holder, and an opposing
roller tool located within the upper turret tool holder which is simultaneously engaged to
provide resistance to the composite sheet material
[58]     In the preferred embodiment, the grooving wheel tool is an active tool, driven via an
electric motor which is activated automatically upon the tool being presented to the punching
station.
[59]     In the preferred embodiment, the grooving wheel tool is indexed with the ability to
rotate 360 degrees to groove lines in any required direction.
[60]     In the preferred embodiment, the tool is indexed using existing hardware and software.
[61]     In the preferred embodiment, the existing CNC processor presents the groove wheel
tool at predetermined height increments to control groove line depths.
[62]     In the preferred embodiment, the CNC processor is activated when the turret is rotated
to a predetermined tool holder position.
[63]     In the preferred embodiment, the tool can be easily and economically retrofitted to
existing CNC turret punch machines that utilise an indexing station.
[64]     In the preferred embodiment, the grooving wheel tool is a circular saw blade with
varying teeth profiles for grooving lines into materials of different properties.
[65]     In the preferred embodiment, the grooving wheel tool grooves folding lines from the
underside of the composite sheet material, with all swarf material being collected below the
workpiece ensuring the surface is kept clear and clean.

                                            8
[66]  The preferred embodiment upgrades the CNC turret punch press into a complete
composite sheet material processing centre.
