9844902_1 (GHMatters) P107933.AU

                                                                3
arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following
drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being
carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology
used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
                                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0018]                      FIGS. 1-9 illustrate an inflator tool 10 that is used to inflate or deflate inflatable
devices (e.g., an air mattress, a tire, etc.). The inflator tool 10 is a handheld, battery operated
power tool having a motor 14 (e.g., a brushed or brushless AC or DC motor 14) operatively
coupled to a rotor or fan18 that drives pressurized airflow (FIG. 9). As will be described in
greater detail below, the spatial configuration of the components of the inflator tool 10 allow for a
compact inflator.
[0019]                      The inflator tool 10 includes a housing 22 having a handle portion 26 extending
between a tool head portion 30 and a battery receiving portion 34. The handle portion 26
includes a generally cylindrical grip 38 defining a longitudinal axis 42 of the handle portion
26. The handle portion 26 further includes an actuator 46 (e.g., a trigger) movable relative to the
handle portion 26 that is configured to control operation of the inflator tool 10 (e.g., activate the
motor 14). At least a portion of the motor 14 is supported within the handle portion 26 (FIG. 9).
[0020]                      With reference to FIG. 2, the battery receiving portion 34 is disposed at a first end
of the handle portion 26 and is configured to detachably receive a rechargeable power tool
battery pack (e.g., a lithium-ion battery pack; not shown) within a battery cavity 50. The battery
cavity 50 is disposed on a lower surface of the tool 10 and includes engagement features to
electrically and mechanically couple the battery pack such that the battery pack can provide
power to the inflator tool 10. The engagement features include, for example, electrical contacts
to facilitate electrical communication, alignment members guiding attachment of the battery
pack, and a latch mechanism to maintain engagement of the battery pack to the tool.
[0021]                      In one embodiment, the battery pack is a 'slide on' battery pack that is attached to
the inflator tool 10 along a first battery insertion axis 54 that extends in a direction that is
generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 42 of the handle portion 26 (FIG. 2). In another
embodiment, the battery pack is an axially insertable battery pack that is attached to the inflator
9844902_1 (GHMatters) P107933.AU

                                                              4
tool 10 along a second battery insertion axis 58 that is generally parallel to or collinear with the
longitudinal axis 42 of the handle portion 26 (FIG. 2). In yet another embodiment, the inflator
tool 10 is configured to be coupled to an external power source via a cord (i.e., the inflator tool
10 is a corded power tool).
[0022]                      With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the battery receiving portion 34 also includes a
retention member 62 disposed on a surface of the battery receiving portion 34 that is opposite
the battery cavity 50. The retention member 62 releasably retains at least one inflator tool
accessory 66, such as an inflation adapter or a deflation adapter. The retention member 62 may
engage the inflator tool 10 accessories by any known mechanism (e.g., interference fit, snap fit,
threaded engagement, sliding engagement, etc.).
[0023]                      With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the tool head portion 30 is disposed
on a second end of the handle portion 26 and is defined by a substantially arcuate body 70 and
an outlet body 78 extending radially away from the arcuate body 70. The body 70 delimits an air
driving chamber or compression chamber 74 extending concentrically about the rotor 18 (FIGS.
8-9). One lateral side of the body 70 includes a planar outer surface 82 (FIG. 3). An opposite
side of the body 70 includes a channel 86 defined by an inner wall 90 facing laterally outward,
an upper surface 94, a lower surface 98 and ribs 102 extending between the upper surface 94
and the lower surface 98 (FIG. 4). As seen in FIGS. 4-7, an outer periphery of the upper and
lower surfaces 94, 98 defines a first radius R1 of the body 70 that is substantially equivalent to a
radius R defined by the planar outer surface 82. However, the inner wall 90 defines a second
radius R2 that is less than the first radius R1. As will be described in greater detail below, this
results in the compression chamber 74 having a spirally shaped delimiting interior wall 126 (FIG.
8).
[0024]                      With reference to FIG. 7, an air inlet 106 is formed on a top surface 110 of the
arcuate body 70 to fluidly communicate the air compression chamber 74 with the surrounding
environment. The air inlet 106 includes a cylindrical inlet member 114 having a bore 118
extending therethrough. In the illustrated embodiment, the bore 118 includes one or more ribs
or vanes 122 extending across the bore 118 that may, for example, prevent foreign objects from
entering the compression chamber 74. As seen in FIG. 7, the illustrated inlet member 114 is
disposed in a central location on the top surface 110 of the arcuate body 70.
9844902_1 (GHMatters) P107933.AU

                                                                 5
[0025]                      With reference to FIG. 8, the compression chamber 74 is delimited by the interior
wall 126 extending around an air driving assembly 130 that is a centrifugal fan or pump including
the rotor 18 in the illustrated embodiment. The rotor 18 is operatively coupled to an output shaft
134 of the motor 14 (FIG. 9) and includes curved blades 138 extending from a hub 142 toward
the interior wall 126. The interior wall 126 is a curved wall having a center defined by the center
of the rotor 18. A radius defined by the wall 126 increases along a circumferential direction of
the wall 126 (e.g., along a counter-clockwise direction with respect to FIG. 8). Accordingly, a
circumferential clearance C1 is defined between an outer periphery of the rotor 18 and the
interior wall 126. The circumferential clearance C1 is in fluid communication with the outlet body
78.
[0026]                      With continued reference to FIG. 8, channels 148 in the rotor 18 are defined
between adjacent blades 138, such that the channels 148 extend from the hub 142 to the outer
periphery of the rotor 18. The channels 148 fluidly communicate the air inlet 106 with the
circumferential clearance C1.
[0027]                      The outlet body 78 extends away from the arcuate body 70 and defines an air
outlet 80 (FIG. 8). The air outlet 80 includes at least one retention member for engaging an
inflation adapter 150. In the illustrated embodiment, the retention member is a bayonet style
retention mechanism including a protrusion on the tool that is received and retained within a slot
of the adapter 150. However, other retention mechanisms (e.g., interference fit, threaded
engagement, etc.) may be used in place of the bayonet style retention mechanism.
[0028]                      With reference to FIGS. 8 and 9, the outlet body 78 expands in the radial direction
moving towards the air outlet 80 to define a diffusion portion 154. At the air outlet 80, the
inflation adapter 150 may be attached. In the illustrated example, the inflation adapter 150
includes a body that narrows radially inwardly to define a nozzle portion. However, in other
embodiments, the outlet body 78, the inflation adapter 150 or both the outlet body 78 and the
inflation adapter 150 may extend linearly (i.e., a diffusion portion or a nozzle portion are not
defined).
[0029]                      Collectively, the air inlet 106, the compression chamber 74, and the air outlet 80
define an airflow path 146 extending through the inflator tool 10 (FIG. 9). Air is drawn in through
the air inlet 106 to the compression chamber 74, where the air is pressurized/accelerated and
9844902_1 (GHMatters) P107933.AU

                                                                 6
driven through the outlet body 78 toward the air outlet 80. More specifically, air drawn through
the air inlet 106 enters the compression chamber 74 at the hub 142 of the rotor 18 and is
directed to flow radially outwardly along the channels 148 of the rotor 18. After exiting the rotor
18, the air enters into the circumferential clearance C1 and is directed to flow to the outlet body
78 (e.g., in a counter-clockwise direction in FIG. 8). From the outlet body 78, the air is directed
out of the air outlet 80.
[0030]                      FIG. 9 illustrates the spatial relationships and orientations of the components of
the inflator tool 10. The motor 14 includes the output shaft 134 operatively coupled to the rotor
18. The output shaft 134 defines a motor axis or rotor rotation axis 158. The inlet member 114
and the air inlet 106 define an air inlet axis 162 that is generally coaxial with the motor axis
158. However, in other embodiments, the inlet member 114 may be disposed on the housing 22
at different location such that the air inlet axis 162 is spaced from the motor axis 158. In such an
embodiment, the air inlet axis 162 may be parallel to the motor axis 158, or alternatively may be
disposed at an oblique angle relative to the motor axis 158.
[0031]                      With continued reference to FIG. 9, the motor axis 158 is disposed an oblique
angle relative to the longitudinal axis 42 of the handle portion 26 (e.g., an angle that is less than
approximately 30 degrees). However, in other embodiments, the motor axis 158 and the axis 42
of the handle may be parallel or collinear.
[0032]                      With continued reference to FIG. 9, the outlet body 78 extends along an outlet
axis 166 that is substantially orthogonal to the motor axis 158 and the air inlet axis 162. In
addition, the outlet axis 166 is angled relative to the longitudinal axis 42 of the handle portion
(e.g., an angle of approximately 60-120 degrees). This orientation results in the airflow path 146
entering along a first axis and exiting along a second axis. However, in other embodiments, the
outlet axis 166 may be disposed at an oblique angle to the air inlet axis 162 and/or the motor
axis 158.
[0033]                      In operation, a user couples the inflator tool 10 to an inflatable device (e.g., via
engagement between the inflation adapter 150 and a port on the inflatable device) and operates
the actuator 46 to drive the motor 14 and, in turn, the rotor 18. Rotation of the rotor 18 draws air
into the compression chamber 74 via the air inlet 106 towards the hub 142, where the air is
directed into the channels 148 between the blades 138. The air in the channels 148 is driven in
9844902_1 (GHMatters) P107933.AU

                                                                7
a radial and circumferential direction to drive airflow into the circumferential clearance C1 and
along the interior wall 126 toward the outlet body 78. When the air reaches the diffusion portion
of the outlet body 78, the air is decelerated and the pressure is increased as it continues toward
the air outlet 80. At the air outlet 80, when the inflation adapter 150 is attached, the nozzle
portion accelerates the air and the pressure is decreased as it exits the air outlet 80 and enters
the inflatable device.
[0034]                      When the inflator tool 10 is desired for use as a deflator tool, a user may couple
the inlet member 114 to the port of an inflatable device either directly or via an adapter. As
described above, the user will then operate the inflator tool 10 to drive airflow through the air
inlet 106 and out of the air outlet 80, thereby driving air out of the inflatable device.
[0035]                      The inflator tool 10 described above advantageously provides a compact tool for
driving airflow based on the spatial configuration and components of the tool described above.
In addition, the tool provides a handheld, 'pistol grip' style powered tool for inflating and deflating
inflatable devices.
[0036]                      Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain
preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or
more independent aspects of the invention as described.
[0037]                      In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication,
the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive
sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or
addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
