    THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR METHODS OF USE
                                      CLAIM OF PRIORITY
        This application claims priority from International Application No. PCT/CN2012/070601,
filed January 19, 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
        Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to
2-oxoglutarate (i.e., a-ketoglutarate). These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of
which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate
dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which
localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases,
one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. Each NADP(+)-dependent
isozyme is a homodimer.
        IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), cytosolic) is also known as IDH; IDP;
IDCD; IDPC or PICD. The protein encoded by this gene is the NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate
dehydrogenase found in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. It contains the PTS-1 peroxisomal
targeting signal sequence. The presence of this enzyme in peroxisomes suggests roles in the
regeneration of NADPH for intraperoxisomal reductions, such as the conversion of 2, 4-dienoyl
CoAs to 3-enoyl-CoAs, as well as in peroxisomal reactions that consume 2-oxoglutarate, namely
the alpha-hydroxylation of phytanic acid. The cytoplasmic enzyme serves a significant role in
cytoplasmic NADPH production.
        The human IDH1 gene encodes a protein of 414 amino acids. The nucleotide and amino
acid sequences for human IDH1 can be found as GenBank entries NM_005896.2 and
NP_005887.2 respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for IDH1 are also
described in, e.g., Nekrutenko et al., Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:1674-1684(1998); Geisbrecht et al., J.
Biol. Chem. 274:30527-30533(1999); Wiemann et al., Genome Res. 11:422-435(2001); The
MGC Project Team, Genome Res. 14:2121-2127(2004); Lubec et al., Submitted (DEC-2008) to
UniProtKB; Kullmann et al., Submitted (JUN-1996) to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases;

                                                  1

Non-mutant, e.g., wild type, IDHI catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to u
ketoglutarate thereby reducing NAD* (NADP*) to NADH (NADPH), e.g., in the forward
reaction:
        Isocitrate + NAD* (NADP) -+ a-KG + C02 + NADH (NADPH) + H+.
        It has been discovered that mutations of IDHI present in certain cancer cells result in
a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of a-ketoglutarate
to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The production of 2HG is believed to contribute to the
formation and progression of cancer (Dang, L et al, Nature 2009, 462:739-44).
        The inhibition of mutant IDHI and its neoactivity is therefore a potential therapeutic
treatment for cancer. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for inhibitors of IDHI mutants
having alpha hydroxyl neoactivity.

         The compounds of this invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus
occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, scalemic mixtures, and diastereomeric mixtures, as well as
single enantiomers or individual stereoisomers that are substantially free from another possible
enantiomer or stereoisomer. The term "substantially free of other stereoisomers" as used herein
means a preparation enriched in a compound having a selected stereochemistry at one or more
                                               6

98%, or 99%. The term "enriched" means that at least the designated percentage of a
preparation is the compound having a selected stereochemistry at one or more selected
stereocenters.   Methods of obtaining or synthesizing an individual enantiomer or stereoisomer
for a given compound are known in the art and may be applied as practicable to final compounds
or to starting material or intermediates.
         In one embodiment, the compound is enriched in a specific stereoisomer by at least about
60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%.
         The compounds of formula I, II, 11-a, 11-a-1, 11-b or 11-b-I may also comprise one or more
isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including IH, 2H (D or
                                                                                12   13        14
deuterium), and 3H (T or tritium); C may be in any isotopic form, including       C,    C, and    C; 0
may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 180; and the like. For example, the compound is
enriched in a specific isotopic form of H, C and/or 0 by at least about 6 0%, 6 5%, 7 0%, 7 5%,
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%.
         Unless otherwise indicated when a disclosed compound is named or depicted by a
structure without specifying the stereochemistry and has one or more chiral centers, it is
understood to represent all possible stereoisomers of the compound.
         The compounds of this invention may also be represented in multiple tautomeric forms,
in such instances, the invention expressly includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds
described herein, even though only a single tautomeric form may be represented (e.g., alkylation
of a ring system may result in alkylation at multiple sites, the invention expressly includes all
such reaction products). All such isomeric forms of such compounds are expressly included in
the present invention.
         Compounds described herein may be prepared following procedures detailed in the
examples and other analogous methods known to one skilled in the art. Compounds produced by

 any of the schemes set forth below may be further modified (e.g., through the addition of
 substituents to rings, etc.) to produce additional compounds. The specific approaches and
 compounds shown herein are not intended to be limiting. The suitability of a chemical group in
 a compound structure for use in the synthesis of another compound is within the knowledge of
 one of ordinary skill in the art. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group
 methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the applicable compounds are
 known in the art and include, for example, those described in Larock R, Comprehensive Organic
 Transformations,VCH Publishers (1989); Greene, TW et al., Protective Groups in Organic
 Synthesis, 3 rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1999); Fieser, L et al., FieserandFieser'sReagentsfor
 Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and Paquette, L, ed., Encyclopedia ofReagents
for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.
          Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those
 that result in the formation of stable compounds.
          It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of
 the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of
 pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, "Pharmaceutically
 Acceptable Salts." J. Pharm. Sci. Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.
          For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic
 (e.g., -COOH may be -COO-), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of
 suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na* and KY,
 alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as A13+. Examples of
 suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4 ) and
 substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R*, NH 2R2 +,NHR3 +, NR 4 ). Examples of some suitable
 substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine,
 dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
 piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as
 amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is
N(CH3)4.
          If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group that may be cationic (e.g., -NH 2
 may be -NH3*), then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable inorganic

Methods of Use
        Provided is a method for inhibiting a mutant IDHI or IDH2 activity comprising
contacting a subject in need thereof with a compound (including its tautomers and/or
isotopologues) of structural formula I, I, I-a, I-a-1, I-b, or I-b-I or a compound described
in any one of the embodiments herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In one
embodiment, the cancer to be treated is characterized by a mutant allele of IDH 1 or IDH2
wherein the IDHI or IDH2 mutation results in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the
NADPH-dependent reduction of a-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate in a subject. In
one aspect of this embodiment, the mutant IDHi has an R132X mutation. In one aspect of
this embodiment, the R132X mutation is selected from R132H, R132C, R132L, R132V,
R132S and R132G. In another aspect, the R132X mutation is R132H or R132C. In yet
another aspect, the R132X mutation is R132H.
                                                 51

         Also provided are methods of treating a cancer characterized by the presence of a
mutant allele of IDHI comprising the step of administering to subject in need thereof (a) a
compound of formula I, II, II-a, II-a-1, II-b, or II-b-1, or a compound described in any one of
the embodiments herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or (b) a
pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
         In one embodiment, the cancer to be treated is characterized by a mutant allele of
IDH1 wherein the IDH1 mutation results in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the
NADPH-dependent reduction of a-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate in a patient. In
one aspect of this embodiment, the IDHI mutation is an R132X mutation. In another aspect
of this embodiment, the R132X mutation is selected from R132H, R132C, R132L, R132V,
R132S and R132G. In another aspect, the R132X mutation is R132 H or R132C. A cancer
can be analyzed by sequencing cell samples to determine the presence and specific nature of
(e.g., the changed amino acid present at) a mutation at amino acid 132 of IDHI.
         Without being bound by theory, applicants believe that mutant alleles of IDHI
wherein the IDHI mutation results in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH
dependent reduction of a-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and in particular R132H
mutations of IDHI, characterize a subset of all types of cancers, without regard to their
cellular nature or location in the body. Thus, the compounds and methods of this invention
are useful to treat any type of cancer that is characterized by the presence of a mutant allele of
IDHI imparting such acitivity and in particular an IDHI R132H or R132C mutation.
         In one aspect of this embodiment, the efficacy of cancer treatment is monitored by
measuring the levels of 2HG in the subject. Typically levels of 2HG are measured prior to
treatment, wherein an elevated level is indicated for the use of the compound of formula I, II,
II-a, II-a-1, II-b, or II-b-I or a compound described in any one of the embodiments described
herein to treat the cancer. Once the elevated levels are established, the level of 2HG is
determined during the course of and/or following termination of treatment to establish
efficacy. In certain embodiments, the level of 2HG is only determined during the course of
and/or following termination of treatment. A reduction of 2HG levels during the course of
treatment and following treatment is indicative of efficacy. Similarly, a determination that
2HG levels are not elevated during the course of or following treatment is also indicative of
efficacy. Typically, the these 2HG measurements will be utilized together with other well
known determinations of efficacy of cancer treatment, such as reduction in number and size
                                                 52

these 2HG measurements will be utilized together with other well-known determinations of
efficacy of cancer treatment, such as reduction in number and size of tumors and/or other cancer
associated lesions, improvement in the general health of the subject, and alterations in other
biomarkers that are associated with cancer treatment efficacy.
        2HG can be detected in a sample by LC/MS. The sample is mixed 80:20 with methanol,
and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant can
be collected and stored at -80 degrees Celsius prior to LC-MS/MS to assess 2-hydroxyglutarate
levels. A variety of different liquid chromatography (LC) separation methods can be used. Each
method can be coupled by negative electrospray ionization (ESI, -3.0 kV) to triple-quadrupole
mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with MS
parameters optimized on infused metabolite standard solutions. Metabolites can be separated by
reversed phase chromatography using 10 mM tributyl-amine as an ion pairing agent in the
aqueous mobile phase, according to a variant of a previously reported method (Luo et al. J
ChromatogrA 1147, 153-64, 2007). One method allows resolution of TCA metabolites: t = 0,
50% B; t = 5, 95% B; t= 7, 95% B; t= 8, 0% B, where B refers to an organic mobile phase of
100% methanol. Another method is specific for 2-hydroxyglutarate, running a fast linear
gradient from 50% -95% B (buffers as defined above) over 5 minutes. A Synergi Hydro-RP,
100mm x 2 mm, 2.1 pm particle size (Phenomonex) can be used as the column, as described
above. Metabolites can be quantified by comparison of peak areas with pure metabolite
standards at known concentration. Metabolite flux studies from 13C-glutamine can be performed
as described, e.g., in Munger et al. Nat Biotechnol 26, 1179-86, 2008.
        In one embodiment 2HG is directly evaluated.
        In another embodiment a derivative of 2HG formed in process of performing the analytic
method is evaluated. By way of example such a derivative can be a derivative formed in MS
analysis. Derivatives can include a salt adduct, e.g., a Na adduct, a hydration variant, or a
hydration variant which is also a salt adduct, e.g., a Na adduct, e.g., as formed in MS analysis.
        In another embodiment a metabolic derivative of 2HG is evaluated. Examples include
species that build up or are elevated, or reduced, as a result of the presence of 2HG, such as
glutarate or glutamate that will be correlated to 2HG, e.g., R-2HG.

        Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at
the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as combination chemotherapy.
        In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a differentiation agent.
Such differentiation agent includes retinoids (such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis
retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cRA) and 4-hydroxy-phenretinamide (4-HPR)); arsenic
trioxide; histone deacetylase inhibitors HDACs (such as azacytidine (Vidaza) and butyrates (e.g.,
sodium phenylbutyrate)); hybrid polar compounds (such as hexamethylene bisacetamide
                                                 57

    WO 2013/107291                                                            PCT/CN2013/000068
((HMBA)); vitamin D; and cytokines (such as colony-stimulating factors including G-CSF and
GM-CSF, and interferons).
        In some embodiments the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a targeted therapy agent.
Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins of cancer cells.
Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated,
overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the
tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, dasatinib, erlotinib, imatinib,
gefitinib, lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Vandetanib,
and also cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Alvocidib and Seliciclib. Monoclonal
antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody which
specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the anti
HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN@) typically used in breast cancer, and the anti
CD20 antibody rituximab and Tositumomab typically used in a variety of B-cell malignancies.
Other exemplary antibodies include Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab,
Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and Gemtuzumab. Exemplary fusion proteins include Aflibercept
and Denileukin diftitox. In some embodiments, the targeted therapy can be used in combination
with a compound described herein, e.g., a biguanide such as metformin or phenformin,
preferably phenformin.
        Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as "homing devices" which can bind to
cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Radionuclides
which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually kill the cancer cell if the nuclide
decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of such therapy includes BEXXAR@.
        In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is an immunotherapy agent.
Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce the
subject's own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an
immune response against tumors include intravesicular BCG immunotherapy for superficial
bladder cancer, and use of interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal
cell carcinoma and melanoma subjects.
        Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of
immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a graft-versus
                                                  58

    WO 2013/107291                                                                PCT/CN2013/000068
tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be used in combination with
a compound or composition described herein.
          In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a hormonal therapy
agent. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain hormones.
Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and prostate
cancers. Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional
treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be
therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, the hormonal therapy agents can be used in
combination with a compound or a composition described herein.
          Other possible additional therapeutic modalities include imatinib, gene therapy, peptide
and dendritic cell vaccines, synthetic chlorotoxins, and radiolabeled drugs and antibodies.

After addition, the mixture was stirred for another 1 h and then quenched with ice (110 g). The
resulting mixture was extracted with Et 20 (2 x100 mL). Combined organic layers were washed
with brine, dried over anhydrous Mg2 SO 4 and concentrated to about 15 mL solution. Toluene (2
x 30 mL) was added into the residue and the mixture was co-evaporated twice to remove Et 20
(about 30 mL solution left each time to avoid explosion). The resulting toluene solution was
heated to 90 0C until the evolution of N 2 ceased. Next, 40 mL of t-BuOH was added into the
reaction mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at 90 0C. The mixture was
cooled and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography using petroleum

portion dropwise at 0 0C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 0C for 20 min, and then allowed
to warm up to r.t and stirred for another 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and
dissolved in H 20 (200 mL). The resulting mixture was extracted by Et 20 (150 mL) and the
aqueous layer was adjusted to pH=1 1 with solid Na 2CO 3 and extracted by DCM (2 x 150 mL).
The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated in
vacuo using a cold-water bath (<20 0C). The residue was dissolved in HCOOEt (90 mL), and

Step A: 5-Nitroisophthaloyl dichloride. To a solution of 5-nitroisophthalic acid (2.3 g, 11 mmol)
in SOCl 2 (6 mL) was added a drop of DMF and the mixture was stirred at reflux for 3 hr. The
resulting reaction mixture was concentrated to give the crude product which was used directly in
the next step.
Step B: 5-Nitroisophthalamide. 5-Nitroisophthaloyl dichloride (2.7 g, 9.7 mmol) was added
portionwise to a cold solution of NH3-H20 (40 mL) at 0 0C. The reaction mixture was stirred
overnight and a white precipitate formed. The mixture was then filtered, washed with excess of
water, and dried at 110 0C to give the crude product which was used directly in the next step.
 Step C: 5-Aminoisophthalamide. To a solution of 5-nitroisophthalamide (2 g, 9.6 mmol) in
MeOH (200 mL) was added Pd/C (200 mg). The reaction was stirred overnight under a hydrogen
atmosphere. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to afford the desired
product which was used directly in the next step.

Example B: Cellular Assays for IDHim (R132H or R132C) Inhibitors.
        Cells (HT1080 or U87MG) are grown in T125 flasks in DMEM containing 10% FBS, lx
penicillin/streptomycin and 500ug/mL G418 (present in U87MG cells only). They are harvested
by trypsin and seeded into 96 well white bottom plates at a density of 5000 cell/well in 100
ul/well in DMEM with 10% FBS. No cells are placed in columns 1 and 12. Cells are incubated
overnight at 37*C in 5% CO 2 . The next day test compounds are made up at 2x the final
concentration and 100ul are added to each cell well. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.2%
and the DMSO control wells are plated in row G. The plates are then placed in the incubator for
48 hours. At 48 hours, 100ul of media is removed from each well and analyzed by LC-MS for 2
HG concentrations. The cell plate is placed back in the incubator for another 24 hours. At 72
hours post compound addition, 10 mL/plate of Promega Cell Titer Glo reagent is thawed and
mixed. The cell plate is removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room
temperature. Then 100ul of Promega Cell Titer Glo reagent is added to each well of media.
The cell plate is then placed on an orbital shaker for 10 minutes and then allowed to sit at room
temperature for 20 minutes. The plate is then read for luminescence with an integration time of
500ms.
        The IC50 for inhibition of 2-HG production (concentration of test compound to reduce
2HG production by 50% compared to control) in these two cell lines for various compounds of
formula I is set forth in Table 2 above. As used in Table 2, "A" refers to an IC 50 for inhibition of
2-HG production < 0.1 pM; "B" refers to an IC50 for inhibition of 2-HG production between 0.1
pM and 0.5 pM; "C" refers to an IC5 0 for inhibition of 2-HG production between 0.5pM and 1
