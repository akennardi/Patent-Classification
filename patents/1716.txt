    Title
         VACUUM INFUSION FOR THE INCLUSION OF A SUPPLEMENT
                                 INTO FOOD PRODUCTS
 5  Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates to a method and composition for preparing dry pet
    food products including a specifically formulated dietary supplement. It is
    particularly related to products containing inactivated probiotics, probiotics,
    enzymes, Inactivated yeasts, botanical extracts and dairy components.

    Background
    Animal (and some human) feeds typically are supplied as pellets or pieces
    ("kibble"). The Pellets are typically formed from a starch and/or protein containing
    base ingredient, e.g. wheat or com, mixed with a variety of other ingredients. The
15  starch or protein containing base ingredient has a functional as well as a
    nutritional role in the pellet Its functional role is to bind all other ingredients
    together and to provide the textural and physical (most importantly the porosity)
    characteristics of the product.
    Binding of ingredients typically occurs because of the gelatinization of starch or
20  the denaturation of protein. Both of these physical / chemical processes are
    usually carried out at elevated temperature and/or pressure. Those harsh
    conditions often result in the degradation of labile additives, such as probiotics
    and other dietary supplements. This problem has been overcome by the cold
    extrusion process disclosed in WO 2007/059588.
25  However, the cold extrusion process can be time-consuming and often forms a
    "bottle-neck" in many processing plants.
    Thus, there is a need for an alternative process that will allow the incorporation of
    labile components into products prepared via other forms of the extrusion process
    without significant degradation of those components.
                                              I

   WO 2012/016282                                                             PCT/AU2011/000981
     It is proposed that the installation of vacuum infusion technology as an adjunct to
     a standard dry pet food extrusion process will ensure that a heat-labile component
     may be delivered into the finished product with full functionality, whilst not causing
     any loss to the production capacity of the processing plant.
 5   Liquid coatings are commonly added to the external surface of extruded products
     for a number of reasons including:
     1)      To improve product surface aesthetics (for example, the glossy coatings
     used on the surface of extruded rice snacks).
     2)      To improve product flavour (for example, the addition of flavourings greatly
10   enhances the palatability of extruded pet food).
     3)      To increase the product energy density. (The addition of oils and fats to.
     the product significantly Increases the metabolizable energy of the product.)
     4)      To modify the product textural attributes. (The addition of a plasticizer,
     such as glycerol, to an extruded structure Is one means of producing a "soft"
15   texture.)
     5)      To allow the post-process addition of active Ingredients or infusates.
     (Many of the most expensive functional ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals,
     pigments, etc are also temperature sensitive. Hence post-process addition can
     result in significant savings on formulation costs.)
20   The development of the vacuum infusion process is closely linked to the growth of
     the aquaculture industry. During the 1970's a number of the major feed
     manufacturers began to utilize extrusion cooking technology to replace the more
     traditional pellet milling processes. One of the major justifications for this change
     in processing technology was the deemed improvement in product quality and
25   also the ability to produce feeds with an oil content in excess of 20 %. The initial
     processing was focused predominantly on single screw extruders (S.S.E.).
     Extensive research into the metabolism of various marine species (especially trout
     and salmon), during the early 1980's, showed that an increase in the Total Fat
     Content (up to at least 30 %)would be beneficial. It was difficult to add this
30   amount of oil externally on the pellets. The incorporation of this level of fat Into the
     formulation began to stretch the limits of the extrusion technology and this lead to
                                               2

   WO 2012/016282                                                                PCT/AU2011/000981
    the use of Twin Screw Extruders and also Specialty S.S.E.
    It was during this period that the Dinnissen Company (Holland) and BP. Nutrition
    (now known as Nutreco) began to collaboratively develop the vacuum infusion
    process for the addition of significant levels of fat, post-extrusion. The major
 5  benefit of this process was that significantly higher levels of oil could be
    incorporated into pellets produced via standard extrusion technology.
    In order to provide an understanding of how this technology works, we now
    describe the fundamental processes that are involved in the liquid coating of
    porous substrates.
10  The Atmospheric Coating Process
    The adsorption of liquid coatings during the atmospheric coating process is
    primarily controlled by the action of capillary forces. The magnitude of a capillary
    force is determined by the radius of the capillary, Rp, and by the liquid surface
    tension, cr. The magnitude of the suction pressure is given by the following simple
15  expression - Pc = 2 *oL *cos ew / Rp
    This behaviour is shown in Figure 1 for the absorption of vegetable oil (al = 0.073
    N m-1 at T = 25 "C).
    The data clearly indicates that the use of very fine capillaries would be beneficial.
    The resultant flow rate within these fine capillaries would, however, be very slow.
20  The Fanning Equation may be used to estimate the pressure drop associated with
    thisflow-Pf = 2*f*[I(2Rp)]*p*v2
    The provision of larger pores would therefore ensure a more rapid uptake of the
    liquid coatings, due to the reduced pressure drop within the larger pores. The
    uptake of suspended infusates would also be promoted by the use of larger pores.
25  The subsequent leakage of liquids from the pellets (a common problem for high oil
    content products) would, however, also be promoted by the provision of larger
    pores, since the capillary force will not retain the liquid within the pore.
    One of the primary objectives during the manufacture of an expanded extruded
    product must therefore be to provide an optimal pore size distribution. The gross
30  means of monitoring this product attribute in the manufacturing environment is via
    the measurement of the product bulk density.
                                              3

   WO 2012/016282                                                             PCT/AU2011/000981
    The measurement of bulk density alone is not enough, however. It is also
    necessary to give consideration to both the sectional expansion and longitudinal
    expansion. These parameters are shown schematically in Figure 2. These
    parameters are commonly monitored in an indirect manner in many applications
 5  since SEI = D2 / d2 (common to measure the product diameter) and LEI = f
    (piece length) (common to measure the cutter speed)
    Changes to the magnitude of either the sectional expansion index (S.E.I.) and / or
    the longitudinal expansion index (L.E.l.), even at a constant bulk density or
    Volumetric Expansion index (V.E.I. = S.E.I. x LE.l.) will result in significant
10  changes to the pore morphology (i.e. the size, number and shape of the pores).
    These changes to the pellet internal characteristics will have an effect upon the
    coating characteristics of the product via an atmospheric coating process.
    The magnitude of the SEI and the LEl are influenced by both the ingredient
    composition and via the process parameters used during the manufacture of the
15  product.
    The Vacuum Infusion Process
    As a result of the limitations of both the atmospheric coating process (as outlined
    above) and the extrusion process (unable to handle large amounts of added il),
    an alternative means of Increasing the oil content of the finished product needed
20  to be found. This scenario ultimately led to the development of the vacuum
    infusion process.
    The design of a typical vacuum infusion process Is presented In Figure 3.
    The mechanism via which the process proceeds is shown schematically in Figure
    4 and may be described via the following steps:
25   1)    The required amount of product (typically pre-weighed in a weigh hopper)
    is charged into a vacuum vessel. The vessel is then sealed.
    2)     The vessel is then depressurized (a vacuum is drawn) to the required level
    (typically about 0.2 bar [abs.) or 80% Vacuum). This ensures that most of the air
    is removed, even from within the pores of the product.
30  3)     The required amount of liquid coating (which may or may not contain a
    quantity of infusates) is then sprayed into the vessel via a series of nozzles, whilst
                                              4

   WO 2012/016282                                                             PCT/AU2011/000981
    the bed of product is being blended via mixing paddles. This ensures that all of
    the product surfaces become wetted.
    4)      The vacuum is then slowly released. The Rate of Pressure Rise, 5P, is
    one of the most important process control points. In order for optimal coating to
 5  proceed, the external pressure must increase at a rate that is able to sustain the
    rate of flow of liquids into the pores. The rate of flow must also not exceed the
    rate of wetting of the pore inlets,
    5)      When the pressure within the vessel has returned to atmospheric pressure,
    the vessel contents may be discharged.

    Preferred embodiments of the Invention
15  In one aspect the present Invention provides an improved method of vacuum
    Infusion of a supplement into a porous food product comprising treating a porous
    food product having a majority pores of within a certain diameter size range with a
    supplement dispersed in a carrier wherein the supplement comprises particles the
     majority of which have a size range which is less than the pore size range,
20  wherein said method performed under suitable conditions and for a suitable time
    to achieve infusion of the supplement Into the food product, the improvement
    comprising higher levels of supplement incorporation than with other supplement
     particle sizes.
     The term "a supplement" refers to specifically formulated dietary supplements,
25   particularly particulate supplements, such as products containing probiotics,
     inactivated probiotics, yeasts, inactivated yeasts, probiotics, enzymes, botanical
     extracts and/or dairy components.
     The probiotics may be selected from one or more of the following group used
     singly or in combination and used whole or in fractions of the whole bacterial
30   organism: Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus lichenformis, Bacillus subtlis,
     Bitldobacterium sp., Enterococcus feacium, Lactobacillus acidolphilus,

   WO 2012/016282                                                                PCT/AU2011/000981
    Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fennentum, Lactobacillus johnsoni,
    Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus reuter, Lactobacilius ruminsis,
    Lactobacillus ,hamnosus, Pediococcusacidifacticii.
    The probiotics may be supplied in a live state, that is, capable of metabolizing
 5  nutrients and proliferating. Probiotics may also be supplied In an inactivatedd'
    state, that is, incapable of metabolizing nutrients and proliferating. Where
    probiotic bacteria are supplied in the inactivated state they still maintain an
    identifiably approximate physical formation or structure to that manifested in the
    live state.
10  The yeasts may include any of the strains of yeasts of the species
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae used singly or in combination, used whole or in
    fractions of the whole yeast organism. The yeasts may be supplied in an active
    state, that is, capable of metabolizing nutrients and proliferating. Yeasts may also
    be supplied in a 'inactivated' state, that is, incapable of metabolizing nutrients and
15  proliferating. Where yeasts are supplied in the inactivated state they still maintain
    the same physical formation or structure manifested in the live state.
    The prebiotics may include any of the following, singly or in combination: galacto
    oligosaccharide,lactulose, lactosucrose, fructo-oligosaccharide, raffinose,
    stachyose and malto- oligosaccharlde.
20  The enzymes may include any of the following enzymes, singly or in combination:
    alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, cellulase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-glucanase,
     beta-glucosidase, glucoamylase, lactase, pectinase, xylanase, lipase and
     protease.
     The term "a porous food product" means a dry or semi-moist food product which
25   has pores or minute passages or interstices which make the product permeable to
     liquids. Typically this is this Is dried pet food kibble or the like which has been
     produced by the diret expansion process after extrusion cooking or via the cold
     extrusion process.
     The porous food may comprise a variety of grains, legumes, pulses or vegetables
30   such as amaranth, quinoa, millet, bulgur, wild rice, cous cous, sooji, spelt, kamut,
     kasha, kaniwa, tapioca and the like.
     The term 'a majority pores of within a certain diameter size range" means
                                                6

   WO 2012/016282                                                            PCT/AU2011/000981
    substantially 80% of the pores in that size range. Generally the majority of pores
    in such a product are 200 to 1000pm In diameter.
    The term "dispersed in a carrier" means that the particles are kept in suspension
    via agitation, preferably in vegetable oil and/or tallow.
 5  The term "particles the majority of which have a size range which is less than the
    pore size range" means that substantially 85% of the particles are less than the
    pore size range. Preferably, the particles are < 250 pm and the mass average
    particle size is about 210 pm.
    The term "performed under suitable conditions and for a suitable time to achieve
10  infusion" means that the method is carried out under the appropriate conditions
    and for the appropriate time to achieve infusion. These parameters include the
    maximum vacuum attained (prior to the slurry being coated onto the product), the
    wet mixing time (during which the slurry is absorbed into the product via capillary
    forces) and the vacuum release rate (VRR). The accurate control of the VRR
15  ensures that the slurry Is driven into the pores.
    The term "higher levels of supplement incorporation" means the processing of
    infusate slurries containing greater than 20% w/w particulate.
    In another aspect, the invention provides an improved method of vacuum infusion
    of a supplement in a porous food product comprising treating a porous food
20   product having a majority of pore sizes of less than about 1000pm, preferably
     between about 250 to about 600 pm in diameter with a supplement having a
     particle diameter size range less than the pore size range, wherein said
    supplement is present in a carrier, and said method is performed under suitable
    conditions and for a suitable time to achieve infusion of the supplement Into the
25  food product, the improvement comprising higher levels of supplement
     incorporation than with other pore size and particle diameter size ranges.
     In addition to the higher levels of supplement incorporation achieved with the
     method of the invention process times are greatly shortened. This means that the
     improved process of the invention allows the dried food to be produced at much
30   lower cost. The cold extrusion process results in a reduction of the average
     processing rate of the extruder by approximately 50%. The use of the vacuum
     infusion process allows for the extruder to be operated at its rated capacity.

   The preferred dietary supplement for use in the invention is Y+. Y+ is a
    commercial product containing probiotics, inactivated probiotics. yeasts,
    inactivated yeasts, probiotics and enzymes.
    Preferably, the Y+ is incorporated into the finished product at a concentration of
 5  1% w/w of the kibble.
    The dietary supplement is milled (using appropriate size reduction technology) to
    an average particle size less than 0.5mm or 500 pm.
    The milled supplement is then blended with beef tallow, poultry tallow, fish oil or
    vegetable oil to form a suspension (or slurry) containing not less than 10% w/w of
10  the supplement.
    The base product (consisting of one or more extrusion cooked kibble
    components) is added to the vacuum coater and agitated to ensure uniform
    mixing. An appropriate level of vacuum Isdrawn on the vessel. The suspension
    is then added to the coater, whilst continuing the agitation In order to ensure a
15  substantially uniform surface coating of the kibble. The vacuum is then slowly
    released in order to ensure the substantially uniform penetration of the
    supplement into the kibble. The optimal vacuum release rate can be determined
    experimentally.
     Details of preferred vacuum infusion coating requirements are given in Table 1
20  and the calculation of a prediction of the wettability of kibble pellets is shown in
    Table 2.
    Additional Considerations for Optimisation of Preferred Embodiments
     Ensure that pellets have a minimal moisture content (m< 20% w/w).
     Ensure that pellets are unifomily dried. Case hardened pellets will retard liquid
25   penetration due to the shrunken pores.
     Ensure that the pellet core temperature is less than 50 OC. This will prevent pellet
     moisture from boiling during the vacuum process.
     Ensure that the vacuum release time is adequately slow. If liquids are
     drawn/driven into the capillaries more quickly than the surface wetting rate, voids
30   will be formed within the pores.

   WO 2012/016282                                                             PCT/AU2011/000981
    It may be necessary to utilize a multi-stage process (drawing vacuum more than
    once) for some applications.
    Ensure that the liquid temperature (and hence the viscosity and surface tension)
    is optimal.
 5  Providing an over-pressure on the liquid supply may augment the process
     performance.
    An external coat of solid fat may be used to seal up the pores after filling to
    ensure that leakage does not occur.
    The shelf life of the finished product can be extended by controlling the pH level of
10  the pellets. Preferably, the pH should be less than 7 and itis particularly
     preferable for the pH to be about 6.
     The pellets may be prepared by using a liquid acid digest, typically obtained
     commercially from animal by-product renderers. Preferably, the liquid acid digest
     is neutralized (by a base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) and
15   then dried into a powder form.
     Detailed description of tests with a model system
     In order to gain a deeper insight into the fundamental mechanisms Involved Inthis
     process a series of trials was completed using a model system.
20   The liquid used forethe tests was vegetable oli (since itis liquid and has a low
     viscosity at room temperature). Jet milled Icing sugar was incorporated in order to
     simulate the effect of an infusate addition. (The sugar concentration was varied
     from 6% to 32% w/w.) The density of the slurry was related linearly to the sugar
     concentration via pSLURRY = 0.915 + 0.004 * sugarl (g cm-3). (It was therefore
25   possible to determine the amount of infused sugar and / or oil via changes in the
     slurry density.)
     The "pore size" was controlled by using woven filter cloths made of synthetic
     fibres. The apparatus is shown schematically in Figure 5.
     The vacuum used for all tests was initially set at 0.2 bar and the vacuum release
30    rate was 6P 0.1 bar per 10 seconds.

   The testing method used for the Investigation consisted of the following steps:
   The vials (4) for each test are pre-weighed (WVi).
   The filter mesh (of the required pore size) for each vial is pre-weighed (WFi) and
   then fitted to the vial.
 5 The vacuum chamber Is sealed and the pressure is reduced to P = 0.2 bar.
   A slunry is prepared, containing the required sugar concentration in vegetable oil.
   The valve is opened and the chamber is allowed to fill, such that the surface of the
   vial Is covered by - 1cm of sluny.
   The vacuum Is then released at a rate of OP = 0.1 per 10 seconds, and the slurry
10  is then drained from the chamber and the vials are removed for weighing.
    The following data is obtained:
    WTf = Final weight of the vial, filter and collected slurry
   WFf = Final weight of the filter and collected infusate
    WVf = Final weight of vial and collected slurry
15  Vf = Volume of collected slurry
    The total infused weight (oil and sugar) isdetermined from the average of the four
    individual results at each slurry concentration, via W = WVf - (WVi + WFi)
    The density of the collected slurry is given by pSLURRY = (WVf - WVi) /Vf
    The total infusate added is given by M = {      If' ( pSLURRY - 0.915)10.0004 }+
20  (WFf - Wfi)
    The results obtained from the tests are best presented in a graphical form as
    shown in Figure 6.
    The data clearly shows that both the pore size (most significant) and also the
    slurry concentration have an impact upon the total infused weight of the finished
25  product. The result may be modeled via W = f [ Rp-0.0005, c-0.7, exp(Rp) ] (r2 =
    0.87).

    Inspection of the slurry collected within the vials showed that two distinct layers
   existed. Initially the material passing through the cloth consisted of true slurry. As
   the test proceeded, however, the material became clearer. The cloths were
    acting as a filter and the coamer particles were being retained. This is given
 5 further validation when one considers the infusate weight alone.
   These data may be readily modeled via M = f [ Rp3 I (r2 = 0.96).
    The data obtained from these experiments clearly shows that the provision of an
    optimal pore size distribution is indeed critical to the adequate operation of a
    vacuum infusion process. The data also indicates that the amount of infusate that
10  may be added Is Independent of the slurry concentration.
    While the present invention has been described with reference to a few specific
    embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be
    construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications may occur to those
    skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention

    Title
         VACUUM INFUSION FOR THE INCLUSION OF A SUPPLEMENT
                                 INTO FOOD PRODUCTS
 5  Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates to a method and composition for preparing dry pet
    food products including a specifically formulated dietary supplement. It is
    particularly related to products containing inactivated probiotics, prebiotics,
    enzymes, Inactivated yeasts, botanical extracts and dairy components.
10
    Background
    Animal (and some human) feeds typically are supplied as pellets or pieces
    ("kibble"). The Pellets are typically formed from a starch and/or protein containing
    base ingredient, e.g. wheat or com, mixed with a variety of other ingredients. The
15  starch or protein containing base ingredient has a functional as well as a
    nutritional role in the pellet. Its functional role is to bind all other ingredients
    together and to provide the textural and physical (most importantly the porosity)
    characteristics of the product.
    Binding of ingredients typically occurs because of the gelatinization of starch or
20  the denaturation of protein. Both of these physical / chemical processes are
    usually carried out at elevated temperature and/or pressure. Those harsh
    conditions often result in the degradation of labile additives, such as probiotics
    and other dietary supplements. This problem has been overcome by the cold
    extrusion process disclosed inWO 2007/059588.
25  However, the cold extrusion process can be time-consuming and often forms a
    "bottle-neck" in many processing plants.
    Thus, there is a need for an alternative process that will allow the incorporation of
    labile components into products prepared via other forms of the extrusion process
    without significant degradation of those components.

   WO 20121016282                                                             PCT/AU2011/000981
     It is proposed that the Installation of vacuum infusion technology as an adjunct to
     a standard dry pet food extrusion process will ensure that a heat-labile component
     may be delivered into the finished product with full functionality, whilst not causing
     any loss to the production capacity of the processing plant.
 5   Liquid coatings are commonly added to the external surface of extruded products
     for a number of reasons including:
     1)      To improve product surface aesthetics (for example, the glossy coatings
     used on the surface of extruded rice snacks).
     2)      To improve product flavour (for example, the addition of flavourings greatly
10   enhances the palatability of extruded pet food).
     3)      To increase the product energy density. (The addition of oils and fats to.
     the product significantly Increases the metabolizable energy of the product.)
     4)      To modify the product textural attributes. (The addition of a plasticizer,
     such as glycerol, to an extruded structure Is one means of producing a "softN
15   texture.)
     5)      To allow the post-process addition of active Ingredients or infusates.
     (Many of the most expensive functional ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals,
     pigments, etc are also temperature sensitive. Hence post-process addition can
     result in significant savings on formulation costs.)
20   The development of the vacuum infusion process is closely linked to the growth of
     the aquaculture industry. During the 1970's a number of the major feed
     manufacturers began to utilize extrusion cooking technology to replace the more
     traditional pellet milling processes. One of the major justifications for this change
     in processing technology was the deemed improvement in product quality and
25   also the ability to produce feeds with an oil content in excess of 20 %. The initial
     processing was focused predominantly on single screw extruders (S.S.E.).
     Extensive research into the metabolism of various marine species (especially trout
     and salmon), during the early 1980's, showed that an Increase in the Total Fat
     Content (up to at least 30 %) would be beneficial. It was difficult to add this
30   amount of oil externally on the pellets. The incorporation of this level of fat Into the
     formulation began to stretch the limits of the extrusion technology and this lead to
                                               2

   WO 20121016282                                                                PCT/AU2011/000981
    the use of Twin Screw Extruders and also Specialty S.S.E.
    It was during this period that the Dinnissen Company (Holland) and B.P. Nutrition
    (now known as Nutreco) began to collaboratively develop the vacuum infusion
    process for the addition of significant levels of fat, post-extrusion. The major
 5  benefit of this process was that significantly higher levels of oil could be
    incorporated into pellets produced via standard extrusion technology.
    In order to provide an understanding of how this technology works, we now
    describe the fundamental processes that are involved in the liquid coating of
    porous substrates.

    primarily controlled by the action of capillary forces. The magnitude of a capillary
    force is determined by the radius of the capillary, Rp, and by the liquid surface
    tension, c. The magnitude of the suction pressure is given by the following simple
15  expression - Pc = 2 * aL * cos Ow / Rp
    This behaviour is shown in Figure 1for the absorption of vegetable oil (at = 0.073
    N m-1 at T = 25 "C).
    The data clearly indicates that the use of very fine capillaries would be beneficial.
    The resultant flow rate within these fine capillaries would, however, be very slow.
20  The Fanning Equation may be used to estimate the pressure drop associated with
    thisflow-Pf = 2*f*[LJ(2Rp)]*p*v2
    The provision of larger pores would therefore ensure a more rapid uptake of the
    liquid coatings, due to the reduced pressure drop within the larger pores. The
    uptake of suspended infusates would also be promoted by the use of larger pores.
25  The subsequent leakage of liquids from the pellets (a common problem for high oil
    content products) would, however, also be promoted by the provision of larger
    pores, since the capillary force will not retain the liquid within the pore.
    One of the primary objectives during the manufacture of an expanded extruded
    product must therefore be to provide an optimal pore size distribution. The gross
30  means of monitoring this product attribute in the manufacturing environment is via
    the measurement of the product bulk density.

   WO 20121016282                                                              PCT/AU2011/000981
    The measurement of bulk density alone is not enough, however. It is also
    necessary to give consideration to both the sectional expansion and longitudinal
    expansion. These parameters are shown schematically in Figure 2. These
    parameters are commonly monitored in an indirect manner in many applications
 5  since SEI = D2 / d2 (common to measure the product diameter) and LEI = f
    (piece length) (common to measure the cutter speed)
    Changes to the magnitude of either the sectional expansion index (S.E.1.) and / or
    the longitudinal expansion index (L.E.I.), even at a constant bulk density or
    Volumetric Expansion index (V.E.I. = S.E.l. x L.E.I.) will result In significant
10  changes to the pore morphology (i.e. the size, number and shape of the pores).
    These changes to 'the pellet internal characteristics will have an effect upon the
    coating characteristics of the product via an amospheric coating process.
    The magnitude of the SEI and the LEI are influenced by both the ingredient
    composition and via the process parameters used during the manufacture of the
15  product.
    The Vacuum Infusion Process
    As a result of the limitations of both the atmospheric coating process (as outlined
    above) and the extrusion process (unable to handle large amounts of added oil),
    an alternative means of Increasing the oil content of the finished product needed
20  to be found. This scenario ultimately led to the development of the vacuum
    infusion process.
    The design of a typical vacuum infusion process Is presented In Figure 3.
    The mechanism via which the process proceeds is shown schematically in Figure
    4 and may be described via the following steps:
25   1)     The required amount of product (typically pre-weighed in a weigh hopper)
     is charged into a vacuum vessel. The vessel Is then sealed.
    2)      The vessel is then depressurized (a vacuum is drawn) to the required level
    (typically about 0.2 bar [abs.] or 80% Vacuum). This ensures that most of the air
     is removed, even from within the pores of the product.
30  3)      The required amount of liquid coating (which may or may not contain a
    quantity of infusates) is then sprayed into the vessel via a series of nozzles, whilst
                                              4

   WO 20121016282                                                             PCT/AU2011/000981
    the bed of product is being blended via mixing paddles. This ensures that all of
    the product surfaces become wetted.
    4)      The vacuum is then slowly released. The Rate of Pressure Rise, OP, is
    one of the most important process control points. In order for optimal coating to
 5  proceed, the external pressure must increase at a rate that is able to sustain the
    rate of flow of liquids into the pores. The rate of flow must also not exceed the
    rate of wetting of the pore inlets.
    5)      When the pressure within the vessel has returned to atmospheric pressure,
    the vessel contents may be discharged.

     particle sizes.
     The term "a supplement" refers to specifically formulated dietary supplements,
25   particularly particulate supplements, such as products containing probiotics,

                                              5

   WO 20121016282                                                               PCT/AU2011/000981
    Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fennentum, Lactobacillus johnsoni,
    Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus reuter, Lactobacillus muminsis,
    Lactobacilus rhamnosus,Pediococcus acllactici
    The probiotics may be supplied in a live state, that is,capable of metabolizing
 5  nutrients and proliferating. Probiotics may also be supplied In an 'Inactivated'
    state, that is, incapable of metabolizing nutrients and proliferating. Where
    probiotic bacteria are supplied in the inactivated state they still maintain an
    identifiably approximate physical formation or structure to that manifested in the
    live state.
10  The yeasts may include any of the strains of yeasts of the species
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae used singly or in combination, used whole or in
    fractions of the whole yeast organism. The yeasts may be supplied in an active
    state, that is, capable of metabolizing nutrients and proliferating. Yeasts may also
    be supplied in a 'inactivated' state, that is, incapable of metabolizing nutrients and
15  proliferating. Where yeasts are supplied in the inactivated state they still maintain
    the same physical fomiation or structure manifested inthe live state.
    The prebiotics may include any of the following, singly or in combination: galacto
    oligosaccharide,lactulose, lactosucrose, fructo-oligosaccharide, raffinose,
    stachyose and malto- oligosaccharlde.
20  The enzymes may include any of the following enzymes, singly or in combination:
    alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, cellulase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-glucanase,
     beta-glucosidase, glucoamylase, lactase, pectinase, xylanase, lipase and
     protease.
     The term "a porous food product" means a dry or semi-moist food product which
25   has pores or minute passages or interstices which make the product permeable to
     iquids. Typically this is this Is dried pet food kibble or the like which has been
     produced by the direct expansion process after extrusion cooking or via the cold
     extrusion process.
     The porous food may comprise a variety of grains, legumes, pulses or vegetables
30   such as amaranth, quinoa, millet, bulgur, wild rice, cous cous, sooji, spelt, kamut,
     kasha, kaniwa, tapioca and the like.
     The term "a majority pores of within a certain diameter size range" means
                                               6

   WO 20121016282                                                            PCT/AU2011/000981
    substantially 80% of the pores in that size range. Generally the majority of pores
    in such a product are 200 to 1000pm In diameter.
    The term "dispersed in a carrier" means that the particles are kept in suspension
    via agitation, preferably in vegetable oil and/or tallow,
 5  The term "particles the majority of which have a size range which Is less than the
    pore size range" means that substantially 85% of the particles are less than the
    pore size range. Preferably, the particles are < 250 pm and the mass average
    particle size is about 210 pm.
    The term "performed under suitable conditions and for a suitable time to achieve
10  infusion" means that the method is carried out under the appropriate conditions
    and for the appropriate time to achieve infusion. These parameters include the
    maximum vacuum attained (prior to the slurry being coated onto the product), the
    wet mixing time (during which the slurry is absorbed into the product via capillary
    forces) and the vacuum release rats (VRR). The accurate control of the VRR
15  ensures that the slurry Is driven into the pores.
    The term "higher levels of supplement incorporation" means the processing of
    infusate slurries containing greater than 20% w/w particulates.
    In another aspect, the invention provides an improved method of vacuum infusion
    of a supplement in a porous food product comprising treating a porous food
20   product having a majority of pore sizes of less than about 10O0pm, preferably
     between about 250 to about 600 pm in diameter with a supplement having a
     particle diameter size range less than the pore size range, wherein said
    supplement is present in a carrier, and said method is performed under suitable
    conditions and for a suitable time to achieve infusion of the supplement Into the
25  food product, the improvement comprising higher levels of supplement
     incorporation than with other pore size and particle diameter size ranges.
     In addition to the higher levels of supplement incorporation achieved with the
     method of the invention process times are greatly shortened. This means that the
     improved process of the invention allows the dried food to be produced at much
30   lower cost. The cold extrusion process results in a reduction of the average
     processing rate of the extruder by approximately 50%. The use of the vacuum
     infusion process allows for the extruder to be operated at its rated capacity.

   WO 20121016282                                                               PCT/AU2011/000981
   The preferred dietary supplement for use in the invention is Y+. Y+ is a
    commercial product containing probiotics, inactivated probiotics. yeasts,
    inactivated yeasts, problotics and enzymes.
    Preferably, the Y+ is incorporated into the finished product at a concentration of
 5  1%w/w of the kibble.
    The dietary supplement is milled (using appropriate size reduction technology) to
    an average particle size less than 0.5mm or 500 pm.
    The milled supplement is then blended with beef tallow, poultry tallow, fish oil or
    vegetable oil to form a suspension (or slurry) containing not less than 10% w/w of
10  the supplement.
    The base product (consisting of one or more extrusion cooked kibble
    components) is added to the vacuum coater and agitated to ensure uniform
    mixing. An appropriate level of vacuum Isdrawn on the vessel. The suspension
    is then added to the coater, whilst continuing the agitation In order to ensure a
15  substantially uniform surface coating of the kibble. The vacuum is then slowly
    released in order to ensure the substantially uniform penetration of the
    supplement into the kibble. The optimal vacuum release rate can be determined
    experimentally.
     Details of preferred vacuum infusion coating requirements are given in Table 1
20  and the calculation of a prediction of the wettability of kibble pellets is shown in
    Table 2.
    Additional Considerations for Optimisation of Preferred Embodiments
     Ensure that pellets have a minimal moisture content (m c 20% w/w).
     Ensure that pellets are uniformly dried. Case hardened pellets will retard liquid
25   penetration due to the shrunken pores.
     Ensure that the pellet core temperature is less than 50    0C. This will prevent pellet
     moisture from boiling during the vacuum process.
     Ensure that the vacuum release time is adequately slow. If liquids are
     drawn/driven into the capillaries more quickly than the surface wetting rate, voids
30   will be formed within the pores.

   WO 20121016282                                                              PCT/AU2011/000981
    It may be necessary to utilize a multi-stage process (drawing vacuum more than
    once) for some applications.
    Ensure that the liquid temperature (and hence the viscosity and surface tension)
    is optimal.
 5  Providing an over-pressure on the liquid supply may augment the process
    performance.
    An external coat of solid fat may be used to seal up the pores after filling to
    ensure that leakage does not occur.
    The shelf life of the finished product can be extended by controlling the pH level of
10  the pellets. Preferably, the pH should be less than 7 and it is particularly
    preferable for the pH to be about 6.
    The pellets may be prepared by using a liquid acid digest, typically obtained
    commercially from animal by-product renderers. Preferably, the liquid acid digest
     is neutralized (by a base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) and
15  then dried into a powder form.
     Detailed description of tests with a model system
     In order to gain a deeper insight into the fundamental mechanisms Involved in this
     process a series of trials was completed using a model system.
20   The liquid used for the tests was vegetable oil (since it is liquid and has a low
     viscosity at room temperature). Jet milled icing sugar was incorporated in order to
     simulate the effect of an infusate addition. (The sugar concentration was varied
     from 6% to 32% w/w.) The density of the slurry was related linearly to the sugar
     concentration via pSLURRY = 0.915 + 0.004 * [sugarl (g cm-3). (It was therefore
25   possible to determine the amount of infused sugar and / or oil via changes in the
     slurry density.)
     The "pore size" was controlled by using woven filter cloths made of synthetic
     fibres. The apparatus is shown schematically in Figure 5.
     The vacuum used for all tests was initially set at 0.2 bar and the vacuum release
30   rate was 6P      0.1 bar per 10 seconds.

   The testing method used for the investigation consisted of the following steps:
   The vials (4) for each test are pre-weighed (WVi).
   The filter mesh (of the required pore size) for each vial is pre-weighed (WFi) and
   then fitted to the vial.
 5 The vacuum chamber Is sealed and the pressure is reduced to P = 0.2 bar.
   A slurry Is prepared, containing the required sugar concentration in vegetable oil.
   The valve is opened and the chamber is allowed to fill, such that the surface of the
   vial is covered by - 1cm of slurry.
    The vacuum Is then released at a rate of 5P = 0.1 per 10 seconds, and the sluny
10  is then drained from the chamber and the vials are removed for weighing.
    The following data is obtained:
    WTf = Final weight of the vial, filter and collected slurry
    WFf = Final weight of the fitter and collected infusate
    WVf = Final weight of vial and collected slurry
15  Vf = Volume of collected slurry
    The total infused weight (oil and sugar) is determined from the average of the four
    indidual results at each sluny concentration, via W = WVf - (WVi + WFi)
    The density of the collected slurry is given by pSLURRY = (WVf - WVi) /Vf
    The total infusate added is given by M = { Vf * (pSLURRY - 0.915 ) / 0.0004 }+
20  (WFf - Wfi)
    The results obtained from the tests are best presented in a graphical form as
    shown in Figure 6.
    The data clearly shows that both the pore size (most significant) and also the
    slurry concentration have an impact upon the total infused weight of the finished
25  product. The result may be modeled via W = f[ Rp-0.0005, c-0.7, exp(Rp) ] (r2 =
    0.87).

    Inspection of the slurny collected within the vials showed that two distinct layers
   existed. Initially the material passing through the cloth consisted of true slurry. As
   the test proceeded, however, the material became clearer. The cloths were
    acting as a filter and the coarser particles were being retained. This is given
 5 further validation when one considers the infusate weight alone.
    These data may be readily modeled via M - f [ Rp3] (r2 = 0.96).
    The data obtained from these experiments clearly shows that the provision of an
    optimal pore size distribution is indeed critical to the adequate operation of a
    vacuum infusion process. The data also indicates that the amount of infusate that
10  may be added Is Independent of the slurry concentration.
    While the present invention has been described with reference to a few specific
    embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be
    construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications may occur to those
    skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention
