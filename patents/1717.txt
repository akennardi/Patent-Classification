                              ABSTRACT
   A method is described for operating a heavy haul rail
   system 10 to transport bulk commodities.      The rail system
 5 comprises one or more consists 20 provided with at least
   one loco L1 - L3 and a plurality of wagons 22.             A lead
   loco L1 is equipped with an automatic train protection
    (ATP) system 28 for supervising operation of the consist
   20 in response to signals received from a train control
10 system (24) that authorises movement of the consist 20
   within the rail system 10.    The rail system 10 is equipped
   with an automatic train operation    (ATO) system 12 for
   generating driving commands capable of driving the consist
   20 independent of action of any onboard personnel.                   The
15 method involves assembling the consist 22 comprising one
   or more locos L1 -  L3 and empty wagons 22 in a yard.
   Train configuration data is uploaded to the ATP system 28
   on a lead loco L1.   The ATO system 12 utilises train
   configuration to generate driving commands for the consist
20 20.   The ATO system 12 then utilises the driving commands
   to drive the consist 20.

                       RAIL TRANSPORT SYSTEM
   Field of the Invention
 5 The present invention relates to a railway transport
   system and in particular, a rail transport system that
   facilitates automatic train operation.   The invention
   further relates to components and sub-systems of the rail
   transport system.
10
   Background of the Invention
   A typical rail transport system comprises a network of
   railroad tracks extending between geographic locations
15 between which people or goods are transported.          A consist
   comprising at least one locomotive and a series of wagons
   or carriages is typically driven along the tracks by a
   driver operating throttle and brake levers in the
   locomotive.  A signalling system is incorporated in the
20 rail transport system to provide signals to the driver to
   facilitate the safe operation of the consist.          These may,
   for example, signal a driver to reduce throttle setting,
   or apply the brakes or bring the consist to a stop.                   In
   the event of a driver not complying with a signal
25 provided, the signalling system may override the driver
   and bring the consist to a halt.
   In heavy haul rail transport systems, a consist may
   comprise two or three head end locomotives, and well over
30 one hundred wagons.   A driver of a heavy haul system must
   be conscious of internal train forces when accelerating
   and braking to ensure that the consist doesn't break at a
   coupling or derail. The total length of a heavy haul
   consist may exceed 1500m.
35
   In heavy haul systems, one or more bankers may be attached
   to the rear of the consist to assist in pushing the
                                             9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 2
   consist up a gradient.   As is appreciated and understood
   by those skilled in the art, distributed power is used to
   control the throttle and brake settings of the banker
   locos  from a head end lead loco to ensure that the locos
 5 are driven at  similar speeds so that the consist does not
   break apart during acceleration or derail during braking.
   Distributed power involves providing a communication path
   between the head end lead loco and a banker lead loco so
10 that throttle and brake  settings are co-ordinated.                  This
   communication path may be facilitated by way of radio
   communication between a driver in the head end lead loco
   and a driver in the banker lead loco.    Alternately a wired
   communication link may exist between the head end lead
15 loco and the banker lead loco.    In this event, a computer
   or other controller in the banker lead loco may be
   controlled by a driver in the head end lead loco to adjust
   the throttle and brake position.
20 The present rail transport system and various components
   and sub-systems thereof have been developed with a view to
   enabling automatic train operation.

   Brief Description of the Drawings
   Embodiments of the present invention will now be described
   by way of example only and with reference to the
 5 accompanying drawings in which:
   Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an embodiment of
   a rail transport system in accordance with the present
   invention;

   Figure 2 is a schematic representation of an automatic

15 Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
   Figure 1 is a general schematic representation of a heavy
   haul rail transport system 10 that operates with
   locomotives under control of a computer based system
20 without drivers stationed onboard  (i.e. driverless
   locomotives) across at least a portion of the rail
   transport system 10.
   A heavy haul rail transport system is typically
25 characterised as one where the consist is loaded with
   significantly greater tonnage than passenger consists and
   is of significantly greater length than passenger
   consists. The length of a heavy haul consist may exceed
   1000 meters.  Consists for transporting bulk commodities
30 such as coal and iron ore are common examples.           The
   significant tonnage of the load means that a driver of a
   typical heavy haul system has to take greater account of
   internal train forces and train dynamics when accelerating
   and braking than occurs for a passenger consists.                This        is
35 to ensure that the consist does not break apart or derail.
   Major components and sub-systems of the rail transport
                                             9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                                 -  10
   system 10 comprise rail track       (not shown),    one or more
   consists 20   (i.e. one or more trains),      an automatic train
   operation   (ATO) system 12  consisting of wayside/remote and
   onboard components, a wayside communications network 14,                              a
 5 train control    (TCS) system 24,    a signalling system 26, an
   automatic train protection      (ATP) system, and a locomotive
   control system    (LCS) 32.
   Consist 20 is comprised of three head end locos Li,                       L2 and
10 L3;  a plurality of wagons shown generally as item 22                       and
   three banker locos Bi,    B2 and B3.      The lead loco Li                is the
   head end lead loco while the banker loco Bi is the banker
   lead loco.    At a minimum, each of the head end lead loco
   Li  and banker lead loco Bi is provided with an onboard
15 component of the ATO System 12,        namely an ATO onboard
   system 18.    However it is envisaged that every loco may be
   fitted with an ATO onboard system 18 to simplify the
   assembly of a consist.
20 It should be noted that the particular configuration of
   the consist 20 is not a critical or essential
   configuration for the operation of the rail transport
   system 10.    The system 10 will operate with a consist
   comprising a single head end loco and a number of wagons
25 30;  a light engine;   or at least one head end loco,
   multiple wagons and any number        (including zero) of banker
   locos.
   The ATO system 12 comprises a remote ATO control centre
30  (ATOCC) 16 and on each ATO enabled locomotive, at least
   one ATO onboard system 18.       To facilitate driverless
   operation, the functions of the train driver are                  split
   between the ATOCC 16 and the ATO onboard system 18.                         In
   particular, the ATOCC 16 provides operating parameters to
35 the ATO onboard system 18,      such as limit of authority
   data, clearance to commence a driverless journey, train
   configuration data, destination and target time of arrival
                                                   9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               -  11
   data.   The ATOCC 16 may update these parameters from time
   to time during a  journey of a consist 20.      ATOCC 16 may
   also issue commands so as to bring a consist to an
   unscheduled stop for reasons such as a fault or alarm, or
 5 other reasons as may be determined by an operator at the
   ATOCC 16.   The ATOCC 16 may also issue commands for the
   ATO onboard system 18 to activate a locomotive's horn and
   other systems  such as sand for traction control.
10 The ATO onboard systems  18 generate signals that operate
   the locomotive's throttle and brake according to a
   particular driving strategy which is dictated by data,
   such as destination and target time of arrival data,
   received from the ATOCC 16, along with train configuration
15 data.
   The wayside signalling system 26 may provide the rail
   transport system 10 with a fixed block signalling regime
   that typically includes wayside signals and/or cab-code
20 generators and wayside transponders.     A fixed block
   signalling system divides the rail network into a series
   of successive  sections of track.    Each section constitutes
   a  'block' within the fixed block signalling system.                    Each
   block is signalled individually by the signalling system.
25
   The way side signals  consist of wayside coloured lights.
   They communicate to a driver, when present onboard the
   locomotive, current operating conditions     (such as proceed,
   proceed with caution, or stop) within the block that
30 consist 20 is travelling.
   The  signal status of a block is typically dependent on
   whether either of the following two blocks is occupied by
   a train  (or other equipment).    If there is no train in
35 either of the next two blocks then the status of the
   current block is "proceed", i.e. a green light.               If the
   next block is empty but the following block is occupied,
                                               9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                                - 12
   then the status of the current block is "proceed with
   caution", i.e. a yellow light.     If the next block is
   occupied then the status of the current block is "stop",
   i.e. a red light, which means    stop at the end of the
 5 current block.
   Cab-code generators use the rails as a transmission medium
   for signalling to the onboard systems of consist 20 the
   current signal   (e.g. green, yellow, red) within the block
10 that consist 20 is travelling.     This signal corresponds
   with the wayside coloured light signal     (if used).               The
   rails of adjacent blocks are electrically isolated to
   facilitate transmission of block specific signals.
15 The wayside transponders transmit    signals to a passing
   consist 20.   The signals are detected and received by
   train borne components located on the head end lead loco
   Li.  The transponders are typically located at either end
   of a block and transmit   signals containing information
20 that verifies the locos current location and also
   information about the block that consist 20 is about to
   traverse.
   The signals received from the rails and the wayside
25 transponders provide what is called "in-cab signalling" to
   a driver when present on board the head end lead loco Li.
   Additionally an Automatic Train Protection        (ATP) system
   uses the signals received from the rails and the wayside
   transponders to override the ATO on board system 18                    (or
30 driver action if the train is operating in a manual mode)
   and thereby enforces limits of authority and speed
   restrictions.
   The TCS 24  controls signalling system 26 and determines
35 the signalling condition for each block of the rail
   transport system 10 at any particular point in time.                       The
   TCS 24 interfaces with human operators     (train controllers)
                                                9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 13
   charged with the responsibility of ensuring the safe
   working of the rail network.    The TCS 24 provides
   information such as the location and identity of
   locomotives, ATP parameters, arrival time and departure
 5 time to the ATOCC   16 for different  consists 20 at
   different locations on the rail network.     This is provided
   to the ATOCC 16 via voice and data communications.                   The
   ATOCC 16 informs the TCS 24   of the status of the ATO
   onboard systems  18 for each ATO enabled locomotive
10 operating within the system 10.    The TCS 24 and the ATOCC
   16 may form part of, or be co-located with, a Train
   Control Centre  (TCC) 25 in which train controllers manage
   the scheduling and routing of consists 20.       This includes
   the generation of train sheets for each consist 20.
15
   In general terms, the combination of the ATOCC 16 and the
   ATO onboard system 18 constitute the ATO system.                Thus the
   ATO system 12 is a dispersed system comprising a remote
   ATOCC  16 which may be located at considerable distance
20 from a rail network along which the consist 20 travels,
   and an ATO onboard system 18.    The ATO onboard system 18
   is provided in each loco that is required to operate in a
   driverless mode as a head end lead Li   or lead banker Bi
   loco.
25
   The ATO onboard system 18  interfaces with a locomotive
   control system  (LCS) 32 of the locos in which it is
   installed.  Driving instructions,   such as destination,
   target time of arrival and train configuration data are
30 sent from the ATOCC 16 through the communications network
   14 to the ATO onboard system of the lead loco Li.                 These
   driving instructions are processed and interpreted by the
   ATO onboard system which provides appropriate signals to
   the LCS 32.  These signals drive the loco Li in accordance
35 with a driving strategy dictated by the driving
   instructions as determined by the onboard ATO system 18.
   Pre journey instructions are provided to the ATO onboard
                                              9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                              - 14
   system 18 prior to commencement of a  journey.         This
   provides data that enables the consist 20 to drive
   automatically to its destination.   Additional driving
   instructions and commands may issue from the ATOCC 16
 5 during the journey.
   The wayside communications network 14   enables
   communication between a particular ATO onboard system 18
   and the ATOCC 16.
10
   The ATP system 28 is a safety system receptive to signals
   provided by the signalling system 26,  for example cab code
   signalling and transponder data.   The ATP is interfaced
   with the ATO onboard system 18 and provides overriding
15 operational control of the LCS 32 in the event of the head
   end lead loco Li, and thus the consist 20,    travelling
   outside of safe operating parameters as signalled by the
   signalling system 26.  The ATP system 28 is able to
   override the ATO onboard system 18 to enforce current
20 speed limits for the consist 20 having regard to current
   block signalling and network operating restrictions in
   view of a consists particular configuration.
   A more detailed description of each of the main components
25 and subsystems of the rail transport system 10 is now
   provided.
   ATO System
   The ATO system 12 comprises a combination of the ATOCC 16,
30 and the ATO onboard system 18.   As described above, the
   ATOCC 16 is provided at a remote location and communicates
   with the ATO onboard system 18 via communications network
   14.  The ATOCC 16 is staffed by a number of ATO operators
   who are able to supervise and control the movement of
35 consist 20 via one or more computer servers and a number
   of computer work stations each acting as a Human Machine
   Interface  (HMI). Thus, an ATO operator can use a HMI to
                                             9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                                  -  15
   monitor a consist 20 under ATO control and intervene in
   its     journey if required.  The ATOCC 16 is also provided
   with a server to facilitate communication with TCS 24.
 5 ATO Onboard System
   Referring to Figure 3, the ATO onboard system 18 comprises
   an ATO director 60 and an ATO controller 62.                The ATO
   controller 62 interfaces with the LCS 32 to generate and
   provide operating signals      for the lead locomotive Li                    of
10 consist 20.      An interface is provided between the ATO
   controller 62 and the ATP system 28.          Communication
   between the ATO controller 62 and the ATOCC 16 is via the
   onboard radio transceiver system 52 which interfaces the
   ATO controller 62 and the wayside data network 14.
15
   The ATO controller 62 is a computer which is programmed to
   drive the loco on which it is installed in accordance with
   operating signals received from the ATO director 60.                           The
   ATO Controller 62 is subject to overriding control by the
20 ATP system 28.
   The ATO director     60 receives   train   configuration           data and
   movement parameters, such as destination and target time
   of arrival data, from the ATO Controller 62.                The ATO
25 director     60 calculates appropriate operating signals such
   as throttle settings and brake settings and periodically
   communicates these to the ATO controller 62.
   Communication between the ATO director and ATO controller
   62 is via a wired connection.          Thus drive commands
30 operating a loco in a driverless manner are generated on
   board the relevant loco.
   The ATO controller     62 is configured to drive its               loco and
   associated consist 20 when in automatic mode; and, send
35 and receive messages to and from the ATOCC 16 and other
   components of the onboard locomotive systems.                 The ATO
   controller     62 configures the ATP system 28 on the basis of
                                                    9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 16
   train sheet data that is either input manually by a driver
   or communicated to it by the ATOCC 16.    Train sheet data
   is first compiled by a train controller at the train
   control centre 25 when the train is assembled in a
 5 marshalling yard.   The train sheet is updated after
   loading of the train.   A track database is also stored in
   the ATO onboard system 18.    The database provides
   information relating to the location of transponders,
   speed limits for consists that are loaded, unloaded and
10 have no wagons, and the locations of crossing points.
   In addition to being under the overriding control of the
   ATP system 28, the ATO controller 62 is also responsive to
   commands issued from the remote ATOCC 16.      This enables an
   operator at the ATOCC 16 to intervene in the journey of
15 the consist to bring it to a halt or to update its journey
   information, for example if a consist is re-routed mid
   journey.
   ATP System and Configuration
20 The ATP system 28 is a safety system receptive to the
   signalling system 26 and intervenes   in the operation of
   the consist 20 in the event that the consist 20 is
   travelling outside of safe operating parameters.                The ATP
   system receives and interprets   cab code signals received
25 through the rails from signalling system 26 as well as
   signals from the wayside transponders.    It detects an over
   speed condition through monitoring the lead loco Li
   tachometer, signal status for the current block, and train
   configuration data.
30
   The ATP may intervene during an overspeed event or other
   critical fault in one of three ways.    It may issue a
   warning that the consist is operating outside of current
   speed restrictions.   It may apply a service brake to
35 reduce the consist speed or it may bring the consist to a
   stop.
                                              9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                              - 17
   A consist has different operating parameters depending on
   the number of wagons, if any, and whether the wagons are
   loaded or unloaded.  Different speed and braking
   restrictions apply to the different train configurations.
 5 To supervise a consist effectively, the ATP system needs
   to be configured with data indicating the configuration of
   the consist it is supervising.
   The ATP system is configured either manually or remotely.
10 Manual configuration occurs after a train has been
   assembled in a marshalling yard.  Typically the train is
   unloaded at this point and is about to embark on a journey
   to a mine site where it is loaded with ore.       The manual
   update of ATP configuration data is performed by a driver
15 entering data into an onboard control panel as part of an
   ATO set up routine.  Subsequent to entering the train
   configuration data into the ATP system 28 the driver can
   activate a driverless mode of operation which enables the
   train to execute a driverless journey.
20
   Remote configuration of the ATP system 28 occurs during a
   driverless journey when configuration parameters change.
   Typically this occurs after loading of a consist.               To
   execute a remote update, train configuration data is
25 transmitted from the ATOCC 16 to the ATO Controller                62
   from where it is uploaded to the ATP system 28.            The
   transfer of information between the ATP system 28 and the
   ATO controller 62 is via an ATP-ATO interface.
   The train configuration entered into the ATP system 28
30 describes physical characteristics of the loco and the
   consist to which it is attached.  The train configuration
   data includes:
   1.   the number of locos attached to the consist;
35
   2.   the number of wagons attached to the consist              (this
        may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10);
                                            9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 18
   3.   the retardation rate of the loco;
   4.   the maximum speed of the consist;
 5 5.   the brake delay in seconds;
   6.   the train type  (eg, empty, loaded, light engine);
   7.   the consists wheel adhesion   (normal or low);             ;
10
   8.   the locomotives location; and
   9)   locomotive orientation   (e.g. long hood or short hood
        leading).
15
   When train configuration data is first uploaded to an ATP
   system 28, or when it is first updated, it is verified
   before consist 20 can commence a driverless journey under
   direction of the ATO system 12.    When the ATP
20 configuration is input or updated manually, the ATO
   Controller 62 receives ATP configuration data from the
   driver's input panel and updates the current ATP
   configuration and records the current ATP configuration as
   unverified.  The ATO controller 62 then sends the updated
25 but unverified ATP configuration   (ie, the new ATP
   configuration) to the train control system (TCS)24 for
   review and verification by an operator.    Assuming that the
   operator verifies the new ATP configuration, the TCS 24
   subsequently commands the ATO controller 62 to accept the
30 new configuration as valid.    The new configuration is then
   recorded by the ATO controller 62 as verified.            The ATO
   controller 62 then commands the onboard system of the
   locomotive to notify the driver that the ATP configuration
   has been verified.  The ATO system 12 will not operate to
35 automatically drive a consist without a verified ATP
   configuration.
                                              9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 19
   With the ATP system 28 configured the ATO system 12 is
   able to correctly interpret and apply signals         received
   from the signalling system 26 so as to maintain movement
   of the consist 20 within safe operating parameters.                    This
 5 enables the driver to switch the ATO onboard system from a
   manual mode of operation to an automatic mode          (i.e. an ATO
   mode).   The consist 20 will then be able to commence
   operation under the control of the ATO system.            Typically,
   the consist is unloaded at this point and will proceed to
10 a loading station for loading under direction of commands
   generated by the ATO Director 60 and implemented by the
   ATO Controller 62.
   Typically, destination data is uploaded to the ATO onboard
15 system 18 by the ATOCC 16 along with target time of
   arrival data.   This data is used by the ATO Director 62 to
   generate driving commands that satisfy various constraints
   including operational safety, train forces, brake wear and
   journey time.   A rail network that services more than one
20 mine site will require a different  set of operating
   commands  for reaching different mine site.
   During the journey to the mine site, the ATO Controller 62
   implements driving commands issued by the ATO Director 60.
25 These driving commands will have regard to current signal
   conditions on the network and within the block that the
   consist is currently operating.   The ATP system 28
   monitors train operating conditions,  such as speed,
   against track conditions, block signal conditions and in
30 cab  signals and overrides the drive commands issued by the
   ATO Director 62 if required to maintain safe operation of
   the consist.
   Once the consist 20 reaches the mine site it is loaded at
35 a loading station.   After loading, the train configuration
   data held by the ATO onboard systems 18 is updated,
   typically by signal issued from the ATOCC 16.           The updated
                                              9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 20
   data is entered into the ATP system 28 where it is sent to
   the TCS 24  for verification.   Once verified, the consist
   may proceed under direction of the ATO Director 62,
   subject to block signal conditions.    Typically, the ATO
 5 onboard systems will also be updated with destination data
   for the forward journey and an operator at the ATOCC 16
   will typically release the consist to the control of the
   ATO Director 60 and ATO Controller 60.    At completion of
   the return journey, the consist is unloaded in the
10 vicinity of a stock pile.
   ATP Details
   The ATP is configured to provide a speed resolution of
   1/16ms and to log an alarm when the cab coil pickup
15 voltage is less than 1OOmV.
   The ATP system is further configured so that brake tests
   are performed on demand by an ATO operator in the ATOCC 16
    (or via an onboard driver if present).   In addition, the
20 ATP system 28 is configured to conduct a service brake
   test and an emergency brake test independently of the ATO
   system 12.
   In order to ensure integrity of the brake systems, the ATP
25 system is configured to raise an alarm if an elapsed time
   since the last  service brake test or the last emergency
   brake test exceed respective predetermined periods which
   may be different for each type of brake test and may
   typically occur once per day.
30
   The ATP system 28 will log all non-critical ATP alarms and
   is configured to for acknowledgment of   semi-critical ATP
   alarms by an ATO operator when the ATO system 12 has
   control of and is driving a consist 20.    This will enable
35 an ATO operator to issue commands to the consist 20 if
   required by the circumstances at hand.    On the sensing of
   a critical ATP alarm, the ATP system 28 operates to apply
                                              9725973_1 (GHMatters) P78190.AU.3 28/11/17

                               - 21
    a service brake automatically.   The service brakes may
    also be applied if the ATP system does not receive cab
    code signals for a predetermined period of time for
    example 12 seconds.
  5
    In the event of an ATP system 28 failure, the ATP system
    is configured to apply full service brakes for a
    predetermined period of time such as 20 seconds before
    applying the emergency brake.   In addition, the emergency
10  brake will be applied by the ATP system 28 during an ATP
    service brake application if either the consist speed is
    not decreasing faster than a specified threshold profile;
    or, the brake pipe pressure is not reducing faster than a
    predetermined threshold profile.   In the event of the
15  above emergency brake application, the ATP system will
    request an end-of-train monitor  (ETM) dump to detect
    whether any brake valves are closed.
    It will be appreciated from the above description that the
20  railway transport system 10 enables the driverless
    operation in a safe and reliable manner, with the ability
    for human operators to intervene in the operation thereof
    from a remote location.
25  All modifications and variations that will be obvious to a
    person of ordinary skill in the art are deemed to be
    within the scope of the present invention the nature of
    which is to be determined from the above description and
