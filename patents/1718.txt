 Cross-Reference to Related Applications
 [0001]      The present application claims benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent
Application Serial No. 61/733,689 filed on December 5, 2012, the entirety of which is hereby

                                           BACKGROUND
Field
 [00021      The present disclosure relates to extrusion devices and, in particular, a hand-held
 implement configured to extrude a material so as to construct three-dimensional (3D) objects.
Description of the Related Art
 [0003]     Three-dimensional printers are known which may be used to produce 3D items of all
types. Certain printers operate by deposition of sequential layers of plastic while others function
by sequential agglomeration or solidification of layers of a precursor material. These printers
tend to be large and expensive and require the design to be provided as a computer file, for
example as generated by a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program.
[00041      U.S. Patent 3,665,158 to Froedge discloses a conventional handheld extrusion device.
A chamber is filled with a granulated solid plastic material and then sealed with a cap. The
contents of the chamber are heated to melt the plastic and create pressure within the chamber. A
passage leads from the chamber to a rotatable nozzle that blocks flow in a first position and
allows flow in a second position. A trigger is attached to the nozzle such that pulling the trigger
moves the nozzle to the second position, thereby allowing the molten plastic to be expelled from
the nozzle due to the pressure within the chamber. Releasing the trigger allows the nozzle to
return to the first position, thereby stopping the flow of plastic. There is no provision to
replenish the raw material without shutting off the device nor any mechanism to mechanically
feed material to the nozzle at a constant rate. In addition, Froedge's system does not provide a
means of cooling the extruded material.

                                               SUMMARY
 [00051      It is desirable to provide a reliable, easily refillable hand-held device to form 2D and
3D items without the need for computerized design files. The present disclosure describes a
hand-held device that allows a user to "draw" a 3D structure with a feed stock that can be
replenished while in continuous use.
[00061       In certain embodiments, a 3D drawing device is disclosed that includes a housing
configured for manipulation by a user's hand and to accept a feed stock, a nozzle assembly at
least partially disposed within the housing and having an exit nozzle, a motor disposed within the
housing, and a gear train disposed within the housing and coupled between the motor and the
feed stock and configured such that rotation of the motor causes the feed stock to be extruded out
of the exit nozzle to form a three-dimensional object.
[00071       In certain embodiments, a 3D drawing device is disclosed that includes a housing
configured for manipulation by a user's hand and to accept a feed stock. The housing has an
internal volume and at least one cooling port in fluid communication with the internal volume.
The 3D drawing device also includes a nozzle assembly at least partially disposed within the
housing proximate to the at least one cooling port and having an exit nozzle, a fan disposed
within the housing and configured to draw air into the internal volume and then force the air out
of the at least one cooling port, a motor disposed within the housing, and an actuator coupled to
the housing. Actuation of the actuator causes the feed stock to be extruded out of the exit nozzle
to form a three-dimensional object.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00141       The present disclosure describes a hand-held device that allows a user to "draw" a 2D
or 3D structure and to easily refill or replace the feed stock.
[0015]       The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various
configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations
in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated
herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific
details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology.
However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be
practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and
components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the
subject technology. Like components are labeled with identical element numbers for ease of
understanding.
[00161       As used within this disclosure, the phrase "feed stock" means any material provided
in any form suitable for processing within the 3D drawing device so as to provide the desired
output stream. Feed stock may be a thermoplastic such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS),
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a polylactic acid (PLA), a thermoset material such as an epoxy, a
metal such as tin or lead or a mixture of metals. Feed stock may be a single material or a mixture
                                                  -3-

of materials, such as a rod having particles of a first material dispersed within a matrix of a
second material.
 [00171      FIG. I is a perspective view of an exemplary 3D drawing device 100 according to
certain aspects of the present disclosure. The device 100 includes a housing 110 in which a
control assembly 120, a nozzle assembly 130, a fan assembly 140 are provided. The housing 110
may be sized and configured to fit in a user's hand and suitably shaped to allow for manipulation
like a pen or pencil. An actuator, for example buttons 122 and 124 in this embodiment, may be
positioned to allow the user to actuate either the actuator while holding the device 100. In this
embodiment, the user may actuate one or both of buttons 122, 124 while manipulating the
3D drawing device 100. In this embodiment, the device 100 is configured to accept a feed
stock 20 in the form of a strand that may be 3 mm in diameter. In certain embodiments, the feed
stock 20 may be provided as a cut length, for example 30 cm in length, or as a continuous strand
drawn from a spool (not shown in FIG. 1).      includes an input portal 18, or other input element,
such as a hopper, for example, through which a raw material 19 is provided to the implement 10.
The feed stock 20 may be a thermoplastic material, for example a PVC, an ABS, or a PLA,
however, other embodiments may accept other types of material, such as a thermoset plastic or a
metal or combination of materials.
[00181       In an example of use of one embodiment of the device 100, the user selects a
particular type and color of a thermoplastic feed stock 20 and introduces the feed stock 20 into
the entrance port 115 (see FIG. 2) and connects a power cord (not shown in FIG. 1) to a power
source, such as a wall outlet. In certain embodiments, the 3D drawing device 100 may include a
portable power source (not shown in FIGS. 1-2), for example a lithium polymer battery, to power
the device 100. After a warm-up period, the user may press button 122 while drawing a line on a
surface with the device 100, for example tracing a pattern on a printed sheet, in a manner similar
to drawing a line with a pencil. A column 22 of the feed stock 20 is extruded from the nozzle
assembly while the button 122 is depressed. In certain embodiments, the column 22 may be
0.3 mm in diameter. If the user moves the device along the surface at approximately the same
speed as the rate of extrusion of the column 22, the user will create a solid, three-dimensional
"line" on the surface. In certain embodiments, the feed stock 20 exists the nozzle assembly 130
in essentially a solid form such that the extruded column retains its shape. In certain
                                                  -4-

 embodiments, freshly extruded feed stock 20 will bond to previously extruded columns 22 such
 that a structure may be formed by drawing a line across to onto a previously drawn column 22.
 [0019]        In certain embodiments, button 122 may cause the feed stock 20 to be extruded at a
 first rate, for example 2.6 mm/sec, while the second button 124 may cause the feed stock 20 to
 be extruded at a second rate, for example 5.0 mm/sec. In certain embodiments, the first rate may
 be in the range of 0.1-10.0 mm/sec and the second rate may be in the range of 2-50 mm/sec. In
 certain embodiments, the first and second rates are chosen to provide a speed appropriate for the
 intended user, for example a device 100 intended for use by a young child may have slower rates
than a device 100 intended for an adult artist. In certain embodiments, the 3D drawing
 device 100 may include a variable speed control mechanism (not shown in FIG. 1-2) to allow the
 user to adjust one or more of the rates of extrusion. In certain embodiments, the variable speed
control mechanism may include a dial. In certain embodiments, releasing either of the buttons
 122, 124 may cause the internal mechanism to draw the feed stock 20 backward a certain
amount, thereby breaking off the extruded column 22. In this manner, the user can "write" with
the 3D drawing device 100 in much the same manner as they would with a pen except they can
do so in three dimensions since the extruded material is three-dimensional. The user can create
free-form lines, shapes or other objects, as desired. A user may additionally use stencils or other
guides in order to create desired objects such as sculpture, jewelry, artistic pieces, etc. In
addition, or in the alternative, the 3D drawing device 100 may be used to repair or enhance
existing objects and structures. In certain embodiments, pressing both buttons 122, 124 at the
same time may cause another action, such as expelling the unused portion of the feed stock 20
from the entrance port 115 such that the user may switch to a different color or type of feed
stock 20.
[0020]        FIG. 2 is a cut-way view of the device 100 of FIG. I with a portion of the
housing 110 removed according to certain aspects of the present disclosure. It can be seen that a
circuit assembly 126 is positioned under the switches 122, 124 and a feed mechanism 150 is
disposed on the lower housing 114, with the feed stock 20 entering through the entrance port 115
and passing over and between elements of the feed mechanism 150, which is discussed in greater
detail with respect to FIGS. 4A-4B. In certain embodiments, the circuit assembly 126 may
include a processor while, in certain embodiments, the circuit assembly 126 may include analog
                                                  -5-

circuit elements such as mechanical switches, resistors, capacitors, and other electrical elements
(not visible in FIG. 2) as known to those of skill in the art. In certain embodiments, the circuit
assembly 126 may include a power conditioning circuit (not shown) that converts power from
the power source to a different form, such as a direct current (DC) voltage. In certain
embodiments, the circuit assembly 126 may include a portable power source (not shown in
FIG. 2). In certain embodiments, the circuit assembly 126 may be connected to an external
power source through a power cord (not shown in FIGS. 1-2). In certain embodiments, the 3D
drawing device 100 also includes an external control interface 127 that is connected to the circuit
assembly 126 and configured to accept actuation commands from a remote system, such as a
computer numerical control (CNC) machine. In certain embodiments, the housing 110 may be
adapted for mounting on a tool interface of a CNC machine such that the machine can
manipulate the 3D drawing device 100 to create 3D objects. For example, the external control
interface 127 may include three electrical pins, wherein a pin 1 is a common such as a ground, a
pin 2 that is coupled to the button 122 such that provision of a DC voltage across pin I and pin 2
is equivalent to pressing button 122, and a pin 3 that is coupled to the button 124 such that
provision of a DC voltage across pin I and pin 3 is equivalent to pressing button 124. In certain
embodiments, the external control interface 127 may be configured to accept signals through a
radio frequency (RF) or optical wireless system. In certain embodiments, the external control
interface 127 may be configured to accept signals through a fiber-optic cable.
[00211       FIGS. 3A-3B are cross-sectional and cutaway views of the device 100 of FIG. I
according to certain aspects of the present disclosure. FIG. 3A is a side view of the entire
3D drawing device 100, showing how the upper housing 112 and lower housing 114 together
form an internal volume 116 in which is located the feed mechanism 150. At the right end, it can
be seen that the nozzle assembly 130 includes an extruder 132 and a guide tube 134, which are
discussed in greater detail with respect to FIG. 3B. the fan assembly 140 includes a fan
cover 142, which is stationary and attached to the upper housing 112, an impeller 14 located
underneath the cover 142 and configured to draw air into the internal volume 116 through ports
(not visible in FIG. 3A) in the cover 142. A motor 146 is mounted, in this example, to the lower
housing 114 and drives the impeller 144 at a constant speed. The air that is drawn into the
internal volume may, in certain embodiments, flow out through either cooling ports 118 in the
                                                 -6-

upper and lower housings 112, 114. The cooling ports 118 are discussed in greater detail with
respect to FIG. 3B. It can be seen in FIG. 3A that, in this embodiment, the feed stock 20 follows
a straight path though the device 100.
[0022]       FIG. 3B is a close-up, cutaway view of the nozzle assembly 130. The extruder 132
has a first chamber 135 formed as a cylindrical bore of approximately the same diameter as the
feed stock 20 and an extrusion passage 133 of a smaller diameter, terminating in an exit
nozzle 133A. In certain embodiments, the first chamber 135 may have a first diameter of 3 mm
while the extrusion passage 133 has a diameter of 0.3 mm. In certain embodiments, the extruder
132 is formed of a thermally conductive material, for example a metal or a ceramic, with a
heating element, for example a nichrome wire, (not visible in FIG. 3B) wound around the
exterior circumference. When the device 100 is connected to a power source, the heating
element raises the temperature of the extruder 132 to a temperature that may be above the
melting point of the feed stock 20. In certain embodiments, the nozzle assembly 130 includes a
temperature sensor that is connected to the circuit assembly 126 which may include a
temperature control circuit to regulate the power to the heater element so as to maintain the
temperature of the extruder 132 within a desired range of a setpoint. As systems and methods for
temperature regulation are known to those of skill in the art, the details are not provided herein.
In certain embodiments, an indicator (not shown), for example an LED, may be provided to
indicate that the extruder 132 has reached a temperature sufficient to melt the feed stock 20.
[0023]       In certain embodiments, for example with a feed stock comprising a plastic, the
temperature of the extruder 132 may be in the range of 20-500 'C. In certain embodiments, for
example with a feed stock comprising a metal, the temperature of the extruder 132 may be in the
range of 1000-2000 'C. In certain embodiments, for example with a feed stock comprising a
metal such as lead, tin, or mixtures thereof, the temperature of the extruder 132 may be in the
range of 100-400 'C. In certain embodiments, for example with a feed stock comprising a metal
such as copper, gold, silver or mixtures thereof, the temperature of the extruder 132 may be in
the range of 1000-1200 'C. In certain embodiments, for example with a feed stock comprising a
metal such as platinum, the temperature of the extruder 132 may be in the range of
 1600-2000 'C. In certain embodiments, the 3D drawing device 100 may include a variable
temperature controller (not shown) that is connected to the circuit assembly 126 to allow a user
                                                  -7-

to select a setpoint temperature for the extruder 132. In certain embodiments, the variable
temperature controller may allow the use to select a type of material, for example
"thermoplastic," and the circuit assembly 126 will adjust the setpoint temperature of the extruder
 132. In certain embodiments, the variable temperature controller may include a dial.
[0024]       A guide tube 134 is aligned with the first chamber 135 of the extruder 132 such that
feed stock passing through the guide tube 134 enters the first chamber 135. In certain
embodiments, the guide tube 134 may be formed of a low-friction material, such as
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), so allow the feed stock 20 to slide easily while also minimizing
the gap between the guide tube 134 and feed stock 20. The extruder 132 and guide tube 134 are
held in alignment by a mounting tube 138. In certain embodiments, the mounting tube 138 is
formed of a metal having a relatively low thermal conductivity, compared to other metals. In
certain embodiments, the mounting tube 138 may be a stainless steel. In certain embodiments,
an insulating film (not visible in FIG. 3B), for example a polyimide tape, may be applied over
the heating element and under the mounting tube 138.
 [00251       In certain embodiments, an insulator 131 may be provided over the mounting
tube 138 so as to reduce the amount of heat transferred from the extruder 132 to the upper and
lower housings 112, 114. In certain embodiments, one or both of the upper and lower
housings 112, 114 may have cooling ports 118 formed therethrough such that air can flow from
the interior volume 116 to the ambient atmosphere. In certain embodiments, the passages
formed in the top and bottom housings 112, 114 that lead to the cooling ports 118 may be angled
such that the air that emerges from the cooling ports 118 is directed inward toward the tip 137.
Thus, as the air exits the cooling ports 118, the air passes by the tip 137 of the extruder 132,
cooling both the tip 137 and the feed stock 20 that just been extruded from the extrusion
passage 133. Both of these cooling effects serve to reduce the temperature of the feed stock 20
as it exits the extrusion passage 133 such that the feed stock 20 may be essentially solid as it
exits the extrusion passage 133. In certain embodiments, the freshly extruded feed stock 20 may
be pliable and formable into various shapes. In certain embodiments, the surface of the freshly
extruded feed stock 20 may be receptive to attachment, e.g. sticky, such that the extruded
material will bond to other previously extruded feed stock 20.
                                                  -8-

[0026]       In certain embodiments, there may be a gap between the insulator 131 and the
mounting tube 138. In certain embodiments, this gap may provide a thermal break so as to
further thermally isolate the upper and lower housings 112, 114 from the extruder 132.
[00271       As the feed stock 20 is driven toward the extrusion passage 133 by the feed
mechanism 150 (not shown in FIG. 3B), the portion of the feed stock 20 that is within the
extruder 132 will be heated by the extruder 132 such that the feed stock 20 within the first
chamber 135 softens or melts. As the solid feed stock 20 is forced forward, the softened or
molten feed stock 20 will be forced out through the extrusion passage 133 and emerge from the
tip 137, where the cooling air that is flowing out of the cooling ports 118 flows over the freshly
extruded feed stock 20, thereby cooling and solidifying the feed stock 20. In certain
embodiments, a portion of the extruder 132 that extends outward beyond a front plane 102 may
be cooled to a temperature below the temperature of the main portion of the extruder 132 by the
air flowing out of the cooling ports 118. In certain embodiments, the temperature of the tip 137
may be below the melting point of the feed stock 20.
[00281       FIGS. 4A-4B are plan and perspective views of the feed mechanism 150 according to
certain aspects of the present disclosure. FIG. 4A shows a series of gear pairs 153, 154, 155,
 156, and 157 that are driven by the motor 152 through a spur gear (not visible in FIG. 4A) that is
attached to the rotor of the motor 152. Each gear pair has a large gear and a small gear that are
fixedly attached to each other and rotate about a common axis. The small gear of the motor 152
drives the large gear 153A, which causes the small gear 153B to drive the large gear 154A. In
certain embodiments, the large gears 153A, 154A, 155A, 156A, and 157A each may have 40
teeth while the small gears 153B, 154B, 155B and 156B (not visible in FIG. 4A), and 157B may
have 12 teeth, providing a 40:12 step-down ratio between each gear pair. In certain
embodiments, the step-down from the motor 152 to the small gear 157B may be 5*(40:12) or
approximately 17:1, i.e. seventeen complete rotations of the motor 152 causes only one complete
rotation of the small gear 157B. In certain embodiments, the gear pairs 153, 154, 155, 156, and
157 may have a different number of teeth on the large and/or small gears. In certain
embodiments, the gear pairs 153, 154, 155, 156, and 157 may not have the same number of teeth
on each corresponding large or small gear.
                                                 -9-

[00291      In use, the use of a motor 152 to drive a step-down gear train 150 to control the
advancement of the feed stock 20 provides an improved level of control over the rate of
extrusion of the feed stock 20. For example, a conventional glue gun has a direct linkage
between a trigger and the glue stick, such that pressure on the trigger on the trigger is directly
transferred to the rod. The rate of advancement of the glue stick, and therefore the rate of
extrusion, is dependent upon the viscosity of the melted glue and therefore caries over a die
range. This often results in excessive glue being dispensed. In addition, since releasing the
trigger does not retract the glue stick, there is frequently a "tail" of glue drawn out of the glue
gun as the nozzle is moved away from the dispensing location. In contrast, the disclosed 3D
drawing device 100 provides a constant rate of extrusion, for example 3 mm/sec, due to the
controlled motion provided by the motor 152 and gear train 150. In addition, the circuit
assembly 126 causes the motor 152 to briefly run in reverse when the button 122 is released,
thereby retracting the feed stock 20 slightly and drawing the melted feed stock 20 that is within
the extrusion passage 133 back into the extruder 132, thereby cleanly severing the extruded
column 22 from the tip 137.
[00301      FIG. 4B shows how the teeth of the final small gear 157B engage the feed stock 20.
In this embodiment, the feed stock 20 passes by a post 119 of the lower housing 114, then by the
small gear 157B, and then into the guide tube 134. In certain embodiments, the gear 157B is
positioned such that the teeth press against the feed stock 20, which is restrained from lateral
motion away from the teeth of gear 157B by the post 119 and the guide tube 134, such that
rotation of the gear 157B applies an axial force, i.e. directed along the length, to the feed
stock 20. Rotation of the gear set 150 in a first direction will cause the feed stock 20 to move
linearly forward, i.e. toward the tip 137. As this portion of feed stock 20 is not affected by the
heating within the extruder 132, rotation of the gear set 150 in a reverse direction will cause the
feed stock 20 to move linearly backward, i.e. away from the tip 137.
[00311      It can be seen from FIGS. 4A and 4B that rotation of the motor 152, which is
controlled by pressing one of the buttons 122, 124, causes the feed stock 20 to move forward or
backward. The step-down from the motor 152 to the small gear 157B provides a smooth rate of
motion of the feed stock, as the motor 152 may turn at a speed within a normal range of smooth

100321       FIGS. 5A-5B are perspective and cutaway views of another embodiment 200 of a
3D drawing device according to certain aspects of the present disclosure. FIG. 5A shows a
3D drawing device 200 configured to accept a feed stock in the form of pellets 25 that are held in
a hopper 250 attached to the body 210. A power cord 270 is attached to the body 210. FIG. 5B
is a cut-away view showing a feed screw 260 that transfers the pellets 25 from the hopper 250 to
the nozzle assembly 230 that melts the pellets 25 and, under pressure provided by the feed
screw 260, extrudes the melted feed stock 25 in a manner similar to the nozzle assembly 130 of
embodiment 100, previously discussed. Other features of the embodiment 100, such as the
cooling ports 118, may also be provided in embodiment 200. In certain embodiments, the pellets
may be transferred from the hopper 250 to the nozzle assembly 130 by other mechanisms, for
example a reciprocating cylinder (not shown in FIGS. 5A-5B) as will be known to those of skill
in the art. In certain embodiments, the feed stock may be provided as a liquid, for example an
epoxy with beads of catalyst suspended in a liquid polymer, that is held in the hopper 250. In
certain embodiments, passage of the liquid feed stock through an extrusion passage, similar to
extrusion passage 133 of embodiment 100, may modify the liquid feed stock such that it hardens
quickly after extrusion from the 3D drawing device 200.
10033]       The disclosed examples of a 3D drawing device illustrate the principles of its
construction and use. The provision of a flow of cooling air at the tip to quickly solidify the
extruded feed stock allows the user to work in three dimensions, rather than being forced to rely
on a support surface to hold the still-fluid extruded material in place while it hardens. The use of
a mechanical gear train to advance the feed stock, instead of a pressurized supply or a direct
connection between a trigger and a feed rod, allows precise control of the rate of extrusion,
thereby increasing the uniformity of the extruded column of material and allowing precise
placement without excess material.
100341       This application includes description that is provided to enable a person of ordinary
skill in the art to practice the various aspects described herein. While the foregoing has
described what are considered to be the best mode and/or other examples, it is understood that
