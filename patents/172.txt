                                                        OVERVIEW
             For     safety        reasons,           an    intrabody             catheter            is      typically
   discarded           after       use,        due      to    the       catheter            having          come       into
   contact with the body of a subject.                                   In many cases, the                     catheter
 0 is    fixedly          coupled       to    a   handle,        such       that,       when       discarding           the
   catheter,           there      is     no     choice      but      to      also      discard           the     handle.
   Unfortunately,                 however,              catheter             handles             often           include
   relatively expensive circuitry or other components.
             Embodiments           of     the     present         invention            therefore             provide      a
 5 catheter handle              that      is partly reusable.                      The handle comprises                   a
   distal handle-piece, which, typically,                                    is    fixedly coupled to the

   coupled to           the distal handle-piece.                         After the            catheter is            used,
   the     proximal         handle-piece             is    decoupled           from       the      distal        handle

   pieces        of     the    handle         are     held      adjacent           to     one      another.             One
   advantage           of   such       an    embodiment           is     that       the      handle-pieces              are

             Typically,            the    proximal         handle-piece                  and      distal       handle
   piece       are    coupled         together      such      that         they        are     held     adjacent        to

   one    another.            For       example,           the     connectors            may     hold       the     two
   handle-pieces            together         such       that      the      separation          DO    between        the
   respective         handle-piece             bodies         54    of     the    handle-pieces              is    less
   than 5 mm.            (The      "body"      of     a   handle-piece            is     the portion            of  the
 5 handle-piece           that         does      not       include          the     connector,            which      is
   coupled to the            connector.)               For example,            the connectors may hold
   the    two       handle-piece              bodies           in     contact           with      one       another.
   Typically,         neither           one     of      the      connectors            comprises          a     cable,
   which     would        cause         the     two      handle-pieces               to     be     coupled         more

          As    described           above      in    the      Overview,          distal       handle-piece           32
   is   typically fixedly connected to the                                catheter,         and is        therefore
   discarded          after         use,       whereas           proximal            handle-piece               34   is
   typically reused with multiple catheters.
 5        As     illustrated              in    Fig.       1,     a   plurality            of    wires         38   run
   through        the        lumen         of      catheter            26.            These        wires         carry
   electrocardiographic                    signals           from      the       catheter            (e.g.,        from
   electrodes         at the        distal       end      of    the    catheter)          to    distal       handle
   piece 32.          In some embodiments,                     distal handle-piece                  32    comprises
 0 a   high-voltage           suppressor             (HVS)       40,     which        suppresses           any     high
   voltages        in    these         signals,          and/or        an     analog        filter         (AF)     42,
   which    filters          out     noise        from       these      signals.            Alternatively            or
   additionally, distal handle-piece                              32 may comprise a memory                        (MEM)
   46,   which       stores         relevant         data       for     constructing             map      52.       For
25 example,       memory        46     may    store        data     related          to   the     configuration
   of the     electrodes at the distal end of the catheter,                                            and/or data
   related to the calibration of the catheter.
          Typically,           wires        38     also       carry      tracking          signals,          such    as
   the     induced          voltages           described             above,          which        indicate          the
30 position and orientation of the catheter.
          Typically,            distal       handle-piece              32     comprises          a     multiplexer
   44,   which      selectively            passes         the    plurality           of    signals,         received
   via    wires        38,       to      proximal          handle-piece               34.         For       example,

   multiplexer 44 may sequentially pass the                                         signals,         i.e.,      pass        the
   signals           one     at      a     time,         to     the     proximal          handle-piece.                    The
   multiplexer             thus       facilitates             using      a   large       number       of    distal-end
   electrodes,            without           requiring          that     the handle-piece                connector            be
 5 capable          of     simultaneously                 passing         a    large       number         of     signals.
    (Multiplexer             44      may      alternatively             be     referred         to    as     an      analog
   switch.)
            Typically, proximal handle-piece                                  34    comprises         an     analog-to
   digital          (A/D)      converter             50,    which      digitizes          any     analog         signals,
 0 such      as      the    above-described                   ECG     and    tracking         signals,           received
   from the catheter                    via the         distal handle-piece.                    Alternatively or
   additionally,                 the       proximal            handle-piece              may      comprise             other
   circuitry, which processes these signals.                                            The   processed signals
   are     passed          to     cable          36,     which,        as     described          above,         delivers
 5 these signals to console 30.
            As       described            above,         an     advantage           of    embodiments              of       the
   present            invention             is      that       the      circuitry           contained             in        the
   proximal handle-piece need not be discarded after use.
            It      is    noted        that        the     configuration             of    handle        22     shown        in

   of     the     present          disclosure             includes         any     suitable          configuration.
   For     example,         each        of     the     handle-pieces             may     include        any      suitable
   types of, and arrangement of, components.
            Advantageously,                   some       embodiments            of    the    present           invention
25 allow       the proximal               handle-piece              to be       decoupled         from the           distal
   handle-piece              (and        catheter),            and     subsequently            recoupled            to      the
   distal        handle-piece                 or     coupled         to    a     different         distal         handle
