                   BRUTON'S TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS
                   CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]           This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed on 22 April 2016, which is a divisional application of Australian Application
No. 2010289313, filed on 3 September 2010, and is related to International Patent Application
No. PCT/US2010/047883, filed on 3 September 2010 and claims priority from U.S. Provisional
Patent Application No. 61/240,011, filed on 4 September 2009; each of which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]           Protein kinases are a large multigene family consisting of more than 500 proteins
which play a critical role in the development and treatment of a number of human diseases in
oncology, neurology and immunology.           The Tec kinases are non-receptor tyrosine kinases
which consists of five members (Tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma),
Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase), Itk (interleukin-2 (IL-2)-inducible T-cell kinase; also known as
Emt or Tsk), Rlk (resting lymphocyte kinase; also known as Txk) and Bmx (bone-marrow
tyrosine kinase gene on chromosome X; also known as Etk)) and are primarily expressed in
haematopoietic cells, although expression of Bmx and Tec has been detected in endothelial and
liver cells. Tec kinases (Itk, Rlk and Tec) are expressed in T cell and are all activated
downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR). Btk is a downstream mediator of B cell receptor
(BCR) signaling which is involved in regulating B cell activation, proliferation, and
differentiation. More specifically, Btk contains a PH domain that binds phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3).     PIP3 binding induces Btk to phosphorylate phospholipase C
(PLCy), which in turn hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce two secondary messengers, inositol
triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activate protein kinase PKC, which then
induces additional B-cell signaling. Mutations that disable Btk enzymatic activity result in
XLA syndrome (X-linked agammaglobulinemia), a primary immunodeficiency.                    Given the
critical roles which Tec kinases play in both B-cell and T-cell signaling, Tec kinases are targets
of interest for autoimmune disorders.
[0003]           Consequently, there is a great need in the art for effective inhibitors of Btk. The
present invention fulfills these and other needs.

terms "heterocycle," "heterocyclyl," "heterocyclyl ring," "heterocyclic group," "heterocyclic
moiety," and "heterocyclic radical," are used interchangeably herein, and also include groups in
which a heterocyclyl ring is fused to one or more aryl, heteroaryl, or cycloaliphatic rings, such as
indolinyl, 3H-indolyl, chromanyl, phenanthridinyl, or tetrahydroquinolinyl, where the radical or
point of attachment is on the heterocyclyl ring. A heterocyclyl group may be mono- or bicyclic.
The term "heterocyclylalkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclyl, wherein the
alkyl and heterocyclyl portions independently are optionally substituted.
[0027]         As used herein, the term "partially unsaturated" refers to a ring moiety that
includes at least one double or triple bond. The term "partially unsaturated" is intended to
encompass rings having multiple sites of unsaturation, but is not intended to include aryl or
heteroaryl moieties, as herein defined.
[00281         As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the suffix "-ene" is used to
describe a bivalent group. Thus, any of the terms above can be modified with the suffix "-ene"
to describe a bivalent version of that moiety.          For example, a bivalent carbocycle is
"carbocycylene", a bivalent aryl ring is "arylene", a bivalent benzene ring is "phenylene", a
bivalent heterocycle is "heterocyclylene", a bivalent heteroaryl ring is "heteroarylene", a bivalent
alkyl chain is "alkylene", a bivalent alkenyl chain is "alkenylene", a bivalent alkynyl chain is
"alkynylene", and so forth.
[0029]         As described herein, compounds of the invention may, when specified, contain
"optionally substituted" moieties. In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the
term "optionally" or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are
replaced with a suitable substituent.   Unless otherwise indicated, an "optionally substituted"
group may have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more
than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent
                                              10

selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every
position. Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that
result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable," as used
herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to
allow for their production, detection, and, in certain embodiments, their recovery, purification,
and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.

[00361          As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts
which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the
tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the
like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable
salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically
acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by
reference.
[0037]          In certain embodiments, the neutral forms of the compounds are regenerated by
contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional
manner. In some embodiments, the parent form of the compound differs from the various salt
forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
[00381          Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all
isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the
structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, Z and E double
bond isomers, and Z and E conformational isomers. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as
well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures of the present
compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms
                                                13

of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless
otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only
in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the
present structures including the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the
                                 13
replacement of a carbon by a        C- or 1C-enriched   carbon are within the scope of this invention.
Such compounds are useful, for example, as analytical tools, as probes in biological assays, or as
therapeutic agents in accordance with the present invention.
[00391            The term "oxo," as used herein, means an oxygen that is double bonded to a
carbon atom, thereby forming a carbonyl.
[0040]            One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the synthetic methods, as
described herein, utilize a variety of protecting groups. By the term "protecting group," as used
herein, it is meant that a particular functional moiety, e.g., 0, S, or N, is masked or blocked,
permitting, if desired, a reaction to be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a
multifunctional compound.       Suitable protecting groups are well known in the art and include
those described in detail in Protecting Groups in OrganicSynthesis, T. W. Greene and P. G. M.
Wuts,   3 rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by
reference. In certain embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give a
protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions; the protecting group is preferably
selectively removable by readily available, preferably non-toxic reagents that do not attack the
other functional groups; the protecting group forms a separable derivative (more preferably
without the generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group will preferably have
a minimum of additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction. As detailed herein,
oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon protecting groups may be utilized. By way of non-limiting
example,       hydroxyl    protecting     groups    include    methyl,   methoxylmethyl       (MOM),

Exemplary Syntheses
[0113]         Compounds of the invention are synthesized by an appropriate combination of
generally well known synthetic methods. Techniques useful in synthesizing the compounds of
the invention are both readily apparent and accessible to those of skill in the relevant art. The
discussion below is offered to illustrate certain of the diverse methods available for use in
assembling the compounds of the invention. However, the discussion is not intended to define
the scope of reactions or reaction sequences that are useful in preparing the compounds of the
present invention.
[0114]         Compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to Scheme A utilizing a
wide variety of synthetic approaches such as Route I wherein substituted pyridine moieties can
undergo palladium-catalyzed arylation or alkenylation with alkyl bromobenzoate or triflates or
alkyl heterocyclic carboxylate or triflate to afford compounds with structures similar to those
represented by A.2      (Li, J. J.; Gribble, G. W. In Palladium in Heterocyclic Chemistry;
Pergamom: Amsterdam, 2000; Vol. 20. Junfeng, H.; Orac, C. M.; McKay, S.; McKay, D. B.;
Bermeier, S. C Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 2008, 16, 3816. Nakamura, H.; Onagi, S.;
Kamakura, T. J. Org. Chem., 2005, 70, 2357. Hartner, F. W.; Hsiao, Y.; Eng, K. K.; Rivera, N.

Tschaen, D.; Volante, R. P. J. Org. Chem., 2004, 69, 8723). The corresponding substituted biaryl
or alkyl pyridines A.2 can be reduced to afford the substituted heterocycle via catalytic
hydrogenation using palladium on carbon or by other methods familiar to those skilled in the art
and subsequently be protected with the appropriate protecting group to give compounds of
structure A.3.
[0115]         Alternatively compounds of formula (I) can be synthesized utilizing route II by
reacting commercially available substituted pyrrolidin-3-ones, piperidin-3-ones or azepa-3-ones
with lithium diisopropyl amine (LDA) or by other bases familiar to one skilled in the art and
trifuoromethanesulfonic anhydride in a solvent such as THF or another appropriate non
hydroxylic solvent to yield the vinyl triflate A.5. Compounds which structure similar to those
represented by A.5 can undergo palladium-catalyzed arylation with alkyl bromobenzoate or alkyl
heterocyclic carboxylate to yield compounds with structures similar to those represented by A.6.
                                              44

The substituted unsaturated heterocycle maybe reduced to afford the substituted heterocycles A.3
via catalytic hydrogenation or by other methods familiar to those skilled in the art.
[01161            Another method for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) is illustrated in
route III were by commercially available substituted heterocycles such as pyrrolidine carboxylic
acid, piperidine carboxylic acid or azepane carboxylic acid can be subjected to various key
transformations to facilitate the formation of substituted heteroaromatic moieties A.3. (Saunders,

1399. Gong, P. et. al. J. Med. Chem. 2007, 50, 3686). The alkyl ester can be hydrolyzed to the
carboxylic acid and subjected to the Curtius reaarangement (Scriven, E. F.; Turnbull, K.; Chem.
Rev. 1988, 88, 297; Brase, S.; Gil, C.; Knepper, K.; Zimmermann, V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.
2005, 44, 5188) to afford the primary amine A.8. The amine A.8 can be reacted with the
appropriate electrophile (Chong, P. Y.; Janicki, S. Z.; Petillo, P. A. Journal of Organic
Chemistry 1998,      63, 8515) in the presence of an organic base such as DIEA or other bases
familiar to one skilled in the art and in a solvent such as DMF or another appropriate solvent to
yield I-c. Alternatively, an amine A.9. can be reacted with chloroformate or chlorothioformate or
o-, p-nitrophenylchloroformate or phenylchloroformate (or their thiocarbonyl equivalents),
followed by displacement with an amine to yield the corresponding urea or thiourea. The
protecting group on the heterocyclic amine can be removed using the appropriate conditions to
afford A.10 which can be alkylated using the corresponding substituted pyridyl or pyrimidyl
moieties using conditions such as DIEA or other bases familiar to one skilled in the art and in a
solvent such as DMF or another appropriate solvents to yield I-c. Alternatively, the N alkylation
of A.10 can be also accomplished utilizing Buchwald coupling (Shafir, A. Buchwald, S. L. J.
Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 8742. Mehrotra, M. M. et. al. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry
Letters 2002, 12, 1103) to afford compounds of formula (I-c).

amine.     Suitable leaving groups are well known in the art, e.g., see, "Advanced Organic
Chemistry," Jerry March,    5 th Ed., pp. 351-357, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y. Such leaving groups

electrophile (Chong, P. Y.; Janicki, S. Z.; Petillo, P. A. Journalof Organic Chemistry 1998, 63,
8515) in the presence of an organic base such as DIEA or other bases familiar to one skilled in

nitrophenylchloroformate or phenylchloroformate (or their thiocarbonyl equivalents), followed
by displacement with an amine also yields the corresponding urea or thiourea. The protecting

the amine and reacted with the corresponding substituted pyridyl or pyrimidyl moieties using
DIEA or by other bases familiar to one skilled in the art and in a solvent such as DMF or another
appropriate solvents to yield compounds of formula (I-d). Alternatively, the N alkylation can also

Methods of Use
[0125]              In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention are for use in
medicine.        In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention are useful as kinase
inhibitors. In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention are selective inhibitors
of Btk.       In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of decreasing Btk
enzymatic activity. Such methods include contacting a Btk with an effective amount of a Btk
                                                           52

inhibitor. Therefore, the present invention further provides methods of inhibiting Btk enzymatic
activity by contacting a Btk with a Btk inhibitor of the present invention.
[01261           Btk enzymatic activity, as used herein, refers to Btk kinase enzymatic activity.
For example, where Btk enzymatic activity is decreased, PIP3 binding and/or phosphorylation of
PLCy is decreased. In some embodiments, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of
the Btk inhibitor against Btk is less than 1 pM.       In some embodiments, the ICso of the Btk
inhibitor against Btk is less than 500 nM. In some embodiments, the IC 50 of the Btk inhibitor
against Btk is less than 100 nM. In some embodiments, the ICso of the Btk inhibitor against Btk
is less than 10 nM. In some embodiments, the IC 50 of the Btk inhibitor against Btk is less than 1
nM. In some embodiments, the IC50 of the Btk inhibitor against Btk is from 0.1 nM to 10 pM.
In some embodiments, the IC 50 of the Btk inhibitor against Btk is from 0.1 nM to 1 pM. In some
embodiments, the IC 50 of the Btk inhibitor against Btk is from 0.1 nM to 100 nM. In some
embodiments, the IC 50 of the Btk inhibitor against Btk is from 0.1 nM to 10 nM.
[0127]           In some embodiments, Btk inhibitors are useful for the treatment of diseases and
disorders that may be alleviated by inhibiting (i.e., decreasing) Btk enzymatic activity.         By
"diseases" is meant diseases or disease symptoms. Thus, the present invention provides methods
of treating autoimmune disorders, inflammatory disorders, and cancers in a subject in need
thereof. Such methods include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of
a Btk inhibitor.     The term "autoimmune disorders" includes diseases or disorders involving
inappropriate     immune    response  against   native   antigens,  such    as acute    disseminated
encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Addison's disease, alopecia areata, antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome (APS), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, bullous pemphigoid
(BP), Coeliac disease, dermatomyositis, diabetes mellitus type 1, Goodpasture's syndrome,
Graves'     disease,   Guillain-Barr6   syndrome      (GBS),    Hashimoto's    disease,    idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple
sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anaemia, polymyositis, primary
biliary cirrhosis, Sj6gren's syndrome, temporal arteritis, and Wegener's granulomatosis.         The
term "inflammatory disorders" includes diseases or disorders involving acute or chronic
inflammation such as allergies, asthma, prostatitis, glomerulonephritis, pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),
                                               53

reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, transplant rejection, and vasculitis. In one embodiment,
the present invention provides a method of treating rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.          The term
"cancer" includes diseases or disorders involving abnormal cell growth and/or proliferation, such
as glioma, thyroid carcinoma, breast carcinoma, lung cancer (e.g. small-cell lung carcinoma,
non-small-cell lung carcinoma), gastric carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pancreatic
carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, prostate carcinoma,
renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma (e.g., anaplastic large-cell lymphoma), leukemia (e.g. acute
myeloid leukemia, T-cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic              leukemia), multiple myeloma,
malignant mesothelioma, malignant melanoma, and colon cancer (e.g. microsatellite instability
high colorectal cancer).     In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of
treating leukemia or lymphoma.
[01281          The term "subject," as used herein, refers to a mammal to whom a pharmaceutical
composition is administered.       Exemplary subjects include humans, as well as veterinary and
laboratory animals such as horses, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, and aquatic
mammals.
Assays
[0129]          To develop useful Btk inhibitors, candidate inhibitors capable of decreasing Btk
enzymatic activity may be identified in vitro. The activity of the inhibitor compounds can be
assayed utilizing methods known in the art and/or those methods presented herein.
[01301           Compounds that decrease Btk enzymatic activity may be identified and tested
using biologically active Btk, either recombinant or naturally occurring. Btk can be found in
native cells, isolated in vitro, or co-expressed or expressed in a cell. Measuring the reduction in
the Btk enzymatic activity in the presence of an inhibitor relative to the activity in the absence of
the inhibitor may be performed using a variety of methods known in the art, such as the BTK
POLYGAT-LS ASSAY described below in the Examples.                  Other methods for assaying the
activity of Btk are known in the art. The selection of appropriate assay methods is well within
the capabilities of those of skill in the art.
[01311           Once compounds are identified that are capable of reducing           Btk enzymatic
activity, the compounds may be further tested for their ability to selectively inhibit Btk relative to
                                                54

other enzymes. Inhibition by a compound of the invention is measured using standard in vitro or
in vivo assays such as those well known in the art or as otherwise described herein.
[0132]          Compounds may be further tested in cell models or animal models for their ability
to cause a detectable changes in phenotype related to Btk activity. In addition to cell cultures,
animal models may be used to test Btk inhibitors for their ability to treat autoimmune disorders,
inflammatory disorders, or cancer in an animal model.
Pharmaceutical Compositions
[01331          In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions
comprising a Btk inhibitor compound of the invention or a Btk inhibitor compound in
combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient (e.g., carrier).
[0134]          The pharmaceutical compositions include optical isomers, diastereomers, or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the inhibitors disclosed herein.       For example, in some
embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions include a compound of the present invention and
citrate as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The Btk inhibitor included in the pharmaceutical
composition may be covalently attached to a carrier moiety, as described above. Alternatively,
the Btk inhibitor included in the pharmaceutical composition is not covalently linked to a carrier
moiety.
[0135]          A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier," as used herein refers to pharmaceutical
excipients, for example, pharmaceutically, physiologically, acceptable organic or inorganic
carrier substances suitable for enteral or parenteral application that do not deleteriously react
with the active agent. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water, salt solutions
(such as Ringer's solution), alcohols, oils, gelatins, and carbohydrates such as lactose, amylose or
starch, fatty acid esters, hydroxymethycellulose, and polyvinyl pyrrolidine.      Such preparations
can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents such as lubricants, preservatives,
stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring,
and/or aromatic substances and the like that do not deleteriously react with the compounds of the
invention.
[01361          The compounds       of the invention can be administered alone or can be
coadministered to the subject. Coadministration is meant to include simultaneous or sequential
                                                55

administration of the compounds individually or in combination (more than one compound).
The preparations can also be combined, when desired, with other active substances (e.g. to
reduce metabolic degradation).
Formulations
[0137]          Compounds of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide
variety of oral, parenteral, and topical dosage forms.        Thus, the compounds of the present
invention can be administered by injection (e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously,
subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally).     Also, the compounds described herein
can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the
present invention can be administered transdermally. It is also envisioned that multiple routes of
administration (e.g., intramuscular, oral, transdermal) can be used to administer the compounds
of the invention. Accordingly, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and one or more compounds of the
invention.
[01381         For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present
invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid.            Solid form
preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible
granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances that may also act as diluents, flavoring
agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.
[01391         In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid in a mixture with the finely
divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the
necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.
[0140]         The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% to 70% of the active
compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose,
pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a
low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the
formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule
in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is
thus in association with it.    Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included.     Tablets, powders,
                                                56

capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral
administration.
[0141]          For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid
glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously
therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized
molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.
[0142]          Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for
example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations
can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.
[01431          When parenteral application is needed or desired, particularly suitable admixtures
for the compounds of the invention are injectable, sterile solutions, preferably oily or aqueous
solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. In particular,
carriers for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of dextrose, saline, pure water,
ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, peanut oil, sesame oil, polyoxyethylene-block polymers, and
the like. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds of the invention can also be
incorporated into liposomes or administered via transdermal pumps or patches. Pharmaceutical
admixtures suitable for use in the present invention include those described, for example, in
Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA) and WO 96/05309, the
teachings of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
[0144]          Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active
component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents as
desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided
active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins,
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents.
[0145]          Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted,
shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include
solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active
component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants,
thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.
                                               57

[01461         The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form
the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
component.     The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or
ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can
be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.
[0147]         The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or
adjusted from 0.1 mg to 10000 mg, more typically 1.0 mg to 1000 mg, most typically 10 mg to
500 mg, according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The
composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.
[01481          Some compounds may have limited solubility in water and therefore may require
a surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition.        Such co-solvents include:
Polysorbate 20, 60, and 80; Pluronic F-68, F-84, and P-103; cyclodextrin; and polyoxyl 35 castor
oil. Such co-solvents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01 % and about 2% by
weight.
[0149]         Viscosity greater than that of simple aqueous solutions may be desirable to
decrease variability in dispensing the formulations, to decrease physical separation of
components of a suspension or emulsion of formulation, and/or otherwise to improve the
formulation. Such viscosity building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl
pyrrolidone,   methyl   cellulose, hydroxy      propyl  methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose,
carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, chondroitin sulfate and salts thereof,
hyaluronic acid and salts thereof, and combinations of the foregoing. Such agents are typically
employed at a level between about 0.0 1% and about 2% by weight.
[0150]         The compositions of the present invention may additionally include components
to provide sustained release and/or comfort. Such components include high molecular weight,
anionic mucomimetic polymers, gelling polysaccharides,          and finely-divided drug carrier
substrates.  These components are discussed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,920;
5,403,841; 5,212,162; and 4,861,760.        The entire contents of these patents are incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

Effective Dosages
[0151]          Pharmaceutical    compositions    provided by the       present  invention   include
compositions wherein the active ingredient is contained in a therapeutically effective amount,
i.e., in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a
particular application will depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated. For example, when
administered in methods to treat cancer, such compositions will contain an amount of active
ingredient effective to achieve the desired result (e.g. decreasing the number of cancer cells in a
subject).
[0152]          The dosage and frequency (single or multiple doses) of compound administered
can vary depending upon a variety of factors, including route of administration; size, age, sex,
health, body weight, body mass index, and diet of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms
of the disease being treated (e.g., the disease responsive to Btk inhibition); presence of other
diseases or other health-related problems; kind of concurrent treatment; and complications from
any disease or treatment regimen.        Other therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in
conjunction with the methods and compounds of the invention.
[01531          For any compound described herein, the therapeutically effective amount can be
initially determined from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations
of active compound(s) that are capable of decreasing Btk enzymatic activity as measured, for
example, using the methods described.
[0154]          Therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans may be determined from
animal models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration
that has been found to be effective in animals.        The dosage in humans can be adjusted by
monitoring Btk inhibition and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards, as described above.
[0155]          Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the
compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present
invention, should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time.
The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse
side effects.   Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the
optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until
                                               59

the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In some embodiments, the dosage range is
0.0010% to 10% w/v. In some embodiments, the dosage range is 0.l1% to 5% w/v.
[01561             Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the
administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will
provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's disease
state.

Example 6
[0192]            Schemes 6 and 7 demonstrate exemplary syntheses utilizing a protected pyrrolo
pyrimidine. The heteroaryl functionality can be protected (e.g., by tosylation) with subsequent
removal of the protecting group. In Scheme 6, the heteroaryl bond to the piperidine nitrogen is
formed before elaboration of the pendant side chain, which in this case, includes a urea moiety.

Example 12
[02771           Scheme 12 shows an exemplary synthesis of compounds having a substituted aryl
as A1 . In this scheme, a dioxaboralanyl pyridine is conjugated with an appropriately substituted
aryl amine before protection and hydrogenation of the pyridine to form the piperidine.           The
resultant protected aryl piperidine then undergoes covalent bond formation between the
piperidinyl nitrogen and the protected heteroaryl moiety.         The pendant side chain is then
elaborated before final deprotection and purification.

Example 13
[0294]           Like Scheme 8, exemplary synthesis Scheme 13 incorporates a heteroaryl
functionality after the pendant side chain.           Scheme 13 demonstrates alternative heteroaryl
functionalities.   Scheme 13 uses a mixture of amine (e.g., 0.25 mmol) and aryl-Cl (e.g., 0.25
mmol) in DIEA (1.5 mmol) and DMF (1 mL) may be stirred at 80 0C or 100 0C for 4 h.
Subsequently, the reaction mixture may be concentrated in vacuo to afford a residue, which is
purified by reverse phase chromatography C18 column and 10% acetonitrile/water containing
0.1% TFA to afford the compounds.

and DIEA (1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) was heated to 100 0 C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was
cooled to RT, and the solvent removed in vacuo.                     The residue was purified by flash
chromatography (50% EtOAc/Hexane to 100% EtOAc) to povide compound 23.2 (81o% yield) as
a yellow foam.
[0364]          Cmpd 23.3. The pH of a solution of compound 23.2 (0.8 mmol) and aldehyde
(0.8 mmol) in MeOH (5 mL) was adjusted to pH 6 by the dropwise addition of HOAc. Sodium
cyanoborohydride (1.3 eq.) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated to 60 0 C while being
stirred. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, quenched with water, and concentrated in vacuo
to afford a residue which was dissolved in EtOAc.             The organic phase was washed with sat.
NaHCO 3, brine, dried (Na 2SO 4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford an oil, which was
subsequently purified by preparative TLC (1:1 EtOAc/Hexane) to provide 23.3 (100% yield).

RT for lh. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified via
flash chromatography (30% EtOAc/Hexanes) to give (100% yield) a yellow foam, which was
mixed with aniline (1.2 eq.) and DIEA (1.2 eq.) in DMF (3 mL). The solution was heated to 80
'C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, and the solvent was removed in vacuo to
afford a residue, which was purified via preparative TLC (30% EtOAc/Hexane) to afford
compound 23.6 (60% yield) as a yellow oil.

enzyme (Upstate 14-552), ATP, and inhibitor. The BTK kinase reaction was done in a black 96
well plate (costar 3694). For a typical assay, a 24 ptL aliquot of a ATP/peptide master mix (final
concentration; ATP 10 ptM, polyGAT 100 nM) in kinase buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10
mM MgCl 2 , 200 ptM Na3 PO 4 , 5 mM DTT, 0.010%Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml casein) is added
to each well. Next, 1 ptL of a 4-fold, 40X compound titration in 100% DMSO solvent is added,
followed by adding 15 uL of BTK enzyme mix in 1X kinase buffer (with a final concentration of
0.25 nM). The assay is incubated for 30 minutes before being stopped with 28 paL of a 50 mM
EDTA solution. Aliquots (5 ptL) of the kinase reaction are transferred to a low volume white
384 well plate (Corning 3674), and 5 ptL of a 2X detection buffer (Invitrogen PV3574, with 4
                                               220

nM Tb-PY20 antibody, Invitrogen PV3552) is added. The plate is covered and incubated for 45
minutes at room temperature. Time resolved fluorescence (TRF) on Molecular Devices M5 (332
nm excitation; 488 nm emission; 518 nm fluorescein emission) is measured. IC50 values are
calculated using a four parameter fit with 100% enzyme activity determined from the DMSO
control and 0% activity from the EDTA control.

[0556]          Protocolfor human B cell stimulation. Human B cells were purified from 150 ml
of blood. Briefly, the blood was diluted 1/2 with PBS and centrifuged through a Ficoll density
gradient. The B cells were isolated from the mononuclear cells by negative selection using the B
cell isolation kit II from Milenyi (Auburn, CA). 50,000 B cells per well were then stimulated
with 10 ptg/ml of goat F(ab')2 anti-human IgM antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in a 96-well plate. Compounds were diluted in DMSO and added
to the cells. Final concentration of DMSO was 0.5%. Proliferation was measured after 3 days
using Promega CellTiter-Glo (Madison, WI). Certain compounds of formula I were tested and
found to be active.
[0557]          Table 1 shows the activity of selected compounds of this invention in the in vitro
Btk kinase assay. Compounds have an activity designated as "A" provided an IC50       <  100 nM;
compounds having an activity designated as "B" provided an IC 50 of 100-999 nM; compounds
having an activity designated as "C" provided an IC 50 of 1000-10,000 nM; and compounds
having an activity designated as "D" provided an IC50 of >10,000 nM. In some instances where
a compound tested has activity "D", other structurally similar compounds beyond the measurable
limits of the assay are not included in Table 1.
