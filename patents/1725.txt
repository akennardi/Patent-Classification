OPTICAL OBJECTIVE WITH ENLARGEMENT OF THE EXIT PUPIL BY MEANS OF A DIFFRACTIVE
ELEMENT
     The present invention relates to optical instruments, especially microscopes,
     in particular optical instruments which have an exit pupil at which an image
     of an object may be viewed by an observer, and diffractive optical elements
     for use with the same.
     In conventional optical instruments, the size of the exit pupil is determined
     by a function of the numerical aperture and overall magnification of the
     optical instrument, and hence the size of the exit pupil is of fixed and
     relatively-small dimension. Consequently, it is necessary for an observer to
     accurately align the entrance pupil of his/her eye with the exit pupil of the
     optical instrument in order properly to view an image.
     The present applicant has previously developed a number of different optical
     instruments which, through the provision of a diffractive element at an
     intermediate image plane, provide an exit pupil which is effectively enlarged,
     allowing an observer to view an image by placing his/her eye anywhere
     within the enlarged exit pupil.   These optical instruments are disclosed in
     US-A-6028704, US-A-6608720 and US-A-7123415.
     GB-A-2418345 discloses the use of a diffraction grating in the coloration of a
     black and white photographic image.
     The present applicant has now developed improved optical instruments,
     which still provide an exit pupil which is effectively enlarged, but which can
     provide for greater optical clarity and avoid the need for a field lens
     arrangement, which, given the size of the field of view, usually represents
     the most expensive component within the optical instruments, being a
     precision-ground and polished glass component.
     In one aspect the present invention provides an optical instrument for
     producing an optical image to be viewed by an observer, the optical

diffractive element, light from the received image is relayed to a common
region on a viewing plane across the aperture of the diffractive element.

the present invention, in this embodiment a projection microscope.
The microscope comprises an objective lens 3 for producing a primary image
 in an image plane, here a primary image plane PIP, of an object at an object
 plane OP, in this embodiment as defined by an aperture stop 5.
 In this embodiment the microscope further comprises a projection lens 7
 which images the primary image of the objective lens 3 in an image plane,
 here a secondary image plane SIP, and produces an image of the aperture
 of the objective lens 3 at the ray vertex 9 of the projection lens 7.

 pupil to a viewing plane VP, such as to be viewable by an eye of an
 observer.

 embodiment a transmissive element, which is located at the secondary
 image plane SIP, here intermediate the field lenses 15, 17 of the field lens

corresponding to an exit pupil which would be produced in the absence of
the diffractive element 25.
Through suitable design, the diffractive element 25 can be configured to
provide that the exit pupils in the array of exit pupils are spaced apart or in
contact, and the configuration is chosen such that the array of exit pupils
appears to the eye of the observer in effect as a single, continuous enlarged
exit pupil.
In this embodiment, as illustrated in Figures 2(a) to (c), the diffractive
element 25 comprises a principal surface 37 which has an array of diffractive
 units 39, each of which generates one of the exit pupils of the array of exit
 pupils. The profile and form of the individual diffractive units 39 determines
the comparative light energy within each of the individual pupil images.
 In this embodiment the surface 37 is on a substantially flat plane.       In an
 alternative embodiment the surface 37 could be a part-spherical surface.
 In this embodiment the diffractive units 39 each comprise a lenticule 41,
 which     are effective to produce diffractive interference of light passing
 therethrough and generate a plurality of exit pupils which are displaced
 relative to one another in the form of an array of exit pupils, such as to be
 viewable as a single, continuous enlarged exit pupil.
  In this embodiment the lenticules 41 each comprise an irregular feature
  which has a plurality of surfaces. In this embodiment the lenticules 41 have
  substantially a rectangular or square shape at the principal surface 37 of the
  diffractive element 25.
  In this embodiment the lenticules 41 are formed on a radial spiral.       In an
  alternative embodiment the lenticules 41 could be formed on concentric
  circles, which can be rotated about an axis which is off centre of the axis of

observed.
In this embodiment the lenticules 41 are formed on a radial spiral at a radial
spiral pitch of 60 pm, and pitched at 69.3 pm along the spiral. In other
 embodiments the radial spiral pitch could be from about 40 pm to about 120
 pm. In other embodiments the pitch along the spiral could be from about
 40 pm to about 120 pm.
 In this embodiment the lenticules 41 have a radial width of 55 pm. In other
 embodiments the lenticules 41 could have a width of from about 30 pm to
 about 100 pm.
 In this embodiment the lenticules 41 have an average radial length of 100
 pm. In other embodiments the lenticules 41 could have a width of from
 about 30 pm to about 100 pm.
 The lenticules 41 each include a first, rectilinear surface 42 which is tilted or
  inclined relative to the principal surface 37 of the diffractive element 25 and
  defines a lateral face.
  In this embodiment the rectilinear surface 42 encloses an angle P of 80.27
  degrees relative to the principal surface 37 of the diffractive element 25. In
  other embodiments the rectilinear surface 42 could enclose an angle P of
  from about 65 degrees to about 90 degrees relative to the principal surface
  37 of the diffractive element 25.
  In this embodiment the rectilinear surface 42 is an arcuate or curved
  surface, here an outwardly-facing, frusto-cylindrical or frusto-conical
  surface. In an alternative embodiment the rectilinear surface 42 could be an
  outwardly-facing, frusto-cylindrical or frusto-conical surface.

The lenticules 41 each include a second arcuate or curved surface 43 which
extends from the rectilinear surface 42 to the principal surface 37 of the
diffractive element 25.
In this embodiment the arcuate surface 43 is a concave surface. In another
embodiment the arcuate surface 43 could be a convex surface.
In this embodiment the arcuate surface 43 has a radius of 1 mm. In other
embodiments the arcuate surface 43 has a radius of from about 0.5 mm to
about 5 mm, preferably from about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm, more preferably
from about 0.5 mm to about 1.5 mm.
In this embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 2(c), the lenticules 41 are
formed by a cutting tool 51 which is passed over the surface of the
diffractive element 25.
 In this embodiment the tool 51 comprises a frusto-spherical tip 53, having a
 flat part 55 which cuts the rectilinear surface 42 of each of the lenticules 41
 and a spherical surface part 57 which cuts a spherical radius of the arcuate
 surface 43 of each of the lenticules 31. In this embodiment the spherical
 surface part 57 has a radius of 1 mm, and the flat part 55 is set at 28.6 pm
 from the axis of the tool 51. In other embodiments the spherical surface
 part 57 has a radius of from about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm, preferably from
 about 0.5 mm to about 2 mm, more preferably from about 0.5 mm to about
  1.5 mm.
 With this configuration, the microscope provides a single, enlarged exit pupil
 having an effective size corresponding to the array of exit pupils, and the
 array of exit pupils have desired optical characteristics, particularly in
  providing for uniform energy distribution of a polychromatic image.

The microscope of this embodiment is similar to the microscope of the first
described embodiment, and thus, in order to avoid duplication of
description, only the differences will be described in detail with like parts
designating like reference signs.
The     microscope    of this  embodiment     differs  from   the   first-described
embodiment in that the field lens arrangement 11 is omitted, and instead
the diffractive element 25 is configured to relay light from the received
image to a common region on the viewing plane VP across the aperture of
the diffractive element 25, in this embodiment centered on the optical axis
of the diffractive element 25.
In this embodiment the diffractive units 39 which are disposed progressively
 radially outwardly from the optical axis of the diffractive element 25 are
 configured progressively to provide for an increasing angular offset, such
that, independent of location on the diffractive element 25, light from the
 received image is relayed to a common region.
 In this embodiment the progressively-increasing angular offset is provided
 by forming the lenticules 41 of the diffractive units 39 with increasing
 angular orientation relative to the optical axis of the diffractive element 25.
 In this embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 4, the lenticules 41 are formed
 by inclining the cutting tool 51 with increasing angular orientation P1, Pz, P3,
 ...IP, relative to the optical axis of the diffractive element 25 as the
 lenticules 41 are formed progressively radially outwardly from the optical
 axis of the diffractive element 25.
  Finally, it will be understood that the present invention has been described
  in its preferred embodiments and can be modified in many different ways
  without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the
  appended claims.
