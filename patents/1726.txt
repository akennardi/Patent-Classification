10 Field Of The Invention
           This invention relates to a bag-in-box system for use in dispensing a
   pumpable product, comprising a carton, a flexible thermoplastic pouch, a
   spout joined to the pouch, a spout closure, and a pumpable product disposed
   in the pouch.
15
   Background Of The Invention
           Collapsible thermoplastic pouches are often used to store pumpable
   products. The pouches are typically housed in a corrugated paperboard or
   other rigid or substantially rigid carton to aid in the transporting, handling and
20 dispensing of the product. Such systems are commonly referred to as "bag
   in-box" (BiB) packaging systems, and include a carton, a flexible pouch, a
   spout joined to the pouch, a spout closure, and a pumpable product disposed
   in the pouch.
           A number of BiB applications require pouches with a combination of
25 high barrier and toughness during processing, shipping, and handling.
           For bag-in-box applications, multi-ply laminates having metallized
   polyester substrates are sometimes employed as at least a portion of the
   pouch material, sometimes with a polyethylene liner. Also used are barrier
   films having a coextruded multilayer construction.
30         However, the current systems for dispensing pumpable products often
   suffer from one of two problems.
           A shortcoming with metallized pouch materials is the occurrence of pin
   holes in the pouch due to flex cracking. This phenomenon, sometimes caused
   by vibrational stresses imparted during shipping and distribution of filled

   WO 2014/126841                                                     PCT/US2014/015528
                                              2
   pouches, can compromise the oxygen barrier properties of the pouch, and in
   turn adversely affect the shelf life of the contents of the pouch.
          Coextruded multilayer barrier films used in pouch construction can
   sometimes lack sufficient toughness in terms of burst strength.
 5        Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a bag-in-box system for
   use in dispensing pumpable products that satisfactorily addresses the above
   noted deficiencies in prior art systems.

   Detailed Description Of The Invention
           Figures 1 through 4 show a bag-in-box system 10 for use in dispensing
   a pumpable product 19, including a carton 12, a flexible thermoplastic pouch
20 14, a spout 16, a spout closure 18, and optionally a pump 20 or 60. The
   pouch 14, containing the pumpable product 19, with spout 16 and spout
   closure 18, are disposed in carton 12, as depicted in Figure 2. Spout 16 is
   associated with pouch 12 such that in one embodiment pump 20 or 60 can be
   aligned with the spout to lock the pump into place so that product 19 can be
25 dispensed from pouch 14. Pouch 14 can be produced in any appropriate size,
   depending on the product to be packaged. For example, a 0.5 pint to 5 gallon
   size can be made. The pouch size and shape, and location of the spout on
   the pouch can be selected to suit existing carton and pump systems. A hole
   21 in carton 12 allows access and a connection of spout 16 with pump 20 or
30 60.
           Figure 3 shows in exploded view an embodiment of a portion of pouch
   14 that includes an outer wall 22 having outer surface 51 and inner surface

   52; a discrete inner wall 24 having outer surface 53 and inner surface 54; an
   outer wall 26 having outer surface 61 and inner surface 62; and a discrete
   inner wall 28 having outer surface 63 and inner surface 64. Seals 31 bond
   together the walls 22, 24, 28, 26 at or near the edges of the pouch.
 5        A spout 16 is positioned through walls 24 and 22, the spout flange 25
   adhered to inner surface 54 of discrete inner wall 24, and the spout projecting
   through both walls 24 and 22. Spout closure 18 covers the outer end of spout
   16.
           Figure 4 shows in exploded view an alternative embodiment of a
10 portion of pouch 14 that includes an outer wall 32 having outer surface 71 and
   inner surface 72; a discrete inner wall 34 having outer surface 73 and inner
   surface 74; an outer wall 36 having outer surface 81 and inner surface 82; a
   discrete inner wall 38 having outer surface 83 and inner surface 84; a discrete
   intermediate wall 35 disposed between outer wall 32 and inner wall 34, having
15 outer surface 75 and inner surface 76; and a discrete intermediate wall 39
   disposed between outer wall 36 and inner wall 38, having outer surface 85
   and inner surface 86. Seals 50 bond together the walls 32, 35, 34, 38, 39, 36,
   at or near the edges of the pouch.
           Referring to FIG. 5, in one embodiment, outer walls 22, 26, 32, and 36
20 comprise a thermoplastic film 101 that includes a heat sealable layer 112
   comprising an ethylene ester copolymer such as EVA, or EAO such as linear
   low density polyethylene, e.g. DOWLEX TM 3010 having a density of 0.921
   grams/cc. Various additives such as antiblock or slip agents can optionally be
   included in layer 112 in minor amounts, for example between about 5 and
25 15% by weight of layer 112, sufficient to provide machinability or other desired
   properties depending on the end use of the packaging material, and the
   particular equipment in which the packaging material is used; e.g., a
   masterbatch blend of about 90% low density polyethylene and about 10%
   colloidal silica may be used as an effective antiblock agent. An example is
30 10,075ACP T M Syloid concentrate available from Teknor Color.
           Layer 114 comprises very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), e.g.
   ATTANE TM      4203 available from Dow, having a density of about 0.905

   WO 2014/126841                                                 PCT/US2014/015528
                                           8
   grams/cc. An alternative material for layer 114 is EVA with a fractional melt
   index (i.e. a melt index of less than about 1.0 grams/ten minutes) and a vinyl
   acetate content of at least about 12%. One such resin is ESCORENE        TM
                                                                                LD
   705.15 available from ExxonMobil, with a melt index of about 0.40 grams/10
 5 minutes and a VA content of about 13% by weight. lonomer resins such as
   those available from DuPont under the SURLYN trademark, comprising
   metal-salt neutralized ethylene acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymers, are
   also suitable for layer 114.
          A first tie layer 116 is disposed between and bonds abuse layer 114
10 and a first intermediate layer 118 to be discussed below. Layer 116
   comprises chemically modified polyolefin that bonds layers 114 and 118
   together. An example is a maleic anhydride-modified EVA having a VA
   content of about 11%      by weight, e.g. PLEXAR T M PX 1007 available from
   Lyondell Basell. Optionally, a minor amount, for example between about 5
15 and 15% by weight of layer 116, of a second thermoplastic resin can be
   included in layer 116, e.g. a single-site catalyzed ethylene/octene copolymer
   such as AFFINITY TM KC 8852G plastomer available from Dow Chemical, and
   having a density of about .875 grams/cc.
          A first intermediate layer 118 is adhered to tie layer 116, and also
20 adhered to core layer 120. This layer comprises a polyamide such as nylon 6,
   or copolyamide such as nylon 6/66, 6/69 or nylon 6/12. Optionally, a minor
   amount, for example between about 5 and 15%, by weight of layer 118, of a
   second thermoplastic resin can be included in layer 118, e.g. a blend of an
   ionomer resin and a polyamide, such as SURLYN TM AM7927available from
25 DuPont.
          The core layer 120 comprises EVOH. EVOH resins can have various
   ethylene contents, e.g. at least about 38 mole% ethylene, such as
   SOARNOL TM ET3803 available from Nippon Gohsei.
          On the surface of the core layer 120 opposite the first intermediate
30 layer 118 is the second intermediate layer 122 comprising a polyamide or
   copolyamide such as those described herein for first intermediate layer 118.

   WO 2014/126841                                                    PCT/US2014/015528
                                            9
           A second tie layer 124 represents a self-weldable layer comprising the
   same material as that used in layer 116, although different chemically
   modified polymeric adhesives could be used for layers 116 and 124
   respectively. When the tubular coextruded film 101 is collapsed, self-weldable
 5 layers 124 will weld together.
           Interface 126 represents the point of contact between self-weldable
   layers 124 when the tubular film is collapsed.
           In a first alternative embodiment, a film is provided like that of FIG. 5,
   but without layer 114; tie layer 116 is bonded directly to heat sealable layer
10 112.
           In a second alternative embodiment, a film is provided like that of
   Figure 5, or like that of the first alternative embodiment, but in which core
   layer 120 comprises a chemically modified polyolefinic adhesive.
           In a process for producing these films, melt streams for each of the
15 resins of layers 112 through 124 of FIG. 5 are produced and coextruded
   through an annular die to form a tubular extrudate. The extrudate is hot blown,
   cooled and then collapsed to form a layflat tubular film. Thus, the self
   weldable material of layers 124 (FIG. 5) is welded to itself at the interior
   collapsed interface 126 of the film.
20          The walls used to construct the pouch can have any total thickness
   desired, so long as the pouch provides the desired properties for the
   packaging operation in which the pouch is used. Thermoplastic films used to
   make the walls can be manufactured by coextrusion thermoplastic film
   forming processes known in the art. The film can be oriented or non-oriented.
25         Spout 16
           Spout 16 can be disposed at any suitable location in the pouch, and
   can function both as a device for filling the pouch, and as a device to
   cooperate and associate with pump 20 or 60 to allow discharge of the
   pumpable product from pouch 14. Alternatively, spout 16 can function as a
30 device for filling the pouch, and a separate pump or dispensing device can be
   installed at a separate location on the pouch for dispensing the pumpable
   product from the pouch.

          Carton 12
          Carton 12 can be formed by folding and sealing a pre-cut blank by
   methods well known in the art. Suitable materials from which the blank can
   be made include coated or uncoated paperboard, which can include as a
 5 component bleached or unbleached pulp; plastics such as polyolefins,
   polycarbonates, vinyl polymers, polyesters and acrylics; etc. Examples of
   these are solid bleached sulfate paperboard (SBS), clay-coated newsback
   (CCNB), coated solid unbleached sulfate (SUS), multi-ply folding box board or
   kraft paperboard, etc. In some embodiments, the blank can comprise
10 materials suitable for printing. The carton can be constructed by hand or
   mechanically in any suitable manner. For example, a conventional unfolded
   blank can be used to construct a single piece tray-style box container; or the
   carton can be made with parts that are molded separately and then joined by
   any suitable method.
15         Either before or after pouch 14 is filled, the pouch can be inserted into
   carton 12.
           Pump 20 or 60
          A delivery mechanism, such as a pump, can be associated with pouch
   14 and carton 12 to dispense the contents of the pouch.                 In some
20 embodiments, the pump can include a piercing portion to contact, pierce,
   and/or interlock with spout 16. Thus, the pump can have a conical or piercing
   portion matched to the spout. The precise construction of the pump for use
   with pouch 14 can vary so long as it interlocks with spout 16 to dispense
   pouch contents, or alternatively can be attached to another portion of the
25 pouch to access the pouch contents.      Spout 16 can fasten and interlock with
   the pump to dispense pouch contents without leaks. In some embodiments, a
   piercing nozzle can be attached to a conventional drawing tube of a
   conventional pump device. Many alternative embodiments are possible,
   provided that spout 16, or another portion of the pouch, can be brought into
30 direct or indirect communication or connected engagement with a pump. One
   means of connecting the pump to the pouch is via a dispensing tube, or
   alternatively a quick connect/disconnect coupler. Pump 20 or 60 can also

   comprise a dispensing means. The pump can have any suitable manual or
   mechanical actuated valve or pumping system, e.g. a "clothes-pin" style valve.
   When the viscosity of packaged product is such that the product cannot be
   dispensed by gravity forces only and/or when an accurate flow control of the
 5 product to be dispensed is desired, a pump assembly can be used.              For
   example, a volumetric positive displacement pump assembly, as is well
   known in the art, can be used with the disclosed dispensing system.
           Method of Makinq Pouches
           The pouch, with spout and spout closure, can be made by any suitable
10 process. In one embodiment, a four lane pouch making machine from
   Maverick Engineering S.A. is used. In the process of making pouches, the
   following steps can be followed:
           a)     four webs are provided, each mounted on a respective roll, at
   an upstream end of the machine and process, the first and fourth webs
15 comprising e.g. the web depicted in Fig. 5, and the second and third webs
   comprising e.g. a monolayer low density polyethylene;
           b)      a first set of draw rollers intermittently advances the first and
   second webs, positioned such that the first web comprises an outer wall in the
   finished pouches, and the second web comprises an inner wall in the finished
20 pouches; a second set of draw rollers advances the third and fourth webs,
   positioned such that the fourth web comprises an outer wall in the finished
   pouches, and the third web comprises an inner wall in the finished pouches;
           c)     holes are periodically stamped out in registration out of the first
   and     second webs, the holes made "four across", i.e. four holes present
25 across the lateral width of the webs at longitudinally and laterally spaced
   intervals, predetermined according to the anticipated individual pouch size
   and geometry, and intended location of each spout on a respective pouch,
   with the chads produced by this stamping step removed from the main
   production line;
30         d)     a spout is supposited in each hole, and a seal applied at the
   flange of each spout, to seal each spout to the inner surface of the second
   web;

                                             12
           e)     the four webs, with spouts supposited            and sealed,    are
   advanced, and a first and second continuous longitudinal side seal is made to
   the four webs at the first and second extreme lateral edges (running parallel to
   the process flow) of the webs, and three additional continuous intermediate
 5 longitudinal side seals are made to the four webs at spaced intermediate
   lateral positions on the webs, with the edge trim produced during production
   of the first and second continuous longitudinal side seals removed as scrap;
           f)     a third set of draw rollers advances the side sealed webs to a
   station    where delta seals are optionally applied to the webs              in a
10 predetermined, registered, periodic fashion ( a delta seal is a diagonal seal
   that is added to the webs at locations on the webs that will, at the end of the
   process, comprise the corners of individual pouches);
           g)     a spout closure (tap) is inserted and partially sealed to the first,
   projecting end, i.e. the outer end, of each respective spout;
15         h)     a lateral end seal is applied to the webs at predetermined
   periodic intervals;
           i)     the four web lanes defined by the first and second continuous
   longitudinal    side   seals and     three   additional  continuous   intermediate
   longitudinal side seals are slit apart to define four side sealed precursor pouch
20 laminations; and
           j)       a fourth set of draw rollers advances the four side sealed
   precursor pouch laminations to a perforation station where lateral perforations
   are applied to each of the four side sealed precursor pouch laminations at
   predetermined spaced intervals.
25         An alternative to step  j) is to advance the four side sealed precursor
   pouch laminations to a cutting station where the lamination are cut at
   predetermined spaced intervals to define individual pouches open at one end
   thereof.
           The perforated pouch laminations, or cut individual pouches, can then
30 be boxed and shipped to a processor for filling each pouch with a pumpable
   product, placing each filled pouch in a respective carton, and supplying the
   finished bag-in-box to a commercial customer or consumer. In the case of

                                               13
   certain foodstuffs and the like, the perforated pouch laminations or cut
   individual pouches can be shipped to a sterilizer where the pouches can be
   sterilized, e.g. in an aseptic process, filled with a sterilized pumpable product,
   placed in a carton, and supplied to e.g. a retail outlet or restaurant.

   Test Methods
   Seal strength of the manufactured pouches was characterized in three ways
   during the test:
20     1. Peelability of seals by thumb insertion
                  Pass = no peel
       2. Failure mode during blow-up tests with compressed air
                  Pass = pouch body blows out instead of seal delamination
       3. 5-ft drop tests for water-filled packages
25                Pass = survives three consecutive drops
   Instron tests were run on side and end seals for one of the package structures
   (Structure A in Table 4).

   Results:
        1. Machine Operation
             A Maverick machine run according to vendor's specifications, generally
 5 in accordance with the description hereinabove re: the Method of Making
   Pouches, successfully manufactured the structures during the test. Pinch
   rollers were used on the bottom webs to smooth out wrinkles. Three lanes
   were run on all structures except Structure Z; four lanes were run on structure
   Z. Table 4 summarizes the structures run. Delta seals were applied in all four
10 corners of pouches made from Structures L and X (50 cm x 50 cm). For
   Structure 1, the spout/spout closure assembly was off-set to the leading/drive
   side edge of the pouch; for the remaining structures, the spout and closure
   were centered toward the leading edge of the pouch.

   2. Pouch Properties
          Thumb insertion to delaminate the seals was used to set the proper
   dwell times and sealing temperatures for the various sealing stations. Once
   the dwell times and temperatures were fixed, pouches were collected for burst
 5 and drop testing. Table 5 summarizes the test results for the pouches
   manufactured during this trial.
                                        Table 5.

        Z       Side seal burst, no delamination                  N/A
10        When pouch body bursts occurred, they usually initiated about mid
   package and propagated quickly in the machine direction from seal to seal.
   These bursts occurred either on the spout side of the bag, or the non-spout
   side. It was observed for Structure Y, that the outer wall (FE3) was able to
   expand long after the PE inner wall failed during burst testing. This
15 phenomenon (burst inner wall, intact outer wall) was observed only for
   Structure Y. The other outer webs burst more or less simultaneously with the
   PE liner.
          The typical failure mechanism for five-foot drop tests was a seal burst
   that is, a tear that propagated along the seal-pouch body interface.
20 Delamination was not observed. For Structure B, the spout was offset from
   center so that its position was 64 mm from the leading edge and 64 mm from
   the DS (Delta seal) edge. For this package, the failures invariably occurred
   along the seals proximal to the spout position.
       3. Instron Seal Strengths

          Structure A (FE1/PE) was tested for Instron seal strengths. Several 25
   mm strips were cut from end seals and side seals of pouches taken from all

   WO 2014/126841                                                   PCT/US2014/015528
                                             20
   three lanes during the production run.        The top webs (8145 and PE films)
   were clamped to one jaw, and the lower two webs (PE and FE1 films) were
   clamped to the second jaw. A jaw separation rate of 200 mm/min was used
   on three replicates per package location. In all cases, the film broke; no seal
 5 delaminations were observed. ANOVA analysis on the Maximum Load for the
   four seals in each package showed no significant difference at a significance
   level of a = 0.05. Therefore the Maximum Load data was pooled to calculate
   a mean value for each package. These results are shown in Table 6.
                                         Table 6
                                 Maximum Load, N/25mm
        Lane            Mean                  Standard Deviation
          A             115.3                          5.35
          B             111.6                          5.65
          C             110.9                          7.02
10
           There is no statistically significant difference among the means for the
   maximum      load as a function of the lane in which the pouch was
   manufactured. The values of 110 to 115 N/25mm are comfortably above the
   minimum value of 80 N/25mm typically required for FS films.
15
       4. Unrestrained Burst Test Results
           An unrestrained burst test was performed on the following structure:
   FE4 (2.3 mil)//PE film (2.0 mil)// air //PE film (2.0 mil)//FE4 (2.3 mil),
   manufactured on a Maverick machine. Thus, the structure had two outer walls
20 comprising the FE4 coextruded barrier film, and two inner walls comprising
   monolayer low density polyethylene. The inner walls comprising the 2 mil PE
   burst, yet the FE4 outer walls remained inflated and intact. Such behavior is
   not typically observed with fully coextruded blown or cast film structures, or
   laminations currently available from current suppliers of BiB materials.
25
       5. Transportation Survivability Test Results
           Shipping performance test ASTM 4169D was used to determine
   transportation survivability of pouches made from FE4 coextruded barrier film
30 used as the two outer walls, with two 3 mil PE inner walls. Fifty pouches were

   WO 2014/126841                                                   PCT/US2014/015528
                                             21
   filled with 8 liters of water each, and were placed in boxes, two pouches per
   box. Upon test completion, 66% of the pouches showed no signs of leakage.
   Pouch body failures (water leaking through holes created in walls of the
   pouch) existed in 34% of the bags. Interestingly, 20% of the pouches showed
 5 a leak in the PE inner wall, but not in the FE4 outer wall of the film. Because
   the outer wall was not compromised in these pouches, they would not result in
   failure of the package (primary loss), or secondary failures of the corrugated
   containers that would be stacked adjacent or below the leaking packaging. It
   is known in the BiB packaging industry that if leakage in a single BiB container
10 occurs, the stack of palletized BiB containers can be damaged. The strength
   of the corrugated boxes can be seriously impaired by leaking liquid product. It
   is also known that pallets or even stacked pallets can collapse from the failure
   of a single BiB pouch.
           The same shipping test was performed with FE5 as the two outer walls.
15 These pouches were also 8 liters and had a 3 mil PE liner. In this case,
   pouches were irradiated (with specification of 30-50 kGy dosage). Upon test
   completion, 68% of the pouches showed no signs of leakage. Body failures
   existed in 32% of the pouches. As with the previous test involving FE4 as the
   two outer walls, 20% of the pouches showed a leak in the PE layer but not in
20 the outer walls of the structure. These results indicate that transportation test
   results were not adversely affected by the use of irradiation.
           BIB pouches which exist in the market place today were also tested
   using an ASTM 4169D procedure. These irradiated pouches had a 4 mil
   metallized PET outer layer and a 2 mil PE liner. The bag dimensions and box
25 sizes were the same as those used for FE4 and FE5 film tests. Pouch body
   failures were observed in 74% of the samples. Because of the mPET outer
   layer, it was not possible to detect how many samples had a leak in the PE
   layer only. Table 7 below summarizes these results:

       6. Gelbo Flex Test Results
 5         A Gelbo flex tester was used to compare the number of flexes to
   failure. A failure was indicated by a hole in the film, through which a colored
   dye would travel and become visible on a white background. FE4 films failed
   between 2500 and 2600 flexes.        FE5 films failed between 1500 and 2000
   flexes. Commercial mPET materials failed between 1400 and 1500 flexes.
10         Methods of Usinq the Disclosed System
            A filled pouch 14 in carton 12 can be delivered to an end user (e.g. a
   worker in a restaurant, or a consumer), after storage if necessary. In some
   embodiments, the end user can also be provided a pump for use with the
   particular pouch. When it is desired to dispense pumpable product 19 from
15 pouch 14, pump 20 or 60 can be attached directly or indirectly to the pouch
   by insertion of a portion of the pump into the pouch, either at the location of
   the spout, or at another portion of the pouch, for retentive engagement with
   the pump.
           The present application is directed in various embodiments to the
20 subject matter described below. These are optional embodiments of any of
   the aspects of the invention as described hereinabove in the Summary of the
   Invention, and for each aspect, these features can be suitably included alone
   or in any suitable combination of these features:
           - the pouch of the dispensing system is absent a metallized layer.
25         - the dispensing system further comprises a pump in connected
   relationship with the pouch.
