           HYDROMECHANICAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FOR A HEADER OF AN
                                  AGRICULTURAL HARVESTER
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    [0001]     The present invention relates generally to a hydraulic system for a header of
  5 a plant cutting machine (e.g., a combine harvester). More specifically, the present
    invention relates to a hydromechanical transmission system having a hydrostatic pump
    and a variable speed motor for a header.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    [0002]      Large vehicles, such as plant cutting machines, are typically operated using
 .0 hydraulic systems because of the benefits of increased power and torque that the
    system can provide. In such hydraulic systems, a hydraulic pump generally pumps
    hydraulic fluid to various components of the large vehicle, such as the power steering in
    a combine and various actuators necessary to operate a header attached to the
    combine. However, the hydraulic system may not function properly when the hydraulic
 .5 system cannot provide sufficient pressurized hydraulic fluid to the systems requiring
    hydraulic pressure. For example, a combine may necessitate additional hydraulic fluid
    to operate a specific function, such as lifting the header, which may cause insufficient
    hydraulic pressure to pass to a transmission system inside the header and
    consequently cause failure or harm to the transmission system.
20  [0003]     Therefore, what is sought is a hydraulic system that can efficiently provide
    sufficient pressurized hydraulic fluid to specific components, such as a transmission
    system of a header. The disclosed invention overcomes the disadvantages referenced
    above by providing a header with a hydromechanical transmission in combination with
    an accumulator.
25                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [0004]      In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
    header for an agricultural harvesting machine that comprises an inlet line, a check

                                                    2
    valve, an accumulator and a hydromechanical transmission system. The inlet line is
    used for receiving a first pressure of hydraulic fluid. The check valve is in
    communication with the inlet line. The accumulator is downstream the check valve and
    in communication with the inlet line. The hydromechanical transmission system includes
  5 a pressure line and a closed hydraulic circuit. The pressure line is in communication
    with the inlet line downstream the accumulator. The closed hydraulic circuit is in
    communication with the pressure line and includes a hydrostatic pump and a variable
    speed motor.
    [0005]      The header can further comprise a drain line in communication with the
 .o hydromechanical transmission system for receiving an excess pressure of hydraulic
    fluid. Additionally, the closed hydraulic circuit further includes a first circuit line in
    communication with the hydrostatic pump and the variable speed motor and a second
    circuit line in communication with the hydrostatic pump and the variable speed motor.
    The first circuit line and the second circuit line are in communication with the pressure
 .5 line. Alternatively, the closed hydraulic circuit can instead include a first circuit line in
    communication with the hydrostatic pump and the variable speed motor, a second
    circuit line in communication with the hydrostatic pump and the variable speed motor,
    and a third circuit line in communication with the pressure line, the first circuit line, and
    the second circuit line.
 'o [0006]      Advantageously, the hydrostatic pump can be configured to receive a charge
    pressure and output an operating pressure greater than the charge pressure.
    Additionally, the variable speed motor is configured to receive the operating pressure
    and output a pressure lower than the operating pressure. Furthermore, the accumulator
    is configured to output a pressure greater than a charge pressure necessary to operate
25  the closed hydraulic circuit.
    [0007]       Preferably, the check valve is configured to be in an open position when the
    first pressure is greater than or equal to a charge pressure necessary to operate the
    closed hydraulic circuit. Additionally, the check valve is configured to be in a closed
    position when the first pressure is less than a charge pressure necessary to operate the

                                                    3
    closed hydraulic circuit. Furthermore, the accumulator is configured to provide hydraulic
    pressure to the pressure line when the check valve is in a closed position.
    [0008]      Advantageously, the header can further comprise a pressure reducing valve
    in communication with the inlet line and downstream the check valve. The pressure
  5 reducing valve is also upstream the hydromechanical transmission system.
    Furthermore, there may also be a pressure transducer downstream the pressure
    reducing valve. Additionally, the header further comprises a pressure transducer in
    communication with the inlet line and downstream the check valve. The pressure
    transducer is also upstream the hydromechanical transmission system. Furthermore,
 .o there may also be a pressure reducing valve upstream the pressure transducer.
    [0009]      Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent
    from the following more detailed description of an exemplary, non-exhaustive
    embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by
    way of example, the principles of the invention.

                                                     4
                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    [0014]      Reference will now be made in detail to the various embodiments of the
    present invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the
    same or like reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the
  5 same or like features. It should be noted that the drawings are in simplified form and
    are not drawn to precise scale. Certain terminology is used in the following description
    for convenience only and is not limiting. Directional terms such as top, bottom, left, right,
    above, below and diagonal, are used with respect to the accompanying drawings. The
    term "distal" shall mean away from the center of a body. The term "proximal" shall
 .0 mean closer towards the center of a body and/or away from the "distal" end. The words
    "inwardly" and "outwardly" refer to directions toward and away from, respectively, the
    geometric center of the identified element and designated parts thereof. Such
    directional terms used in conjunction with the following description of the drawings
    should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner not
 .5 explicitly set forth. Additionally, the term "a," as used in the specification, means "at
    least one." The terminology includes the words above specifically mentioned,
    derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.
    [0015]      The terms "grain," "ear," "stalk," "leaf," and "crop material" are used
    throughout the specification for convenience and it should be understood that these
 .0 terms are not intended to be limiting. Thus, "grain" refers to that part of a crop which is
    harvested and separated from discardable portions of the crop material. The header of
    the present invention is applicable to a variety of crops, including but not limited to
    wheat, soybeans and small grains. The terms "debris," "material other than grain," and
    the like are used interchangeably.

    amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of +20%,
    ±10%, 5%,        1%, or +0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate.
    [0017]      Throughout this disclosure, various aspects of the present invention can be
    presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range

                                                   5
    format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an
    inflexible limitation on the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the description of
    a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges
    as well as individual numerical values within that range. For example, description of a

    subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3
    to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 2.7, 3, 4, 5,
    5.3, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range.
    [0018]       Furthermore, the described features, advantages and characteristics of the
 .o exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be combined in any suitable
    manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, in
    light of the description herein, that the present invention can be practiced without one or
    more of the specific features or advantages of a particular exemplary embodiment. In
    other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain
 .s embodiments that may not be present in all exemplary embodiments of the present
    invention.
    [0019]       Referring now to the drawings, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment,
    the present invention provides a header 102 for an agricultural harvester 100 having a
    hydraulic system 200. FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic view of the hydraulic system 200.
 'o [0020]      The hydraulic system 200 includes an inlet line 202 for receiving a first
    pressure of hydraulic fluid, a hydraulic manifold 204 and a hydromechanical
    transmission system 206. The hydraulic manifold 204 includes a check valve 208 that is
    in communication with the inlet line 202 and an accumulator 210 that is downstream the
    check valve 208 and in communication with the inlet line 202. The hydromechanical
25  transmission system 206 includes a pressure line 212 in communication with the inlet
    line 202 and downstream the accumulator 210. The hydromechanical transmission
    system 206 also includes a closed hydraulic circuit 214 that is in communication with
    the pressure line 212. The closed hydraulic circuit includes a hydrostatic pump 216 and
    a variable speed motor 218.

                                                   6
    [0021]      In accordance with an aspect of the present embodiment, the inlet line 202 is
    configured to be connectible with a hydraulic fluid source having a first pressure,
    hereafter additionally referred to as P1. Such a hydraulic fluid source can be supplied
    from a combine 104 to which the header 102 can be attached.
  5 [0022]      The check valve 208 has an inlet in communication with the inlet line 202.
    The check valve 208 is configured to have an open position and a closed position. In
    the open position, the inlet is open to allow passage of the pressurized hydraulic fluid. In
    the closed position, the inlet is closed to prevent passage of the pressurized hydraulic
    fluid. The check valve 208 requires a specific cracking pressure, herein referred
 .0 alternatively as P,, to maintain its open position. The cracking pressure is at most a
    minimum charge pressure, hereafter referred to as P,, for the safe operation of the
    hydrostatic pump 216.
    [0023]      The accumulator 210 is a pressure storage reservoir that has an inner volume
    for storing stored hydraulic fluid. The accumulator 210 generates and stores pressurized
 .5 hydraulic fluid for use when the inlet line's 202 pressure is insufficient. The accumulator
    210 is further configured such that when the pressure in the inlet line 202 is below its
    normal operative pressure, which may be Pc, the check valve 208 closes and the stored
    pressurized hydraulic fluid is released into the inlet line 202 to bring the pressure in the
    inlet line 202 to its normal operative pressure. In other words, the accumulator 210 is
 .0 configured to provide hydraulic pressure to the pressure line 212 when the check valve
    208 is in a closed position.
    [0024]      The hydraulic manifold 204 can also include a pressure reducing valve 220, a
    pressure transducer 222, a pressure relief valve 224 and a bleed valve 226. The
    pressure transducer 222, the pressure reducing valve 220 and the pressure relief valve
25  224 serve to keep the pressure inside the hydraulic manifold 204 and the inlet line 202
    within appropriate safety levels and/or at appropriate pressures for operating the
    hydromechanical transmission system 206. The bleed valve 226 allows for safe
    discharge of hydraulic fluid from the accumulator 210 for the purpose of servicing the
    same.

                                                     7
    [0025]      The hydromechanical transmission 206 includes a pressure line 212 and a
    closed hydraulic circuit 214. The pressure line 212 is configured to be in communication
    with the inlet line 202 and the hydraulic circuit 214. The closed hydraulic circuit 214
    includes the hydrostatic pump 216 and the variable speed motor 218.
  5 [0026]      The hydrostatic pump 216 includes an inlet and an outlet. The hydrostatic
    pump 216 requires a charge pressure (P,) for safe operation. Anything below the
    charge pressure could cause harm to the hydrostatic pump 216 and necessitate
    expensive and untimely replacement of the hydrostatic pump 216. The hydrostatic
    pump 216 operates by taking in pressurized hydraulic fluid, typically at the charge
 .0 pressure, and outputting an equal or higher pressurized hydraulic fluid (i.e., an
    operating pressure) at an operating variable flow rate, hereafter referred to as an
    operating flow.
    [0027]      The variable speed motor 218 includes an inlet and an outlet. It operates by
    taking in the operating flow from the hydrostatic pump 216. The value of the operating
 .5 variable flow rate determines the speed at which an output shaft 236, which is
    connected to, for example, a variable output 238 in the header 102, operates. In sum,
    the variable speed motor 218 operates via pressurized hydraulic fluid output from the
    hydrostatic pump 216, and subsequently outputs a lower pressurized hydraulic fluid
    (PL)
 .0 [0028]      It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that the hydrostatic pump 216 and
    variable speed motor 218 can reverse their respective inlets and respective outlets. In
    other words, the hydrostatic pump 216 can pump pressurized hydraulic fluid out of
    either of its inlet or outlet, and the variable speed motor 218 can receive the pumped
    pressurized hydraulic fluid in either its inlet or outlet, depending on the direction the
25  closed hydraulic circuit 214 is engaged. It is also appreciated that the direction that the
    variable speed motor 218 operates, for example rotating clockwise versus
    counterclockwise, is dependent on which direction the pressurized hydraulic fluid
    travels. Thus, the closed hydraulic circuit 214, which the hydrostatic pump 216 and the
    variable speed motor 218 are a part of, is reversible.

                                                     8
    [0029]      The closed hydraulic circuit 214 includes the hydrostatic pump 216 and
    variable speed motor 218 as shown in FIG. 3. The closed hydraulic circuit 214 also
    includes the first circuit line 240 and the second circuit line 242 which are connected to
    the pressure line 212. The pressure line 212 may alternatively feed into a third circuit
  5 line 244 which is connected to the first and second circuit lines 240, 242. The hydraulic
    circuit 214 is considered a "closed hydraulic circuit" because the hydrostatic pump 216
    and the variable speed motor 218 are directly connected to each other's respective
    inlets and outlets by way of the first circuit line 240 and second circuit line 242. It is
    appreciated that the closed hydraulic circuit 214 can also include other components,
 .0 such as check valves, in communication with the first, second or third circuit lines 240,
    242, 244.
    [0030]      Additionally, the hydromechanical transmission system 206 includes a case
    drain flow line 246. The case drain flow line 246 serves to drain excess pressurized
    hydraulic fluid and/or wasted hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic system 200 back to a
 .5 hydraulic fluid source located, for example, in the combine 104. In other words, the
    drain line 246 is in communication with the hydromechanical transmission system 206
    for receiving an excess pressure of hydraulic fluid.
    [0031]      Referring again to FIG. 2, the hydraulic system 200 is configured as shown.
    Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, the inlet line 202 is connectable to a
 .0 hydraulic fluid source for fluid communication therewith and extends into the hydraulic
    system 200. In sum, the inlet line 202 extends into the hydraulic manifold 204 and is in
    communication with the check valve 208. The accumulator 210 is downstream from the
    check valve 208 and also in communication with the inlet line 202 at junction 248.
    [0032]      The pressure reducing valve 220 is downstream from the junction 248 and in
25  communication with the inlet line 202. The pressure transducer 222 is downstream the
    pressure reducing valve 220 and also in communication with the inlet line 202. In sum,
    the header 102 comprises a pressure reducing valve 220 in communication with the
    inlet line 202 and downstream the check valve 208. The pressure reducing valve 220 is
    upstream the hydromechanical transmission system 206. Also, the header 102

                                                   9
    comprises a pressure transducer 222 in communication with the inlet line 202 and
    downstream the check valve 208. The pressure transducer 222 is upstream the
    hydromechanical transmission system 206.
    [0033]       Extending from the hydraulic manifold 204 is the pressure line 212 that feeds
  5 into the hydromechanical transmission system 206. The pressure line 212 bifurcates
    into the first circuit line 240 and the second circuit line 242. In an aspect of the present
    exemplary embodiment, the pressure line 212 can instead feed into a third circuit line
    244 of the closed hydraulic circuit 214. In this embodiment, the third circuit line 244 is in
    communication with both the first and second circuit lines 240, 242. The first circuit line
 .0 240 is connected to the hydrostatic pump's 216 inlet and the variable speed motor's 218
    outlet. The second circuit line 242 is connected to the hydrostatic pump's 216 outlet and
    the variable speed motor's 218 inlet. In other words, the first circuit line 240 is in
    communication with the hydrostatic pump 216 and the variable speed motor 218, the
    second circuit line 242 is in communication with the hydrostatic pump 216 and the
 .5 variable speed motor 218, the first circuit line 240 and the second circuit line 242 are in
    communication with the pressure line 212. Alternatively, the third circuit line 244 is in
    communication with the pressure line 212, the first circuit line 240, and the second
    circuit line 242.
    [0034]      The variable speed motor 218 is attached to a variable output 238 by way of,
  o for example, an output shaft 236 for operating another component in the header 102,
    such as a cutter assembly.
    [0035]       Extending from the variable speed motor 218 is the case drain flow line 246
    which is in communication with the pressure relief valve 224 and the bleed valve 226
    inside the hydraulic manifold 204. The pressure relief valve 224 is in communication
25  with the pressure transducer 222 at a junction 250 within the hydraulic manifold 204.
    The case drain flow line 246 is also in communication with the pressure reducing valve
    220 at a junction 252 inside the hydraulic manifold 204. The bleed valve 226 is in
    communication with the accumulator 210 and the inlet line 202 at the junction 248 inside
    the hydraulic manifold 204. The case drain flow line 246 extends out of the hydraulic

                                                    10
    system 200 and can be configured to be connectable to a hydraulic fluid source located
    in, for example, the combine 104.
    [0036]       The hydraulic system 200 operates by maintaining at least a minimum
    pressure such as, for example, the charge pressure for the hydrostatic pump 216. This
  5 is accomplished by having the first pressure, i.e. P1, pumped through the inlet line 202
    into the hydraulic system 200. The inlet line 202 feeds into the check valve 208. If P1 is
    equal to or greater than the cracking pressure, Pv, of the check valve 208, the check
    valve 208 remains open and allows the pressurized hydraulic fluid to pass through. If P1
    is less than P,, the check valve 208 is closed and the hydromechanical transmission
 .0 system 206 receives pressurized hydraulic fluid solely from the accumulator 210, as
    described in further detail below.
    [0037]       If P1 is greater than a predetermined charge pressure Pc, the accumulator
    210, if it is not already full, stores pressured hydraulic fluid, i.e. stored hydraulic fluid. If
    P1 is less than Pc, the accumulator 210 releases its stored pressurized hydraulic fluid
 .s into the inlet line 202 to bring the pressure to, at least, Pc. In other words, the
    accumulator is configured to output a pressure greater than a charge pressure
    necessary to operate the closed hydraulic circuit.
    [0038]       The pressurized hydraulic fluid in the inlet line 202 then passes through the
    pressure reducing valve 220 and the pressure transducer 222, which can operate in
 'o tandem with the pressure relief valve 224. If P1 exceeds the safety levels of the inlet line
    202 or the hydraulic manifold 204, the hydraulic manifold 204 drains off sufficient
    pressurized hydraulic fluid into the case drain flow line 246. Put differently, if there is a
    sudden rise of supply pressure to the hydraulic manifold 204, the pressure relief valve
    224 clips the pressure peaks that are not absorbed by the accumulator 210.
25  [0039]       The resulting pressurized hydraulic fluid enters into the closed hydraulic
    circuit 214 through the pressure line 212 and/or the third circuit line 244. The
    pressurized hydraulic fluid then flows into either the first circuit line 240 or the second
    circuit line 242, the flow of which is directed by whichever circuit line has a lower

                                                  11
    pressure, referred hereafter as PL, which restores the pressure in that circuit line to at
    least Pc.
    [0040]      The hydraulic fluid in the closed hydraulic circuit 214, having a pressure of at
    least Pc, flows into the hydrostatic pump 216. The hydrostatic pump 216 pumps out
  5 pressurized hydraulic fluid at a higher pressure than the charge pressure (Po) and at a
    variable flow rate, which flows through the other of the first or second circuit line 240,
    242 to the variable speed motor 218. The variable speed motor 218 actuates the output
    shaft 236 to operate the variable output 238 at a rate depending on the variable flow
    rate. Any wasted or leaked hydraulic fluid is then released into the case drain flow line
 .0 246 to be returned to the hydraulic fluid source. The remainder of the pressurized
    hydraulic fluid, which is at PL, a pressure lower than Po, is released back into the closed
    hydraulic circuit 214. The lower pressurized hydraulic fluid is thereafter fed back into the
    hydrostatic pump 216 and the cycle repeats itself.
    [0041]      The accumulator 210 serves to function as a safety measure to ensure the
 .5 safe operation of the hydraulic circuit 214. Specifically, if P1 drops too low or the check
    valve 208 is closed, the accumulator 210 serves to return the pressure in the inlet line
    202 to at least the charge pressure Pc. For example, if the a variable flow pump
    upstream the inlet line 202 has a momentary flow limitation event (such as ,for example,
    having too many other hydraulic components active at the same time), the check valve
 'o 208 will close and the accumulator 210 will provide momentary flow to the
    hydromechanical transmission system 206. If the minimum pressure or charge pressure
    is maintained, the hydrostatic pump will not be harmed and thereby continue to function
    properly.
    [0042]      It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that while the present
25  invention was described with respect to a combine 104 and header 102, the present
    invention can be incorporated into any hydraulic system.
    [0043]      Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, additional components can be
    incorporated into the agricultural harvester 100 that utilize the hydraulic circuit 200, and
    can be arranged into a combine system 300.

                                                   12
    [0044]      Additionally, for exemplary purposes only, the agricultural harvester 100 is
    illustrated as a combine harvester. The harvester 100 includes a combine 104 and a
    header 102. The combine 104 and header 102 house a series of components such as
    engines, transmissions, actuators, power trains, cutting assemblies 106, 108, harvesting
  5 reels 110 and so forth, that may require hydraulic fluid to operate. These components
    will hereafter be collectively referred to as other hydraulic components 310. Therefore, it
    can be appreciated that during operational use, the hydrostatic pump 216 may get
    insufficient pressurized hydraulic fluid when other aspects of the combine 104 or header
    102 draw hydraulic power.
 .o [0045]      The combine system 300 is configured as shown in FIG. 3 and includes a
    combine circuit 302 and a header circuit 304. The combine circuit 302 includes a
    hydraulic reservoir 306, a variable flow pump 308 and one or more hydraulic
    components 310. The header circuit 304 includes the hydraulic system 200 described
    above and a charge filter 312. Additionally, the closed hydraulic circuit 214 can also
 .5 include various other valves and flow lines to maintain the efficiency and life of the
    hydromechanical transmission system 206. Interconnecting the combine system 300
    are a series of flow lines designed to transfer pressurized hydraulic fluid from one
    component to another.
    [0046]      While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary
 'o embodiments, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes may
    be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing
    from the scope of the present invention. Additionally, features described in one manner
    may instead be accomplished by known techniques in the art, such using different
    valves.
25  [0047]      In addition, modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or
    material to the teachings of the present invention without departing from the essential
    scope thereof. For example, the type of hydrostatic pump may be changed, which would
    alter the charge pressure. It is to be understood, therefore, that the present invention is
    not be limited to the particular exemplary embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to

                                             13
cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the
appended claims.
