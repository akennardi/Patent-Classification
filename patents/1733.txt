   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to cancer diagnostics and therapies and in particular to the detection of
   mutations that are diagnostic and/or prognostic.
10
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a member of the type 1 tyrosine kinase family of
   growth factor receptors, which play critical roles in cellular growth, differentiation, and survival.
15 Activation of these receptors typically occurs via specific ligand binding, resulting in hetero- or
   homodimerization between receptor family members, with subsequent autophosphorylation of the
   tyrosine kinase domain. This activation triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways
   involved in both cellular proliferation (the ras/raf/MAP kinase pathway) and survival (the P13
   kinase/Akt pathway). Members of this family, including EGFR and HER2, have been directly
20 implicated in cellular transformation.
   A number of human malignancies are associated with aberrant or overexpression of EGFR and/or
   overexpression of its specific ligands e.g. transforming growth factor a (Gullick, Br Med Bull 1991,
   47:87-98; Modijtahedi and Dean, Int J Oncol 1994, 4:227-96; Salomon et al., Crit Rev Oncol Hematol
25  1995;19:183-232). EGFR overexpression has been associated with an adverse prognosis in a number
   of human cancers, including NSCLC. In some instances, overexpression of tumor EGFR has been
   correlated with both chemoresistance and a poor prognosis (Lei et al., Anticancer Res 1999;19:221-8;
   Veale et al., Br J Cancer 1993;68:162-5). These observations suggest that agents that effectively
   inhibit EGFR receptor activation and subsequent downstream signaling may have clinical activity in a
30 variety of human cancers, including NSCLC.
   Tarceva TM (also known as erlotinib; OSI-774), a quinazoline, is an orally active, potent, selective
   inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase. Erlotinib inhibits human EGFR tyrosine kinase with an IC 5 0 of 2
   nM (0.786 mg/mL) in an in vitro enzyme assay. This inhibition is selective for EGFR tyrosine
35 kinase, results in cell cycle arrest at G1, and is reversible. Oral administration of erlotinib in mice has
   demonstrated a >70% reduction in EGFR autophosphorylation in human xenografts and marked
                                                          1
   9934831_1 (GHMatters) P71002.AU.4

   growth inhibition of HN5 and A431 xenografts in nude mice has been demonstrated. In addition to
   single-agent activity in in vivo assay systems, erlotinib has been evaluated in combination with a
   number of chemotherapy agents to determine possible interactions. There was an additive interaction
   between erlotinib and paclitaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and doxorubicin.

   Lung cancer represents the leading cause of cancer-related mortality for both men and women in the
   United States. In 2000, it was estimated that 164,000 new cases would be diagnosed and 157,000
   patients would die from this disease (Greenlee et al., CA Cancer J Clin 2001, 51:15-36).
   Approximately 75% of these patients would have had non-small cell histologies, with the majority
10 presenting with inoperable Stage IIIB or Stage IV disease. For those patients with more limited
   disease at presentation (Stages I-IIIA), relapse following standard surgical therapy, with or without
   adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy, is common. These findings result in an overall
   5-year survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of -12% and serve to emphasize the unmet
   medical need in this disease.
15
   The platinum compound cisplatin was the first chemotherapy agent to show clinical benefit in the
   management of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated
   improved response rates, quality of life, and survival compared with the best supportive care (Rapp et
   al. 1988). However, the magnitude of this improvement was modest-measured in weeks.
20 Subsequently, a number of newer chemotherapy agents have been evaluated as single agents and in
   combination with the platinum salts in the first-line setting. The conclusion from these studies is that
   modem "doublet" chemotherapy appears to achieve response rates of 15%-20%, median time to
   disease progression of 3-4 months, and median survival of 7-8 months. The modest improvements
   in efficacy with combination therapies over the results obtained with cisplatin have established these
25 therapies as a standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC and an acceptable performance
   status (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cooperative Group, Br Med J 1995,311:899-909; American
   Society of Clinical Oncology, J Clin Oncol 1997, 15:2996-3018; Breathnach et al., J Clin Oncol
   2001;19:1734-42).

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TB PREFERR3D]EMBODIMENTS
     It is a discovery of the present invention that mutational events associated with tumorigenesis occur in
     Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Although it was previously known that aberrant EGFR
35   activity was associated with various cancers, it was unknown that mutations in the EGFR kinase domain
     region (KDR) existed that caused aberrant signaling activity associated with some cancers. Surprisingly
     patients suffering from tumors having EGFR KDR mutations have a better prognosis than those with
     wild-type EGFR. The KDR mutations of the EGFR gene can involve rearrangements such as insertions
     and deletions as well as point mutations.
                                                            4

         Samples from approximately 250 patients who participated a randomized, double-blinded phase IlI
        clinical trial referred to as Tribute were sequenced for mutations occurring in exons 18-21 of EGFR.
        Tribute studied 1,079 patients at approximately 150 centers in the United States having histological
        confirmed NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy comparing erlotinib + chemotherapy
 10     (carboplatin/paclitaxel) with chemotherapy alone. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 3 hour i.v.
        infusion) followed by carboplatin (AUC = 6 mg/ml x minute infused over 15-30 minutes using Calvert
       formula) with or without erlotinib (100 mg/day p.o. escalated to 150mg/day for tolerant patients),
       Tumor samples, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks or unstained slides, from approximately 250
       patients collected from the Tribute trial were enriched for tumor cells by laser capture mircrodissection
15     followed by DNA extraction. Exons 18-21 were amplified by nested PCR and bi-directional sequences
      were obtained from each PCR product using fluorescent dye-terminator chemistry.                 Mutations
      discovered from the sequencing are shown in table 1:

   Nucleotide numbering for mutations is based on reference sequence shown in figures 2a-2d.
   Clinical outcome of patients having tumors with EGFR mutations and wild-type EGFR were analyzed
   according to response (complete + partial) benefit (response + stable disease) and progressive disease.
10 Lesions were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RBCIST) criteria whereby
   "complete response" (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; "partial response" (PR) is
   defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference
   the baseline sum longest diameter; "progressive disease" (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the
   sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter

 15     Analysis of clinical outcome revealed that patients with tumors expressing a mutation in exons 18-21 of
       EGFR have better prognosis than those with tumors expressing wild-type EGFR. Mutant EGPR patients
       exhibited greater response rate, benefit rate and survival when treated with chemotherapy or
       chemotherapy plus erlotinib.     These results are useful for predicting outcome such that patients who's
       tumors have EGFR mutations in any or all of exons 18 through 21 have more favorable prognosis than
20     patients who's tumors do not have such mutations,

           Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for determining the prognosis of a patient having a
           tumor comprising determining in a sample of said tumor the presence or absence of one or more EQFR
           mutations in exons 18-21 (or the amino acid sequence corresponding to exons 18-21) whereby the
          presence of said one or more EGFR mutation indicates better prognosis compared to the absence of said
    10    one or more EGFR mutation. By "prognosis" is meant response and/or benefit and/or survival. By
          "EGFR mutations" means an amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that differs from wild-type EGFR
          protein or nucleic acid respectively found on one allele (heterozygous) or both alleles (homozygous) and
          may be somatic or genn line. In a particular embodiment said mutation is found in the kinase domain
          region (KDR) of EGFR. In another particular embodiment the mutation is an amino acid substitution,
   15     deletion or insertion as shown in table 1. In an embodiment the amino acid mutation is one or more of
          the following: G719A, E746K, L7478, E749Q, A750P, A755V, 87681, L858P, E746-R748 del, R748

         EGFR exons 18-21 from an H1975 tumor cell line that exhibited resistance to treatment with erlotinib
        was sequenced and found to incorporate a mutation T790M in combination with an L858R mutation.
  25    Accordingly the present invention further provides a method for determining the prognosis of a patient
        having a tumor comprising determining in a sample of said tumor the presence or absence of the T790M
        EGFR mutation whereby the presence of said T790M EGFR mutation indicates poorer prognosis
        compared to the absence of said T790M EOFR mutation.              Further, there is provided a method of
        identifying patients having a tumor that is less responsive to therapy of an EGFR inhibitor such as
  30    erlotinib or gefitinib, whether in combination with chemotherapy or not comprising determining the
        presence or absence of a T790M EGFR mutation in the patient's tumor whereby the presence of said
        mutation indicates the patient will respond less to said therapy compared to a patient having a tumor that
       does not have said T790M EGFR mutation. Further, there is provided a method of identifying a tumor
       that is resistant to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, such as a dnase domain binding inhibitor (for
 35    example erlotinib or gefitinib), whether in combination with chemotherapy or not, comprising
       detennining the presence or absence of a T790M EGFR mutation in a sample of the tumor whereby the
       presence of said mutation indicates the tumor is resistant to said treatment.         It is understood that
       determination of the mutation is at the protein level or nucleic acid level (genomic DNA or mRNA) and
       are accomplished using techniques such as those described herein. In a particular embodiment, said
                                                             8

      5       EGFR inhibitor competes with ATP at the EGFR kinase domain. In a particular embodiment the EGFR
              inhibitor is erlotinib.
             In another aspect, there is provided a method of treating a patient having a tumor incorporating a T790M
             mutant EGFR protein or gene (or treating a tumor incorporating a T790M mutant EGFR protein or gene)
    10       comprising co-administering to said patient (or contacting said tumor with) a first compound that binds
             to and/or inhibits signaling of said T790M mutant EGFR in combination with a second compound that
             binds to and/or inhibits signaling of wild-type EGFR or EGFR incorporating an activating mutation. In a
            particular embodiment said activating mutation is one or more of those described in Table 1 (other than
            T790M). In a particular embodiment said first and second compounds are administered sequentially or
   15       concomitantly. In a particular embodiment said second compound is erlotinib.
            In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of screening for compounds that inhibit
           signaling of a mutant EGFR protein that incorporates a T790M mutation, comprising contacting said
           mutant EGER.-with a test.compound in the presence of a phosphorylation substrate and.ATP and
 20        detecting a change in the amount of phosphorylation of said substrate whereby a reduction of
           phosphorylation of said substrate compared to a control, or compared to phosphorylation of the substrate
           in the absence of the test compound, indicates said test compound is an inhibitor of mutant EGFR
           signaling. In an embodiment, said method is performed in vitro in the presence of a ligand for said
          mutant EGFR such as EGF or TGF-alpha.
 25
          In a particular embodiment the inhibitory activity of a test compound can be determined in vitro by the
          amount of inhibition of the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate (e.g. Lys3 -Gastrin br polyGluTyr
          (4:1) random copolymer (I, Posner et, aL, J. Biol. Chem. 267 (29), 20638-47 (1992)) on tyrosine by
          epidermal growth factor receptor kinase by a test compound relative to a control. Purified, soluble
30        human T790M mutant EGFR (96 rig) is preincubated in a nicrofuge tube with EGF (2 pg/ml) in
         phosphorylation buffer+vanadate (PBV: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 125 mM NaCl; 24 mM MgC 2; 100
         pM sodium orthovanadate), in a total volume of 10 p], for 20-30 minutes at room temperature. The test
         compound, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); is diluted in PBV, and 10 ptl is mixed with the
         mutant EGFR/EGF mix, and incubated for 10-30 minutes at 30* C. The phosphorylation reaction is
35       initiated by addition of 20 pl " P- ATP/substrate mix (120 pM Lys3 -Gastrin (sequence in single letter
        code for amino acids, KKIKGPWLEEEEAYGWLDF - SEQ ID NO: 38), 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4,40
        pM ATP, 2pCi y[ 3 P]-ATP) to the mutant EGFR/EGF mix and incubated for 20 minutes at room
        temperature. The reaction is stopped by addition of 10 p stop solution (0.5M EDTA, pH 8; 2mM ATP)
                                                               9

     5      and 6 pl 2N HC1. The tubes are centrifuged at 14,000 RPM, 4"C., for 10 minutes. 35 P1 of supernatant
            from each tube is pipetted onto a 2.5 cm circle of Whatman P81 paper, bulk washed four times in 5%
            acetic acid, I liter per wash, and then air dried. This results in the binding of substrate to the paper with
            loss of free ATP on washing. The [33P] incorporated is measured by liquid scintillation counting.
           Incorporation in the absence of substrate (e.g., lys3 -gastrin) is subtracted from all values as a
   10      background and percent inhibition is calculated relative to controls without test compound present. Such
           assays, carried out with a range of doses of test compounds, allow the determination of an approximate
           IC50 value for the in vitro inhibition of T790M mutant EGFR kinase activity.
          In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for identifying a tumor in a human subject
  15      that is susceptible to treatment comprising determining the presence of a mutated EGFR gene or mutated
          EGFR protein in a sample of said tumor wherein said mutation is located in exons 18-21 of EGFR
          whereby the presence of a mutated EGFR gene or mutated EGFR protein indicates that the tumor is
          susceptible to treatment with an anticancer agent. In a particular embodiment the anticancer agent is a
          chemotherapeutic agent which may be a cytotoxic or cytostatic. Tumors include neuroblastoma,

          TarcevaT' (erlotinib, OSI Pharmaceuticals), IressaTm (gefitinib, Astra-Zeneca), tyrphostins described by
 25       Dvir, et al., J Cell Biol., 113:857-865 (1991); tricyclic pyrimidine compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent

30       In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of identifying an BEGFR mutation in a
         sample comprising contacting nucleic acid from said sample with a nucleic acid probe that is capable of
         specifically hybridizing to nucleic acid encoding a mutated EGFR protein, or fragment thereof
         incorporating a mutation, and detecting said hybridization. In a particular embodiment said probe is
        detectably labeled such as with a radioisotope ('H, '2P, "P etc), a fluorescent agent (rhodamine,
35      fluorescene etc.) or a chromogenic agent. In a particular embodiment the probe is an antisense oligomer,
        for example PNA, morpholino-phosphoramidates, LNA or 2'-alkoxyalkoxy.                  The probe may be from
        about 8 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides, or about 10 to about 75, or about 15 to about 50, or about
        20 to about 30. In another aspect said probes of the invention are provided in a kit for identifying EGFR
        mutations in a sample, said kit comprising an oligonucleotide that specifically hybridizes to or adjacent
                                                                 11

      S     to a site of mutation in the EGFR gene. The kit may further comprise instructions for treating patients
            having tumors that contain EGFR mutations with an EGFR inhibitor based on the result -of a
            hybridization test using the kit,
           In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of detecting a mutated EGFR gene in a
    10     sample comprising amplifying from said sample nucleic acid corresponding to the kinase domain of said
           EGFR gene, or exons 18-21, or a fragment thereof suspected of containing a mutation, and comparing
           the electrophoretic mobility of the amplified nucleic acid to the electrophoretic mobility of
           corresponding wild-type EGFR gene or fragment thereof A difference in the mobility indicates the
           presence of a mutation in the amplified nucleic acid sequence, Electrophoretic mobility may be
   15      determined on polyacrylamide gel.
          Alternatively , amplified EGFR gene or fragment nucleic acid may be analyzed for detection of
          mutations using Enzymatic Mutation Detection (EMD) (Del Tito et al, Clinical Chemistry 44:731-739,
          1998). EMD uses the bacteriophage resolvasso T4 endonuclease VII, which scans along double-stranded
 20       DNA until it detects and cleaves structural distortions caused by base pair mismatches resulting from
          point mutations, insertions and deletions.    Detection of two short fragments formed by resolvase
          cleavage, for example by gel eletrophoresis, indicates the presence of a mutation. Benefits of the EMD
         method are a single protocol to identify point mutations, deletions, and insertions assayed directly from
         PCR .reactions eliminating the need for sample purification, shortening the hybridization time, and
 25      increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Mixed samples containing up to a 20-fold excess of normal DNA
         and fragments up to 4 kb in size can been assayed. However, EMD scanning does not identify particular
         base changes that occur in mutation positive samples requiring additional sequencing procedures to
         identiity of the mutation if necessary. CEL I enzyme can be used similarly to resolvase T4 endonuclease
         VII as demonstrated in U85869245.
30
         Another simple kit for detecting the EGFR mutations of the invention is a reverse hybridization test strip
         similar          to         Haemochromatosis                   StripAssayT"                  (Viennalabs
        http://www.bamburghmarrshcom/pdf/4220.pdf) for detection of multiple mutations in AiFE, TFR2 and
        FPNI genes causing Haemochromatosis. Such an assay is based on sequence specific hybridisation
35      following amplification by PCR. For single mutation assays, a microplate-based detection system may
        be applied, whereas for multi-mutation assays, teststrips may be used as "macro-arrays". Kits may
        include ready-to use reagents for sample prep, amplification and mutation detection, Multiplex
                                                            12

    5    amplification protocols provide convenience and allow testing of samples with very limited volumes.
         Using the straightforward StripAssay format, testing for twenty and more mutations may be completed
         in less than five hours without costly equipment. DNA is isolated from a sample and the EGFR gene (or
         exons 18-21 or KDR or segments thereof) is amplified in vitro (e.g. PCR) and biotin-labelled, preferably
         in a single ("multiplex") amplification reaction, The PCR products are the selectively hybridized to
  10     oligonucleotide probes (wild-type and mutant specific) immobilized on a solid support such as a test
         strip in which the probes are immobilized as parallel lines or bands. Bound biotinylated amplicons are
        detected using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and color substrates. Such an assay can detect all or
        any subset of the mutations in table 1. With respect to a particular mutant probe band one of three
        signalling patterns are possible: (i) a band only for wild-type probe which indicates normal EGFR (ii)
 15     bands for both wild-type and a mutant probe which indicates heterozygous genotype and (iii) band only
        for the mutant probe which indicates homozygous mutant EGFR genotype. Accordingly there is further
        provides a method of detecting EGFR mutations of the invention comprising isolating nucleic acid from
        a sample, amplifying the EGFR gene, or fragment thereof (e.g. the KDR or exons 18-21 or smaller) such
        that the amplified nucleic acid comprises a ligand, contacting the amplified EGFR gene or fragment with
 2o     a probe which comprises a detectable binding partner to the ligand and the probe is capable of
        specifically hydribizing to an EGFR mutation, and then detecting the hybridization of said probe to said
       amplified EGFR gene or fragment. In a particular embodiment the ligand is biotin and the binding
       partner is comprises avidin or streptavidin. In a particular embodiment the binding partner is
       steptavidin-alkaline which is detectable with color substrates. In a particular embodiment the probes are
 15    immobilized for example on a test strip wherein probes complementary to different mutations are
       separated from one another. Alternatively, the amplified nucleic acid is labelled with a radioisotope in
       which case the probe need not comprise a ligand.
       The tumor samples were also analyzed for mutations in KRAS (as referred to as p2la).            Particular
30     mutations detected in exon I are: G12C; 012A; G12D; G12R; G12S; G12V; G13C; G13D which
       correlated with poor prognosis to chemotherapy as well as chemotherapy with erlotinib therapy.
       Accordingly, the invention further provides a method of identifying patients not responsive to therapy of
       an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib or erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy comprising
       determining the presence or absence of a KRAS mutation whereby the presence of said mutation
35     indicates a patient will not respond to said therapy. Alternatively, there is provided a method for
      identifying a tumor in a human subject that is susceptible to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor
      comprising (i) determining the presence of a wild-type KRAS protein or gene in a sample of said tumor
      whereby the presence of a wild-type KRAS protein or gene indicates that the tumor is susceptible to
      treatment with an EGFR inhibitor or (ii) determining the presence of a mutated KRAS protein or gene in
                                                            13

   5   a sample of said tumor whereby the absence of a mutated KRAS protein or gene indicates that the tumor
       is susceptible to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor. In a particular embodiment the mutation is in exon I
       of K-Ras. In another embodiment the K-Ras mutation is at least one of G12C; G12A; G12D; G12R;
       012S; G12V; G13C; 013D. Alternatively, individuals who have tumors which harbor mutant K-Ras
      may be treated with EGFR inhibitors when in concomitantly with a K-Ras inhibitor. Methods for
 10   determining the presence of K-Ras mutations are analogous to those used to identify EGFR mutations
      described in detail herein.
      According to the diagnostic and prognostic method of the present invention, alteration of the wild-type
      EGFR gene is detected. Alterations of a wild-type gene according to the present invention encompasses
 15   all forms of mutations such as insertions, inversions, deletions, and/or point mutations. Somatic
      mutations are those which occur only in certain tissues, e.g., in the tumor tissue, and are not inherited in
      the germ line. Germ line mutations can be found in any of a body's tissues. If only a single allele is
      somatically mutated, an early neoplastic state is indicated. However, if both alleles are mutated then a
      late neoplastic state is indicated. The finding of EGFR mutations is therefore a diagnostic and prognostic
 20   indicator as described herein.
      The EGFR mutations found in tumor tissues may result in increased signaling activity relative to wild
      type EGFR leading to a cancerous state. In order to detect the alteration of the wild-type EGFR gene a
      sample or biopsy of the tumor is obtained by methods well known in the art and appropriate for the
 t5  particular type and location of the tumor. For instance, samples of lung cancer lesions may be obtained
     by resection, bronchoscopy, fine needle aspiration, bronchial brushings, or from sputum, pleural fluid or
     blood. Means for enriching a tissue preparation for tumor cells are known in the art. For example, the
     tissue may be isolated from paraffin or cryostat sections.       Cancer cells may also be separated from
     normal cells by flow cytometry or laser capture microdissection. These as well as other techniques for
30   separating tumor from normal cells are well known in the art. If the tumor tissue is highly contaminated
     with normal cells, detection of mutations is more difficult.
     Detection of point mutations may be accomplished by molecular cloning of the EGFR allele (or alleles)
     and sequencing that allele(s) using techniques well known in the art. Alternatively, the polymerase chain
35   reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify gene sequences directly from a genomic DNA preparation from
     the tumor tissue. The DNA sequence of the amplified sequences can then be determined and mutations
     identified therefrom. The polymerase chain reaction is well known in the art and described in Saiki et
     al., Science 239:487, 1988; U.S. 4,683,203; and U.S. 4,683,195.

   $   and deletions of genes can also be detected by cloning, sequencing and amplification. In addition,
       restriction fragment length polymorphism, (RFLP) probes for the gene or surrounding marker genes can
      be used to score alteration of an allele or an insertion in a polymorphic fragment.         Single stranded
      conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis can also be used to detect base change variants of an allele.
      (Orita et aL., Proc. Nat]. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 86, pp. 2766-2770, 1989, and Genomics, Vol. 5, pp. 874
 10   879, 1989.) Other techniques for detecting insertions and deletions as are known in the art can be used.
      Alteration of wild-type genes can also be detected on the basis of the alteration of a wild-type expression
      product of the gene. Such expression products include both the EGFR mRNA as well as the EGFR
      protein product, Point mutations may be detected by amplifying and sequencing the mRNA or via
 15   molecular cloning of cDNA made from the mRNA, The sequence of the cloned cDNA can be
      determined using DNA sequencing techniques which are well known in the art. The cDNA can also be
      sequenced via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Mismatches, according to the present invention are hybridized nucleic acid duplexes which are not 100%
 Z0   complementary. The lack of total complementarity may be due to deletions, insertions, inversions,
     substitutions or frameshift mutations. Mismatch detection can be used to detect point mutations in the
     gene or its mRNA product. While these techniques are less sensitive than sequencing, they are simpler to
     perform on a large number of tumor samples. An example of a mismatch cleavage technique is the
     RNase protection method, which is described in detail in Winter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol.
 !5  82, p. 7575, 1985 and Meyers et al., Science, Vol. 230, p. 1242, 1985. In the practice a the present
     invention the method involves the use of a labeled riboprobe which is complementary to the human
     wild-type EGFR gene coding sequence (or exons 18-21 or KDR thereof). The riboprobe and either
     mRNA or DNA isolated from the tumor tissue are annealed (hybridized) together and subsequently
     digested with the enzyme RNase A which is able to detect some mismatches in a duplex RNA structure.
30   If a mismatch is detected by RNase A, it cleaves at the site of the mismatch. Thus, when the annealed
     RNA preparation is separated on an electrophoretic gel matrix, if a mismatch has been detected and
     cleaved by RNase A, an RNA product will be seen which is smaller than the full-length duplex RNA for
     the riboprobe and the mRNA or DNA. The riboprobe need not be the full length of the EOFR mRNA or
     gene but can be exons 18 through 21 or the EGFR KDR or segments thereof. If the riboprobe comprises
35   only a segment of the EGFR mRNA or gene it will be desirable to use a number of these probes to
     screen the whole mRNA sequence for mismatches.
                                                          16

    5    In a similar manner, DNA probes can be used to detect mismatches, through enzymatic or chemical
         cleavage. See, e.g., Cotton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 85, 4397, 1988; and Shenk et al.,
         Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 72, p. 989, 1975. Alternatively, mismatches can be detected by shifts in
         the electrophoretic mobility of mismatched duplexes relative to matched duplexes. See, e.g., Cariello,
         Human Genetics, Vol. 42, p. 726, 1988. With either riboprobes or DNA probes, the cellular mRNA or
   10    DNA which might contain a mutation can be amplified using PCR before hybridization. Changes in
        DNA of the EGFR gene can also be detected using Southern hybridization, especially if the changes are
        gross rearrangements, such as deletions and insertions.
        DNA sequences of the EGFR gene which have been amplified by use of polymerase chain reaction may
  15    also be screened using allele-specific probes. These probes are nucleic acid oligoners, each of which
        contains a region of the EGFR gene sequence harboring a known mutation. For example, one oligomer
        may be about 30 nucleotides in length, corresponding to a portion of the EGFR gene sequence. By use of
        a battery of such allele-specific probes, PCR amplification products can be screened to identify the
       presence of a previously identified mutation in the EGFR gene. Hybridization of allele-specific probes
 20     with amplified EGFR sequences can be performed, for example, on a nylon filter. Hybridization to a
       particular probe under stringent hybridization conditions indicates the presence of the same mutation in
       the tumor tissue as in the allele-specific probe.
       Alteration of wild-type EGFR genes can also be detected by screening for alteration of wild-type EGFR
 Z5    protein. For example, monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive with EGFR can be used to screen a tissue.
       Lack of cognate antigen would indicate an EGFR mutation. Antibodies specific for products of mutant
       alleles could also be used to detect mutant EGFR gene product. Antibodies may be identified from
       phage display libraries. Such immunological assays can be done in any convenient format known in the
       art. These include Western blots, immunohistochemical assays and ELISA assays. Any means for
30     detecting an altered EGFR protein can be used to detect alteration of wild-type EGFR genes.
       Mutant EGFR genes or gene products can be detected from tumor or from other body samples such as
      urine, sputum or serum. The same techniques discussed above for detection of mutant EGFR genes or
      gene products in tumor samples can be applied to other body samples. Cancer cells are sloughed off
35    from tumors and appear in such body samples. By screening such body samples, a simple early
      diagnosis can be achieved for many types of cancers. In addition, the progress of chemotherapy or
      radiotherapy can be monitored more easily by testing such body samples for mutant EGFR genes or gene
      products.
                                                            17

           The methods of diagnosis of the present invention are applicable to any tumor in which EGFR has a role
           in tumorigenesis for example lung, breast, colon, glioma, bladder, liver, stomach and prostate. The
           diagnostic method of the present invention is useful' for clinicians so that they can decide upon an
           appropriate course of treatment. For example, a tumor displaying alteration of both EGFR alleles might
    10     suggest a more aggressive therapeutic regimen than a tumor displaying alteration of only one EGFR
           allele.
          The primer pairs of the present invention are useful for determination of the nucleotide sequence of a
          particular EGFR allele using the polymerase chain reaction. The pairs of single stranded DNA primers
   15     can be annealed to sequences within or surrounding the EGFR gene on in order to prime amplifying
          DNA synthesis of the EGFR gene itself. A set of these primers allows synthesis of all of the nucleotides
          of the EGFR exons 18 through 21. Allele specific primers can also be used. Such primers anneal only to
          particular EGFR mutant alleles, and thus will only amplify a product in the presence of the mutant allele
          as a template.   In order to facilitate subsequent cloniAj of anplifiAid sequences, primers may have
  20     restriction enzyme site sequences appended to their ends. Thus, all nucleotides of the primers are derived
         from EGFR exons 18-21 or sequences adjacent thereto except the few nucleotides necessary to form a
         restriction enzyme site. Such enzymes and sites are well known in the art. The primers themselves can
         be synthesized using techniques which are well known in the art. Generally, the primers can be made
         using oligonucleotide synthesizing machines which are commercially available. Design of particular
 25     primers is well within the skill of the art.
        The nucleic acid probes provided by the present invention are useful for a number of purposes. They can
        be used in Southern hybridization to genomic DNA and in the RNase protection method for detecting
        point mutations already discussed above. The probes can be used to detect PCR amplification products.
30     They may also be used to detect mismatches with the BGFR gene or mRNA using other techniques.
       Mismatches can be detected using either enzymes (e.g., Sl nuclease), chemicals (e.g., hydroxylamine or
       osmium tetroxide and piperidine), or changes in electrophoretic mobility of mismatched hybrids as
       compared to totally matched hybrids. These techniques are known in the art. See Novack et al., Proc.
       Natl, Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 83, p. 586, 1986. Generally, the probes are complementary to EGFR exon
35     18-21 sequences, although generally probes to the kinase domain and segments thereof are also
       contemplated. An entire battery of nucleic acid probes may be used to compose a kit for detecting
       alteration of wild-type EGFR genes. The kit allows for hybridization to the entire exon 18-21 sequence
       of the EGFR gene. The probes may overlap with each other or be contiguous.
                                                           I8

   If a riboprobe is used to detect mismatches with mRNA, it is complementary to the mRNA of the
   EGFR gene. The riboprobe thus is an antisense probe in that it does not code for the EGFR protein
   because it is complementary to the sense strand. The riboprobe generally will be labeled with a
   radioactive, colorimetric, or fluorometric material, which can be accomplished by any means known
 5 in the art. If the riboprobe is used to detect mismatches with DNA it can be of either polarity, sense
   or anti-sense. Similarly, DNA probes also may be used to detect mismatches.
   Predisposition to cancers can be ascertained by testing any tissue of a human for mutations of the
   EGFR gene. For example, a person who has inherited a germ line EGFR mutation would be prone to
10 develop cancers. This can be determined by testing DNA from any tissue of the body. For example,
   blood can be drawn and DNA extracted from the cells of the blood. In addition, prenatal diagnosis
   can be accomplished by testing fetal cells, placental cells, or amniotic fluid for mutations of the
   EGFR gene. Alteration of a wild- type EGFR allele, whether for example, by point mutation or by
   deletion, can be detected by any of the means discussed above.

      Example 5        Dose Response
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and mutant constructs used in this study
      were epitope-tagged at the N-terminus with the herpes simplex virus signal sequence of gD, replacing
 ao   the endogenous EGFR signal sequence (Schaefer et al. 1999 J. Biol. Chem. 274, 859-866). Cos7 cells
     were seeded in 12 well dishes in normal growth medium 24 hours prior to transfection.          Cells were
     transfected with 0.25ug per well with expression plasmid DNAs (pRK5.gD.EGFR wild-type,
     pRK5.gD.EGFR. L858R, or pRK5.gD.EGFR.del(E746-S752)) using LipofectAMINE 2000 following
     manufacturer's recommended protocol (Invitrogen).        Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were
  5  serum starved for six hours in serum free DMEM. One hour prior to stimulation, transfected cells were
     preincubated with the indicated concentrations of erlotinib. Transfected cells were stimulated with 1 nM
     TGFa for 10 minutes. Cells were lysed directly in the wells using reducing Laemmli buffer. Receptor
     autophosphorylation, an index of EGFR receptor activation by growth factor stimulation, was detected
     by Western blotting using an HRP-oonjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Oncogene Sciences, AB
30   4).   Transfection efficiency was evaluated using an antibody specific for the gD epitope tag (5B6).
     Level of receptor activation was evaluated from the autoradiograms using NIH Image software. These
     data were then used to generate a graph from which an IC50 was calculated using a 4 parameter fit
     function.    As illustrated by the results below, erlotinib has a greater affinity to EGFR containing
     mutations compared to wild-type EGFR.
