[0001]     This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 62/439,379
filed on December 27, 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0002]     Patient transfer apparatuses may be adapted to transport patients up or down an incline,
such as stairs. In many instances, it may be difficult or impossible for certain people to travel up
or down the stairs on their own. In situations where stairs are the only viable option to navigate
between floors, such as outdoor staircases or buildings without elevators, patient transfer
apparatuses may be employed. These allow one or more operators to move a patient up or down
stairs in a safe and controlled manner.
[0003]     Patient transfer apparatuses may include a seat for a patient and a track assembly that
engages the stairs such that a portion of the weight of the chair and the patient is supported by
the track instead of the operators. In some instances, the track is powered by a motor controlled
by the operator to facilitate moving the patient up or down the stairs without the operators having
to provide the full force necessary to move the patient. In emergency evacuation situations,
however, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel need to get to and evacuate the patient
as quickly as possible.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0024]     A patient transfer apparatus is configured to be controlled by an operator to traverse a
set of stairs while supporting a patient. In one embodiment, the patient transfer apparatus is
configured to travel up the set of stairs. In another embodiment, the patient transfer apparatus is
configured to travel down the set of stairs. In yet another embodiment, the patient transfer
apparatus is configured to travel up and down the set of stairs. The patient transfer apparatus
may be further configured to travel on level ground. A track is configured to act as a tractive
element and engage the stairs when traversing the set of stairs. Controlling the movement of the
track (e.g., by a motor, by friction, etc.) controls the movement of the patient transfer apparatus
relative to the stairs when the track has engaged the stairs. The term "stairs" used herein
includes any sloped surface or path in addition to a stepped surface or path. For example and
without limitation, the sloped surface or path can be relatively planar.
[0025]     In certain situations, it is advantageous to vary the movement of the patient transfer
apparatus based on certain situation specific factors. By way of example, to ensure the safety of
the patient and one or more operators, it may be desired that the patient transfer apparatus travel
along the set of stairs at a certain speed when supporting a patient, but can move faster up the set
of stairs when not carrying a patient. By way of another example, when traveling down the set
of stairs in a descending direction (opposite an ascending direction), damping the movement of
the patient transfer apparatus (e.g., by increasing friction on the track 52 from FIG. 1) can
                                                    -3-

increase the control of the operators and reduce the physical effort required by the operators to
safely move the patient transfer apparatus. When traveling up the stairs in an ascending direction
opposite the descending direction, however, this friction would increase the effort required to
move the patient transfer apparatus, so it would be advantageous to selectively engage the
damping. Controlling the movement of the patient transfer apparatus based on the situation
allows the operator to get to and move the patient quickly, safely, and easily.
[0026]    Referring to FIGS. 1-4, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a patient
transfer apparatus, such as patient transfer apparatus 10, includes a seat assembly 20 configured
to support a patient. The seat assembly 20 includes a frame 21 and a track assembly 50
including a moveable track 52 coupled to the seat assembly. According to the exemplary
embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-4, the track assembly 50 includes a motor 54 configured to drive
the track 52. As illustrated in FIG. 9, in some embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus 10
also includes a control system 100. The control system 100 includes a controller 110, one or
more sensors 150, and an operator interface 180. In other embodiments, the patient transfer
apparatus does not include the control system 100.
[0027]    In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-4, the frame 21 includes rear vertical members
22, front vertical members 24, side-facing horizontal members 26, rear facing horizontal
members 28, and a foot rest 30. In some embodiments, the members 22, 24, 26, and 28 and foot
rest 30 are fixed or pivotably coupled such that they allow the frame 21 to support the load of a
patient but also allow the frame 21 to be folded into a more compact configuration or otherwise
manipulated or repositioned. For ease of lifting and general movement, in some embodiments
the frame 21 includes a top handle 32, rear handles 34, and front handles 36. Any of handles 32,
34, and 36 may be fixed, pivotably coupled, or translatably coupled to the rest of the frame as is
most effective to facilitate storage and usage. Front wheels 38 and rear wheels 39 are rotatably
coupled to the frame 21 and support the patient transfer apparatus when moving across level
ground, a smooth incline, or a non-stepped incline. In the embodiments shown, rear wheels 39
are coupled to the frame 21 such that they can only rotate about one axis, whereas the front
wheels 38 are casters that are free to rotate about two axes. This configuration allows the patient
                                                 -4-

transfer apparatus 10 to facilitate maneuvering and also allows the apparatus 10 to be tipped back
on the rear wheels 39 in a "dollying" configuration. In other embodiments, different numbers
and types of wheels are used.
[0028]    As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the seat assembly 20 also includes a seat frame 42, which is
pivotally coupled to the frame 21 and transfers the load of the patient into the frame 21. In other
embodiments, the seat frame 42 is fixed relative to the frame 21. In some embodiments, a seat is
coupled to the seat frame 42 and supports the patient or object placed on the seat assembly 20.
In some embodiments, the seat frame 42 and seat are formed together into one component.
[0029]    According to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-4, the track assembly 50 includes at
least one track 52, a track support 56, and two pulleys 57 rotatably coupled to the track support
56, which support the track 52. In one embodiment, the track 52 forms a continuous band of one
or more materials and is supported by at least one pulley 57 such that rotation of the pulley(s) 57
causes the track 52 to move with the pulley 57 (and/or movement of the track 52 causes rotation
of the pulley(s) 57). For example and without limitation, in one embodiment, the track 52 is a
plastic belt with radial Kevlar@ reinforcement and its outer surface having teeth and/or
comprising a soft rubber for traction. Traction with the stairs or other support surface allows
movement of the track to cause movement of the track and apparatus 10 across the stairs or
support surface. Although the track 52 is illustrated as being generally oval in shape, the track
may take on a variety of shapes in accordance with other embodiments. For example and
without limitation, the track may be circular and may generally operate similar to a wheel.
[0030]    In one embodiment, the pulleys 57 translatably support the track as the track 52
translates between the two pulleys 57. Although the illustrated embodiment includes two
pulleys, there may be more or less pulleys in other embodiments. The track assembly 50 further
includes track assembly frame members 58 coupled to the track support 56. The exemplary
embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-3 includes two slides 60 coupled to the track assembly frame
members 58, which support the patient transfer apparatus 10 when traversing the set of stairs. As
shown in FIG. 3, the slides 60 include one or more strips of smooth material. In other
                                                 -5-

embodiments the slides 60 have a different configuration (e.g., have a series of rollers disposed
along the length of the slide). In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 and 5 the slides 60 are omitted
and the patient transfer apparatus 10 is instead supported by additional tracks 52. In some
embodiments, the track assembly frame members 58 are omitted and the slides 60 are coupled to
the track support 56 or to the frame 21. According to various exemplary embodiments, a patient
transfer apparatus may have one or more of each of tracks 52, track supports 56, track assembly
frame members 58, slides 60, and combinations thereof.
[0031]    In the exemplary embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-4, the track assembly 50 is pivotably
coupled to the seat assembly 40 and can be selectively fixed in a position wherein the track
assembly 50 is pivoted relative to the seat assembly 40. This configuration allows the track
assembly 50 to move from a storage position, shown in FIG. 3, which minimizes the overall size
of the patient transfer apparatus 10, to a deployed position, shown in FIG. 2 which angles the
track 52 to angularly align with the stairs. The track 52 may be in the deployed position when
engaging the stairs. In other embodiments, the track assembly 50 is fixed at an angle relative to
the frame 21. In some embodiments, the track assembly 50 is disposed partially or completely
below the seat assembly 20. At least a portion of the track 52 may be pivotable about a pivot
axis adjacent one end of the track 52. The pivot axis may be adjacent at least one of the wheels
39. The track 52 may be disposed adjacent a rear portion of the frame 21 adjacent the wheels 39.
A shown in FIG. 6, the track 52 may be disposed at a track angle 84 relative to a vertical axis 82
when traversing or engaging the stairs.
[0032]    Referring to FIG. 5, the motor 54 is coupled to a gearbox 62, which drives the track 52
located in the center. When the track 52 engages the set of stairs, the motor 54 can then control
the motion and speed of the patient transfer apparatus 10 traversing the stairs. Referring to
FIGS. 1-5, the track 52 is configured to be pivotally fixed relative to the motor 54 such that the
motor 54 pivots with the track 52 upon moving between the storage and deployed positions. In
one embodiment, the motor 54 is fixed relative to the track support 56 such that the motor 54
moves with the track support 56. By way of example, the track 52 can include a timing belt
pattern on its interior surface, and the motor 54 can drive the track 52 through pulley 57, which
                                                 -6-

has a corresponding timing belt pattern in some embodiments. As such, at least one pulley 57
can be driven by a motor 54. In some embodiments, the gearbox 62 is configured to not allow
back driving (e.g., a worm gearbox, a gearbox with a ratcheting mechanism), allowing the motor
54 to hold its position under external loading. In other embodiments, the gearbox 62 is omitted
and the motor 54 directly drives the track 52. In some embodiments, one or both of the motor 54
and gearbox 62 are coupled to the track support 56. In other embodiments, each track 52 is
powered by a separate motor 54. In other embodiments, one motor powers two or more tracks
52. Although the illustrated embodiment shown in Figure 5 shows the track assembly 50 having
two moveable tracks 52, there may be more or less tracks in other embodiments. Furthermore,
one or more than one of the tracks 52 may be driven by one or more motors 54. In some
embodiments, one or more of the tracks 52 may not be driven by a motor. Although the motor
54 is illustrated as being laterally offset from the track support 56, in other embodiments, the
motor 54 is positioned at least partially within the track support 56 and/or perpendicularly
relative to the track support 56.
[0033]     In order to power the motor 54, the patient transfer apparatus 10 includes a power
source. The power source is coupled (e.g., electrically) to the motor 54 such that it can provide
the energy necessary to drive the motor 54. The power source may be coupled to the control
system 100 (FIG. 9) such that it provides the energy necessary to run the controller 110 and one
or more sensors 150 (FIG. 9). In some embodiments, the power source comprises one or more
battery packs that are removable and rechargeable.
[0034]     FIG. 6 shows a side profile of the track assembly 50 while traversing the set of stairs,
according to an exemplary embodiment. One or more slides 60 (or additional tracks) are
positioned near to or in contact with the stairs to support and stabilize the patient transfer
apparatus 10 while traversing the stairs. The track 52 contacts one or more stairs, providing
traction. A track axis 80 is defined parallel to the direction of travel of the patient transfer
apparatus 10 when traversing the set of stairs. In some embodiments, the track axis 80 is parallel
to a longitudinal surface 81 of the track 52. In other embodiments, the track axis 80 is parallel to
the slides 60. A vertical axis 82 is defined as parallel to the direction of gravity vector. The
                                                   -7-

track angle 84 is defined as the smallest angle that can be measured between the track axis 80
and the vertical axis 82. This angle 84 provides a relative indication of the amount of force
necessary for the patient transfer apparatus 10 to ascend the set of stairs. For a given patient
weight supported by the patient transfer apparatus 10, a smaller track angle 84 will require a
greater force to move the patient transfer apparatus 10 up the set of stairs in a given time. The
track angle 84 may be indicative of a slope 86 of the stairs. The slope 86 can be calculated based
on the track angle. The controller 110 may be configured to determine the slope 86 based on the
track angle 84 and vice versa.
[0035]    FIG. 7 depicts another exemplary embodiment of a patient transfer apparatus, shown as
patient transfer apparatus 90. The patient transfer apparatus 90 includes a number of tracks 91
coupled to a seat assembly 92 with a pair of rear legs 93 that are rotatably coupled to the seat
assembly 92 or frame of the patient transfer apparatus 90. The tracks 91 are located partially
under the seat assembly 92, saving space and allowing the tracks 91 to be oriented in a stair
traversing orientation without having to be deployed. When traversing the set of stairs, the rear
legs 93 can rotate such that the tracks 91 can contact the stairs without interference from the rear
legs 93. FIG. 8 depicts another embodiment of a patient transfer apparatus, shown as patient
transfer apparatus 95. The patient transfer apparatus 95 includes a number of tracks 96
integrated into a pair of rear legs 97. The rear legs 97 and a pair of front legs 98 are rotatably
coupled to a seat assembly 99. When traversing a set of stairs, the rear legs 97 and front legs 98
rotate relative to the seat assembly 99 to maintain a desired orientation of the seat assembly 99
relative to the set of stairs. While many of the features and functions described herein are
described with reference to patient transfer apparatus 10, the same and similar features and
functions, including but not limited to the speed control described below, may be incorporated
into patient transfer apparatuses 90, 95.
[0036]    In some embodiments, the motor 54 is controlled by the control system 100, shown in
the schematic of FIG. 9. The control system 100 includes the controller or processing circuit 110
operatively coupled to the motor 54. While illustrated as one controller, the controller 110 may
be part of a larger system and/or controlled by other controller(s) throughout the system 100 or
                                                  -8-

apparatus. Therefore, the controller 110 and one or more other controllers not shown in the
illustrated embodiments may collectively be referred to as a "controller" that controls various
components of the system 100 or apparatus in response to signals to control functions of the
system 100. The controller or processing circuit 110 can include a processor and a memory
device. The processor can be implemented as a general purpose processor, an application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a group
of processing components, or other suitable electronic processing components. The memory
device (e.g., memory, memory unit, storage device, etc.) is one or more devices (e.g., RAM,
ROM, Flash memory, hard disk storage, etc.) for storing data and/or computer code for
completing or facilitating the various processes, layers and modules described in the present
application. The memory device may include volatile memory or non-volatile memory. The
memory device may include database components, object code components, script components,
or any other type of information structure for supporting the various activities and information
structures described in the present application. According to an exemplary embodiment, the
memory device is communicably connected to the processor via processing circuit and includes
computer code for executing (e.g., by processing circuit and/or processor) one or more processes
described herein. In addition to the controller 110, the control system 100 includes one or more
sensors 150, which will be explained in further detail below.
[0037]     The patient transfer apparatus 10 may include a load indicator 152 configured to
provide a signal to the controller 110 that indicates the presence of an object. In some
embodiments, the load indicator 152 indicates the presence of an object on the seat assembly 20.
In some embodiments, the load indicator 152 is operatively coupled to the controller 110. The
load indicator 152 may be a sensor, such as sensor 152a, or a mechanical input mechanism, such
as a switch or mechanical fuse. A sensor 152a is shown in FIG. 1 as being coupled to the seat
44. In other embodiments, the sensor 152a is located elsewhere. The sensor 152a may be
selected from a variety of sensor types including, but not limited to: a load cell, a pressure
sensor, an optical sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a thermal sensor, a resistive sensor, and a
capacitive sensor. By way of example, the sensor 152a is a load cell. In this example, the sensor
                                                 -9-

provides a signal to the controller 110 to indicate the presence of an object based on the force
exerted on the seat 44 as measured by the load cell compared to a threshold value. The use of a
threshold value as opposed to zero load would reduce the likelihood of a false reading of an
object due to signal noise. By way of another example, the sensor 152a may be a thermal sensor.
In this example, the sensor could determine the presence of an object if the object has a distinct
temperature signature (e.g., the object is warmer than the ambient air, the object is colder than
the ambient air, etc.). By way of yet another example, the sensor 152a may be an optical sensor
that emits a beam of light at a retroreflective target (i.e., a target designed to reflect light back to
its source) and detects if the beam returns to the sensor. In this example, the retroreflective
target is placed on the seat back and the optical sensor is placed on the seat, and an object placed
on the seat interrupts the beam of light thereby indicating the presence of the object.
[0038]     In some embodiments, the control system 100 includes an occupancy indicator, such as
load indicator 152 or sensor 152a, for sending a signal to the controller 110 indicative of the
occupancy of the seat assembly 20. The signal corresponds to a load or weight sensed by the
occupancy indicator. The load or weight exceeding a predefined threshold is indicative of a
patient occupying the seat assembly 20. The occupancy indicator may be at least one a load cell,
a pressure sensor, an optical sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a thermal sensor, a resistive sensor, a
capacitive sensor, and a mechanical input mechanism.
[0039]     In some embodiments, the sensor 152a detects, specifically, the presence of a patient as
opposed to an object. In these embodiments, the sensor 152a is used to distinguish between an
object with a similar shape or weight to a patient (e.g., a bag of equipment used by the operator)
and a patient. The types of sensors useful for these embodiments include, but are not limited to,
an optical sensor, a thermal sensor, and a capacitive sensor. By way of example, a capacitive
sensor can be included in sensor 152a. In this case, the capacitive sensor is used to detect the
presence of a patient by sensing the presence of material with a specific conductivity (e.g., skin).
The sensor 152a may use one type of sensor or multiple types of sensors in concert. The use of
multiple sensor types may allow for a more definitive sensor reading. By way of example, an
optical sensor similar to that discussed in the above example may be used to detect the presence
                                                  -10-

of an object, and a load cell may be used to confirm that a load was placed on the seat assembly
20.
[0040]     In some embodiments, the occupancy indicator is a sensor disposed within a seatbelt
assembly of the apparatus 10. The apparatus may include a seatbelt configured to secure a
patient on the seat assembly 20. Upon fastening of the seatbelt to secure the patient, the
occupancy indicator may send a signal indicative of the fastening to the controller 110. As such,
the controller 110 may adjust the speed of the apparatus 10 based on whether the seatbelt is
fastened or unfastened. As such, occupancy of the seat assembly 20 may be determined based on
fastening of the seatbelt (e.g., whether a free end of the seatbelt is fastened to a fixed portion of
the seat assembly 20 or frame 21 to secure the patient).
[0041]     In some embodiments, a target speed of the motor 54 is determined (e.g., by the
controller 110) by comparing a current to the motor 54 relative to a set of predefined current
thresholds. As used herein, "speed of the motor" refers to a rotational speed of an output shaft of
the motor 54. The current to the motor 54 may be detected by a current sensor. If the current to
the motor 54 is relatively low such that it falls below a first current threshold (e.g., the lowest
threshold of the set), then the track 52 that is being driven by the motor 54 may be slipping
relative to the stairs. In such a case, it may be desirable to decrease the speed of the motor 54 to
a predefined slipping speed to halt or minimize the slipping. The predefined slipping speed may
be a fixed value or a dynamic value based on other factors. By way of example, the predefined
slipping speed is a percentage of an actual speed of the motor 54 (e.g., 90% of the actual speed),
such that the speed of the motor 54 steps down incrementally (e.g., by 10%) until slipping no
longer occurs or is minimized.
[0042]     In some embodiments, the current to the motor is measured to indicate the occupancy of
the seat assembly. If the current to the motor 54 is greater than the first current threshold but
falls below a second current threshold (greater than the first current threshold), it may be
desirable to adjust a target speed of the motor 54 or a maximum allowable speed of the motor 54
to a first speed. In such a case, the current to the motor 54 is still relatively low and may indicate
                                                  -11-

that there is no (or at most minimal) slipping of the track 52 relative to the stairs, and (if
anything) only an object and not a patient is being supported by the seat assembly 20. Therefore,
it may be permissible for the apparatus to move at higher speeds.
[0043]    If the current to the motor 54 is greater than the second current threshold but falls below
a third current threshold (greater than the second current threshold), it may be desirable to adjust
a target speed of the motor 54 or a maximum allowable speed of the motor 54 to a second speed
less than the first speed. In such a case, the current to the motor 54 is relatively high and may
indicate that a patient is occupying the seat assembly 20. Therefore, it may be desirable to
decrease the target speed of the motor 54 and/or the maximum allowable speed of the motor 54.
[0044]    If the current to the motor 54 is greater than the third current threshold, it may indicate
undesirable operating conditions such that the motor 54 should be slowed or stopped. In such a
case, the current to the motor 54 is relatively high such that the speed of the motor 54 may be
decreased (to a predefined value or incrementally as described above).
[0045]    In some embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to decrease the speed of the
motor 54 (or of the track 52) to a predefined slipping speed when the current to the motor 54
falls below a first current threshold. In some embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to
adjust the target speed of the motor 54 (or of the track 52) or the maximum allowable target
speed of the motor 54 (or of the track 52) to the first speed when the current to the motor 54 is
greater than the first current threshold but falls below the second current threshold. In some
embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to adjust the target speed of the motor 54 (or of
the track 52) or the maximum allowable target speed of the motor 54 (or of the track 52) to the
second speed when the current to the motor 54 is greater than the second current threshold but
less than the third current threshold. In some embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to
decrease the speed of the motor 54 (or of the track 52) to zero or to a predefined value when the
current to the motor 54 is greater than the third current threshold.
[0046]    In some embodiments, the first current threshold, the second current threshold, and the
third current threshold are based on a slope of the stairs being traversed (among other factors).
                                                  -12-

The slope of the stairs may be determined from signals sent from sensors (e.g., such as the
sensors 156, 158, and/or 160 described herein in connection with FIGS. 9-10) to the controller
110.
[0047]     The controller 110 may be configured to adjust the speed of the motor 54 based on a
voltage of the battery. In one embodiment, the controller 110 is configured to set the speed of
the motor 54 to a predefined speed in response to the voltage of the battery falling below a
predefined voltage threshold.
[0048]     A method for operating the apparatus 10 may include decreasing a speed of the
apparatus 10 in response to detecting a slip between the track 52 and stairs. The slip may be
determined as being (i) a difference in a speed of the track 52 relative to the stairs and a speed of
the frame 21 or apparatus 10 relative to the stairs, or (ii) detected motion of the track 52 with an
absence of motion of the frame 21 relative to the stairs. In some embodiments, the "speed of the
track 52" refers to the linear speed of the track as it translates between the pulleys 57 (FIG. 5).
Decreasing the speed of the apparatus 10 may include decreasing a speed of the motor 54, the
motor 54 being configured to drive the track 52. A change in a distance to a landing measured
by a sensor of the apparatus 10 (e.g., such as sensor 158 or 160 as shown and described in
connection with FIG. 10) is indicative of the detected motion of the frame 21 relative to the
stairs. The method may include, in response to detecting slip, stopping motion of the track 52.
Stopping motion of the track may include applying a braking force imparted on the track 52
and/or stopping rotation of the motor 54 driving the track 52.
[0049]     In some embodiments, the slip is determined as being a difference between a first speed
of a first track 52 of the apparatus 10 and a second speed of a second track 52 of the apparatus 10
exceeding a predefined threshold. In such embodiments with more than one independently
driven tracks 52, decreasing the speed of the track 52 may include decreasing the first speed of
the first track when the first speed is greater than the second speed and decreasing the second
speed of the second track 52 when the second speed is greater than the first speed. In other
embodiments, the slip is determined as being a difference in a first current supplied to drive a
                                                  -13-

first track 52 of the apparatus 10 and a second current supplied to drive a second track 52 of the
apparatus 10 exceeding a predefined current threshold. In such embodiments, decreasing the
speed of the track 52 may include decreasing a first speed of the first track 52 when the first
current is less than the second current and decreasing a second speed of the second track 52
when the second current is less than the first current.
[0050]     In some embodiments, occupancy of the seat assembly 20 is determined based on an
acceleration of the apparatus 10. If the acceleration falls bellows a predefined threshold (e.g.,
due to an increased load on the seat assembly 20), then the controller 110 may designate the seat
assembly 20 as being occupied by a patient. If the acceleration exceeds the predefined threshold,
then the controller 110 may designate the seat assembly 20 as being unoccupied. As such, the
controller 110 may be configured to control or adjust a speed of the apparatus 10 (e.g., of the
motor 54) based on at least one of an occupancy of the seat assembly 20 or a condition of the
stairs (e.g., slope, transition between stairs and landing, surface material of the stairs), wherein
the occupancy is determined based on an acceleration of the apparatus 10 to achieve a target or
desired speed. In one embodiment, the controller is configured to decrease a target speed or
maximum allowable speed of the apparatus 10, or maintain a set speed of the apparatus 10 when
the acceleration falls below a predefined acceleration threshold. In one embodiment, the
controller 110 is configured to increase a target speed or maximum allowable speed of the
apparatus 10 when the acceleration reaches or exceeds the predefined acceleration threshold.
The controller may be configured to permit the apparatus 10 to operate at the desired speed (e.g.,
as inputted or requested by the operator) when the acceleration reaches or exceeds the predefined
acceleration threshold. The predefined acceleration threshold may be a fixed value or a dynamic
value based on a number of factors, such as e.g., a speed of the track or motor, the slope of the
stairs, the track angle, and other conditions of the stairs.
[0051]     In some embodiments, occupancy of the seat assembly 20 is an input from another
apparatus or system that is in communication (directly or indirectly) with the apparatus 10. In
such embodiments, the controller 110 receives an input from the other apparatus or system
indicative of the occupancy of the apparatus 10. The other apparatus or system in
                                                  -14-

communication with the apparatus 10 may be a base to which the apparatus selectively couples
(e.g., inside an ambulance) or a heart rate monitor. The controller 110 may be in communication
with the other device or system itself directly, or the controller 110 and the other device or
system may both be in communication with a remote server, wherein the controller 110 and other
device or system send and receive signals to and from the remote server.
[0052]     In some embodiments, the apparatus includes an RFID reader configured to send and
receive data from RFID tags. The RFID tags may be coupled to equipment such as defibrillators,
heartrate monitors, and airway bags, and/or to the patient device such as a wearable bracelet. In
such embodiments, occupancy of the seat assembly 20 may be determined based on the RFID
tags detected by the RFID reader. The RFID reader may be in communication with the
controller 110 such that the controller 110 receives signals from the RFID indicative of the
occupancy of the seat assembly 20 (e.g., whether the seat assembly 20 is occupied by equipment
or a patient). As described herein, there are several ways to determine the occupancy of the seat
assembly 20 to adjust the speed of the apparatus 10 accordingly.
[0053]     In some embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to control the motor and to
adjust a speed of the apparatus 10 based on occupancy of the seat assembly upon traversing the
stairs. The controller may be configured to adjust the speed of the apparatus by adjusting the
speed of the track. The controller may be configured to adjust the speed of the apparatus 10 or
track 52 by adjusting a motor speed of the motor 54, and the controller 110 may be configured to
command the motor in accordance with the speed of the apparatus by commanding the motor to
operate at the motor speed. The controller may be configured to decrease the speed of the
apparatus 10 when a patient occupies the seat assembly upon traversing the stairs. The controller
may be configured to increase the speed of the apparatus 10 when the seat assembly is
unoccupied by a patient upon traversing the stairs. The controller may be configured to adjust
the speed of the apparatus 10 to a first speed value when a patient occupies the seat assembly 20
and to a second speed value when the seat assembly is unoccupied by the patient. The first speed
value may be less than the second speed value. The first speed value may be less than or equal
to about 1 km/h. The second speed value may be less than or equal to about 3 km/h.
                                                 -15-

[0054]     The patient transfer apparatus 10 may include a sensor 154 (FIG. 2) configured to
measure movement of the track 52. In some embodiments, multiple sensors 154 are used (e.g.,
when multiple tracks 52 are used). The sensor 154 is operatively coupled to the controller 110.
In some embodiments, the sensor 154 is a sensor that measures or detects rotation (e.g., an
encoder). Referring to FIG. 2 as an example, the sensor 154 is rotatably coupled to the pulley 57
such that it detects the rotation of the pulley 57. In other embodiments, the sensor 154 is
incorporated into the gearbox 62 or the motor 54. In yet other embodiments, the sensor 154 is
incorporated into the track assembly 50 in a location such that a tangent point on the rotating
portion of the sensor 154 contacts and moves with a surface of the track 52. In some
embodiments, the controller 110 uses data from the sensor 154 to determine the displacement
(e.g., rotational displacement, linear displacement) of the track 52. In some embodiments, the
controller 110 uses data from the sensor 154 to determine the speed (e.g., linear speed) of the
track 52.
[0055]     The patient transfer apparatus 10 may include a sensor 156 configured to be used by the
controller 110 to determine the angle 84 at which the track is positioned. In some embodiments,
multiple sensors 156 are used. The sensor 156 is operatively coupled to the controller 110. In
some embodiments, the sensor 156 is a sensor that measures the angular position of the sensor
relative to the direction of gravity (e.g., an accelerometer). In some embodiments, the sensor 156
directly measures the track angle 84. In other embodiments, the sensor 156 measures a value
other than the track angle 84, which is then used to calculate the track angle 84. By way of
example, the sensor 156 measures the angular position of part of the patient transfer apparatus
(e.g., the track assembly 50) relative to the direction of gravity, and the angular position of this
part relative to the track angle 84 is known (e.g., 15 degrees off) due to a physical constraint
(e.g., while traversing the set of stairs, the track 52 runs parallel to the direction of travel). A
constant is then added to the measured value in order to obtain the actual track angle 84. By way
of another example, an accelerometer is used to detect the direction of gravity, and the
accelerometer is then used to measure the direction of travel of the patient transfer apparatus 10.
These values are then used to determine the track angle 84. FIG. 1 shows the sensor 156 coupled
                                                   -16-

to the track assembly 50. In other embodiments, the sensor 156 is coupled to the frame 21 or
another part of the patient transfer apparatus 10. Coupling the sensor 156 directly to the track
assembly 50 allows the sensor 156 to provide a direct indication of the track angle 84 when
traversing the set of stairs. The sensor 156 may be a track angle sensor configured to send a
signal to the controller 110 indicative of the track angle 84. The controller 110 may be
configured to receive the signal and determine the slope 86 based on the signal.
[0056]    The patient transfer apparatus 10 may include a sensor 158 configured to measure the
distance from the sensor 158 to a surface or object. In some embodiments, multiple sensors 158
are used. The sensor 158 is operatively coupled to the controller 110. In FIG. 1, the sensor 158
is coupled to the lower end portion of the track assembly 50. In other embodiments, the sensor
158 is located elsewhere on the patient transfer apparatus 10. The sensor may be selected from
any type of distance or proximity sensor (e.g., an ultrasonic sensor, a photoelectric sensor, a
camera, etc.). By way of example, the sensor 158 is used to detect the distance from the sensor
158 to a surface (e.g., a riser portion of a stair, a tread portion of a stair, or a landing of a set of
stairs). The controller 110 can use this distance to determine if the sensor 158 and, thus, the
patient transfer apparatus 10 are moving relative to the surface and/or to determine the speed at
which the patient transfer apparatus 10 is moving relative to the surface.
[0057]    The patient transfer apparatus may include a sensor 160 configured to detect the
proximity of a nearby surface or object to the point of the apparatus 10 on which the sensor 160
is mounted. The sensor 160 is shown in FIG. 3 as being coupled near the rear end of the track
assembly 50, but in other embodiments the sensor 160 is located elsewhere depending on the
point of interest. In some embodiments, the sensor 160 is a type of sensor that can measure
distance (e.g., an ultrasonic sensor, a photoelectric sensor, a camera, etc.), similar to sensor 158.
The sensor 160 may be configured to send a signal indicative of the proximity when the sensor
160 detects that the surface or object is within a certain distance of the sensor 160 (e.g., within
15 centimeters, within 30 centimeters, within 3 centimeters, etc.). In other embodiments, the
sensor 160 uses a type of sensor that can only detect very close proximity (e.g., a limit switch).
In yet other embodiments, the sensor 160 detects if an object or surface is within a line of sight
                                                    -17-

162 of the sensor 160. As shown in FIG. 10, the stairs break the line of sight 162 until the track
assembly 50 reaches the landing at the top of the stairs. Using this, the sensor 160 can indicate
when the part of the apparatus 10 holding the sensor passes a certain point, such as to provide an
indication of an approaching transition between the set of stairs and a platform or landing. This
type of sensor may also incorporate a similar type of sensor to sensor 158. The landing may be a
bottom landing or a top landing and be adjacent an end of the stairs. In some embodiments, the
landing may be substantially horizontal and/or generally level with the ground. The transition
between the stairs and landing may be a position in which the landing and stairs meet.
[0058]     In some embodiments, the control system 100 includes an operator interface, such as
the operator interface 180 shown in FIG. 11, which is operatively coupled to the controller 110.
In some embodiments, the operator interface 180 includes a direction selector 182. The direction
selector 182 allows the operator to communicate to the controller 110 whether to stop the track
52 or run the track 52 forward or backward. By way of example, the direction selector 182
includes a three-position switch where each position corresponds to one of the track 52 moving
forward, moving backward, and not moving. In other embodiments, the direction selector 182
includes different ways of selecting the direction (one or more buttons, a knob with multiple
positions, etc.)
[0059]     In some embodiments, the operator interface 180 is configured to receive an input from
the operator indicative of a desired speed of the apparatus 10. The controller 110 may be
configured to receive the input from the operator interface 180 and operate the motor 54 based
on the desired speed. the operator interface 180 includes a speed selector 184. The speed
selector 184 allows the operator to communicate to the controller a desired speed of the
apparatus 10 (e.g., a potentiometer, one or more buttons (tactile, capacitive, resistive, etc.), a
sliding lever, a load cell, a pressure sensor, etc.). In some embodiments, the desired speed is not
an absolute speed (e.g., 6 kilometers per hour) and instead is a portion of the maximum speed
(e.g., half speed, quarter speed, etc.). In other embodiments, the desired speed can be quantified
(e.g., 6 kilometers per hour). By way of example, the speed selector 184 includes a series of
buttons, and the speed can be adjusted faster or slower by pressing a certain button multiple
                                                   -18-

times or by holding a certain button down for differing periods of time. By way of another
example, the speed selector may be a force-based handle sensor (or force sensor) for determining
a force applied on a handle of the apparatus. The force sensor may be configured to sense a
force applied by the operator, the force corresponding to an input from the operator indicative of
the desired speed of the apparatus 10. In some embodiments, the force-based handle sensor is a
load cell, a pressure sensor, or a potentiometer. In one embodiment, the force sensor is operably
coupled to a handle 32. For example, a load cell is included in the top handle 32 such that the
force of the operator on the top handle 32 can be measured by the load cell. A tensile force on
the top handle 32 causes the track 52 to move one direction, a compressive force causes the track
52 to move in another direction, and the magnitude of the force determines the desired speed of
the apparatus 10. In some embodiments, the speed selector 184 includes the capabilities of the
direction selector 182. In some embodiments, the operator interface 180 includes either the
direction selector 182 or the speed selector 184. In other embodiments, the operator interface
180 includes both the direction selector 182 and the speed selector 184.
[0060]    In order for the patient transfer apparatus 10 to traverse the set of stairs efficiently and
safely, in some embodiments, the information from the load indicator 152 is received by the
controller 110 and used by the controller 110 to determine the target speed of the apparatus 10.
In situations where the patient transfer apparatus 10 is not supporting a patient (e.g., the operator
is bringing the apparatus 10 from a vehicle to the patient), the patient transfer apparatus
optimally traverses the set of stairs quickly because the safety of the patient is not at risk.
Moving more quickly in this situation will allow the operator to get to his or her destination in
less time than with a fixed-speed patient transfer apparatus, which may be critical in time
sensitive situations (e.g., an emergency response). When the apparatus 10 is supporting a
patient, however, moving more slowly gives the operator a greater amount of control and ensures
the safety and comfort of both the operator and the patient.
[0061]    FIG. 12 illustrates a method 200 for operating a patient transport apparatus. The
method 200 should not be construed as limited to the configuration as illustrated in FIG. 12, but
should include variations where some of the steps may be rearranged and/or removed. The
                                                 -19-

method 200 may be implemented using software code that may be programmed into the
controller 110 (FIG. 9). In other embodiments, the method 200 may be programmed into other
controllers, or distributed among multiple controllers. In step 202, an operator input is received
by the controller 110. The operator input may be a command to start movement of the apparatus
10, a desired direction (e.g., from the direction selector 182) and/or a desired speed (e.g., from
the speed selector 184). In some embodiments as a safety mechanism, if no input is received,
then the controller 110 proceeds to step 203 and stops any movement of the motor 54. If an
input is received, the controller 110 proceeds to step 204 where the controller processes the
input. In some embodiments, this determines the desired direction and/or speed of movement of
the apparatus 10. In step 206, the controller 110 determines if the input indicated a desired
movement of the apparatus 10. If no movement is desired, then the controller 110 proceeds to
step 203 and stops track motion or stops driving the track (e.g., stop the movement of the motor).
If movement is desired, the controller 110 proceeds to step 208.
[0062]     In some embodiments, in step 208, the controller 110 receives information from the
load indicator 152 indicating if a patient or object is present on the seat assembly 20. If the
controller 110 determines that a patient or object is present in step 210, then the controller 110
sets the speed of the apparatus 10 to a first target speed in step 212. If the controller determines
that no patient or object is present in step 210, the controller 110 sets the speed of the apparatus
10 to a second target speed in step 214. Where there is no operator input of a desired speed, the
track speed is set to the pre-determined target speed. By way of example, if the sensor 152a
detects a patient or object, then the first target speed is selected. If the sensor 152a does not
detect a patient or object, then the second target speed is selected. In the illustrated embodiment,
the first target speed is slower than the second target speed. In other embodiments, the first
target speed is faster than the second target speed. The direction selector 182 may be used by the
operator to indicate desired movement of the patient transfer apparatus 10 and the direction in
which it will move. The controller 110 uses the selected target speed and the information from
the direction selector 182 to determine what target speed to select for the track 52. When an
operator input related to the desired speed is received by the controller 110, instead of selecting a
                                                   -20-

predefined target speed value in steps 212 and 214, the controller 110 may select a first speed
range or a second speed range. The speed range is defined by a maximum allowable target speed
and a minimum allowable target speed. In some embodiments, the minimum allowable target
speed is zero. The desired speed from the speed selector 184 is used to determine a selected
target speed within the speed ranges. In some embodiments, the desired speed is not an absolute
speed (e.g., 6 kilometers per hour) but is instead a portion of the maximum speed (e.g., half
speed, quarter speed, etc.).
[0063]    In some embodiments, the controller 110 operates the motor 54 at the target speed for a
set period of time (e.g., 0.1 second, etc.) and returns to step 202. In some embodiments, at step
210, the controller 110 further differentiates between an inanimate object placed on the seat
assembly 20 (e.g., equipment used by the operator) and a patient. In some embodiments, the
controller 110 treats the inanimate object situation the same as if there were no object present
and sets the speed of the apparatus 10 to the second target speed in step 214. In other
embodiments, the controller 110 sets the speed of the apparatus 10 to an intermediate target
speed in this case, the intermediate target speed value being between the first and second target
speed values.
 [0064]    In steps 212 and 214, the controller 110 controls the motor 54 to cause the track 52 to
operate at the selected target speed. By way of example, the sensor 152a detects a patient or
object in step 208, which causes the controller 110 to determine that a patient or object is present
in step 210 and to select a predefined low maximum allowable target speed in step 212. In some
embodiments, the low maximum allowable target speed is about 1 km/h. By way of another
example, the sensor 152a does not detect a patient or object in step 208, which causes the
controller 110 to determine that a patient or object is not present in step 210 and to select a
predefined high maximum allowable target speed in step 212. In some embodiments, the high
maximum allowable target speed is about 3 km/h. The low maximum allowable target speed is
lower than the high maximum allowable target speed. After determining the maximum
allowable target speed, the desired speed is used to determine the selected target speed between
the minimum allowable target speed and the maximum allowable target speed. In some
                                                  -21-

embodiments, the speed selector 184 operates proportionally within the speed range (i.e., a 25%
setting on the speed selector 184 corresponds to 25% of the maximum speed). In other
embodiments, it operates along a different curve between the two speeds (e.g., a parabolic curve,
etc.). The controller 110 may be configured to compare the desired speed (as inputted from the
operator) to the maximum allowable speed to determine at which speed to move the apparatus
10. In some embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to operate the motor 54 such that the
apparatus 10 moves at the maximum allowable speed when the desired speed is less than the
maximum allowable speed (i.e., the controller 100 will not permit the apparatus to move at a
speed exceeding the maximum allowable speed, even if the operator desired to do so), and the
controller 110 is configured to operate the motor 52 such that the apparatus 10 moves at the
desired speed when the desired speed is less than or equal to the maximum allowable speed (i.e.,
the controller 110 permits the apparatus 10 to move at the desired speed when it falls below the
maximum allowable speed).
[0065]    FIG. 13 illustrates a method 300 for operating a patient transport apparatus. The
method 300 should not be construed as limited to the configuration as illustrated in FIG. 13, but
should include variations where some of the steps may be rearranged and/or removed. The
method 300 may be implemented using software code that may be programmed into the
controller 110 (FIG. 9). In other embodiments, the method 300 is programmed into other
controllers, or distributed among multiple controllers. In step 302, an operator input is received
by the controller 110. The operator input may be a command to start movement, a desired
direction (e.g., from the direction selector 182) or a desired speed (e.g., from the speed selector
184). In some embodiments as a safety mechanism, if no input is received, then the controller
110 proceeds to step 303 and stops the movement of the motor 54. If an input is received, the
controller 110 proceeds to step 304 where the controller processes the input. In step 306, the
controller 110 determines if the input indicated a desired movement (i.e., the desired direction of
motion may be determined based on operator input). If no movement is desired, then the
controller 110 proceeds to step 303 and stops track motion (e.g., stop the movement of the
motor). If movement is desired, the controller 110 proceeds to step 308 where the controller 110
                                                 -22-

uses the input to determine the desired direction of motion. In step 310, the controller 110
determines if the desired direction of motion is upstairs or downstairs.
[0066]    When ascending the stairs, the controller 110 begins moving the motor 54 slowly in
step 312. In some embodiments, the sensor 160 (FIG. 1) detects the proximity to the bottom of
the set of stairs before starting the motor 54. Alternatively, the sensor 156 (FIG. 1) is used to
detect that the track has been tilted back to meet the stairs, and the controller 110 starts moving
the track 52 slowly. In yet another embodiment, the controller 110 moves the track 52 slowly
without input from a sensor.
[0067]    In step 314, the controller 110 determines if the apparatus 10 has transitioned from the
landing at the bottom of the set of stairs to the stairs. This may be accomplished by using the
sensor 158 (FIG. 10) to detect the distance from the sensor 158 to the landing at the bottom of
the set of stairs. Because the landing is fixed relative to the stairs, this allows the controller 110
to determine if the patient transfer apparatus is moving relative to the stairs. In other
embodiments, the sensor 158 detects the distance from the sensor 158 (or another reference
point) to a different surface (e.g., one of the stairs, the landing at the top of the stairs, etc.). If
this distance has increased past a certain threshold, then the apparatus has transitioned onto the
stairs. As such, the sensor 158 functions as a transition sensor configured to sense the transition
and send a signal to the controller 110 indicative of the sensed transition. The transition sensor,
which may be sensor 158, may be a proximity sensor such that the signal sent to the controller
110 corresponds to a distance measured by the sensor 158.
[0068]    Additionally, because the actual speed of the track 52 can be determined using sensor
154, the speed at which the patient transfer apparatus 10 is moving relative to the stairs can be
compared to the actual speed of the track 52 to determine if the track 52 is slipping relative to the
stairs. The speed of the apparatus 10 may be detected by sensor 156. If the speed of the track 52
differs from the speed of the apparatus 10, then the track 52 is slipping. In other embodiments,
slipping is detected by determining if the apparatus 10 is moving rather than by comparing
speeds. The controller 110 determines if the track 52 is moving either by measuring the track
                                                   -23-

movement using sensor 154 or by determining whether the current supplied to the motor 54 is
lower than expected, as determined by the controller for example. The controller 110 then
checks to see if the distance from the sensor 158 to the surface is changing. If the distance from
the sensor 158 to the surface is not changing and the track 52 is moving, the track 52 may be
slipping. If slipping is detected, the controller can slow the speed of the track 52 until slipping is
no longer detected. In some embodiments, the controller 110 stops the track 52 completely when
slipping is detected. Preventing slipping prevents damage to the stairs and premature wear on
the track 52.
[0069]     Once the controller 110 has determined that the apparatus 10 is moving up the set of
stairs, the target speed of the apparatus 10 is brought to a desired level in step 316 to climb the
set of stairs. In some embodiments, the speed at this point is adjustable by the operator using the
speed selector 184 or is set by the controller alone, in a process similar to the one illustrated in
FIG. 12. The controller 110 may be configured to adjust the speed of the apparatus 10 based on
the transition between the stairs and the landing. The speed in step 316 also takes into account
other factors, as described below.
[0070]     In some embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus 10 uses the sensor 154 (FIG. 2) to
measure the movement of the track 52 and sends a signal carrying this information to the
controller 110 (FIG. 9). This information can be used by the controller 110 in step 316 to
determine the rotational position of the pulley 57 and speed of the track 52 at any given time. If
the track 52 does not slip relative to the set of stairs, the track speed can be used to determine the
speed of the patient transfer apparatus 10 when traversing the set of stairs. The controller can
maintain the target speed in step 220 by comparing feedback received from the sensor 154
regarding the speed of the track 52 to the target speed and adjusting the output (e.g., speed) of
the motor 54 accordingly. This may be accomplished using a variety of previously described
closed-loop controls techniques.
[0071]     In some embodiments, the controller 110 implements feed-forward control that uses
information about upcoming disturbances to adjust the output of the motor 54 before they are
                                                  -24-

experienced by the system. By way of example, when climbing the set of stairs, some patient
transfer apparatuses experience variations in speed when the number of stairs contacted by the
track 52 changes. When those patient transfer apparatuses have a track that is only slightly
longer than the distance between two stairs, the apparatuses experience a speed fluctuation
between each stair. With the feed-forward control implemented in the patient transfer apparatus
10, the sensor 160 (FIG. 10) may be used to determine when a stair is upcoming and vary the
output of the motor 54 in order to prevent a predicted change in speed.
[0072]    In some embodiments, the sensor 152a (FIG. 1) is used to measure the mass of the
patient or object supported by the patient transfer apparatus 10 in step 316. The greater the mass
of the patient or object, the greater is the force required to move the patient transfer apparatus 10
up the set of stairs at the desired speed. Knowing this, the loss in speed can be predicted based
on the measured mass. In order to avoid a drop in speed of the apparatus 10 when supporting a
heavy load, the controller 110 can vary the motor output (e.g., apply a greater voltage to the
motor 54, etc.) in step 316 to compensate for the predicted reduction of speed.
[0073]    A method of operating a patient transfer apparatus 10 configured to traverse stairs, may
include, in response to a predicted reduction in speed of the apparatus 10 during an ascent of the
stairs, adjusting an output of a motor 54 of the apparatus 10 prior to the predicted reduction in
speed to maintain the speed of the assembly 10 during the ascent. The method may also include
determining the predicted reduction in speed of the apparatus 10. The predicted reduction in
speed may be based on (i) a mass of an object or patient supported by the apparatus 10, (ii) a
length of the track 52 relative to a distance between edges of adjacent stairs, (iii) an approaching
transition from a landing to the stairs, and/or (iv) a slope 86 of the stairs. In one embodiment,
adjusting the output of the motor 54 includes adjusting a voltage to the motor 54.
[0074]    In some embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus 10 uses the sensor 156 (FIG. 1) to
measure the track angle 84 (FIG. 6) in step 316 and sends a signal carrying this information to
the controller 110. In some embodiments, this information is used by the controller in step 316
to change the target speed and/or range thresholds (minimum and maximum) of the track 52. A
                                                   -25-

smaller track angle 84 indicates a steeper set of stairs, and when descending a steep set of stairs,
it may be safer to travel more slowly. This method of determining the target speed may be used
in concert with the determination of the target speed using the sensor 152a (FIG. 1). By way of
example, the target speed of the apparatus 10 determined using the sensor 152a can be multiplied
by a factor determined using the measured track angle 84 in order to determine a final target
speed. This target speed can then be maintained using the feedback from the sensor 154 as
described above. Moving the apparatus 10 up a steeper set of stairs requires more power for a
given patient or object mass. In embodiments that maintain speed using feedback from sensor
154, the motor output automatically compensates for the increased load in steps 218 and 220. In
other embodiments without the sensor 154, the track angle 84 measured by the sensor 156 can be
used to determine how to vary the motor output in order to maintain a target speed. When
climbing a set of stairs, if a decrease in track angle 84 is detected, the motor output can be varied
(e.g., more voltage can be applied to the motor 54) to compensate for the increased load.
[0075]     In some embodiments, the controller 110 is configured to adjust or maintain a speed of
the apparatus 10 based on the slope 86 of the stairs. The controller 110 may be configured to, in
response to the slope 86 of the stairs being less than a predefined slope threshold, maintain the
speed of the apparatus 10 by adjusting an output of the motor 54 when ascending the stairs. The
controller 110 may be configured to determine a slope factor based on the slope 86 of the stairs,
and adjust the speed of the apparatus 10 by multiplying the speed by the slope factor to
determine a final target speed and operate the motor 54 in accordance with the final target speed.
Optionally, the controller 110 may be configured to, in response to the slope 86 of the stairs
being less than a predefined slope threshold, decrease the speed of the apparatus 10 when
descending the stairs.
[0076]     In step 318, the sensor 160 (FIG. 10) may be used to determine the proximity to the set
of stairs, and when the sensor 160 no longer detects any stairs in close proximity, the apparatus
10 has reached the top landing. As the apparatus 10 transitions onto the top landing, the center
of gravity of the apparatus 10 and patient or object will no longer be above the stairs and the load
will not be fully supported by the track 52 on the stairs. Instead, the operator may have to
                                                  -26-

support the mass of the apparatus 10 and the patient or object. To minimize the amount of time
the operator has to support the weight, when the sensor 160 detects that the apparatus is
approaching the top landing, in step 320 the target speed of the apparatus 10 is increased. Once
the apparatus 10 is determined to be fully supported by the landing in step 322, the operator may
turn off the movement of the track 52 using the operator interface 180 in step 324. Alternatively,
the sensor 156 is used to detect the change in track angle 84, and the controller 110 stops the
motion of the track 52 automatically (e.g., when the change in track angles exceeds a predefined
threshold). As such, the sensors 156 and 160 function as transition sensors configured to sense
the transition and send a signal to the controller 110 indicative of the sensed transition. The
transition sensor, which may be sensor 160, may be a proximity sensor such that the signal sent
to the controller 110 corresponds to a distance measured by the sensor 160.
[0077]     Referring back to step 310, the apparatus 10 may instead be used to travel down the
stairs. When descending the stairs, the controller 110 starts the track 52 moving quickly to
reduce the amount of time during which the operator has to support the load before it comes into
contact with the stair until the sensor 160 detects the top stair. In step 328, the sensor 160 is used
to determine the proximity of a stair to a point near the top end of the track assembly 50. Once a
stair is detected, the apparatus 10 is supported by the set of stairs, and in step 330 the controller
110 sets the target speed of the apparatus 10 to descend the set of stairs. In exemplary
embodiments, the aforementioned methods implemented in step 316 for determining, setting, and
controlling the speed of the apparatus 10 while ascending the stairs may also be used in step 330
while descending the stairs. In step 332, the sensor 158 is used to determine the proximity to the
bottom landing. Once the bottom landing is within a certain distance (e.g., within 0.5m, within
Im, etc.), in step 334 the controller 110 slows the target speed of the apparatus 10 to smooth the
transition from the set of stairs to the landing. As such, the controller 110 may be configured to
decrease the speed of the apparatus 10 when the landing is a bottom landing. Once the apparatus
10 is determined to be fully supported by the landing in step 336, the operator may stop the
movement of the track 52 in step 338 using the operator interface 180. Alternatively, the sensor
                                                  -27-

156 is used to detect the change in track angle 84, and the controller 110 stops the motion of the
track 52 automatically.
[0078]    Additionally, in some embodiments, the sensor 158 is used to detect an object located in
the vicinity or path of the apparatus 10. By way of example, the sensor 160 is located near the
front of the apparatus 10 where an operator's field of view is occluded. The sensor 160 is used
to detect the presence of an object or obstacle (e.g., a bump in the floor, an object obstructing the
path, a gap in the floor, etc.) and alert the operator (e.g., by means of a speaker or a light
operatively coupled to the control system 100) and/or stop the track movement. In some
embodiments, this is accomplished using the same sensor 160 used to detect stairs or landings.
In other embodiments, different sensors are used. A method of operating a patient transfer
apparatus 10 may include, in response to a detected obstacle in a vicinity of the apparatus 10,
transmit an alert to the operator of the apparatus 10 or stop motion of a motorized track 52 of the
apparatus 10. The method may also include, detecting the obstacle by receiving a signal from
the sensor 160 coupled to the apparatus 10, the signal being indicative of a presence of the
obstacle in the vicinity of the apparatus. In one embodiment, the vicinity is in front of the
apparatus 10.
[0079]    In some embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus 10 includes a brake for braking the
track 52. Adding a brake allows the operator to have more control of the apparatus 10 when
moving down the set of stairs and requires less force from the user to prevent the apparatus 10
from moving too quickly down the set of stairs. When moving up the stairs, however, it is
advantageous to have as little resistance as possible on the track 52 to minimize the force and
energy necessary to move the apparatus 10 up the set of stairs. This also allows the empty
patient transfer apparatus 10 to be pulled up the stairs instead of being carried. Some
embodiments include a brake that operates to slow the track 52 when traveling down the set of
stairs but does not affect the track 52 when moving up the set of stairs. FIG. 14 shows the
patient transfer apparatus 10 according to an exemplary embodiment. The track assembly 50 in
this embodiment includes two tracks 52 but omits any motors or gearboxes. Instead, it only
includes a mechanical braking system.
                                                  -28-

[0080]     In some embodiments, the speed of the apparatus 10 is adjusted mechanically without
requiring electrical power. Occupancy of the seat assembly 20 by a patient may change
movement of the track 52 such that movement of the track 52 is uninhibited with the apparatus
moving at a first speed when the seat assembly 20 is occupied by a patient upon traversing the
stairs, and inhibited with the apparatus moving at a second speed less than the first speed when
the seat assembly 20 is unoccupied by the patient upon traversing the stairs. In one embodiment,
the speed of the apparatus 10 is adjusted by adjusting a tension in the track 52 through use of a
tensioner that is operably coupled to the track 52. The tension in the track 52 may be adjusted
via commands or signals from the controller 110 or mechanically without the controller 110. By
way of example, the weight or load of a patient on the seat assembly 20 acts to mechanically
adjust the tensioner such that track 52 is under increased tension. In one embodiment, the
tensioner causes the track 52 to be at a first tension corresponding to movement of the track 52 at
the first speed when the seat assembly 20 is supporting a first load upon traversing the stairs, and
at a second tension greater than the first tension and corresponding to the second speed when the
seat assembly 20 is supporting a second load, the second speed being less than the first speed. In
some embodiments, the speed of the apparatus 10 is adjusted by use of a gear assembly (e.g.,
including gear box 62 in FIG. 5). The gear assembly may be operably coupled to and selectively
engageable with the track assembly 50. The controller 110 may be configured to adjust the
speed of the apparatus 10 by adjusting a gear ratio of the gear assembly. In another embodiment,
the gear assembly engages or disengages with the track assembly 50 upon occupancy of a patient
on the seat assembly 20. In one embodiment, one of engagement of and disengagement of the
gear assembly with the track assembly 50 causes the track 52 to move at the first speed, and the
other of engagement and disengagement of the gear assembly with the track assembly causes the
track to move at the second speed. In one embodiment, the gear assembly includes the gearbox
62 (FIG. 5).
[0081]     The methods described herein may include controlling the motor 54 of the track
assembly 50 of the apparatus 10 and adjusting the speed of the moveable track 52 of the track
assembly 50 based on an occupancy of the seat assembly 20 upon traversing the stairs, the track
                                                  -29-

being configured to traverse the stairs. The methods described herein may also include operating
the motor 54 in accordance with the speed of the apparatus 10, decreasing the speed of the
apparatus 10 when a patient occupies the seat assembly 20, and receiving a signal from an
occupancy indicator (such as load indicator 152, for example) indicative of the occupancy of the
seat assembly 20. Adjusting the speed of the apparatus 10 may include adjusting the speed to a
first speed value when a patient occupies the seat assembly 20 and to a second speed value when
the seat assembly is unoccupied by the patient. The methods described herein may also include
receiving an input from an operator interface 180 indicative of a desired speed of the apparatus
10 and operating the motor 54 based on the desired speed. In some embodiments, the speed is a
maximum allowable speed, and operating the motor 54 based on the desired speed includes
operating the motor 54 in accordance with the maximum allowable speed when the desired speed
is greater than the maximum allowable speed and operating the motor 54 in accordance with the
desired speed when the desired speed is less than or equal to the maximum allowable speed. The
methods described herein may include adjusting the speed of the apparatus 10 based on a
transition between the stairs and a landing. Adjusting the speed of the apparatus 10 may include
decreasing the speed of the apparatus 10 when the landing is a bottom landing. The methods
described herein may also include receiving a signal indicative of the transition from a transition
sensor (such as sensors 158, 154, 160, for example) that is configured to sense the transition.
[0082]    In some embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus shown in FIG. 14 includes a brake.
Brake 400, shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, includes a bi-directional rotary damper 402 coupled to
one of the pulleys 57 of the track assembly 50. An axle 404 runs through the damper 402, the
pulley 57, and a ratcheting mechanism 406. The axle 404 is concentric with the pulley 57. The
axle 404 rotationally locks the interior surface 403 of the damper 402 and the interior surface 407
of the ratcheting mechanism 406 together. The ratcheting mechanism 406 is coupled to the track
support 56 such that only the interior surface 407 can rotate. When the apparatus 10 moves up a
set of stairs, the track 52 rotates the pulley 57, which rotates the axle 404, and the ratcheting
mechanism allows the axle 404 to rotate freely, minimizing the braking force on the track 52.
When the apparatus 10 moves down a set of stairs, the track 52 rotates the pulley 57, which
                                                   -30-

attempts to rotate the axle 404, and the ratcheting mechanism 406 does not allow the axle 404 to
rotate, which causes the damper 402 to impart a braking force on the track 52. In order to
minimize uncontrolled friction on the track 52, the friction between the track 52 and the track
support 56 may be minimized.
[0083]     In other embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus 10 shown in FIG. 14 includes a
brake 500. The brake 500, shown in FIG. 17, includes a uni-directional damper 502 and an axle
504. The axle 504 runs concentrically through one of the pulleys 57 of the track assembly 50
and the damper 502. The damper 502 is coupled to the track support 56 such that the only part
of the damper 502 that can rotate is an interior surface 503. The axle 504 rotationally locks the
interior surface 503 of the damper 502 to the pulley 57. When the apparatus 10 moves up the set
of stairs, the damper 502 allows the axle 504 to move freely, minimizing the braking force on the
track 52. When the apparatus 10 moves down the set of stairs, the damper 502 imparts a braking
force on the axle, which brakes the track 52. In order to minimize uncontrolled friction on the
track 52, the friction between the track 52 and the track support 56 may be minimized.
[0084]     FIG. 18 is a fragmentary side view of a brake 506 of the patient transfer apparatus 10,
according to an exemplary embodiment. FIG. 19 is a cross-sectional view of the brake 506 of
FIG. 18 taken along line 19-19. The brake 506 includes a unidirectional damper assembly 507
with a damper 508, an axle 510, a cover plate 512, and a one-way bearing 514. The damper
assembly 507 is configured such that the damper assembly 507 slows rotation of the axle 510 in
one direction and permits the axle 510 to rotate freely in the opposite direction. The axle 510
may be fixedly coupled to the pulley 57 such that the pulley 57 and axle 510 rotate together. The
axle 510 may extend into a central bore of the pulley 57. The braking force imparted by the
damper assembly 507 on the axle 510 causes rotation of the pulley 57 (and movement of the
track 52 shown in FIG. 14, for example) to slow down. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG.
19, the damper 508 is seated within a housing 515 of the track assembly 50, the housing 515
itself being seated within a central cavity of the pulley 57. Roller bearings 516 may be provided
between the housing 515 and pulley 57 to permit the pulley 57 to rotate relative to the housing
515, which may be fixedly coupled to the track support 56. If the apparatus 10 includes a motor
                                                 -31-

54 (shown in FIG. 5, for example), the motor 54 may drive rotation of the axle 510 directly or
indirectly via the track 52. For example and without limitation, the motor 54 may drive the other
pulley 57 of the track assembly 50 (not shown in FIG. 18).
[0085]    The one-way bearing 514 may be fixedly coupled to the axle 510 such that the axle 510
and one-way bearing 514 rotate together. As the axle 510 rotates in a direction corresponding to
the apparatus 10 traveling down the stairs, the one-way bearing 514 engages the damper 508
creating a braking force that is imparted on the axle 510. The one-way bearing 514 may be
configured to engage the damper 508 and create the braking force upon movement of the track
52 in the descending direction, and to not engage the damper 508 upon movement of the track 52
in the ascending direction. In one embodiment, an inner race of the one-way bearing 514, which
is fixedly coupled to the axle 510, rotates relative to an outer race of the one-way bearing 514
when the inner race rotates in one direction corresponding to ascending the stairs, and the inner
race becomes fixedly coupled with the outer race (by outward radial movement of rollers
disposed between the inner and outer races) such that the outer race rotates with the inner race
(and axle 510). Because the outer race is in contact with the damper 508, the rotation of the
outer race is slowed down by the braking force imparted by the damper 508 onto the outer race
of the one-way bearing 514. As such, the bearing 514 may be configured like a clutch or one
way needle bearing such that the damper 508 affects rotation of the axle 510 in only one
direction. The one-way bearing 508 may be configured such that the inner race can only rotate
relative to the outer race in one direction. Therefore, the braking force from the damper 508 may
only be imparted to the axle 510 and pulley 57 in one direction corresponding to descending the
stairs.
[0086]    The damper 508 may include two halves, each half having maze-like channels 520
formed therein through which a damper grease may reside. The two halves 508 may be nested
together as illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, an inner surface of one of the halves 508 is
in contact with an outer surface of the one-way bearing 508. Upon rotation of the one-way
bearing 508 that causes rotation of the outer surface, the half 508 in contact with the one-way
bearing 508 turns with the bearing 508 causing torsion on both halves 508. The torsion causes
                                                  -32-

the braking force imparted on the axle 510. The grease may be a damper grease with a viscosity
selected for the particular application.
[0087]    In other embodiments, the patient transfer apparatus 10 shown in FIG. 14 includes a
brake 600. Brake 600, shown in FIG. 20, includes a set of high friction pads 602 built into the
track assembly 50. The friction pads 602 may be coupled to the track support 56 and configured
to selectively apply the braking force when moving in the descending direction. The pads 602
can be selectively extended from the surface of the track support 56 such that they engage the
interior surface of the track 52. In some embodiments, the pads 602 are extended manually (e.g.,
by moving a lever into position). In other embodiments, the pads are biased (e.g., by springs) to
be retracted into the track support 56 and can translate a short distance on an angled surface of
the track support 56. When the apparatus 10 ascends the set of stairs, the pads 602 stay retracted
and allow the track 52 to move with minimal braking force. When the apparatus 10 descends the
set of stairs, the pads 602 catch on the back surface of the track 52 and are pulled against the
angled surface of the track support 56, forcing the pads 602 to extend into the back of the track
52 and impart a braking force. As such, the brake force may be a frictional force applied to the
interior surface of the track 52 opposite an exterior surface configured to engage the stairs. In
order to minimize uncontrolled friction on the track 52, the friction between the track 52 and the
track support 56 may be minimized.
[0088]    In embodiments having a motor 54, the brake may be the motor 54 and be used to
impart a braking force on the track 52. The motor 54 may be operably coupled to the track 52 to
drive the track 52. In some embodiments, the motor 54 is used normally to climb the set of
stairs. When descending, however, the terminals of the motor are electrically coupled. Unless
the track 52 is slipping relative to the motor 54 or the stairs, while the apparatus 10 is traveling
down the set of stairs, the force of gravity on the apparatus 10 causes the track to be driven,
which in turn drives the motor 54. Driving the motor in this way generates energy, which is then
dissipated due to the coupling of the motor leads. The motor 54 may be selected based on a
desired braking force. This dissipation of energy imparts a braking force on the motor 54, which
                                                  -33-

in turn imparts a braking force on the track 52. Therefore, the motor 54 may be configured to
apply the braking force when moving in the descending direction.
[0089]     In some embodiments, when the apparatus 10 is descending a set of stairs, the motor 54
is driven in the reverse direction of the intended motion. The controller 110 may be configured
to operate the motor 54 in the reverse direction when descending the stairs such that the motor 54
imparts the braking force on the track 52 until a target speed is reached, for example. This
provides a controllable braking force to allow the apparatus 10 to descend at a controlled rate. In
some embodiments, the amount of braking force provided by the motor 54 is less than the
amount of force required to stop the apparatus 10 from descending. In this case, some or all of
the force pulling the apparatus 10 down the set of stairs that is not counteracted by the motor 54
is counteracted by the operator. In other embodiments, the motor 54 provides enough braking
force to stop the apparatus 10 from moving. In some embodiments, this method of braking
incorporates the data concerning the weight or load on the seat gathered by sensor 152a (FIG. 1).
In this case, the controller 110 varies or adjusts the output of the motor 54 based on the weight or
load in order to maintain the force required from the operator. In some embodiments, the output
of the motor 54 when braking is determined based on a difference between a target speed of the
apparatus 10 and the actual speed of the apparatus 10 (e.g., measured by the sensor 154). Using
this difference in speed, the controller 110 can determine the target output of the motor 54 using
previously described closed-loop controls techniques. As such, the controller 110 may be
configured to adjust the output of the motor 54 to the target output that is based on the difference
between the target speed of the apparatus and the actual speed of the apparatus. This method
keeps the apparatus 10 moving at the target speed with little force required from the operator. In
some embodiments, the target speed may be zero or a relatively slow speed.
[0090]     Any of the aforementioned brakes may be used alone or in combination with any of the
track assemblies and apparatuses discussed herein. Furthermore, the brakes may be used on one
or all of the tracks and on any or all of the pulleys of the track assemblies. In addition, the brake
included on the apparatus may include a single component or a combination of components. As
discussed hereinabove, the brake 400, 500, 506, 600 may be configured to selectively apply a
                                                  -34-

braking force imparted on the track 52 based on movement of the track 52 in the ascending
direction or descending direction. The brake may be configured to apply the braking force upon
movement of the track 52 in the descending direction and to not apply the braking force upon
movement of the track 52 in the ascending direction. Furthermore, any of the aforementioned
axles may be concentric (sharing a common axis) with at least one pulley 57 but not extend
through the pulley (as with the embodiment of FIG. 18). In addition, the aforementioned brakes
may be coupled directly or indirectly to the axle. The aforementioned rotary dampers may be
configured to selectively apply the braking force upon movement of the track 52 in the
descending direction.
