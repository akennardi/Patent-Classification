     COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS COMPRISING CELECOXIB OR RELATED
                       COMPOUNDS AND DEXTROMETHORPHAN
                                      BACKGROUND
        [0001]     Dextromethorphan is widely used as a cough suppressant and is
considered to be safe enough to be sold over the counter. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory     agent   (NSAID)    approved for the    treatment of osteoarthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions.
                                          SUMMARY
        [0002]     Celecoxib can be used to improve the therapeutic properties, such as
pain relieving properties, of dextromethorphan. Celecoxib can be effective in inhibiting
or reducing the metabolism of dextromethorphan in some human beings. This may be
accomplished by co-administering celecoxib and dextromethorphan.
        [0003]     Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical composition comprising
a therapeutically effective amount of dextromethorphan, a therapeutically effective
amount of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as a cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibitor, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
        [0004]     Some embodiments include a method of treating pain or neurological
disorders      comprising    administering   a   therapeutically   effective  amount    of
dextromethorphan and a therapeutically effective amount of an NSAID, such as a COX
2 inhibitor, to a person in need thereof.
        [0005]     Some embodiments include a method of enhancing the pain relieving
properties of dextromethorphan, comprising co-administering dextromethorphan and an
NSAID, such as a COX-2 inhibitor.
        [0006]     Some embodiments include a method of increasing dextromethorphan
plasma levels in a human being that is an extensive metabolizer of dextromethorphan,
comprising co-administering celecoxib and dextromethorphan to the human being.

        [0007]    Some embodiments include a method of inhibiting the metabolism of
dextromethorphan, comprising administering celecoxib to a human being, wherein the
human     being   is an   extensive metabolizer of dextromethorphan,         and  wherein
dextromethorphan is present in the body of the human being at the same time as
celecoxib.
        [0008]    Some embodiments include a method of increasing the metabolic
lifetime of dextromethorphan, comprising administering celecoxib to a human being,
wherein the human being is an extensive metabolizer of dextromethorphan, and
wherein dextromethorphan is present in the body of the human being at the same time
as celecoxib.
        [0009]    Some    embodiments    include    a  method    of correcting   extensive
metabolism of dextromethorphan, comprising administering celecoxib to a human being
in need thereof, such as a human being in need of treatment for pain.
        [0010]    Some embodiments include a method of improving the pain relieving
properties of dextromethorphan comprising administering celecoxib in conjunction with
administration of dextromethorphan to a human being in need of treatment for pain.
        [0011]    Some embodiments include a method of treating pain comprising
administering a combination of celecoxib and dextromethorphan to a human being in
need thereof.
                       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
        [0012]    FIG. 1 depicts the potency (1/1IC50) of various NSAIDs for the inhibition
of dextromethorphan metabolism.
                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0013]    Dextromethorphan has the structure shown below.
                                             2

     WO 2013/158680                                                     PCT/US20131036836
        [0014]     Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor
agonist, and N-type calcium channel blocker having antitussive properties. Because of
its   mechanism      of action,     there  has  been   interest  from   clinicians  in using
dextromethorphan to treat a variety of neurological conditions including pain. However,
results of clinical trials of dextromethorphan as monotherapy for chronic pain have been
disappointing. In their review, Weinbroum et al. concluded that the few double-blind
human studies of dextromethorphan in chronic and neuropathic pain showed it to be
ineffective for the most part (Can J Anesth 2000; 47:585-596.) Gilron et al. reported that
dextromethorphan showed little or no analgesic efficacy in their study of patients with
facial neuralgias (Neurology 2000; 55:964-971). Similarly, dextromethorphan did not
reduce pain significantly more than placebo in Sang et al.'s study of patients with
diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia (Anesthesiology 2002; 96:1053-1061).
        [0015]    The disappointing clinical effects observed with dextromethorphan
monotherapy in clinical trials may be associated with its rapid metabolism in the human
liver. This rapid hepatic metabolism limits systemic drug exposure in individuals who
are extensive metabolizers.          Human beings can be: 1) extensive metabolizers of
dextromethorphan-those           who    rapidly  metabolize   dextromethorphan;      2)  poor
metabolizers       of     dextromethorphan-those        who     only    poorly     metabolize
dextromethorphan; or 3) intermediate metabolizers of dextromethorphan-those whose
metabolism of dextromethorphan            is somewhere between       that of an extensive
metabolizer and a poor metabolizer. Extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan are a
significant portion of the human population.
                                                3

     WO 2013/158680                                                     PCT/US20131036836
       [0016]    When given the same oral dose of dextromethorphan, plasma levels of
dextromethorphan      are significantly higher in poor metabolizers or intermediate
metabolizers as compared to extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan.                    The
clearance of dextromethorphan for extensive metabolizers is believed to be about 110
L/min.   This high rate of clearance can significantly reduce plasma concentrations of
dextromethorphan      even     at high   doses.    The low     plasma     concentrations       of
dextromethorphan      can limit its clinical utility as a single agent for extensive
metabolizers, and possibly intermediate metabolizers, of dextromethorphan.               Some
NSAIDs    and    COX-2     inhibitors,  such   as celecoxib, inhibit the     metabolism of
dextromethorphan, and can thus improve its therapeutic efficacy.
       [0017]     Pain or neurological disorders may be treated by a method comprising
administering    a therapeutically     effective  amount  of dextromethorphan           and     a
therapeutically effective amount of an NSAID, such as a COX-2 inhibitor, to a person in
need thereof.
       [0018]     Pain relieving properties of dextromethorphan may be enhanced by a
method comprising co-administering dextromethorphan and an NSAID, including a
COX-2 inhibitor such as celecoxib, with dextromethorphan.
       [0019]    These methods may be used to treat, or provide relief to, any type of
pain including, but not limited to, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, cancer-related
pain, acute pain, nociceptive pain, etc.
       [0020]     Examples      of musculoskeletal   pain  include    low back      pain    (i.e.
lumbosacral pain), primary dysmenorrhea, and arthritic pain, such as pain associated
with   rheumatoid      arthritis,  juvenile   rheumatoid   arthritis,   osteoarthritis,   axial
spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, etc.
       [0021]     In some embodiments, a combination of dextromethorphan and an
NSAID such as celecoxib is used to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain.
       [0022]     Examples of neuropathic pain include diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, monoradiculopathies, phantom limb pain,
                                               4

     WO 2013/158680                                                   PCT/US20131036836
central pain, etc. Other causes of neuropathic pain include cancer-related pain, lumbar
nerve root compression, spinal cord injury, post-stroke pain, central multiple sclerosis
pain, HIV-associated neuropathy, and radio- or chemo-therapy associated neuropathy,
etc.
        [0023]   The term      "treating" or "treatment" includes the diagnosis, cure,
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals, or any activity
that otherwise affects the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.
        [0024]   Any compound that inhibits the metabolism of dextromethorphan may
be used in combination with dextromethorphan to improve the therapeutic properties of
dextromethorphan. Some compounds that inhibit the metabolism of dextromethorphan
may include, but are not limited to, NSAIDs such as celecoxib, non-celecoxib NSAIDs,
or   metabolites    thereof.     Dextromethorphan    and    the  compound     that  inhibits
dextromethorphan      metabolism may be administered in separate compositions or
dosage forms, or may be administered in a single composition or dosage form
comprising both.
        [0025]   Celecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor, a type of NSAID, which possesses anti
inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties. Celecoxib has the structure shown below.

        [0026]   Combining celecoxib with dextromethorphan          may provide greater
efficacy, such as greater pain relief, than would otherwise be achieved by administering
either component alone.      In extensive metabolizers, dextromethorphan can be rapidly
and extensively metabolized, yielding low systemic exposure even at high doses.
                                              5

     WO 2013/158680                                                      PCT/US20131036836
Celecoxib, besides being an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, is an inhibitor of
dextromethorphan      metabolism.     Celecoxib has an IC50 of 2.6-2.9            pM for the
demethylation of dextromethorphan, as demonstrated herein. The IC50 is also referred
to as the half maximal inhibitory concentration, and represents the concentration of
drug, such as celecoxib, needed to inhibit the metabolism of dextromethorphan by half.
As explained above, this inhibition may augment dextromethorphan plasma levels,
resulting in additive or synergistic pain relief. Thus, while inhibition of dextromethorphan
metabolism is only one of many potential benefits of the combination, co-administration
of dextromethorphan with celecoxib may thereby enhance the analgesic properties of
celecoxib for many individuals.
        [0027]    Many types of pain arise from both nociceptive and neuropathic
pathophysiologic mechanisms. A combination of celecoxib and dextromethorphan may
therefore be advantageous for treating many pain conditions since celecoxib may
preferentially   target    the   nociceptive      and   inflammatory     components      while
dextromethorphan may preferentially address the neuropathic component of the pain
condition.
        [0028]    Co-administering dextromethorphan and an NSAID, such as celecoxib,
does not necessarily require that the two compounds be administered in the same
dosage form.      For example, the two compounds may be administered in a single
dosage form, or they may be administered in two separate dosage forms. Additionally,
the two compounds may be administered at the same time, but this is not required. The
compounds can be given at different times as long as both are in a human body at the
same time for at least a portion of the time that treatment by co-administration is being
carried out.
        [0029]    In some embodiments, co-administration of a combination of celecoxib
and dextromethorphan results in both celecoxib and dextromethorphan contributing to
the pain relieving properties of the combination.       For example, the combination may
have improved pain relieving properties as compared to celecoxib alone or compared to
dextromethorphan alone.

        [0030]   In some embodiments, the combination may have improved pain
relieving properties of at least about 0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least 100%; up to about
500% or up to 1000%; and/or about 0.5% to about 1000% as compared to celecoxib
alone.
        [0031]   In some embodiments, the combination may have improved pain
relieving properties of at least about 0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least 100%; up to about
500% or up to 1000%; and/or about 0.5% to about 1000% as compared to
dextromethorphan alone.
        [0032]   Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to a compound herein such
as dextromethorphan or celecoxib by structure, name, or any other means, includes
pharmaceutically acceptable salts; alternate solid forms, such as polymorphs, solvates,
hydrates, etc.; tautomers; or any other chemical species that may rapidly convert to a
compound described herein under conditions in which the compounds are used as
described herein.
        [0033]   A dosage form or a composition may be a blend or mixture of
dextromethorphan and a compound that inhibits metabolism of dextromethorphan, such
as celecoxib, either alone or within a vehicle.    For example, dextromethorphan and
celecoxib may be dispersed within each other or dispersed together within a vehicle. A
dispersion may include a mixture of solid materials wherein small individual particles are
substantially one compound, but the small particles are dispersed within one another,
such as might occur if two powders of two different drugs are blended with a solid
vehicle material, and the blending is done in the solid form.    In some embodiments,
dextromethorphan and celecoxib may be substantially uniformly dispersed within a
composition or dosage form. Alternatively, dextromethorphan and celecoxib may be in
separate domains or phases within a composition or dosage form.        For example, one
drug may be in a coating and another drug may be in a core within the coating.

        [0034]    Dextromethorphan and/or a compound that inhibits the metabolism of
dextromethorphan, such as an NSAID, including a COX-2 inhibitor such as celecoxib
(all of which are referred to collectively herein as "therapeutic compounds" for
convenience) may be combined with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of
the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice as described,
for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2005, the disclosure of which is
hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety. The relative proportions of
active ingredient and carrier may be determined, for example, by the solubility and
chemical nature of the compounds, chosen route of administration and standard
pharmaceutical practice.
        [0035]    Therapeutic compounds may be administered by any means that may
result in the contact of the active agent(s) with the desired site or site(s) of action in the
body of a patient. The compounds may be administered by any conventional means
available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic
agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. For example, they may be
administered as the sole active agents in a pharmaceutical composition, or they can be
used in combination with other therapeutically active ingredients.
        [0036]    Therapeutic compounds may be administered to a human patient in a
variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, e.g., orally or
parenterally.   Parenteral administration in this respect includes administration by the
following routes: intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraocular, intrasynovial,
transepithelial    including   transdermal,     ophthalmic,    sublingual      and     buccal;
topically including ophthalmic, dermal, ocular, rectal and nasal inhalation via insufflation,
aerosol and rectal systemic.
        [0037]    The ratio of dextromethorphan to celecoxib may vary.               In some
embodiments, the weight ratio of dextromethorphan to celecoxib may be about 0.1 to
about 2, about 0.2 to about 1, about 0.1 to about 0.3, about 0.2 to about 0.4, about 0.3
to about 0.5, about 0.5 to about 0.7, about 0.8 to about 1, about 0.2, about 0.3, about
0.4, about 0.45, about 0.6, about 0.9, or any ratio in a range bounded by, or between,

any of these values. A ratio of 0.1 indicates that the weight of dextromethorphan is 1/10
that of celecoxib. A ratio of 2 indicates that the weight of dextromethorphan is 2 times
that of celecoxib.
        [0038]   The amount of dextromethorphan in a therapeutic composition may

       [0066]     Inhibition of dextromethorphan metabolism was examined using human
liver microsomes.       Celecoxib was incubated at 7 different concentrations in the
presence of dextromethorphan (2.5 pM) and human liver microsomes (0.5 mg/mL) at
370C. In addition, the assay contained NADPH (2 mM), MgCl 2 (3 mM), and potassium
phosphate buffer (50 mM) at pH 7.4. The assay was initiated by adding the NADPH,
and incubation was terminated after 10 minutes by addition of acetonitrile. The samples
were centrifuged and the metabolism of dextromethorphan was analyzed by LC/MS/MS.
Results were compared to a control containing vehicle. The same assay was carried
out on a number of NSAIDs.           The results are summarized in Table 1 below, and
depicted in FIG. 1.

Sulindac                               >36
       [0067]     Prior to these experiments, there was no reason to expect that
celecoxib would be more active than any other NSAID in Table 1. As can be readily
seen in both Table 1 and FIG. 1, celecoxib is far more active at inhibiting the
metabolism of dextromethorphan than any other NSAID tested.       Celecoxib is about five
times as active at inhibiting the metabolism of dextromethorphan as the next best
compound, and is more than 500 times as active as 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl acetic acid.
This result was unexpected.
