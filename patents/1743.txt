BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                    Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (hereinafier called "PCSK9"), also
    known as neural apoptosis- regulated convertase 1 ("NARC-1"), is a proteinase K-like subtilase
    identified as the 9' member of the secretory subtilase family; see Seidah et at, 2003 PNAS
     100:928-933. The gene for PCSK9 localizes to human chromosome 1p33-p34.3; Seidah et at,
    nupra. PCSK9 is expressed in cells capable of proliferation and differentiation including, for
    example, hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as
    embryonic brain telencephalon neurons; Seidah et al, supra.
                    Original synthesis of PCSK9 is in the form of an inactive enzyme precursor, or
    zymogen, of- 72-kDa which undergoes autocatalytic, intramolecular processing in the
    endoplasmic reticulum ("ER") to activate its functionality. This internal processing event has
    been reported to occur at the SSVFAQ I SIPWNL1 58 motif rendering the first three N-terminal
    residues Ser-lie-Pro (Benjannet er al., 2004 J BioL Chem. 279:48865-48875), and has been
    reported as a requirement of exit from the ER; Benjannet et at, supra; Seidah et aL., supra. The
    cleaved protein is then secreted. The cleaved peptide remains associated with the activated and
    secreted enzyme; supra.
                    The gene sequence for human PCSK9, which is -22-kb long with 12 exons
    encoding a 692 amino acid protein, can be found, for example, at Deposit No. NP_777596.2.
    Human, mouse and rat PCSK9 nucleic acid sequences have been deposited; see, eg., GenBank
    Accession Nos.: AX 127530 (also AX207686), AX207688, and AX207690, respectively.
                    PCSK9 is disclosed and/or claimed in several patent publications including, but
    not limited to the following: PCT Publication Nos. WO 01/31007, WO 01/57081, WO 02/14358,
    WO 01/98468, WO 02/102993, WO 02/102994, WO 02/46383, WO 02/90526, WO 01/77137,

   and WO 01/34768; US Publication Nos. US 2004/0009553 and US 2003/0119038, and European
   Publication Nos. EP 1 440 981, EP 1 067 182, and EP 1 471 152.
                   PCSK9 has been ascribed a role in the differentiation of hepatic and neuronal cells
   (Seidah et al., supra.), is highly expressed in embryonic liver, and has been strongly implicated
 5 in cholesterol homeostasis. Recent studies seem to suggest a specific role in cholesterol
   biosynthesis or uptake. In a study of cholesterol-fed rats, Maxwell et al. found that PCSK9 was
   downregulated in a similar manner as three other genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis,
   Maxwell et al., 2003 J Lipid Res. 44:2109-2119. Interestingly, as well, the expression of
   PCSK9 was regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins ("SREBP"), as seen with
10 other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism; supra. These findings were later supported by a
   study of PCSK9 transcriptional regulation which demonstrated that such regulation was quite
   typical of other genes implicated in lipoprotein metabolism; Dubuc et al., 2004 Arterioscler.
   Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24:1454-1459. PCSK9 expression was upregulated by statins in a manner
   attributed to the cholesterol-lowering effects of the drugs; supra. More, the PCSK9 promoters
15 possessed two conserved sites involved in cholesterol regulation, a sterol regulatory element and
   an SpI site; supra. Adenoviral expression of PCSK9 has been shown to lead to a notable time
   dependent increase in circulating LDL (Benjannet et al., 2004 J Biol. Chem. 279:48865-48875).
   More, mice deleted of the PCSK9 gene have increased levels of hepatic LDL receptors and more
   rapidly clear LDL from the plasma; Rashid et al., 2005 Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 102:5374
20 5379. Recently it was reported that medium from HepG2 cells transiently transfected with
   PCSK9 reduced the amount of cell surface LDLR and internalization of LDL when transferred to
   untransfected HepG2 cells; see Cameron et al., 2006 Human Mol. Genet. 15:1551-1558. It was
   concluded that either PCSK9 or a factor acted upon by PCSK9 is secreted and is capable of
   degrading LDLR both in transfected and untransfected cells. More recently, it was demonstrated
25 that purified PCSK9 added to the medium of HepG2 cells had the effect of reducing the number
   of cell-surface LDLRs in a dose- and time-dependent manner; Lagace et al., 2006 J. Clin. Invest.
   116:2995-3005.
                   A number of mutations in the gene PCSK9 have also been conclusively associated
   with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia ("ADH"), an inherited metabolism disorder
30 characterized by marked elevations of low density lipoprotein ("LDL") particles in the plasma
   which can lead to premature cardiovascular failure; see Abifadel et al., 2003 Nature Genetics
   34:154-156; Timms etal., 2004 Hum. Genet. 114:349-353; Leren, 2004 Clin. Genet. 65:419-422.
   A later-published study on the S127R mutation of Abifadel et al., supra, reported that patients
   carrying such a mutation exhibited higher total cholesterol and apoB 100 in the plasma attributed
35 to (1) an overproduction of apoB 100-containing lipoproteins, such as low density lipoprotein
   ("LDL"), very low density lipoprotein ("VLDL") and intermediate density lipoprotein ("IDL"),
                                                    -2-

   and (2) an associated reduction in clearance or conversion of said lipoproteins; Ouguerram et al.,
   2004 Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24:1448-1453.
                   Together, the studies referenced above evidence the fact that PCSK9 plays a role
   in the regulation of LDL production. Expression or upregulation of PCSK9 is associated with
 5 increased plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, and inhibition or the lack of expression of PCSK9 is
   associated with low LDL cholesterol plasma levels. Significantly, lower levels of LDL
   cholesterol associated with sequence variations in PCSK9 have conferred protection against
   coronary heart disease; Cohen, 2006 N. Engl. J Med 354:1264-1272
                   The identification of compounds and/or agents effective in the treatment of
10 cardiovascular affliction is highly desirable. Reductions in LDL cholesterol levels have already
   demonstrated in clinical trials to be directly related to the rate of coronary events; Law et al.,
   2003 BMJ326:1423-1427. More, recently moderate lifelong reduction in plasma LDL
   cholesterol levels has been shown to be substantially correlated with a substantial reduction in
   the incidence of coronary events; -Cohen et al., supra. This was found to be the case even in
15 populations with a high prevalence of non-lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors; supra.
   Accordingly, there is great benefit to be reaped from the managed control of LDL cholesterol
   levels.
                   Accordingly, it would be of great import to produce a therapeutic-based antagonist
   of PCSK9 that inhibits or antagonizes the activity of PCSK9 and the corresponding role PCSK9
20 plays in various therapeutic conditions.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
                   The present invention relates to antagonists of PCSK9 and particularly human
   PCSK9. Protein-specific antagonists of PCSK9 (or "PCSK9-specific antagonists" as referred to
25 herein) are PCSK9 protein-specific binding molecules or proteins effective in the inhibition of
   PCSK9 function which are of import in the treatment of conditions associated with or impacted
   by PCSK9 function, including, but not limited to hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease,
   metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome and related conditions. PCSK9-specific
   antagonists are characterized by selective recognition and binding to PCSK9. PCSK9-specific
30 antagonists do not show significant binding to other than PCSK9, other than in those specific
   instances where the antagonist is supplemented to confer an additional, distinct specificity to the
   PCSK9-specific binding portion. In specific embodiments, PCSK-9 specific antagonists bind to
   human PCSK9 with a KD of 1.2 X 10-6 or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific
   antagonists bind to human PCSK9 with a KD of 1 X 10-7 or less. In additional embodiments,
35 PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human PCSK9 with a KD of 1 X 10-8 or less. In other
   embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human PCSK9 with a KD of 5 X 10-9 or less,
   or of 1 X 10-9 or less. In further embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human
                                                     -3-

    PCSK9 with a KD of 1 X 10-10 or less, a KD of 1 X 10-11 or less, or a KD of 1 X 10-12 or less.
    In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists do not bind other proteins at the above
    levels.
                     PCSK9-specific antagonists are effective in counteracting PCSK9-dependent
 5  inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake. Repeatedly, PCSK9-specific antagonists demonstrate dose
    dependent inhibition of the effects of PCSK9 on LDL uptake. Accordingly, PCSK9-specific
    antagonists are of import for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Said antagonists also have
    utility for various diagnostic purposes in the detection and quantification of PCSK9.
                     In specific embodiments, the present invention encompasses PCSK9-specific
10  antagonists, and, in specific embodiments, antibody molecules, comprising disclosed heavy
    and/or light chain variable regions, equivalents having one or more conservative amino acid
    substitutions, and homologs thereof. Particular embodiments comprise isolated PCSK9-specific
    antagonists that comprise disclosed CDR domains or sets of the heavy and/or light chain CDR
   domains, and equivalents thereof characterized as having one or more conservative amino acid
15  substitutions. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, fragments of PCSK9-specific
   antagonists that retain the ability to antagonize PCSK9 may be inserted into various frameworks,
   see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,818,418 and references contained therein which discuss various
    scaffolds which may be used to display antibody loops previously selected on the basis of antigen
   binding. In the alternative, genes encoding for VL and VH may be joined, using recombinant
20 methods, for example using a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein
   chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules, otherwise known as
   single chain Fvs ("ScFVs"); see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988 Science 242: 423-426, and Huston et al.,
    1988 Proc.Natl. Acad Sci. USA 85:5879-5883.
                     PCSK-9 specific antagonists and fragments may be in the form of various non
25 antibody-based scaffolds, including but not limited to avimers (Avidia); DARPins (Molecular
   Partners); Adnectins (Adnexus), Anticalins (Pieris) and Affibodies (Affibody). The use of
   alternative scaffolds for protein binding is well appreciated in the scientific literature, see, e.g.,
   Binz & PlUckthun, 2005 Curr. Opin. Biotech. 16:1-11. Accordingly, non-antibody-based
   scaffolds or antagonist molecules with selectivity for PCSK9 that counteract PCSK9-dependent
30 inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake form important embodiments of the present invention.
                     In another aspect, the present invention provides nucleic acid encoding disclosed
   PCSK9-specific antagonists. The present invention provides, in particular aspects, nucleic acid
   encoding PCSK9-specific antagonists, and in specific embodiments, disclosed antibody
   molecules, which comprise disclosed variable heavy and light regions and select components
35 thereof, particularly the disclosed respective CDR3 regions. In another aspect, the present
   invention provides vectors comprising said nucleic acid. In another aspect, the present invention
   provides isolated cell(s) comprising nucleic acid encoding disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists,
                                                      -4-

   in specific embodiments, disclosed antibody molecules and components thereof as described. In
   another aspect, the present invention provides isolated cell(s) comprising a polypeptide, or vector
   of the present invention.
                    In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making PCSK9
 5 specific antagonists which selectively bind PCSK9 including but not limited to antibodies,
   antigen binding fragments, derivatives, chimeric molecules, fusions of any of the foregoing with
   another polypeptide, or alternative structures/compositions capable of specifically binding
   PCSK9. The method comprises incubating a cell comprising nucleic acid encoding the PCSK9
   specific antagonist(s), or comprising individual nucleic acids encoding one or more components
10 thereof, said nucleic acids, which when expressed, collectively produce the antagonist(s), under
   conditions that allow for the expression and/or assembly of the PCSK9-specific antagonist(s),
   and isolating said antagonist(s) from the cell. One of skill in the art can obtain PCSK9-specific
   antagonists disclosed herein as well using standard recombinant DNA techniques.
                    In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the
15 activity or function of PCSK9, or a noted effect of PCSK9, which comprises contacting a cell,
   population of cells, or tissue sample of interest expressing PCSK9 (or treated with PCSK9) with
   a PCSK9-specific antagonist disclosed herein under conditions that allow said antagonist to bind
   to PCSK9. Specific embodiments of the present invention include such methods wherein the cell
   is a human cell. Antagonists in accordance herewith are effective in the inhibition of PCSK9
20 function. Disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists were found to dose dependently inhibit the
   effects of PCSK9 on LDL uptake.
                    In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the
   activity of PCSK9 in a subject exhibiting a condition associated with PCSK9 activity, or a
   condition where the functioning of PCSK9 is contraindicated for a particular subject, which
25 comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific
   antagonist of the present invention. In select embodiments, the condition may be
   hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome or
   related conditions. In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical
   composition or other composition comprising a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention and a
30 pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, diluent, stabilizer, buffer, or alternative designed
   to facilitate administration of the antagonist in the desired amount to the treated individual.
                    The present invention also relates to a method for identifying PCSK9 antagonists
   in a cell sample which comprises providing purified PCSK9 and labeled LDL particles to a cell
   sample; providing a molecule(s) suspected of being a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample;
35 incubating the cell sample for a period of time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the
   cells; isolating cells of the cell sample by removing the supernate; reducing non-specific
   association of labeled LDL particles; lysing the cells; quantifying the amount of label retained
                                                     -5-

   within the cell lysate; and identifying those candidate antagonists that result in an increase in the
   amount of quantified label as compared with that observed when PCSK9 is administered alone.
   Candidate antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of quantified label are PCSK9
   antagonists. This method has proven to be an effective means for identifying PCSK9-specific
 5 antagonists and, thus, forms an important aspect of the present invention.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
30                   The present invention relates to antagonists of PCSK9 and particularly human
   PCSK9. Protein-specific antagonists of PCSK9 (or "PCSK9-specific antagonists") in accordance
   herewith are effective in the inhibition of PCSK9 function and, thus, are of import in the
   treatment of conditions associated with/impacted by PCSK9 function, including, but not limited
   to, hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary syndrome
35 and related conditions. Reference herein to PCSK9 function or PCSK9 activity refers to any
   activity/function that requires, or is exacerbated or enhanced by PCSK9. PCSK9-specific
   antagonists have been demonstrated herein to be particularly effective for counteracting PCSK9
                                                     - 10 -

   dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake. Repeatedly, disclosed antagonists demonstrated
   dose-dependent inhibition of the effects of PCSK9 on LDL uptake.
                    PCSK9-specific antagonists as disclosed herein are, therefore, desirable molecules
   for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. PCSK9-specific antagonists are of utility for any
 5 primate, mammal or vertebrate of commercial or domestic veterinary importance. PCSK9
   specific antagonists are of utility as well for any population of cells or tissues possessing the LDL
   receptor. Means for measuring LDL uptake and, thus, various effects thereon are described in
   the literature; see, e.g., Barak & Webb, 1981 J Cell Biol. 90:595-604, and Stephan & Yurachek,
    1993 J. Lipid Res. 34:325330. In addition, means for measuring LDL cholesterol in plasma is
10 well described in the literature; see, e.g., McNamara el al., 2006 Clinica Chimica Acta 369:158
    167.
                    PSCK9-specific antagonists also have utility for various diagnostic purposes in
   the detection and quantification of PCSK9.
                    PCSK9-specific antagonists as defined herein selectively recognize and
15 specifically bind to PCSK9. Use of the terms "selective" or "specific" herein refers to the fact
   that the disclosed antagonists do not show significant binding to other than PSCK9, except in
   those specific instances where the antagonist is supplemented to confer an additional, distinct
   specificity to the PCSK9-specific binding portion (as, for example, in bispecific or bifunctional
   molecules where the molecule is designed to bind or effect two functions, at least one of which is
20 to specifically bind PCSK9). In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to
   human PCSK9 with a KD of 1.2 X 10-6 or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific
   antagonists bind to human PCSK9 with a KD of 5 X 10-7 or less, of 2 X 10-7 or less, or of 1 X
    10-7 or less. In additional embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human PCSK9
   with a KD of 1 X 10-8 or less. In other embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to
25 human PCSK9 with a KD of 5 X 10-9 or less, or of 1 X 10-9 or less. In further embodiments,
   PCSK9-specific antagonists bind to human PCSK9 with a KD of 1 X 10-10 or less, a KD of I X
    10-11 or less, or a KD of I X 10-12 or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9-specific
   antagonists do not bind other proteins at the above KDs. KD refers to the dissociation constant
   obtained from the ratio of Kd (the dissociation rate of a particular binding molecule-target
30 protein interaction) to Ka (the association rate of the particular binding molecule-target protein
   interaction), or Kd/Ka which is expressed as a molar concentration (M). KD values can be
   determined using methods well established in the art. A preferred method for determining the
   KD of a binding molecule is by using surface plasmon resonance, for example a biosensor
   system such as a BiacoreTM (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) system.
35                  PCSK9-specific antagonists have been shown to dose-dependently inhibit PCSK9
   dependent effects on LDL uptake. Accordingly, PCSK9-specific antagonists are characterized by
   their ability to counteract PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells. This uptake of
                                                    - 11 -

    LDL into cells by the LDL receptor is referred to herein as "cellular LDL uptake". In specific
    embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists antagonize PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL
    uptake into cells, exhibiting an IC50 of 1.2 X 10-6 or less. In specific embodiments, PCSK9
    specific antagonists antagonize PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells, exhibiting
  5 a KD of 5 X 10-7 or less, of 2 X 10-7 or less, or of 1 X 10-7 or less. In additional embodiments,
    PCSK9-specific antagonists antagonize PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells,
    exhibiting an IC50 of 1 X 10-8 or less. In other embodiments, PCSK9-specific antagonists
    antagonize PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells, exhibiting an IC50 of 5 X 10
    9 or less, of 2 X10-9 or less, or of I X 10-9 or less. In further embodiments, PCSK9-specific
10  antagonists antagonize PCSK9-dependent inhibition of LDL uptake into cells, exhibiting an IC50
    of 1 X 10-10 or less, a KD of 1 X 10-11 or less, or a KD of I X 10-12 or less. The extent of
    inhibition by any PCSK9-specific antagonist may be measured quantitatively in statistical
    comparison to a control, or via any alternative method available in the art for assessing a negative
    effect on, or inhibition of, PCSK9 function (i.e.-, any method capable of assessing antagonism of
15  PCSK9 function). In specific embodiments, the inhibition is at least about 10% inhibition. In
    other embodiments, the inhibition is at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70,%, 80%, 90%, or
    95%.
                     A PCSK9-specific antagonist in accordance herewith can be any binding molecule
    with specificity for PCSK9 protein including, but not limited to, antibody molecules as defined
20  below, any PCSK9-specific binding structure, any polypeptide or nucleic acid structure that
    specifically binds PCSK9, and any of the foregoing incorporated into various protein scaffolds;
    including but not limited to, various non-antibody-based scaffolds, and various structures capable
    of affording selective binding to PCSK9 including but not limited to small modular

   Accordingly, non-antibody-based scaffolds or antagonist molecules with selectivity for PCSK9
30 that counteract PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL-uptake form important
   embodiments of the present invention. Aptamers (nucleic acid or peptide molecules capable of
   selectively binding a target molecule) are one specific example. They can be selected from
   random sequence pools or identified from natural sources such as riboswitches. Peptide.
   aptamers, nucleic acid aptamers (e.g., structured nucleic acid, including both DNA and RNA
35 based structures) and nucleic acid decoys can be effective for selectively binding and inhibiting
   proteins of interest; see, e.g., Hoppe-Seyler & Butz, 2000j. Mol. Med 78:426-430; Bock et al.,

                    Expression and selection of various PCSK9-specific antagonists may be achieved
   using suitable technologies including, but not limited to phage display (see, e.g., International

                    "Antibody molecule" or "Antibody" as described herein refers to an
   immunoglobulin-derived structure with selective binding to PCSK9 including, but not limited to,
10 a full length or whole antibody, an antigen binding fragment (a fragment derived, physically or
   conceptually, from an antibody structure), a derivative of any of the foregoing, a chimeric
   molecule, a fusion of any of the foregoing with another polypeptide, or any alternative
   structure/composition which incorporates any of the foregoing for purposes of selectively
   binding/inhibiting the function of PCSK9. "Whole" antibodies or "full length" antibodies refer to
15 proteins that comprise two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds
   which comprise: (1) in terms of the heavy chains, a variable region (abbreviated herein as "VH")
   and a heavy chain constant region which comprises tliree ifoiiains, CHI,~CH2, and CH3; and (2)
   in terms of the light chains, a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as "VL") and a light
   chain constant region which comprises one domain, CL.
20                  "Isolated" as used herein describes a property as it pertains to the disclosed
   PCSK9-specific antagonists, nucleic acid or other that makes them different from that found in
   nature. The difference can be, for example, that they are of a different purity than that found in
   nature, or that they are of a different structure or form part of a different structure than that found
   in nature. A structure not found in nature, for example, includes recombinant human
25 immunoglobulin structures including, but not limited to, recombinant human immunoglobulin
   structures with optimized CDRs. Other examples of structures not found in nature are PCSK9
   specific antagonists or nucleic acid substantially free of other cellular material. Isolated PCSK9
   specific antagonists are generally free of other protein-specific antagonists having different
   protein specificities (i.e., possess an affinity for other than PCSK9).
30                  Antibody fragments and, more specifically, antigen binding fragments are
   molecules possessing an antibody variable region or segment thereof (which comprises one or
   more of the disclosed CDR 3 domains, heavy and/or light), which confers selective binding to
   PCSK9, and particularly human PCSK9. Antibody fragments containing such an antibody
   variable region include, but are not limited to the following antibody molecules: a Fab, a F(ab')2,
35 a Fd, a Fv, a scFv, bispecific antibody molecules (antibody molecules comprising a PCSK9
   specific antibody or antigen binding fragment as disclosed herein linked to a second functional
   moiety having a different binding specificity than the antibody, including, without limitation,
                                                      - 14 -

   another peptide or protein such as an antibody, or receptor ligand), a bispecific single chain Fv
   dimer, an isolated CDR3, a minibody, a 'scAb', a dAb fragment, a diabody, a triabody, a
   tetrabody, a minibody, and artificial antibodies based upon protein scaffolds, including but not
   limited to fibronectin type III polypeptide antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,703,199 and
 5 International Application Numbers WO 02/32925 and WO 00/34784) or cytochrome B; see, e.g.,
   Nygren et al., 1997 Curr. Opinion Struct. Biol. 7:463-469. The antibody portions or binding
   fragments may be natural, or partly or wholly synthetically produced. Such antibody portions can
   be prepared by various means known by one of skill in the art, including, but not limited to,
   conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion.
10                  The present invention provides, in one particular aspect, isolated PCSK9-specific
   antagonists which antagonize PCSK9 function. In particular embodiments, said PCSK9-specific
   antagonists inhibit PCSK9's antagonism of cellular LDL uptake. Disclosed PCSK9-specific
   antagonists effectively antagonize PCSK9's inhibition of LDL uptake and thus, form desirable
   molecules for lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol levels; see, e.g., Cohen et al., 2005 Nat. Genet.
15 37:161-165 (wherein significantly lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels were noted in individuals
   heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in allele PCSK9); Rashid et al., 2005 Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 102:5374-5379 (wherein PCSK9-knockout mice evidenced increased numbers of
   LDLRs in hepatocytes, accelerated plasma LDL clearance, and significantly lower plasma
   cholesterol levels); and Cohen et al., 2006 N. Engl. J. Med. 354:1264-1272 (wherein humans
20 heterozygous for mutated, loss of function, PCSK9 exhibited a significant reduction in the long
   term risk of developing atherosclerotic heart disease).
                    Through repeat experiments, five PCSK9-specific antagonists, namely antibody
   molecules ICXIG08, 3BX5C01, 3CX2A06, 3CX3D02, and 3CX4B08 dose-dependently
   inhibited the effects of PCSK9 on LDL uptake. In specific embodiments, the present invention,
25 thus, encompasses PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody
   molecules comprising the heavy and/or light chain variable regions contained within these
   antibody molecules, as well as equivalents (characterized as having one or more conservative
   amino acid substitutions) or homologs thereof Particular embodiments comprise isolated
   PCSK9-specific antagonists that comprise the CDR domains disclosed herein or sets of heavy
30 and/or light chain CDR domains disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof, characterized as having
   one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. Use of the terms "domain" or "region" herein
   simply refers to the respective portion of the antibody molecule wherein the sequence or segment
   at issue will reside or, in the alternative, currently resides.
                    In specific embodiments, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific
35 antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules comprising a heavy chain
   variable region selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 27, SEQ ID

                    Specific embodiments provide isolated PCSK9-specific antagonists and, in more
   specific embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise heavy chain variable region CDR1,
25 CDR2, and CDR3 sequences and light chain variable region CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 sequences
   comprising (i) SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15, 17, 3, 5 and 7, respectively, (ii) SEQ ID NOs: 29, 31, 33, 21,
   5 and 23, respectively, (iii) SEQ ID NOs: 47, 49, 51, 37, 39 and 41, respectively, (iv) SEQ ID

   respectively; and equivalents thereof characterized as having one or more conservative amino
30 acid substitutions in any one or more of the CDR sequences; specific embodiments of which
   inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake.
                    Conservative amino acid substitutions, as one of ordinary skill in the art will
   appreciate, are substitutions that replace an amino acid residue with one imparting similar or
   better (for the intended purpose) functional and/or chemical characteristics. For example,
35 conservative amino acid substitutions are often ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced
   with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having
   similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic
                                                   - 17-

   side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid),
   uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine,
   cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline,
   phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and
 5 aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Such modifications are
   not designed to significantly reduce or alter the binding or functional inhibition characteristics of
   the PCSK9-specific antagonist, albeit they may improve such properties. The purpose for
   making a substitution is not significant and can include, but is by no means limited to, replacing
   a residue with one better able to maintain or enhance the structure of the molecule, the charge or
10 hydrophobicity of the molecule, or the size of the molecule. For instance, one may desire simply
   to substitute a less desired residue with one of the same polarity or charge. Such modifications
   can be introduced by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and
   PCR-mediated mutagenesis. One specific means by which those of skill in the art accomplish
   conservative amino acid substitutions is alanine scanning mutagenesis as discussed in, for
15 example, MacLennan et al., 1998 Acta Physiol. Scand.Supply. 643:55-67, and Sasaki et al., 1998
   Adv. Biophys. 35:1-24. The altered antagonists are then tested for retained or better function
   using functional assays available in the art or described herein. PCSK9-specific antagonists
   possessing one or more such conservative amino acid substitutions which retain the ability to
   selectively bind to human PCSK9 and antagonize PCSK9 functioning at a level the same or
20 better than the molecule not possessing such amino acid alterations are referred to herein as
   "functional equivalents" of the disclosed antagonists and form specific embodiments of the
   present invention.
                    In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific
   antagonists and, in more specific embodiments, antibody molecules which comprise heavy
25 and/or light chain variable regions comprising amino acid sequences that are homologous to the
   corresponding amino acid sequences of the disclosed antibodies, wherein the antibody molecules
   inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Specific embodiments are
   antagonists which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable regions which are at least 90%
   homologous to disclosed heavy and/or light chain variable regions, respectively. Reference to "at
30 least 90% homologous" includes at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100%
   homologous sequences.
                   PCSK9-specific antagonists with amino acid sequences homologous to the amino
   acid sequences of antagonists described herein are typically produced to improve one or more of
   the properties of the antagonist without changing its specificity for PCSK9. One method of
35 obtaining such sequences, which is not the only method available to the skilled artisan, is to
   mutate sequence encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist or specificity-determining region(s)
   thereof, express an antagonist comprising the mutated sequence(s), and test the encoded
                                                     - 18-

   antagonist for retained function using available functional assays including those described
   herein. Mutation may be by site-directed or random mutagenesis. As one of skill in the art will
   appreciate, however, other methods of mutagenesis can readily bring about the same effect. For
   example, in certain methods, the spectrum of mutants are constrained by non-randomly targeting
 5 conservative substitutions based on either amino acid chemical or structural characteristics, or
   else by protein structural considerations. In affinity maturation experiments, several such
   mutations may be found in a single selected molecule, whether they are randomly or non
   randomly selected. There are also various structure-based approaches toward affinity maturation
   as demonstrated in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,117,096, PCT Pub. Nos.: WO 02/084277 and WO
10 03/099999.
                   As used herein, the percent homology between two amino acid sequences is
   equivalent to the percent identity between the two sequences. The percent identity between the
   two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., %
   homology = # of identical positions/total # of positions X 100), taking into account the number
15 of gaps, and length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two
   sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between
   sequences can be determined using methods generally known to those in the art and can be
   accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity between amino
   acid sequences and/or nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Meyers
20 and Miller, 1988 Comput. Apple. Biosci. 4:11-17, which has been incorporated into the ALIGN
   program (version 2.0). In addition, the percent identity between amino acid sequences or
   nucleotide sequences can be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package
   available online from Accelrys, using its default parameters.
                   In one aspect, the present invention provides isolated PCSK9-specific antibody
25 molecules for human PCSK9 which have therein at least one light chain variable domain and at
   least one heavy chain variable domain (VL and VH, respectively).
                   Manipulation of protein-specific molecules to produce other binding molecules
   with similar or better specificity is well within the realm of one skilled in the art. This can be
   accomplished, for example, using techniques of recombinant DNA technology. One specific
30 example of this involves the introduction of DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region,
   or one or more of the CDRs, of an antibody to the variable region, constant region, or constant
   region plus framework regions, as appropriate, of a different immunoglobulin. Such molecules
   form important aspects of the present invention. Specific immunoglobulins, into which
   particular disclosed sequences may be inserted or, in the alternative, form the essential part of,
35 include but are not limited to the following antibody molecules which form particular
   embodiments of the present invention: a Fab (monovalent fragment with variable light (VL),
   variable heavy (VH), constant light (CL) and constant heavy 1 (CHI) domains), a F(ab')2
                                                    - 19 -

     (bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge or alternative at
     the hinge region), a Fd (VH and CHI domains), a Fv (VL and VH domains), a scFv (a single
     chain Fv where VL and VH are joined by a linker, e.g., a peptide linker, see, e.g., Bird et al.,
      1988 Science 242:423-426, Huston et al., 1988 PNAS USA 85:5879-5883), a bispecific antibody
  5  molecule (an antibody molecule comprising a PCSK9-specific antibody or antigen binding
     fragment as disclosed herein linked to a second functional moiety having a different binding
     specificity than the antibody, including, without limitation, another peptide or protein such as an
     antibody, or receptor ligand), a bispecific single chain Fv dimer (see, e.g., PCT/US92/09965), an
     isolated CDR3, a minibody (single chain-CH3 fusion that self assembles into a bivalent dimer of
10   about 80 kDa), a 'scAb' (an antibody fragment containing VH and VL as well as either CL or
     CHIl), a dAb fragment (VH domain, see, e.g., Ward et al., 1989 Nature 341:544-546, and
     McCafferty et al., 1990 Nature 348:552-554; or VL domain; Holt et al., 2003 Trends in
     Biotechnology 21:484-489), a diabody (see, e.g., Holliger et al., 1993 PNAS USA 90:6444-6448
     and International Application Number WO 94/13804), a triabody, a tetrabody, a minibody (a
15   scFv joined to a CH3; see, e.g., Hu et al., 1996 CancerRes. 56:3055-3061), IgG, IgGI, IgG2,
     IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgD, IgA, IgE or any derivatives thereof, and artificial antibodies based upon
     protein scaffolds, including but not limited to fibronectin type III polypeptide antibodies (see,
     e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,703,199 and International Application Number WO 02/32925) or
     cytochrome B; see, e.g., Koide et al., 1998 J. Molec. Biol. 284:1141-1151, and Nygren et al.,
20   1997 Current Opinion in StructuralBiology 7:463-469. Certain antibody molecules including,
     but not limited to, Fv, scFv, diabody molecules or domain antibodies (Domantis) may be
     stabilized by incorporating disulfide bridges to line the VH and VL domains, see, e.g., Reiter et
    al., 1996 Nature Biotech. 14:1239-1245. Bispecific antibodies may be produced using
    conventional technologies (see, e.g., Holliger & Winter, 1993 CurrentOpinion Biotechnol.
25  4:446-449, specific methods of which include production chemically, or from hybrid
    hybridomas) and other technologies including, but not limited to, the BiTETM technology
    (molecules possessing antigen binding regions of different specificity with a peptide linker) and
    knobs-into-holes engineering (see, e.g., Ridgeway et al., 1996 ProteinEng. 9:616-62 1).
    Bispecific diabodies may be produced in E coli, and these molecules as other PCSK9-specific
30  antagonists, as one of skill in the art will appreciate, may be selected using phage display in the
    appropriate libraries (see, e.g., International Application Number WO 94/13804).
                     Variable domains, into which CDRs of interest are inserted, may be obtained from
    any germ-line or rearranged human variable domain. Variable domains may also be synthetically
    produced. The CDR regions can be introduced into the respective variable domains using
35  recombinant DNA technology. One means by which this can be achieved is described in Marks
    et al., 1992 Bio/Technology 10:779-783. A variable heavy domain may be paired with a variable
    light domain to provide an antigen binding site. In addition, independent regions (e.g., a variable
                                                      - 20 -

     heavy domain alone) may be used to bind antigen. The artisan is well aware, as well, that two
     domains of an Fv fragment, VL and VH, while perhaps coded by separate genes, may be joined,
     using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein
     chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (scFvs).
  5                   Specific embodiments provide the CDR(s) in germline framework regions.
     Specific embodiments herein provide heavy chain CDR(s) selected from the group consisting of:
     SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 85 into VH3 in place of the relevant CDR(s). Specific
    embodiments herein provide heavy chain CDR(s) selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID
    NO: 33, SEQ ID NO: 51 and SEQ ID NO: 67 into VH5 in place of the relevant CDR(s). Specific
10  embodiments herein provide light chain CDR(s) selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID
    NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 23 and SEQ ID NO: 75 into VL3 in place of the relevant CDR(s). Specific
    embodiments herein provide light chain CDR(s) selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID
    NO: 41 and SEQ ID NO: 57 into VK1 in place of the relevant CDR(s).
                      Specific embodiments provide antibody molecules as defined herein which
15  comprise a light chain region comprising sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ
    ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 35, SEQ ID NO: 53 and SEQ ID NO: 69. Additional
    embodiments provide antibody molecules which comprise both a light chain region as described
    and a heavy chain region comprising sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID
    NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 59 and SEQ ID NO: 77.
20                    The present invention encompasses antibody molecules that are human,
    humanized, deimmunized, chimeric and primatized. The invention also encompasses antibody
    molecules produced by the process of veneering; see, e.g., Mark et al., 1994 Handbook of
    Experimental Pharmacology, vol. 113: The pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer
    Verlag, pp. 105-134. "Human" in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules specifically
25  refers to antibody molecules having variable and/or constant regions derived from human
    germline immunoglobulin sequences, wherein said sequences may, but need not, be
    modified/altered to have certain amino acid substitutions or residues that are not encoded by
    human germline immunoglobulin sequence. Such mutations can be introduced by methods
    including, but not limited to, random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro, or by somatic mutation
30  in vivo. Specific examples of mutation techniques discussed in the literature are that disclosed in
    Gram et al., 1992 PNAS USA 89:3576-3580; Barbas et al., 1994 PNAS USA 91:3809-3813, and
    Schier et al., 1996 J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-567. These are only specific examples and do not
    represent the only available techniques. There are a plethora of mutation techniques in the
    scientific literature which are available to, and widely appreciated by, the skilled artisan.
35  "Humanized" in reference to the disclosed antibody molecules refers specifically to antibody
    molecules wherein CDR sequences derived from another mammalian species, such as a mouse,
    are grafted onto human framework sequences. "Primatized" in reference to the disclosed
                                                     - 21 -

     antibody molecules refers to antibody molecules wherein CDR sequences of a non-primate are
     inserted into primate framework sequences, see, e.g., WO 93/02108 and WO 99/55369.
                      Specific antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies and, in
    particular embodiments, are in one of the following antibody formats: IgD, IgA, IgE, IgM, IgGl,
  5  IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 or any derivative of any of the foregoing. The language "derivatives thereof'
     or "derivatives" in this respect includes, inter alia, (i) antibodies and antibody molecules with
    modifications in one or both variable regions (i.e., VH and/or VL), (ii) antibodies and antibody
     molecules with manipulations in the constant regions of VH and/or VL, and (iii) antibodies and
     antibody molecules that contain additional chemical moieties which are not normally a part of
10  the immunoglobulin molecule (e.g., pegylation).
                     Manipulations of the variable regions can be within one or more of the VH and/or
    VL CDR regions. Site-directed mutagenesis, random mutagenesis or other method for
    generating sequence or molecule diversity can be utilized to create mutants which can
    subsequently be tested for a particular functional property of interest in available in vitro or in
15  vivo assays including those described herein.
                     Antibodies of the present invention also include those in which modifications
    have been made to the framework residues within VH and/or VL to improve one or more
    properties of the antibody of interest. Typically, such framework modifications are made to
    decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to "backmutate" one
20  or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an
    antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from
    the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by
    comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the
    antibody is derived. Such "backmutated" antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the
25  invention. Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues
    within the framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell epitopes
    to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to
    as "deimmunization" and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No.
    20030153043 by Carr et al.
30                   In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR
    regions, antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc
    region, where present, typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as
    serum half-life, complement fixation, Fe receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular
    cytotoxicity.
35                   The concept of generating "hybrids" or "combinatorial" IgG forms comprising
    various antibody isotypes to hone in on desired effector functionality has generally been
    described; see, e.g., Tao et al., 1991 J. Exp. Med. 173:1025-1028. A specific embodiment of the
                                                      - 22 -

    present invention encompasses antibody molecules that possess specific manipulations in the Fc
    region which have been found to result in reduced binding to FcyR receptors or Clq on the part
    of the antibody. The present invention, therefore, encompasses antibodies in accordance with the
    present description that do not provoke (or provoke to a lesser extent) antibody-dependent
  5 cellular cytotoxicity ("ADCC"), complement-mediated cytotoxicity ("CMC"), or form immune
    complexes, while retaining normal pharmacokinetic ("PK") properties. Specific embodiments of
    the present invention provide an antibody molecule as defined in accordance with the present
    invention which comprises, as part of its immunoglobulin structure, SEQ ID NO: 87. FIGURE 6
    illustrates a comparison of sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 87, particularly IgG2m4, with
10  IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4.
                     Specific PCSK9-specific antagonists may carry a detectable label, or may be
    conjugated to a toxin (e.g., a cytotoxin), a radioactive isotope, a radionuclide, a liposome, a
    targeting moiety, a biosensor, a cationic tail, or an enzyme (e.g., via a peptidyl bond or linker).
    Such PCSK9-specific antagonist compositions form an additional aspect of the present invention.
15                   In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid encoding
    disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists. The nucleic acid may be present in whole cells, in a cell
    lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form. A nucleic acid is "isolated" or
    "rendered substantially pure" when purified away from other cellular components or other
    contaminants, e.g., other cellular nucleic acids or proteins, for example, using standard
20  techniques, including without limitation, alkaline/SDS treatment, CsCl banding, column
    chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis and other suitable methods known in the art. The
    nucleic acid may include DNA (inclusive of cDNA) and/or RNA. Nucleic acids of the present
    invention can be obtained using standard molecular biology techniques. For antibodies
    expressed by hybridomas (e.g., hybridomas prepared from transgenic mice carrying human
25  immunoglobulin genes), cDNAs encoding the light and heavy chains of the antibody made by the
    hybridoma can be obtained by standard PCR amplification or cDNA cloning techniques. For
    antibodies obtained from an immunoglobulin gene library (e.g., using phage display techniques),
    nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be recovered from the library.
                     The present invention encompasses isolated nucleic acid encoding disclosed
30  variable heavy and/or light chains and select components thereof, particularly the disclosed
    respective CDR3 regions. In specific embodiments hereof, the CDR(s) are provided within
    antibody framework regions. Specific embodiments provide isolated nucleic acid encoding the
    CDR(s) into germline framework regions. Specific embodiments herein provide isolated nucleic

    acid encoding antibody molecules that possess manipulations in the Fc region which result in
30  reduced binding to FcyR receptors or Clq on the part of the antibody. One specific embodiment
    of the present invention is isolated nucleic acid which comprises SEQ ID NO: 88. In specific
    embodiments, synthetic PCSK9-specific antagonists can be produced by expression from nucleic
    acid generated from oligonucleotides synthesized and assembled within suitable expression
    vectors; see, e.g., Knappick et al., 2000 J. Mol. Biol. 296:57-86, and Krebs et al., 2001 J
35  Immunol. Methods 254:67-84.
                      Also included within the present invention are isolated nucleic acids comprising
    nucleotide sequences which are at least about 90% identical and more preferably at least about
                                                    - 25 -

     95% identical to nucleotide sequences described herein, and which nucleotide sequences encode
     PCSK9-specific antagonists which inhibit PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake.
     Sequence comparison methods to determine identity are known to those skilled in the art and
     include those discussed earlier. Reference to "at least about 90% identical" includes at least
  5  about 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identical.
                     The invention further provides isolated nucleic acid which hybridizes to the
     complement of nucleic acid disclosed herein under particular hybridization conditions, which
     nucleic acid binds specifically to PCSK9 and antagonizes PCSK9 function. Methods for
     hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art; see, e.g., Ausubel, CurrentProtocols in
10  Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y., 6.3.1-6.3.6, 1989. As defined herein, moderately
     stringent hybridization conditions may use a prewashing solution containing 5X sodium
     chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% w/v SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of
     about 50% v/v formamide, 6 x SSC, and a hybridization temperature of 55* C (or other similar
    hybridization solutions, such as one containing about 50% v/v formamide, with a hybridization
15  temperature of 42*C), and washing conditions of 60'C, in 0.5 x SSC, 0.1% w/v SDS. A
     stringent hybridization condition may be at 6 x SSC at 45'C, followed by one or more washes in
     0.1 x SSC, 0.2% SDS at 68*C. Furthermore, one of skill in the art can manipulate the
    hybridization and/or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization
    such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90,
20  95, 98, or 99% identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. The basic
    parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable
    conditions are set forth by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Cold
    Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11, 1989 and Ausubel
    et al. (eds), Current Protocols in MolecularBiology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and
25  6.3-6.4, 1995, and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on,
    for example, the length and/or base composition of the DNA.
                     In another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising said nucleic
    acid. Vectors in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, plasmids
    and other expression constructs (e.g., phage or phagemid, as appropriate) suitable for the
30  expression of the desired antibody molecule at the appropriate level for the intended purpose;
    see, e.g., Sambrook & Russell, Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual: 3' Edition, Cold
    Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. For most cloning purposes, DNA vectors may be used. Typical
    vectors include plasmids, modified viruses, bacteriophage, cosmids, yeast artificial
    chromosomes, and other forms of episomal or integrated DNA. It is well within the purview of
35  the skilled artisan to determine an appropriate vector for a particular gene transfer, generation of
    a recombinant PCSK9-specific antagonist, or other use. In specific embodiments, in addition to
    a recombinant gene, the vector may also contain an origin of replication for autonomous
                                                      -26-

     replication in a host cell, appropriate regulatory sequences, such as a promoter, a termination
     sequence, a polyadenylation sequence, an enhancer sequence, a selectable marker, a limited
     number of useful restriction enzyme sites, other sequences as appropriate and the potential for
     high copy number. Examples of expression vectors for the production of protein-specific
  5  antagonists are well known in the art; see, e.g., Persic et al., 1997 Gene 187:9-18; Boel et al.,
     2000 J. Immunol. Methods 239:153-166, and Liang et al., 2001 J Immunol. Methods 247:119
     130. If desired, nucleic acid encoding the antagonist may be integrated into the host
    chromosome using techniques well known in the art; see, e.g., Ausubel, CurrentProtocols in
    Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, and Marks et al., International Application
10  Number WO 95/17516. Nucleic acid may also be expressed on plasmids maintained episomally
    or incorporated into an artificial chromosome; see, e.g., Csonka et al., 2000 J Cell Science
     113:3207-3216; Vanderbyl et al., 2002 Molecular Therapy 5:10. Specifically with regards to
    antibody molecules, the antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be
    inserted into separate vectors or, more typically, both genes may be inserted into the same
15  expression vector. Nucleic acid encoding any PCSK9-specific antagonist can be inserted into an
    expression vector using standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the
    nucleic acid fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present).
    Another specific example of how this may be carried out is through use of recombinational
    methods, e.g. the Clontech "InFusion" system, or Invitrogen "TOPO" system (both in vitro), or
20  intracellularly (e.g. the Cre-Lox system). Specifically with regards to antibody molecules, the
    light and heavy chain variable regions can be used to create full-length antibody genes of any
    antibody isotype by inserting them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant
    and light chain constant regions of the desired isotype such that the VH segment is operatively
    linked to the CH segment(s) within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL
25  segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression vector
    comprising nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist can encode a signal peptide that
    facilitates secretion of the antagonist from a host cell. The nucleic acid can be cloned into the
    vector such that the nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide is linked in-frame adjacent to the
    PCSK9-specific antagonist-encoding nucleic acid. The signal peptide may be an
30  immunoglobulin or a non-immunoglobulin signal peptide. Any technique available to the skilled
    artisan may be employed to introduce the nucleic acid into the host cell; see, e.g., Morrison, 1985
    Science, 229:1202. Methods of subcloning nucleic acid molecules of interest into expression
    vectors, transforming or transfecting host cells containing the vectors, and methods of making
    substantially pure protein comprising the steps of introducing the respective expression vector
35  into a host cell, and cultivating the host cell under appropriate conditions are well known. The
    PCSK9-specific antagonist so produced may be harvested from the host cells in conventional
    ways. Techniques suitable for the introduction of nucleic acid into cells of interest will depend
                                                      - 27 -

     on the type of cell being used. General techniques include, but are not limited to, calcium
    phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and
    transduction using viruses appropriate to the cell line of interest (e.g., retrovirus, vaccinia,
     baculovirus, or bacteriophage).
  5                  In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated cell(s) comprising
    nucleic acid encoding disclosed PCSK9-specific antagonists. A variety of different cell lines can
     be used for recombinant production of PCSK9-specific antagonists, including but not limited to
     those from prokaryotic organisms (e.g., E coli, Bacillus, and Streptomyces) and from Eukaryotic
     (e.g., yeast, Baculovirus, and mammalian); see, e.g., Breitling et al., Recombinant antibodies,
10  John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 1999. Plant cells, including
    transgenic plants, and animal cells, including transgenic animals (other than humans), comprising
    the nucleic acid or antagonists disclosed herein are also contemplated as part of the present
    invention. Suitable mammalian cell lines including, but not limited to, those derived from
    Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells, including but not limited to DHFR-CHO cells (described in
15  Urlaub and Chasm, 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 77:4216-4220) used, for example, with a
    DHFR selectable marker (e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp, 1982 Mol. Biol. 159:601
    621), NSO myeloma cells (where a GS expression system as described in WO 87/04462, WO
     89/01036, and EP 338,841 may be used), COS cells, SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney
    cells, YB2/0 rat myeloma cells, human embryonic kidney cells, human embryonic retina cells,
20  and others comprising the nucleic acid or antagonists disclosed herein form additional
    embodiments of the present invention. Specific embodiments of the present invention may
    employ E coli; see, e.g., Pltckthun, 1991 Bio/Technology 9:545-551, or yeast, such as Pichia,
    and recombinant derivatives thereof (see, e.g., Li et al., 2006 Nat. Biotechnol. 24:210-215).
    Additional specific embodiments of the present invention may employ eukaryotic cells for the
25  production of PCSK9-specific antagonists, see, Chadd & Chamow, 2001 CurrentOpinion in
    Biotechnology 12:188-194, Andersen & Krummen, 2002 CurrentOpinion in Biotechnology
     13:117, Larrick & Thomas, 2001 Current Opinion in Biotechnology 12:411-418. Specific
    embodiments of the present invention may employ mammalian cells able to produce PCSK9
    specific antagonists with proper post translational modifications. Post translational
30  modifications include, but are by no means limited to, disulfide bond formation and
    glycosylation. Another type of post translational modification is signal peptide cleavage.
    Preferred embodiments herein have the appropriate glycosylation; see, e.., Yoo et al., 2002 J
    Immunol. Methods 261:1-20. Naturally occurring antibodies contain at least one N-linked
    carbohydrate attached to a heavy chain. Id. Different types of mammalian host cells can be used
35  to provide for efficient post-translational modifications. Examples of such host cells include
    Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO), HeLa, C6, PC 12, and myeloma cells; see, Yoo et al., 2002 ]
    Immunol. Methods 261:1-20, and Persic et al., 1997 Gene 187:9-18.

                     In another aspect, the present invention provides isolated cell(s) comprising a
   polypeptide of the present invention.
                     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a PCSK9
   specific antagonist of the present invention, which comprises incubating a cell comprising
 5 nucleic acid encoding the PCSK9-specific antagonist, or a heavy and/or light chain of a desired
   PCSK9-specific antagonist (dictated by the desired antagonist) with specificity for human
   PCSK9 under conditions that allow the expression of the PCSK9-specific antagonist, or the
   expression and assembly of said heavy and/or light chains into a PCSK9-specific antagonist, and
   isolating said PCSK9-specific antagonist from the cell. One example by which to generate
10 particular desired heavy and/or light chain sequence is to first amplify (and modify) the germline
   heavy and/or light chain variable sequences using PCR. Germline sequence for human heavy
   and/or light variable regions are readily available to the skilled artisan, see, e.g., the "Vbase"
   human germline sequence database, and Kabat, E.A. et al., 1991 Sequences ofProteins of
   Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH
15 Publication No. 91-3242; Tomlinson, I.M. et al., 1992 "The Repertoire of Human Germline VH
   Sequences Reveals about Fifty Groups of VH Segments with Different Hypervariable Loops" J
   Mol. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox, J.P.L. et al., 1994 "A Directory of Human Germ-line VK
   Segments Reveals a Strong Bias in their Usage" Eur. J Immunol. 24:827-836. Mutagenesis of
   germline sequences may be carried out using standard methods, e.g., PCR-mediated mutagenesis
20 where the mutations are incorporated into PCR primers, or site-directed mutagenesis. If full
   length antibodies are desired, sequence is available for the human heavy chain constant region
   genes; see, e.g., Kabat. E.A. et al., 1991 Sequences ofProteinsofImmunological Interest, Fifth
   Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242.
   Fragments containing these regions may be obtained, for example, by standard PCR
25 amplification. Alternatively, the skilled artisan can avail him/herself of vectors already encoding
   heavy and/or light chain constant regions.
                    Available techniques exist to recombinantly produce other antibody molecules
   which retain the specificity of an original antibody. A specific example of this is where DNA
   encoding the immunoglobulin variable region or the CDRs is introduced into the constant
30 regions, or constant regions and framework regions, of another antibody molecule; see, e.g., EP
   184,187, GB 2188638, and EP-239400. Cloning and expression of antibody molecules,
   including chimeric antibodies, are described in the literature; see, e.g., EP 0120694 and EP
   0125023.
                    Antibody molecules in accordance with the present invention may, in one
35 instance, be raised and then screened for characteristics identified herein using known
   techniques. Basic techniques for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies are described in the
   literature, see, e.g., Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256:495-497). Fully human monoclonal
                                                      - 29 -

     antibodies can be produced by available methods. These methods include, but are by no means
     limited to, the use of genetically engineered mouse strains which possess an immune system
     whereby the mouse antibody genes have been inactivated and in turn replaced with a repertoire of
     functional human antibody genes, while leaving other components of the mouse immune system
  5  unchanged. Such genetically engineered mice allow for the natural in vivo immune response and
     affinity maturation process which results in high affinity, full human monoclonal antibodies.
     This technology is well known in the art and is fully detailed in various publications, including
     but not limited to U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,789,650;

     System"); as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 5,939,598; 6,075,181; 6,114,598; 6,150,584 and related

15                   Alternatively, a library of PCSK9-specific antagonists in accordance with the
    present invention may be brought into contact with PCSK9, and ones able to demonstrate
    specific binding selected. Functional studies can then be carried out to ensure proper
    functionality, i.e., inhibition of PCSK9-dependent inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. There are
    various techniques available to the skilled artisan for the selection of protein-specific molecules
20  from libraries using enrichment technologies including, but not limited to, phage display (e.g.,
    see technology from Cambridge Antibody Technology ("CAT") disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.

    (see, e.g., Georgiou, et al., 1997 Nature Biotechnology 15:29-34) and/or yeast display (see, e.g.,
    Kieke, et al., 1997 Protein Engineering10:1303-13 10). A library, for example, can be displayed
    on the surface of bacteriophage particles, with the nucleic acid encoding the PCSK9-specific
30  antagonist expressed and displayed on its surface. Nucleic acid may then be isolated from
    bacteriophage particles exhibiting the desired level of activity and the nucleic acid used in the
    development of desired antagonist. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the
    literature; see, e.g., Kontermann & Stefan, supra, and International Application Number WO
    92/01047. Specifically with regard to antibody molecules, individual heavy or light chain clones
35  in accordance with the present invention may also be used to screen for complementary heavy or
    light chains, respectively, capable of interaction therewith to form a molecule of the combined
    heavy and light chains; see, e.g., International Application Number WO 92/01047. Any method

     antagonists. Another specific method for accomplishing this is to pan against the target antigen
     in solution, e.g. biotinylated, soluble PCSK9, and then capture the PCSK9-specific antagonist
    phage complexes on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, which are then washed to remove
  5 nonspecifically-bound phage. The captured phage can then be recovered from the beads in the
     same way they would be recovered from the surface of a plate, (e.g. DTT) as described herein.
                       PCSK9-specific antagonists may be purified by techniques available to one of
     skill in the art. Titers of the relevant antagonist preparation, ascites, hybridoma culture fluids, or
    relevant sample may be determined by various serological or immunological assays which
10   include, but are not limited to, precipitation, passive agglutination, enzyme-linked
    immunosorbent antibody ("ELISA") techniques and radioimmunoassay ("RIA") techniques.
                       In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for antagonizing the
    activity of PCSK9, which comprises contacting a cell or tissue sample typically effected by
    PCSK9 (i.e., comprising LDL receptors) with a PCSK9-specific antagonist disclosed herein
15  under conditions that allow said antagonist to bind to PCSK9 when present and inhibit PCSK9's
    inhibition of cellular LDL uptake. Specific embodiments of the present invention include such
    methods wherein the cell is a human cell. In another aspect, the present invention provides a
    method for antagonizing the activity of PCSK9 in a subject, which comprises administering to
    the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present
20  invention. Use of the term "antagonizing" refers to the act of opposing, counteracting,
    neutralizing or curtailing one or more functions of PCSK9. Inhibition or antagonism of one or
    more of associated PCSK9 functional properties can be readily determined according to
    methodologies known to the art (see, e.g., Barak & Webb, 1981 J Cell Biol. 90:595-604;
    Stephan & Yurachek, 1993 J Lipid Res. 34:325330; and McNamara et al., 2006 Clinica Chimica
25  Acta 369:158-167) as well as those described herein. Inhibition or antagonism will effectuate a
    decrease in PCSK9 activity relative to that seen in the absence of the antagonist or, for example,
    that seen when a control antagonist of irrelevant specificity is present. Preferably, a PCSK9
    specific antagonist in accordance with the present invention antagonizes PCSK9 functioning to
    the point that there is a decrease of at least 10%, of the measured parameter, and more preferably,
30  a decrease of at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 95% of the measured
    parameter. Such inhibition/antagonism of PCSK9 functioning is particularly effective in those
    instances where its functioning is contributing at least in part to a particular phenotype, disease,
    disorder or condition which is negatively impacting the subject. Also contemplated are methods
    of using the disclosed antagonists in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of a PCSK9
35  associated disease, disorder or condition or, alternatively, a disease, disorder or condition that
    could benefit from the effects of a PCSK9 antagonist. PCSK9-specific antagonists disclosed
    herein may be used in a method of treatment or diagnosis of a particular individual (human or
                                                       -31 -

    primate). The method of treatment can be prophylactic or therapeutic in nature. In another
    aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a
    PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient,
    diluent, stabilizer, buffer, or alternative designed to facilitate administration of the antagonist in
  5 the desired format and amount to the treated individual. Methods of treatment in accordance
    with the present invention comprise administering to an individual a therapeutically (or
    prophylactically) effective amount of a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the present invention. Use
    of the terms "therapeutically effective" or "prophylactically effective" in reference to an amount
    refers to the amount necessary at the intended dosage to achieve the desired
10  therapeutic/prophylactic effect for the period of time desired. The desired effect may be, for
    example, amelioration of at least one symptom associated with the treated condition. These
    amounts will vary, as the skilled artisan will appreciate, according to various factors, including
    but not limited to the, disease state, age, sex and weight of the individual, and the ability of the
    PCSK9-specific antagonist to elicit the desired effect in the individual. The response may be
15  documented by in vitro assay, in vivo non-human animal studies, and/or further supported from
    clinical trials. The antagonist-based pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be
    formulated by any number of strategies known in the art, see, e.g., McGoff and Scher, 2000
    Solution Formulationof Proteins/Peptides:In - McNally, E.J., ed. Protein Formulation and
    Delivery. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker; pp. 139-158; Akers & Defilippis, 2000, Peptides and
20  Proteinsas ParenteralSolutions. In - Pharmaceutical Formulation Development of Peptides and
    Proteins. Philadelphia, PA: Taylor and Francis; pp. 145-177; Akers et al., 2002, Pharm.
    Biotechnol. 14:47-127. A pharmaceutically acceptable composition suitable for patient
    administration will contain an effective amount of the PCSK9-specific antagonist in a
    formulation which both retains biological activity while also promoting maximal stability during
25  storage within an acceptable temperature range.
                     The antagonist-based pharmaceutically acceptable composition may be in liquid
    or solid form. Any technique for production of liquid or solid formulations may be utilized.
    Such techniques are well within the realm of the abilities of the skilled artisan. Solid
    formulations may be produced by any available method including, but not limited to,
30  lyophilization, spray drying, or drying by supercritical fluid technology. Solid formulations for
    oral administration may be in any form rendering the antagonist accessible to the patient in the
    prescribed amount and within the prescribed period of time. The oral formulation can take the
    form of a number of solid formulations including, but not limited to, a tablet, capsule, or powder.
    Solid formulations may alternatively be lyophilized and brought into solution prior to
35  administration for either single or multiple dosing. Antagonist compositions should generally be
    formulated within a biologically relevant pH range and may be buffered to maintain a proper pH
    range during storage. Both liquid and solid formulations generally require storage at lower
                                                      - 32 -

     temperatures (e.g., 2-8*C) in order to retain stability for longer periods. Formulated antagonist
     compositions, especially liquid formulations, may contain a bacteriostat to prevent or minimize
    proteolysis during storage, including but not limited to effective concentrations (e.g., :1%w/v)
     of benzyl alcohol, phenol, m-cresol, chlorobutanol, methylparaben, and/or propylparaben. A
  5  bacteriostat may be contraindicated for some patients. Therefore, a lyophilized formulation may
    be reconstituted in a solution either containing or not containing such a component. Additional
     components may be added to either a buffered liquid or solid antagonist formulation, including
    but not limited to sugars as a cryoprotectant (including but not limited to polyhydroxy
    hydrocarbons such as sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, and dulcitol and/or disaccharides such as
10   sucrose, lactose, maltose, or trehalose) and, in some instances, a relevant salt (including but not
    limited to NaCl, KCl, or LiCl). Such antagonist formulations, especially liquid formulations
    slated for long term storage, will rely on a useful range of total osmolarity to both promote long
    term stability at temperatures of, for example, 2-84C or higher, while also making the formulation
    useful for parenteral injection. As appropriate, preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants
15  and/or other additives may be included. The formulations may contain a divalent cation
    (including but not limited to MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2); and/or a non-ionic surfactant
    (including but not limited to Polysorbate-80 (Tween 8OTM), Polysorbate-60 (Tween 60TM),
    Polysorbate-40 (Tween     40TM),  and Polysorbate-20 (Tween 20TM), polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers,
    including but not limited to Brij 58TM, Brij35TM, as well as others such as Triton X-100TM, Triton
20  X-1 14TM, NP40TM, Span 85 and the Pluronic series of non-ionic surfactants (e.g., Pluronic 121)).
    Any combination of such components form specific embodiments of the present invention.
                     Pharmaceutical compositions in liquid format may include a liquid carrier, e.g.,
    water, petroleum, animal oil, vegetable oil, mineral oil, or synthetic oil. The liquid format may
    also include physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols, such
25  as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol.
                    Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of a parenterally
    acceptable aqueous solution that is pyrogen-free with suitable pH, tonicity, and stability.
    Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for administration after dilution in isotonic
    vehicles, for example, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, or Lactated Ringer's
30  Injection.
                    Dosing of antagonist therapeutics is well within the realm of the skilled artisan,
    see, e.g., Lederman et al., 1991 Int. J Cancer47:659-664; Bagshawe et al., 1991 Antibody,
    Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals4:915-922, and will vary based on a number of
    factors including but not limited to the particular PCSK9-specific antagonist utilized, the patient
35  being treated, the condition of the patient, the area being treated, the route of administration, and
    the treatment desired. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and
    prescribe the effective therapeutic amount of the antagonist. Dosage ranges may be from about
                                                     - 33 -

     0.0 1 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.05 to 25 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example,
     dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg
     body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. For purposes of
     illustration, and not limitation, in specific embodiments, a dose of 5 mg to 2.0 g may be utilized
  5  to deliver the antagonist systemically. Optimal precision in achieving concentrations of
     antagonist within a range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the
     kinetics of the drug's availability to the target site(s). This involves a consideration of the
     distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the PCSK9-specific antagonist. Antagonists
     described herein may be used alone at appropriate dosages. Alternatively, co-administration or
 10  sequential administration of other agents may be desirable. It will be possible to present a
    therapeutic dosing regime for the PCSK9-specific antagonists of the present invention in
     conjunction with alternative treatment regimes. For example, PCSK9-specific antagonists may
    be used in combination or in conjunction with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, including, but
    not limited to, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g., ZetiaTM) and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors
15   (e.g., ZocorTM and VytorinTM). Individuals (subjects) capable of treatment include primates,
    human and non-human, and include any non-human mammal or vertebrate of commercial or
    domestic veterinary importance.
                      The PCSK9-specific antagonist may be administered to an individual by any route
    of administration appreciated in the art, including but not limited to oral administration,
20  administration by injection (specific embodiments of which include intravenous, subcutaneous,
    intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection), administration by inhalation, intranasal, or topical
    administration, either alone or in combination with other agents designed to assist in the
    treatment of the individual. The route of administration should be determined based on a number
    of considerations appreciated by the skilled artisan including, but not limited to, the desired
25  physiochemical characteristics of the treatment. Treatment may be provided on a daily, weekly,
    biweekly, or monthly basis, or any other regimen that delivers the appropriate amount of PCSK9
    specific antagonist to the individual at the prescribed times such that the desired treatment is
    effected and maintained. The formulations may be administered in a single dose or in more than
    one dose at separate times.
30                   In particular embodiments, the condition treated is selected from the group
    consisting of: hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acute coronary
    syndrome and related conditions. Use of a PCSK9-specific antagonist in the manufacture of a
    medicament for treatment of a PSCK9-associated condition or, alternatively a condition that
    could stand to benefit from a PCSK9 antagonist, including those specified above, therefore,
35  forms an important embodiment of the present invention.
                     The present invention further provides for the administration of disclosed anti
    PCSK9 antagonists for purposes of gene therapy. Through such methods, cells of a subject are
                                                      -34-

    transformed with nucleic acid encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention. Subjects
    comprising the nucleic acids then produce the PCSK9-specific antagonists endogenously.
    Previously, Alvarez, et al, ClinicalCancerResearch 6:3081-3087, 2000, introduced single-chain
    anti-ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach. The methods disclosed by
  5 Alvarez, et al, supra,may be easily adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an
    anti-PCSK9 antibody of the invention to a subject.
                     Nucleic acids encoding any PCSK9-specific antagonist may be introduced to a
    subject.
                     The nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of a subject by any means known
10  in the art. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral vector.
    Examples of preferred viruses from which the vectors may be derived include lentiviruses,
    herpes viruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, alphavirus,
    influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses with desirable cellular tropism.
                     Various companies produce viral vectors commercially, including, but by no
15  means limited to, Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, Calif.; AAV vectors), Cell Genesys (Foster City,
    Calif.; retroviral, adenoviral, AAV vectors, and lentiviral vectors), Clontech (retroviral and
    baculoviral vectors), Genovo, Inc. (Sharon Hill, Pa.; adenoviral and AAV vectors), Genvec
    (adenoviral vectors), IntroGene (Leiden, Netherlands; adenoviral vectors), Molecular Medicine
    (retroviral, adenoviral, AAV, and herpes viral vectors), Norgen (adenoviral vectors), Oxford
20  BioMedica (Oxford, United Kingdom; lentiviral vectors), and Transgene (Strasbourg, France;
    adenoviral, vaccinia, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors).
                     Methods for constructing and using viral vectors are known in the art ( see, e.g.,
    Miller, et al, Bio Techniques 7:980-990, 1992). Preferably, the viral vectors are replication
    defective, that is, they are unable to replicate autonomously, and thus are not infectious, in the
25  target cell. Preferably, the replication defective virus is a minimal virus, i.e., it retains only the
    sequences of its genome which are necessary for encapsidating the genome to produce viral
    particles. Defective viruses, which entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes, are preferred. Use
    of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific, localized area, without
    concern that the vector can infect other cells. Thus, a specific tissue can be specifically targeted.
30                   Examples of vectors comprising attenuated or defective DNA virus sequences
    include, but are not limited to, a defective herpes virus vector (Kanno et al, Cancer Gen. Ther.
    6:147-154, 1999; Kaplitt et al, J Neurosci. Meth. 71:125-132, 1997 and Kaplitt et al,J Neuro
    Onc. 19:137-147, 1994).
                     Adenoviruses are eukaryotic DNA viruses that can be modified to efficiently
35  deliver a nucleic acid of the invention to a variety of cell types. Attenuated adenovirus vectors,
    such as the vector described by Strafford-Perricaudet et al, J Clin. Invest. 90:626-630, 1992 are
    desirable in some instances. Various replication defective adenovirus and minimum adenovirus
                                                      - 35 -

     vectors have been described (PCT Publication Nos. W094/26914, W094/28938, W094/28152,
     W094/12649, W095/02697 and W096/22378). The replication defective recombinant
     adenoviruses according to the invention can be prepared by any technique known to a person
     skilled in the art (Levrero et al, Gene 101:195, 1991; EP 185573; Graham, EMBO J 3:2917,
  5  1984; Graham et al, J Gen. Virol. 36:59, 1977).
                      The adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are DNA viruses of relatively small size
     which can integrate, in a stable and site-specific manner, into the genome of the cells which they
     infect. They are able to infect a wide spectrum of cells without inducing any effects on cellular
     growth, morphology or differentiation, and they do not appear to be involved in human
 10 pathologies. The use of vectors derived from the AAVs for transferring genes in vitro and in
     vivo has been described (see Daly, et al, Gene Ther. 8:1343-1346, 2001, Larson et al, Adv. Exp.
    Med Bio. 489:45-57, 2001; PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/18088 and WO 93/09239; US Patent
    Nos. 4,797,368 and 5,139,941 and EP 488528B1).
                     In another embodiment, the gene can be introduced in a retroviral vector, e.g., as
15  described in US Patent Nos. 5,399,346, 4,650,764, 4,980,289, and 5,124,263; Mann et al, Cell
    33:153, 1983; Markowitz et al, J. Virol., 62:1120, 1988; EP 453242 and EP178220. The
    retroviruses are integrating viruses which infect dividing cells.
                     Lentiviral vectors can be used as agents for the direct delivery and sustained
    expression of nucleic acids encoding a PCSK9-specific antagonist of the invention in several
20  tissue types, including brain, retina, muscle, liver and blood. The vectors can efficiently
    transduce dividing and nondividing cells in these tissues, and maintain long-term expression of
    the PCSK9-specific antagonist. For a review, see Zufferey et al, J. Virol. 72:9873-80, 1998 and
    Kafri et al, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 3:316-326, 2001. Lentiviral packaging cell lines are available
    and known generally in the art. They facilitate the production of high-titer lentivirus vectors for
25  gene therapy. An example is a tetracycline-inducible VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus packaging
    cell line which can generate virus particles at titers greater than 106 IU/mi for at least 3 to 4 days;
    see Kafri et al, J. Virol. 73:576-584, 1999. The vector produced by the inducible cell line can be
    concentrated as needed for efficiently transducing nondividing cells in vitro and in vivo.
                     Sindbis virus is a member of the alphavirus genus and has been studied
30  extensively since its discovery in various parts of the world beginning in 1953. Gene
    transduction based on alphavirus, particularly Sindbis virus, has been well-studied in vitro (see
    Straus et al, Microbiol.Rev., 58:491-562, 1994; Bredenbeek et al, . Virol., 67:6439-6446, 1993;
    Ijima et al, Int. J. Cancer 80:110-118, 1999 and Sawai et al, Biochim. Biophyr. Res. Comm.
    248:315-323, 1998. Many properties of alphavirus vectors make them a desirable alternative to
35  other virus-derived vector systems being developed, including rapid engineering of expression
    constructs, production of high-titered stocks of infectious particles, infection of nondividing
    cells, and high levels of expression (Strauss et al, 1994 supra). Use of Sindbis virus for gene
                                                     - 36 -

   therapy has been described. (Wahlfors et al, Gene. Ther. 7:472-480, 2000 and Lundstrom, J
   Recep. Sig. Transduct. Res. 19(1-4):673-686, 1999.
                     In another embodiment, a vector can be introduced to cells by lipofection or with
   other transfection facilitating agents (peptides, polymers, etc.). Synthetic cationic lipids can be
 5 used to prepare liposomes for in vivo and in vitro transfection of a gene encoding a marker
   (Feigner et al, Proc. NaIl. Acad Sci. USA 84:7413-7417, 1987 and Wang et al, Proc. NaIl. Acad
   Sci. USA 84:7851-7855, 1987). Useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic
   acids are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/18863 and WO 96/17823, and in US Patent
   No. 5,459,127.
10                   It is also possible to introduce the vector in vivo as a naked DNA plasmid. Naked
   DNA vectors for gene therapy can be introduced into desired host cells by methods known in the
   art, e.g., electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate
   precipitation, use of a gene gun, or use of a DNA vector transporter (see, e.g., Wilson, et al, .J.
   Biol. Chem. 267:963-967, 1992; Williams et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2726-2730,
15  1991). Other reagents commonly used for transfection of plasmids include, but are by no means
   limited to, FuGene, Lipofectin, and Lipofectamine. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery
   approaches can also be used (Wu et al, J Biol. Chem. 263:14621-14624, 1988). US Patent Nos.
   5,580,859 and 5,589,466 disclose delivery of exogenous DNA sequences, free of transfection
   facilitating agents, in a mammal. Recently, a relatively low voltage, high efficiency in vivo DNA
20 transfer technique, termed electrotransfer, has been described (Vilquin et al, Gene Ther. 8:1097,
   2001; Payen et al, Exp. Hematol. 29:295-300, 2001; Mir, Bioelectrochemistry53:1-10, 2001;
   PCT Publication Nos. WO 99/01157, WO 99/01158 and WO 99/01175).
                     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for such gene therapy approaches and
   comprising nucleic acids encoding an anti-PCSK9 antagonist of the present invention are
25 included within the scope of the present invention.
                     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for identifying,
   isolating, quantifying or antagonizing PCSK9 in a sample of interest using a PCSK9-specific
   antagonist of the present invention. The PCSK9-specific antagonists may be utilized as research
   tools in immunochemical assays, such as Western blots, ELISAs, radioimmunoassay,
30 immunohistochemical assays, immunoprecipitations, or other immunochemical assays known in
   the art (see, e.g., Immunological Techniques Laboratory Manual, ed. Goers, J. 1993, Academic
   Press) or various purification protocols. The antagonists may have a label incorporated therein or
   affixed thereto to facilitate ready identification or measurement of the activities associated
   therewith. One skilled in the art is readily familiar with the various types of detectable labels
35 (e.g., enzymes, dyes, or other suitable molecules which are either readily detectable or cause
   some activity/result that is readily detectable) which are or may be useful in the above protocols.

                    An additional aspect of the present invention are kits comprising PCSK9-specific
   antagonists or pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein and instructions for use. Kits
   typically but need not include a label indicating the intended use of the contents of the kit. The
   term label includes any writing, or recorded material supplied on or with the kit, or which
 5 otherwise accompanies the kit.
                    The present invention also relates to a method for identifying PCSK9-specific
   antagonists in a cell sample which comprises providing purified PCSK9 (or functional
   equivalent) and labeled LDL particles to a cell sample; providing a molecule(s) suspected of
   being a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample; incubating said cell sample for a period of time
10 sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells; quantifying the amount of label incorporated
   into the cell; and identifying those candidate antagonists that result in an increase in the amount
   of quantified label as compared with that observed when PCSK9 (or functional equivalent) is
   administered alone. The present invention also relates to a method for identifying PCSK9
   specific antagonists in a cell sample which comprises providing purified PCSK9 (or functional
15 equivalent) and labeled LDL particles to a cell sample; providing a molecule(s) suspected of
   being a PCSK9 antagonist to the cell sample; incubating said cell sample for a period of time
   sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells; isolating cells of the cell sample by
   removing the supemate; reducing non-specific association of labeled LDL particles (whether to
   the plate, the cells, or anything other than the LDL receptor); lysing the cells; quantifying the
20 amount of label retained within the cell lysate; and identifying those candidate antagonists that
   result in an increase in the amount of quantified label as compared with that observed when
   PCSK9 is administered alone. Candidate antagonists that result in an increase in the amount of
   quantified label are PCSK9 antagonists. This method has proven to be an effective means for
   identifying PCSK9-specific antagonists and, thus, forms an important aspect of the present
25 invention. Any type of cell bearing the LDL receptor can be employed in the disclosed method
   including, but not limited to HEK cells, HepG2 cells, and CHO cells. A "functional equivalent"
   of PCSK9 is defined herein as a protein with at least 80% homology to PCSK9 at the amino acid
   level having either conservative amino acid substitutions or modifications thereto; said protein
   which exhibits measurable inhibition of LDL uptake by the LDL receptor. Nucleic acid encoding
30 said protein would hybridize to the complement of nucleic acid encoding PCSK9 under stringent
   hybridization conditions. Any number of cells can be plated. For purposes of exemplification,
   the current methods plated 30,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate. In preferred embodiments, the
   cells are in serum-free media when the PCSK9 (or functional equivalent) is added. In specific
   embodiments, the cells are plated for a period of time (e.g., -24 hours) in media with serum;
35 subsequently plated in serum-free media (having removed the serum-containing media) for a
   period of time (e.g., -24 hours); prior to addition of the purified PCSK9 (or functional
   equivalent) and labeled LDL particles. The step of reducing non-specific association of labeled
                                                    - 38 -

   LDL particles is typically carried out by a washing/rinsing step(s) albeit, as the skilled artisan is
   aware, any technique(s) of accomplishing reduction of non-specific association may be utilized.
   LDL particles derived from any source are of use in the above-described assays. In preferred
   embodiments, the LDL particles are fresh particles derived from blood. This can be
 5 accomplished by any method available to the skilled artisan including, but not limited to, the
   method of Havel et al., 1955 J. Clin. Invest. 34: 1345-1353. In specific embodiments, the LDL
   particles are labeled with fluorescence. In particular embodiments, the labeled LDL particles
   have incorporated therein visible wavelength excited fluorophore 3,3'
   dioctadecylindocarbocyanine iodide (dil(3)) to form the highly fluorescent LDL derivative dil(3)
10 LDL. As recognized by one skilled in the art, the present invention can be practiced with any
   label which enables the skilled artisan to detect LDL in the cellular lysate. In specific
   embodiments, an LDL analog may be used that would only become detectable (e.g., become
   fluorescent or fluoresce at a different wavelength, etc.) when metabolized intracellularly or, for
   instance, if it were to become associated with (or dissociated from) other molecules in the
15 process of becoming internalized (e.g. a FRET assay, in which an LDL analog would become
   associated with a secondary fluor, or else be dissociated from a quencher). Any means available
   in the art for detecting internalization of labeled LDL particles can be employed in the present
   invention. The incubation time for the LDL particles and PCSK9 with the cells is an amount of
   time sufficient to allow LDL particle uptake by the cells. In specific embodiments, this time is
20 within the range of 5 minutes to 360 minutes. In specific embodiments, the concentration of
   PCSK9 or functional equivalent added to the cells is in the range of I nM to 5 M. In more
   specific embodiments, the concentration of PCSK9 or functional equivalent added to the cells is
   in the range of 0.1 nM to 3 VtM. One specific means by which the skilled artisan can determine a
   range of concentrations for a particular PCSK9 protein is to develop a dose response curve in the
25 LDL-uptake assay. A concentration of PCSK9 can be selected that promotes close to maximal
   loss of LDL-uptake and is still in the linear range of the dose response curve. Typically, this
   concentration is ~ 5 times the EC-50 of the protein extracted from the dose response curve. The
   concentrations can vary by protein. For purposes of exemplification, the amount of wild-type
   PCSK9 used in Example 5 was ~320 nM, whereas, in equivalent assays employing "gain of
30 function" PCSK9s (e.g., S127R and D374Y), said mutants were added at a lower concentration
   (e.g., 6-50 nM). In the described assay, cells are typically maintained at a temperature suitable
   for their maintenance and/or growth. In specific embodiments, the temperature is maintained
   around 370 C.

    ISOLATION OF RECOMBINANT Fab DISPLAY PHAGE
                   Recombinant Fab phage display libraries (see, e.g, Knappik et al., 2000 J Mol.
   Biol. 296:57-86) were panned against immobilized recombinant human PCSK9 through a
 5 process which is briefly described as follows: Phage Fab display libraries were first divided into
    3 pools: one pool of VH2 + VH4 + VH5, another of VH1 + VH6, and a third pool of VH3. The
   phage pools and immobilized PCSK9 protein were blocked with nonfat dry milk.
                   For the first round of panning, each phage pool was bound independently to V5-,
   His-tagged PCSK9 protein immobilized in wells of Nunc Maxisorp plate. Immobilized phage
10 PCSK9 complexes were washed sequentially with (1) PBS/0.5% TweenM 20 (Three quick
   washes); (2) PBS/0.5% Tween TM 20 (One 5 min. incubation with mild shaking); (3) PBS (Three
   quick washes); and (4) PBS (Two 5-min. incubations with mild shaking). Bound phages were
   eluted with 20 mM DTT and all three eluted phage suspensions were combined into one tube. E
   coli TG1 were infected with eluted phages. Pooled culture of phagemid-bearing cells
15 (chloramphenicol-resistant) were grown up and frozen stock of phagemid-bearing culture were
   made. Phage were rescued from culture by co-infection with helper phage, and phage stock for
   next round of panning were made.
                   For the second round of panning, phages from Round 1 were bound to
   immobilized, blocked V5-, His-tagged PCSK9 protein. Immobilized phage-PCSK9 complexes
20 were washed sequentially with (1) PBS/0.05% Tween TM 20 (One quick wash); (2) PBS/0.05%
   Tween TM 20 (Four 5 min. incubations with mild shaking); (3) PBS (One quick wash); and (4)
   PBS (Four 5-min. incubations with mild shaking). Bound phages were eluted, E. coli TG1 cells
   were infected, and phage were rescued as in Round 1.
                   For the third round of panning, phages from Round 2 were bound to immobilized,
25 blocked VS-His-tagged PCSK9 protein. Immobilized phage-PCSK9 complexes were washed
   sequentially with (1) PBS/0.05% Tween TM 20 (Ten quick washes); (2) PBS/0.05% Tween TM 20
   (Five 5 min. incubations with mild shaking); (3) PBS (Ten quick washes); and (4) PBS (Five 5
   min. incubations with mild shaking). Bound phages were eluted and E coli TG1 cells were
   infected as in Round 1. Phagemid-infected cells were grown overnight and phagemid DNA was
30 prepared.
                   XbaL-EcoRI inserts from Round 3 phagemid DNA were subeloned into
   Morphosys Fab expression vector pMORPH_x9_MH (see, e.g., FIGURE 1), and a library of Fab
   expression clones was generated in E. coli TG1 F-. Transformants were spread on LB +
   chloramphenicol + glucose plates and grown overnight to generate bacterial colonies. Individual
35 transformant colonies were picked and placed into wells of two 96-well plates for growth and
   screening for Fab expression.

     ELISA SCREENING OF BACTERIALLY EXPRESSED FABS
                     Cultures of individual transformants were IPTG-induced and grown overnight for
     Fab expression. Culture supernatants (candidate Fabs) were incubated with purified V5-, His
  5  tagged PCSK9 protein immobilized in wells of 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates, washed with
     0.1% TweenTM 20 in PBS using a plate washer, incubated with HRP-coupled anti-Fab antibody,
     and washed again with PBS/Tween TM 20. Bound HRP was detected by addition of TMP
     substrated, and A450 values of wells were read with a plate reader.
                    Negative controls were included as follows:
 10  Controls for nonspecific Fab binding on each plate were incubated with parallel expressed
     preparations of anti-EsB, an irrelevant Fab.
     Growth medium only.
                    Positive controls for ELISA and Fab expression were included as follows:
     EsB antigen was bound to three wells of the plate and subsequently incubated with anti-EsB Fab.
 15  To control for Fabs reacting with the VS or His tags of the recombinant PCSK9 antigen, parallel
     ELISAs were performed using V5-, His-tagged secreted alkaline phosphatase protein (SEAP)
     expressed in the same cells as the original PCSK9 antigen and similarly purified. Putative
     PCSK9-reactive Fabs were identified as yielding > 3X background values when incubated with
     PCSK9 antigen but negative when incubated with SEAP. Clones scoring as PCSK9-reactive in
20  the first round of screening were consolidated onto a single plate, re-grown in triplicate, re
     induced with IPTG, and re-assayed in parallel ELISAs vs. PCSK9 and SEAP. Positive and
    negative controls were included as described above. Clones scoring positive in at least 2 of 3
    replicates were carried forward into subsequent characterizations. In cases of known or
     suspected mixed preliminary clones, cultures were re-purified by streaking for single colonies on
25  2xYT plates with chloramphenicol, and liquid cultures from three or more separate colonies were
    assayed again by ELISAs in triplicate as described above.

    DNA SEQUENCE DETERMINATION OF PCSK9 ELISA-POSITIVE FAB CLONES
30                  Bacterial culture for DNA preps were made by inoculating 1.2 ml 2xYT liquid
    media with chloramphenicol from master glycerol stocks of positive Fabs, and growing
    overnight. DNA was prepared from cell pellets centrifuged out of the overnight cultures using
    the Qiagen Turbo Mini preps performed on a BioRobot 9600. ABI Dye Terminator cycle
    sequencing was performed on the DNA with Morphosys defined sequencing primers and run on
35  an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer, to obtain the DNA sequence of the Fab clones. DNA sequences
    were compared to each other to determine unique clone sequences and to determine light and
    heavy chain subtypes of the Fab clones.

   and 3CX4B08) and the EsB (negative control) Fab were expressed by IPTG-induction in E. coli
   TGlF- cells. Cultures were lysed and the His-tagged Fabs were purified by immobilized metal
   ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and proteins were exchanged into 25mM HEPES pH
   7.3/150 mM NaCl by centrifugal diafiltration. Proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on
10 Caliper Lab-Chip 90 and by conventional SDS-PAGE, and quantified by Bradford protein assay.
   Purified Fab protein was re-assayed by ELISA in serial dilutions to confirm activity of purified
   Fab. Positive and Negative controls were run as before. Purified Fab preparations were analyzed
   in the EXOPOLAR (cholesterol uptake) assay described below.

   EXOPOLAR ASSAY: EFFECTS OF EXOGENOUS PCSK9 ON CELLULAR LDL UPTAKE
                   On day 1, 30,000 cells/well were plated in a 96 well polyD-lysine coated plate.
   On day 2, the media was switched to no-serum containing DMEM media. On day 3, the media
 5 was removed and the cells were washed with OptiMEM. Purified PCSK9 was added in 100 pl
   of DMEM media containing LPDS and dI-LDL. The plates were incubated at 37*C for 6.5 hrs.
   The cells were washed quickly in TBS containing 2 mg/ml BSA; then washed in TBS-BSA for 2
   minutes; and then washed twice (but quickly) with TBS. The cells were lysed in 100 .U   1 RIPA
   buffer. Fluorescence was then measured in the plate using an Ex 520, Em 580 nm. The total
10 cellular protein in each well was measured using a BCA Protein Assay and the fluorescence units
   were then normalized to total protein.

   KINETIC EVALUATION OF FAB:PCSK9 INTERACTIONS WITH SURFACE PLASMON
   RESONANCE ("SPR")
25                 SPR measurements were performed using a BiacoreTM (Pharmacia Biosensor AB,
   Uppsala, Sweden) 2000 system. Sensor chip CM5 and Amine coupling kit for immobilization
   were from BiacoreTM.
                   Anti-Fab IgG (Human specific) was covalently coupled to surfaces 1 and 2 of a
   Sensor Chip CM5 via primary amine groups, using the immobilization wizard with the "Aim for
30 immobilization" option. A target immobilization of 5000 RU was specified. The wizard uses a
   7 minute activation with a 1:1 mixture of 100 mM NHS and 400 mM EDC; injects the ligand in
   several pulses to achieve the desired level, then deactivates the remaining surface with a 7 minute
   pulse of ethanolamine.
                   Anti-PCSK9 Fabs were captured on capture surface 2 and surface 1 was used as a
35 reference for kinetic studies of Fab:PCSK9 interactions. Fab was captured by flowing a 500
   ng/ml solution at 5 pl/min for 1-1.5 minutes to reach a target RL for an R max of 100-150 RU for
   the reaction. 5-10 concentrations of hPCSK9v5His or mPCSK9v5His antigens were flowed

   across the surface at 30 i/minute for 3-4 minutes. 15-60 minutes dissociation time was allowed
   before regeneration of the Anti-Fab surface with a 30 second pulse of 10 mM glycine pH 2.0.
                   BiaEvaluation Software was used to evaluate the sensograms from the multiple
   concentration of PCSK9 antigen analyzed with each Fab, to estimate the kinetics constants of the
