                        IN A FINANCIAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT
   ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
             A method for providing a wager in a financial market
   environment           is   provided      that      includes        presenting      an
   opportunity          to   make   a  wager    that      is    based    on   a  moving
 5 market       line    associated     with   a   financial         market.      An  end
   user       is      given   an    opportunity        to     bet     on    whether    a
   financial          market  value    will  be    above      or below      the moving
   market        line    at   a   designated      time.          The   wager    may   be
   accepted         from the    end user.        The    wager      may   be  monitored
LO in    order       to determine     whether    the     financial       market    value
   was       above      or   below    the    moving         market     line     at   the
   designated time.

                                 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR WAGERING
                              IN A FINANCIAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT
    TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE                      INVENTION
              This        invention         relates          in   general      to      gaming     and,
    more      particularly,             to     a  system        and    a  method     for wagering
    in a financial market environment.
  5
    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
              The      gaming         industry         has      experienced         a    tremendous
    increase            in       popularity           over       the      last      few      decades.
    Excitement             is     generally        derived        from     the   expectation        of
 LO potential           future        winnings         based      on    the   movements        of  the
    underlying              event      of     the     wager.           Concurrently,           in  the
    financial market a different group of participants                                          engage
    in     allocating               money      based        on   the      likelihood         of   some
    future          event.            Such       participants             (or    investors)        may
 L5 purchase commodities                     (e.g. common           stock through a trading
    exchange)           in      hopes     that      their       purchases      will      appreciate
    with time.               When the investor elects to close or sell his
    position,            a     profit      may     be     obtained        in  cases       where    the
    underlying asset has grown in value.
20            Investors            are   also     given       the    opportunity         in   today's
    trading           markets          to      purchase          equities        that        track    a
    particular              type      of     stock,         sector,       or   exchange.           For
    example,          an      investor      may     take      a  position      in    a   stock    that
    tracks         the      performance           of    semiconductors,           cyclicals,        or
25  small-cap            stocks        (e.g.      the       Russell       2000).        In    another
    example,          investors          are     given       the   opportunity         to    purchase
    a   stock        that        tracks     the     performance           the  NASDAQ        exchange
     (e.g. stock ticker symbol                        'QQQ').        Gains or       losses in the
    NASDAQ are, therefore, reflected by the tracking stock.

                                                             2
              Investors may use any number of theories                                         in order to
    develop          a    hypothesis               for        taking         a    position           in      such
    stocks.              For       example,           because           the      NASDAQ        is      heavily
    weighted          toward          technology,              an    investor          who      feels        that
  5 the     technology            sector        is     due      for     a  rally      may     opt      to take
    a    position         in     the      tracking            stock       of    the    NASDAQ.             Other
    investors            may        use       a      technical            analysis           (considering
    factors         such as momentum, volume,                            and performance               graphs)
    to     determine           whether           or       not      such       an    investment             would
 LO produce a profit.                     Still       other investors may use interest
    rates,        bond prices,               or    any      other       appropriate           factor        as    a
    basis         for     making          such        determinations.                    Alternatively,
    some       investors          may     simply          allocate         capital        based       on pure
    guesswork and hunches.                           Accordingly,              such     a   forum        offers
 L5 the          opportunity                  for          great           speculation                 amongst
    participants,              as      any     number          of   factors         and     theories          may
    be      implemented              in      an      attempt           to      predict         the       future
    performance of an underlying asset.
 20 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
              From      the     foregoing,             it      may    be     appreciated            by     those
    skilled in the art that                         a need has arisen for an                         improved
    gaming         instrument           that       provides           for     enhanced         flexibility
    and       improved          wagering             opportunities                 for     participating
25  customers           and     clients.             In      accordance          with     an     embodiment
    of     the      present           invention,              a    system         and     a    method          for
    wagering          in     a    financial           market         environment            are      provided
    that           substantially                   eliminate               or        greatly             reduce
    disadvantages               and      problems             associated           with      conventional
30  gaming or investment approaches and instruments.
              According to an embodiment of the present invention,
    a    method        for     wagering           in     a    financial          market        environment
    is     provided          that       includes            presenting            an    opportunity             to

                                                       3
    make     a     wager         that     is    based       on    a    moving     market       line
    associated with a financial market.                               An end user is given
    an opportunity to bet on whether a financial market value
    will     be     above         or    below       the     moving      market       line     at     a
  5 designated time.                  The wager may be accepted from the end
    user.        The wager may be monitored                        in   order    to determine
    whether the financial market value was above or below the
    moving market line at the designated time.
           According              to    another          embodiment        of    the       present
 LO invention, a method for determining odds for a wager in a
    financial          market        environment           is    provided      that       includes
    generating          market        line odds associated with                  a wager,        the
    market      line odds for the wager being based on,                                at least,
    a  volatility             factor,       a    time      factor,      and   a    market       line
 L5 associated with a financial market.                               The market line odds
    may     be        provided            to      an       end      user     interested            in
    participating              in    the    wager.          The    end   user     is     given     an
    opportunity           to      bet    on   whether         a  financial       market      value
    will    be     above        or    below     the market           line   at   a    designated
 20 time.       The wager may be settled based on the market line
    odds     after         the      designated            time     in    order      to     resolve
    whether the end user is entitled to a credit or a debit.
           In     yet     another        embodiment          of the present           invention,
    a method        of providing multiple                    wagering      opportunities           in
25  a financial           market        environment          is   provided      that      includes
    offering        a   first       and    a second         wager that       are     each based
    on   a     moving         market        line       associated        with     a    financial
    market.         The     first       wager      is    associated with           a rise      in    a
    financial          market        value      such      that    it    will    be     above      the
30  moving      market          line     at   a    first       designated      time       interval
    within       a    trading         session        associated        with    the      financial
    market,       the second wager being associated                           with a decline
    in  the financial              market value            such that it        will be below

                                                         4
    the       moving         market         line      at      a    second         designated              time
    interval          within        the     trading        session.           A    selected          one    or
    both       of   the      wagers       may be       accepted         from      one      or     more     end
    users.          The wagers may be monitored in order to determine
  5 whether          the       financial          market         was     above         or    below         the
    moving market line.
              In    a   more      particular          embodiment           of    the     invention,           a
    third        and    a   fourth       wager      are      offered       that      are     each based
    on    a     high      line      that       corresponds           to    an     increase           in    the
 LO moving market line.                      The third wager is                 associated with a
    rise       in   the      financial          market       value      such      that      it      will    be
    above        the     high     line       at   a   third       designated           time       interval
    within        the     trading         session       associated           with       the      financial
    market        value,        the     fourth      wager       being      associated             with     the
 L5 financial           market         value      being       below       the      high      line        at   a
    fourth          designated              time      interval           within          the        trading
    session.
              In      addition,           a    fifth        and     a    sixth         wager        may     be
    offered           that        are       each       based        on      a      low       line         that
 20 corresponds             to a decrease            in the moving market line.                            The
    fifth wager is associated with a decline                                     in the financial
    market value              such that it will be below the                            low line at a
    fifth         designated              time       interval           within           the        trading
    session,            the      sixth         wager       being        associated              with       the
25  financial            market        value      being         above      the      low      line        at   a
    sixth         designated              time       interval           within           the        trading
    session.
              Additionally,              a    seventh        and    an    eighth         wager       may    be
    offered           that       are      each      based         on    a     spread          line        that
30  corresponds             to    a    derivation           above      and      below       the       moving
    market        line.          The     seventh        wager       is    associated              with     the
    financial           market        value      being       below      the     spread         line      at   a
    seventh           designated             time      interval          within           the       trading

                                                 5
    session,         the     eighth      wager     being      associated          with     the
    financial        market value         being above the          spread       line at     an
    eighth        designated          time     interval       within        the       trading
    session.
  5          Certain       embodiments        of    the     present      invention         may
    provide        a number      of    technical       advantages.          For     example,
    according        to    one   embodiment        of   the present         invention,        a
    gaming        instrument         is    provided        that     allows        potential
    investors         or    bettors      to   participate        in   betting         on   the
 LO movement         of    financial        markets.          The    existence          of    a
    dynamic        instrument,        which    offers      a  moving      line      variable
    for the placed bet, provides an opportunity for investors
    and gamers         to bet       on   a number      of potential          fluctuations
    in     an    underlying       market.        Accordingly,        clients         may   bet
 L5 that the market will close above or below the moving line
    value        and   also     enjoy      additional        betting       opportunities
    where       they may       bet   that    the market        will    close        above   or
    below       predetermined         levels     that    are    (for   example)         circa
    1% above and below the actual market value.
  0          In    addition,       the    value     of   a   financial         transaction
    may now be wagered according to odds that are dynamically
    determined         based on the underlying market                  levels        and any
    additional         data    that may be relevant             or useful         in   making
    such      a   determination.           Included      in   the    current        wagering
25  architecture          is   a spread      around the current market value
     (i.e.      the moving       middle market          value    line)   .      The    spread
    may offer odds that are better than those relating to the
    non-spread         market      lines    and,     further,      could      be    provided
    with      even    money      odds.       Such     a   wagering      system        may   be
30  implemented         in    cooperation       with any       number      of securities
    and exchanges that experience any degree of movement.
             Yet     another        advantage       of    an    embodiment           of    the
    present          invention         is     an      augmentation           in      betting

                                              6
    opportunities as a result of the use of multiple intraday
    expiries.        This      characteristic         offers      an    even    greater
    selection       for    a    potential       participant         in     the    gaming
    system.      Certain       bets   may    include      a   daily     expiry     or  be
  5 provided with weekly and quarterly                    expiries.         Other bets
    could    extend       to    minute-by-minute           expiries.           On    this
    basis,    customers,        investors,       and   clients      could     have    the
    opportunity       to   bet    on multiple        occasions       throughout       the
    course of the trading day.                 Thus,    in its least ambitious
 LO state,    the financial markets now become a foundation for
    regular    intraday       betting      activity      in    the    same    way    that
    horseracing      and    other    sportsbook        events     present      multiple
    daily betting opportunities               (e.g. a bet expiry every half
    hour throughout the day) for an end user.
 L5       A further advantage of the present invention is that
    a  single    visual       display,     or   GUI,     allows     the     display    of
    data   to   a user      that    has   been    gathered       from a number         of
    distributed         databases,         the       various        stock       market,
    reconstituted at a central processor.
 20       Yet    another       advantage      of    the    present      invention      is
    that   the    GUI    of    the   present       invention       simplifies        user
    data    entry     in    to    a  wager      system      over     the    prior     art
    systems.     The     simplification         of    data     entry      reduces     the
    opportunity       for    errors    in   data     entry     thereby      increasing
25  the efficiency of data processing.
          The     generation         of    a    personalized           user     profile
    improves      a    user's      access     time      to    their      account      and
    thereby increases the efficiency of the system and method
    of   the    present        invention      above      that      associated        with
30  current    wager      systems     by    giving      immediate        access     to   a
    user's    preferred       market    and    type    of wager       upon    the    user
    logging      in.     The     effect       of     the     generation         such     a
    personalized profile results in the processing of profile

                                                   7
    data  influencing          the       manner       in    which      a    computer         system
    operates    by    removing          unnecessary           data     entry       by    the    user
    thereby    increasing           data      processing           efficiency.             Such      an
    influence on       the manner of operation of                        a computer          system
  5 goes beyond the          normal interactions of a computer program
    with a system.
          Certain       embodiments             of     the     present         invention           may
    enjoy   some,      all,      or      none      of     these     advantages.                Other
    technical       advantages           may      be      readily        apparent           to     one
 LO skilled      in      the        art       from         the      following             figures,

                                                     8
    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
             FIGURE       1 is    a simplified             block     diagram     of a       gaming
    system       10     that    offers       an     opportunity         for    wagers        to  be
    placed      in     a financial         market       environment.           Gaming system
  5 10    comprises multiple              end users          12,    a user     interface        16,
    a communications network 18,                       and a central controller 40.
    Gaming system 10 may also include an administrator module
    50      and     a     financial         market         data     element       60.          User
    interface         16 may include             a number        of elements        that offer
 LO connectivity             for    one     or      more     end     users      12    to      other
    elements         within      gaming        system       10.       These     elements        may
    include       an     Internet      20,      a wireless         element      22,     a   casino
    facility         24,    a television            (or display)         28,    and     a broker
    30.      Central controller 40 may include a processor 42 and
 L5 a memory element 44.
             In    accordance          with       the      teachings        of   the      present
    invention,             gaming          system           10      provides          increased
    flexibility                and           improved              opportunities                for
    diversification              in    wagering          in    a   number       of    financial
 20 markets.             Gaming      system        10    offers      financial         odds     for
    moving line markets and, further, is capable of providing
    bets      that       include      multiple          intraday       expiries.            Gaming
    system        10      further       offers         a    pricing        engine       that     is
    operable         to    determine:          1)     a    set    of   moving       fixed      odds
25  around       static       market      lines;        2)   a    correct      moving       market
    line     in     relation       to    static        odds;      and   3)    an    ability      to
    receive betting information in order to display liability
    management            in   relation           to     the      financial       fixed        odds
    betting activity.
30           Some      financial       products          may     display      odds     around      a
    static line that will be unchanged throughout the trading
    day.       In contrast to such architectures, gaming system 10
    offers      a     wagering       platform         that     is    capable     of     offering

                                                9
    bets    associated       with     a   dynamic     market,       where       the market
    line    is   a reflection         of the      current      market       levels.        The
    market      line      may    move      constantly         throughout            a   given
    trading       day    and    reflect       underlying         market        shifts      and
  5 movements.
           A given       end user       12   may bet      that     a selected          market
     (e.g.    the   FTSE)    will      close    at   a value        that     is    above    or
    below the moving line value.                   End users 12 may also enjoy
    additional betting opportunities based on the theory that
 LO the market will close above or below levels that are                                  (for
    example)       approximately           1%   above       or    below        the     actual
    market      value.        Thus,      gaming     system        10     may     include      a
    spread     around the        current      market     value       (i.e.      the moving
    middle     market      value     line),      whereby       the     spread       includes
 L5 odds that are better             (from the perspective of the bettor)
    than those relating to the non-spread market line.                                   Such
    odds may be effectively even, as opposed to                            (for example)
    10/11 type odds.
           Daily      expiries,         as    well      as    other        intraday        and
 20 longer-term       expiries,        may also be         accommodated          by gaming
    system 10.         Bets may be placed            in    any suitable           financial
    market, such as the FTSE, the German DAX, the French CAC,
    the   NASDAQ,       the   American       Exchange        (AMEX),       the     New   York
    Stock Exchange, the Nikkei, the bond or treasury markets,
25  and    the     Hang    Seng     Index,      for     example.           Thus,       gaming
    system       10    may     facilitate         frequent         bet      expiries        in
    relation to any number of suitable financial instruments.
    Bets     could     also    extend       to   minute-by-minute              or     thirty
    second     expiries.         On    this    basis,      end users         12    can   have
30  the    opportunity         to     bet     on    multiple          events/scenarios
    throughout        the    trading       day.        Accordingly,            a    targeted
    financial       market     can    represent       a   foundation          for     regular
    intraday betting activity.

                                                        10
             Other         example         applications            may       include         provisions
    for      a    bet      expiry        every      five       minutes         throughout             market
    hours        (and readily extended to                      accommodate defined future
    time        frames).             In     an     example         scenario,             where        it       is
  5 assumed          that      an    expiry        is     present          every        five      minutes,
    then wagering opportunities could be defined for the FTSE
    market         (in     GMT     times)       as     follows:           (Opening         Bell)        10.00
    am, 10.05           am, 10.10          am, 10.15 am, etc.                 and        continuing to
    17.05,        17.10,       17.15,       17.20      (Closing Bell).
 LO           Clients          seeking         to     place       bets        could         do      so      and
    specify          an     expiry        that     they       have       elected.              This       will
    probably           be    the     imminent          forthcoming            expiry,          but      later
    ones can also be easily accommodated.                                     Hence, a client in
    a betting shop or in an on-line environment has                                             a betting
 L5 opportunity             every minute            throughout           the     day.         Settlement
    could       subsequently             follow       the    bet     expiry         in    any     suitable
    manner            (e.g.       immediately              without            delay         after           the

             A    further capability provided by gaming system 10                                              is
 20 the provision              for a non-time specified expiry.                                 In such a
    scenario,            a   bet       expires         at    a   defined            delay       from        the
    moment the bet was                   struck.          This would allow end user                            12
    to     place       a    bet     at     any    time      throughout             the     day      knowing
    that        the       bet,       which        was      placed,           will         expire           (for
25  instance)           five     minutes        after      the     bet      was      placed         (e.g.       a
    bet     placed        at    12.07      and    35    seconds:          bet     settled        at     12.12
    and 35        seconds).            Thus,     bets would not               necessarily expire
    for     all     participants             at   nominated           intervals,           but      instead

          FIGURE     2   is    a   simplified          schematic        diagram      of   an
    example    screen     page    70      in   accordance       with     an   embodiment
    of the present invention.                   Screen page 70          illustrates       an
    opportunity     for     end user          12   to   bet   on    whether      selected
 20 markets will expire above or below defined market levels.
    The   associated        expirations            can    be    variable.           In    an
    example     scenario       used         for    purposes        of    teaching        and
    example, the expiry is daily at the market closing bell.
          In     the     example           of     FIGURE       2,      eight      betting
25  opportunities         are      offered,           whereby        the      web       page
    represents     bets      that     relate        to   one    specific       financial
    instrument.        The    eight        available      bets     are    based     on   the
    opportunity     to bet       that       the   specified market           will     close
    above or below four separately defined levels.                             A list 72
30  allows end user        12 to access            any given       exchange     in    order
    to place     a potential        bet       associated with          a given      market
    line.

                                                           20
              In     an    example         embodiment,               screen        page       70    includes        a
    high       line,        the     current         market           line,       and      a    low     line     for
    the      FTSE.           The    high       line       is      a    constantly             moving        market
    level:            about       1%     of    the     market           value        above        the     current
  5 market level               in this        example.              Note that           in more volatile
    markets           (or based          on particular                 needs)        such high           and    low
    lines         may      be     +    any       suitable             percentage              level       of    the
    middle market line.                        The     high line             in this          example        is  at
    4404.               The      higher          and         lower         betting             opportunities
 LO represent            constant           fixed       odds        prices.             The       higher       odds
    will         be      odds        against           the         current           levels           (a     short
    position)            and     the     lower      odds will              be     odds       for/supporting
    current          levels        (a    long position                 or    'odds-on').               Thus,     in
    an example arrangement, a set of bets                                         74a and 74b             reflect
 L5 the     short        and     long positions                 for      the high           line.        Bet    74a
    includes            odds      of     5/1,       while          bet      74b       includes           odds    of
    1/12.
              The      current         market        line        is     moving         constantly,            as    a
    reflection              of     the       actual          market          level.               This      is   in
 20 relation            to    the      higher        or       lower        betting           opportunities,
    which        remain         at    static        fixed         odds       prices           (approximately
    10/11        in    this      example).             The      current market line                       is   4354
    and      includes          a   set      of    bets        76a      and     76b,      which        represent
    higher         and      lower      positions             that        are     both       accompanied          by
25  10/11        odds.           Additionally,                another          set     of      bets      78a    and
    78b      are       provided          at     derivations                of     the      current          market
    line.          These        two    bets       are     offered           at     levels         of   4361     and
    4348       respectively.                  Thus,       a     second         current          market       level
     (in    this        case     where        customers             can     bet      at    even      money)      is
30  provided and offers                      an    opportunity to                  bet on          whether the
    market         will       expire        above       or      below        a    market          spread.        In
    this        example,           a     thirteen             point         spread           straddles          the

    current market middle line                           and offers yet another betting
    opportunity for end user 12.
              Screen          page       70    also        includes        a   low     line.            This
    represents             a   constantly          moving        market      level     that       will      be
  5 circa        1%     (in     this     example)         of    the market       value       below        the
    current             market.                The         higher         and      lower          betting
    opportunities                reflect       constant          fixed      odds   prices         in    this
    example.             The      higher      odds will          be     (long)    odds-on         and     the
    lower        odds      will       be   (short)        odds-against.            Thus,       a     set     of
 LO bets        80a       and        80b    are     again        provided,         reflecting             the
    higher         and       lower       bets     respectively.                Additionally,              the
    odds      are      1/12       and    5/1    respectively             for bets      80a      and     80b.
    Other        expiries           may   also      be     accommodated         and    inclusive             of
    intraday            markets,          weekend          markets,         and    monthly           and/or
 L5 quarterly expirations.
              The        high         line      and         low      line,      in     addition              to
    reflecting              market       movements,            will     move    over      time.           The
    spread         between           the    high      line       and     the   market        line       will
    grow      more        narrow         (or   closer)          as    the    expiry      draws         near.
 20 This      is     also       true     for    the bet         evens     higher wager            and the
    lower evens bet                   (bets 78a and 78b).                  Thus,    such lines are
    floating:            not      only    in   the      sense       of market       movements,            but
    also      as     time       progresses          they will           move   and     narrow.            For
    example,          with        five    minutes         left      to   go  for    a  wager,          these
25  lines         will        be       quite       narrow.              Thus,     the       high        line
    generally              comes         down       (while          odds      remain        relatively
    consistent)              and the        low line          generally       goes up during the
    course of            the      trading day.              Note      also   that over          time,        as
    markets         close,          certain bets            may be       eliminated because                  of
30  practical             constraints.              Markets          generally       move      in      whole
    number          increments.                 Therefore,             spreads       that       are       too
    narrow         will       eliminate           certain         bets      (e.g.     bets       74b      and
    80a),        as    the      markets       draw       to    a    close.      This      offers        some

                                                          22
    constraint             on   such       a   scenario,           whereby          (for     example)       the
    high line            and the low line cannot be any closer than five
    or ten ticks apart.
              The 1/12          and 5/1          odds bets           (bets 74b and 80a and 74a
  5 and      80b)       reflect          odds      calculations               that        are    determined
    based        on    their      corresponding               lines        (i.e.        4404    and     4306).
    Thus,        in     an    example          wager,       consider            the      case     where     end
    user      12 bets $100              that the          FTSE will close above the high
    line        (provided           as     4404).           This        bet      provides          5/1    odds
 LO  (identified             as   bet      74a).         At     the     end      of     the   trading       day
    in this example,                  assume the FTSE                 closes at 4425.                  This  is
    a    winning          bet.          Settlement           would         then       ensue      where      end
    user      12    would       collect          $500     from the           winning bet            plus    his
    original          stake,        which would             yield       $600       total.         Using     the
 L5 same parameters,                  consider          a   second        end user           12   that    opts
    to    wager         on    the      lower       bet.          The     lower        bet     offers      1/12
    odds        (identified             as     bet     74b).           When       the      market       closed
    above such a prediction                         (a losing bet),                 end user 12 would
    lose       the      $100     that       he    bet.         If,     on     the      other      hand,     the
  0 FTSE       closed        at    4390       in   this      scenario,             end user         12   would
    be     rewarded           with        $100/12          (the       odds       offered)          plus     his
    original             stake.                This        would          yield           a     return       of
    approximately $108.33 for the winning bet.
              As    described           above,        the     price       that       is     being      offered
25  to end user 12,                 reflecting where the middle of the market
    is,     can be         provided          by a      communications                feed.        This    feed

 L5 12     in the context of a number of wagering opportunities.
              Financial             instruments               90    are      derived       from       a    wager
    that       is    made      with        respect          to   the       outcome      of    one      or more
    events          associated             with        a     financial          market.             Financial
    events          and       parameters                form        the       basis      for        financial
 20 instruments             90,      which reflect wagers                      in selected markets.
    The      events        might        involve          the     movement         or   the      value       of   a
    financial             market          index,          security,            or   other         instrument
    during         or     at   the       end     of     a    predetermined            period         of    time,
    as     described            above.              Such       instruments           may      include         all

              In     operation            of   an      example         embodiment,          the      movement

             Odds         determination                 module        84       of       processor             42

  5 particular            wager.           In    one      embodiment,           the     three        factors
    considered             in      setting         odds        are    the      underlying              market
    level,        volatilities,               and      time.        Volatility            represents             a
    measure         of      uncertainty             exhibited         by      the      market         over       a
    given       time       period.            Markets         generally         follow         log-normal
 LO distribution,                which        reflects          an    abstraction              or      theory
    that       allows         a    person         to     reasonably           approximate              market
    movements.                  In     this       sense,         the     mathematics               used       to
    calculate            odds         could       be      similar        to      that        of      options
    pricing.             In     other        scenarios,           odds     calculations               may     be
 L5 based       on exposure              for    an     owner/operator              of   gaming         system
    10.          Note        that        a     number         of    control          parameters              are
    provided          to       an     administer            of    gaming         system         10.          For
    example,          the        volatility             factor       may      be     manipulated              in
    response         to      breaking          news      that     would       most      likely         affect
 20 market         levels.                This       judgement          may        be     made         by     an
    administrator                 and        reflect           his     own         judgment            and/or
    expertise          in      market        theories.            In   other        scenarios,            such
    news        items         would         automatically              be       priced          into         the
    financial market.
25           In     an       alternative              embodiment,             odds       determination
    module 84          determines odds for                     a particular wager based on
    the following formula:                       odds =        (prize value /              risk value )
    *   factor.             Therefore,            odds      could     be      variable          based        (at
    least      in part) on the prize value and the risk value.                                                In
30  still      other embodiments,                    odds determination module                         84 may
    use or consider                 any number of influential                        factors        to vary
    odds      that       are      offered         to     end     users      12.        Any      number        of
    news      items,         statistical             data,       or   events,          may      affect        or

    influence           a   given       market.            These       factors          may     be   taken
    into      consideration             by    an    administrator                in    setting       odds.
    Such      factors        may     include       market         news       or     commentary,          job
    data,         interest           rate        information,                commodity             prices,

    domestic          product        (GDP)      data,        bond      prices,          or     any   other
    piece       of information or data that may have an influential
    effect        on    a   given      market       line.         For      example,          a   decrease
 LO in interest rates                generally spawns                an increase in the Dow
    Jones        Industrial          Average          (DJIA)        for      that       trading        day.
    Odds       determination             module         84     may      calculate            odds     in     a
    systematic            manner       (as   described            herein)          and     then     factor
    in     this       information           such       that       the      odds        are     generally
 L5 shifted         to    accommodate            for     the     probability              of    gains      in
    that       day's       market       performance.                 In      other        embodiments,
    such       information            is    built         into      the      market          line     in     a
    manner          that       is      suitable            to     an       administrator               and,
    therefore, such manipulations are unnecessary.
 20          In     an    example        scenario,           consider          that       the     S&P    500
    rarely       performs         poorly       in    an    election          year      in    the    United
    States.            Only      twice      in     the      history         of      the     U.S.     stock
    markets         has     the     S&P    500     provided          a    negative           return      for
    investors           during        an    election            year.            Thus,        during       an
25  election          year,      control        parameters           may       be     implemented          to
    reflect         the      proposition           that,         over       the      course        of    the
    year,       the      S&P     500    is    most       likely        to     rise.           Similarly,
    markets          tend       to     decline         in      times        of      war       or    during
    patterns          of   interest        rate       increases.              In    the      event     of    a
30  major        war      or     in     the     event         that       such        a    pattern         (of
    systematic            interest         rate       increases)             is      identified,           an
    administrator             could      again manipulate                the odds           (as    he sees
    fit)     to reflect this probable downward trend.

              In still        other scenarios, the                    odds associated with a
    market         may    be    established               based      on     the      current          market
    line      in     conjunction            with      the      proportion          of    money       bet      on
    that      market       versus         the    total        amount     of money           accumulated
  5 in    the      relevant        betting         pool.          Because        each      set     of     odds
    corresponds            to     a      percentage,            each     participant              is      also
    associated           with      a    percentage.              In   order        to    form      a     group
    of participants               for       a  bet      without       takeout,          gaming         system
    10    can     select participants                   from the        field of participants
 LO whose percentages                  total an         amount that corresponds to the
    odds.          The    percentage            corresponding             to     the     odds      is     also
    referred          to   as   a     target       percentage.              For example,              for     an
    even      money      bet      (i.e.,        target         percentage          of    50%),        if    the
    lead participant                 of     a  group       of participants               has     5-2      odds
 L5 and,      therefore,           is      associated           with    a    percentage           of      28%,
    gaming        system       10      may     form       the    group       of    participants               by
    selecting          other participants whose percentages                                   total       22%,
    such as         a participant having 7-2                       odds      (22%); participants
    having 4-1           odds      (20%) and 50-1 odds                  (2%); or participants
 20 having         7-1    odds        (12%)       and     9-1     odds      (10%).           In     another
    example,           for    a     bet       having         odds     of     2-1       (i.e.,          target
    percentage of             33%),        if the       lead participant                of a group of
    participants            has        6-1    odds       and,     therefore,           is     associated
    with      a   percentage             of   14%,      gaming      system         10    may     form the
25  group        of     participants              by      selecting          other        participants
    whose       percentages             total      19%,       such   as     participants              having
    9-1 odds          (10%) and 10-1 odds                    (9%); participants having 5
    1     odds       (16%)      and        30-1       odds       (3%);      or     a     single          other

30           As     the    number          of    participants            in     an    event       and       the
    odds      for particular participants                          in an event vary, it may
    be    difficult         to     assemble           a    group     of    participants              with      a
    total         percentage              of     exactly          the       target          percentage.

    Therefore,             an      administrator                of      gaming           system         10      may
    attempt         to    form       a    group        of     participants               having        a    total
    percentage           as close to the target percentage                                    as possible.
    In   a    particular             embodiment,              gaming         system        10       (e.g. via
  5 odds     determination               module          84)    may       establish           a   percentage
    threshold          to     be     used      to     determine            whether         odds      bets       may
    be   offered          for      a   particular             event.            For     example,          gaming
    system         10      may       establish              a     threshold              that       is      three
    percentage           points         above        or     below        the      target        percentage.
 LO In   this       example,          gaming         system         10     offers        an     odds      bet      if
    the     total        percentage              for      the      group        of      participants               is
    within       three       percentage             points         above        or below          the     target
    percentage.               Where          no    odds       bet      is      established             in     this
    scenario, gaming system 10 may convert an odds bet into                                                           a
 L5 straight          odds        bet        for      the      lead        participant.                   Gaming
    system       10     may     attempt          to     form       the      group       of    participants
    using any suitable number                          and combination of participants
    in the field of end users                          12.
            Note       that       in    still        other       scenarios,             the     market        line
 20 may be       static         or    fixed        over      a   given        time period,              whereby
    the    odds      may      be     varied        in     order       to     tempt        an end        user       or
    to   solicit          additional betting.                        For      example,          if   the      FTSE
    shoots        up      300       points         to      a    level         of      5000       in     morning
    trading, the             odds       can be         varied significantly                        (e.g. 50/1
25  or   100/1)        in     order to entice                  people to bet                that     the      FTSE
    will      close       below        the      original           market         line.          This      is      an
    unlikely             occurrence.                       Other           unlikely              occurrences

    corresponding               markets)            may       be     readily            appreciated             and
30  are,      thus,       clearly         within          the     scope        of     the     teachings            of
    gaming system 10.
             In     the     example           provided          above,         the      original          market
    line      (when the           FTSE       opened)         was     4700.          Thus,       if the        FTSE

                                                       29
    were at a level             of 5000,          odds would have to be attractive
    enough     to     persuade          a     potential            bettor        to      engage         in    a
    wagering      opportunity              involving            a   significant             decline        in
    the  FTSE.          Thus,       long        odds       prices       can      be      generated         in
  5 order to lure punters                   (i.e. bettors) to bet.                         Market odds
    could    be    refreshed            several            times      per      day       in     order      to
    provide new betting opportunities.
          Odds       determination                module          84    may       be      employed         in
    order      to        determine              odds          for       this         configuration.
 LO Additionally,               administrator                    module           50        may          also

25  present invention.          For example, end user 12 may be given
    the opportunity to bet on a rise or decline in price of a
    single security that is a publicly traded company.                          Thus,
    end  user      12   could   bet    on   whether     the    share     price        of
    Cisco, Systems        (NASDAQ: CSCO) would rise or fall during a
30  given     time      interval.          Moreover,       such      a     wagering
    opportunity could be accompanied by the eight bets as set
    forth   previously       with    reference     to  FIGURE     2.      In    still
    other   scenarios,       a  suitable       financial    vehicle       could       be
