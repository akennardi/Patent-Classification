   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5 This invention is directed to maleate salts of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3
   cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyll-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide,        crystalline   forms    thereof,

10 useful in the treatment of cancer.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Compounds derived from 3-cyanoquinoline have been shown to have anti-tumor activity, which
   may make them useful as chemotherapeutic agents in treating various cancers, including but
   not limited to, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, lymphatic cancer, parotid tumors, Barrett's
15 esophagus, esophageal carcinomas, head and neck tumors, ovarian cancer, breast cancer,
   epidermoid tumors, cancers of major organs, such as kidney, bladder, larynx, stomach, and
   lung, colonic polyps and colorectal cancer and prostate cancer.          Examples of compounds
   derived from 3-cyanoquinoline are disclosed and shown to possess anti-tumor activity in U.S.
   Pat. Nos. 6,002,008; 6,432,979; and 6,288,082.        One limitation of certain 3-cyanoquinoline
20 compounds is that they are not water soluble in a free base form.
   The crystalline form of a particular drug as a salt, a hydrate and/or any polymorph thereof is
   often one important determinant of the drug's ease of preparation, stability, water solubility,
   storage stability, ease of formulation and in-vivo pharmacology. It is possible that one crystalline
   form is preferable over another where certain aspects such as ease of preparation, stability,
25 water solubility and/or superior pharmacokinetics are deemed to be critical. Crystalline forms of
   (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4
   (dimethylamino)-2-butenamide salts that possess a higher degree of water solubility than the
   free base but are stable fulfill an unmet need for stable, crystalline, water-soluble forms of
   substituted 3-cyanoquinoline compounds that selectively inhibit kinase activity, which in turn
30 inhibit cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinoliny}-4
15 (dimethylamino)-2-butenamide is an irreversible inhibitor to Her-2 (also known as ErbB-2 or
   neu) kinase, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. EGFR family
   members have been implicated in tumorigenesis and associated with poor prognosis in tumor
   types in humans. The structure of the (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano
   7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide in the form of a free base is shown

   The compound (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}
   4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide in the form of a free base is described in U.S. Patent No.
   6,288,082. The compound is classified, based on the Biopharmaceutical Classification System,
   as a BCS Class IV compound (low water solubility and low permeability). The free base has low
 5 solubility in water, with a water solubility of about 1pg/mL at about pH 7. The water solubility
   increases with decreasing pH as the compound becomes ionized. This compound is water
   soluble at gastrointestinal pH, and dissolution is not rate limiting. There is a need for a form of
   this compound with improved physicochemical properties.
   The present invention provides a water-soluble acid addition salt form of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2
10 pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide.       The
   free base compound is capable of forming salts with a variety of pharmaceutically suitable
   acids.    Pharmaceutically suitable acids include, but are not limited to for example, acetic,
   fumuric, maleic, methanesulfonic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. The
   physicochemical properties of each acid addition salt form were evaluated to screen for an
15 optimal pharmaceutical salt form, as shown in Table 1.

 5 Of the nine salts, the maleate salt exhibited advantageous physicochemical properties. The
   maleate salt was crystalline and less hygroscopic. The mesylate salt was hygroscopic and less
   crystalline. The tosylate salt was even less attractive, primarily due to its higher molecular
   weight and safety concerns.           Although the acetate "salt" appeared to be crystalline, NMR
   revealed that the product prepared from acetic acid was in fact not a salt. The fact that the
10 product prepared from acetic acid was insoluble in water with a resulting alkaline pH confirmed
   that it largely retained the free base properties.

 5
   A   comparison     of   the    systemic      exposure   (SE)    data     for (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2
   pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide           has
   been conducted on data extracted from multiple preclinical studies in the rat. The analysis of
   these data indicated that, in the rat, administration of the compound as the maleate salt
10 provided a two-fold increase in AUC (area under concentration), as compared to the free base,
   when administered at a dose range of 5 to 45 mg/kg. The systemic availability of the compound
   as the free base was relatively low (20%), and the presence of significant amounts of drug in the
   feces could be attributed to poor absorption.        The increased solubility of the maleate salt
   appears to enhance the absorption of the compound in the rat. Table 3 presents the plasma
15 compound mean AUC and Cmax data observed in rats.

   In  addition    to    exhibiting    poor    water    solubility, the    compound        (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2
   pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide in the
   form of a free base interacts with emectic receptors in the stomach, giving rise to diarrhea in
10 mammals.       The maleate salt of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7
   ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide, however, unexpectedly mitigates such
   problems and minimizes emectic receptor interactions in mammals.
   The maleate salt is prepared by mixing (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3
   cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide (the free base) with maleic acid

   The reaction of the free base and maleic acid occurs at an elevated temperature of from about
   40 C to about 60 C, preferably between about 40'C to about 5000.               The ratio of water:n
 5 propanol may vary, for example between about 1:10 to about 1:5, and the optimal ratio of
   water:n-propanol is about 1:9.      The water-alcohol solution may comprise from about 5% to
   about 20% by volume water and from about 80% to about 95% by volume alcohol. The alcohol
   may be n-propanol. In one embodiment, the water-alcohol solution comprises about 10% by
   volume water and about 90% by volume n-propanol. The volume of the solvent solution may be
10 between about 8 to about 25 volumes, including about 10 to about 12 volumes. About 1.0-1.2
   equivalents of maleic acid is used per equivalent of the free base, preferably about 1.03
   equivalents of maleic acid per equivalent of the free base.
   The resulting solution of the maleate salt may be clarified by filtration prior to cooling. The
   cooling step may be continued until the solution reaches a temperature of about 450C or less,
15 including a temperature of about 390C or less, and more preferably to about 300C or less. In
   one embodiment, the solution is filtered after cooling to about room temperature, preferably from
   about 230C to about 25   0C.   Typically, the maleate salt begins to crystallize out of solution once
   the temperature reaches 370C or below. The solution may be allowed to sit for at least 12
   hours, preferably about 12 to about 15 hours at room temperature, and is then filtered and
20 washed to recover the crystalline maleate salt product.            The resulting filter cake may be
   washed with the same or a different water-alcohol solution to obtain the product. The product
   may be dried to obtain crystalline (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7
   ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate.         At this point, the maleate salt
   product recovered and isolated is typically in the form of the monohydrate form of the maleate
25 salt.
   The product may be dried under vacuum with heating to make the anhydrous form of the
   maleate salt (Form I) at about 70 to about 95% yield, preferably about 80 to about 95% yield.
   This product is usually better than about 98% pure, and often about 99% pure. Typically, the
   drying process is performed over about 12 to about 48 hours to get complete conversion of the
30 anhydrous form of the maleate salt to the monohydrate form of the maleate salt (Form II).

   Shorter drying times generally result in mixtures of the two crystalline forms.           The drying
   process is often performed at temperatures greater than room temperature.                     In one
   embodiment, drying of the maleate salt is performed at a temperature greater than about 300C,
   preferably from about 400C to about 60 C, and in another embodiment at about 50C.
 5 The maleate salt is soluble in many polar solvents, which will be known to one skilled in the art,
   but dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is often used if a small solvent volume is desired. The DMSO
   solution can be heated to about 45 C to about 6000 to further enhance solubility. Once the
   anhydrous maleate salt is in solution, water may be added, typically quickly, causing the
   crystallization that provides the crystalline monohydrate form upon filtration. The anhydrous salt
10 may be dissolved in a solvent, for example DMSO, and to this solution may be added an
   aqueous solution of water and an organic solvent, for example such as tetrahydrofuran (THF),
   isopropanol (IPA), n-propanol, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and acetonitrile. In one embodiment,
   the organic solvent used is IPA, in another embodiment it is n-propanol, and in a third
   embodiment a mixture of these two organic solvents is used. The water content of the aqueous
15 solution can be as little as 5%, but may be about 7.5% or greater, and in one embodiment is
   between about 10% and about 15%. The resulting solution then may be allowed to sit for up to
   about 24 hours, and in one embodiment is allowed to sit for between about 12 hours and about
   24 hours, to allow for crystallization to occur.     Filtration of the mixture yields a crystalline
   monohydrate form of the maleate salt. For purposes of this invention, the term "organic solvent
20 and water" refers to a solution of an organic solvent, such as for example tetrahydrofuran (THF),
   DMSO, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or acetonitrile, and water wherein the organic
   solvent comprises greater then 50% of the solution by volume.
   The invented maleate salt of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy
   6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide was isolated in three different crystalline forms:
25 an anhydrous form (Form 1), a monohydrate form (Form II) and a partially hydrated form (Form
   Ill), which comprises a mixture of Form I and Form II.

   (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4
   (dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate as a monohydrate (Form II) is characterized by X-ray
   diffraction peaks (XRD) at the following angles (±0.200) of 20 in its X-ray diffraction pattern:

   25.69, 26.17, 27.06, 27.58, 28.26, 28.73, and 29.77. In a separate embodiment, the isolated
   crystalline    form    of    (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6
   quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate monohydrate exhibits an X-ray diffraction
   pattern wherein all of the X-ray diffraction peaks are at about the 20 angles disclosed above.
15 As used herein, the term isolated means that more than 50% of the crystalline (E)-N-{4-[3
   chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2
   butenamide maleate salt present is one of Forms I and II. In one embodiment, at least 70% of
   the crystalline (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}
   4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate salt present is one of Forms I and II. In a second
20 embodiment, at least 80% of the maleate salt present is one of Forms I and II. In a third
   embodiment, at least 90% of the maleate salt present is one of Forms I and II.
   The two crystalline forms of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy
   6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate, exhibit distinct XRD patterns and peaks.
   The XRD pattern for each maleate salt form is unique to that salt form.        The XRD patterns of
25 Forms I and II were determined by using techniques and equipment known to those skilled in
   the art of analytical chemistry and X-ray crystallography. XRD patterns were produced using
   powder samples and are comprised of a set of diffraction peaks, which can be expressed in 2
   theta angles, d-spacing and/or relative peak intensities.         The XRD patterns are shown in
   Figures 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Collection parameters for the X-ray data provided in Figures 1, 7 and 8
30 were as follows: voltage 40 kV; current 40.0 mA; 5.00- 30.00 degree scan range; Bruker D8
   Advance instrument; scan step size 0.01     0; total scan time 30 minutes; using a Vantec-1 detector
   and Ni filter. The X-ray data in Figures 5 and 6 were collected as follows: voltage 30 kV; current
   15 mA; 3-40 degree scan range; 2.00 0/min; Rigaku Miniflex bench top X-ray diffractometer.
                                            -15-

   The two-theta diffraction angles and the corresponding d-spacing values account for the
   positions of the peaks found in a XRD pattern. D-spacing values are calculated with observed
   two theta angles and copper Ka1 wavelength using the Bragg equation. Variations in these
   numbers can result from using different diffractometers and also from the method of sample
 5 preparation.     However, more variation can be expected for the relative peak intensities.
   Therefore, identification of the various forms should be based upon the observed two-theta
   angles and the d-spacings, and less importance should be given to the intensities. One skilled
   in the art would understand that the XRD patterns of Forms I and II obtained as described
   herein could contain additional peaks.       Additionally, a skilled artisan would recognize that
10 whether all the peaks are observed for a given form may be highly dependent on the
   concentration level of the form. Figure 1 illustrates XRD scans of the two crystalline forms of
   the maleate salt, Form I and II. The crystalline anhydrous maleate salt form, Form I, is shown
   on the bottom, while the crystalline monohydrate form of the maleate salt, Form II, is shown on
   top.
15 The relative stability and hygroscopicity of the two crystalline forms of the maleate salt was
   studied in detail by dynamic vapor sorption (DVS).        The anhydrous form of the maleate salt
   absorbs water easily and converts to the crystalline monohydrate form of the maleate salt. Upon
   drying or a drop in the relative humidity, the crystalline monohydrate form of the maleate salt
   converts to the anhydrous form of the maleate salt, as summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 is a
20 dynamic      vapor   sorption   isotherm     plot  which    shows    that    (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2
   pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide
   maleate, Form I, gains moisture above 40% relative humidity (RH), especially at 60% RH and
   above. Figure 2 also shows that Form 11loses water at 20% RH and below, especially at 10%
   RH and below. DVS was performed under the following conditions: RH was set at 0%, 30%,
25 52.5%, 75% and 90%, with the sample exposed for 3 hours at each RH for two full cycles.
   The two crystalline forms of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy
   6-quinolinyll-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate exhibit distinct DSC traces. A DSC plot
   of both Form I and Form II of the maleate salt is summarized in Figure 3. Form I of the maleate
   salt exhibits one endothermic peak, indicating a transition temperature of 202.490 C. Form II of
30 the maleate salt exhibits two endothermic peaks, a broad endotherm having an onset
   temperature of 550 C corresponding to loss of water and a second endotherm indicating a
   transition temperature of 202.810 C. The transition temperatures are observed in the range of
   about 196-2042C at which melting and decomposition occurs.                    DSC data, transition
   temperatures and heat flow, were collected using a TA instrument model Q1000 with the
35 following parameters: 50 mL/min purge gas (N2 ); scan range 40 to 240       0C, scan rate 10 0C/min.
   Pure, crystalline solids have a characteristic transition temperature, the temperature at which
                                           -16-

   point the substance changes state, in the present case the solid transitions to a liquid. The
   transition between the solid and the liquid is so sharp for small samples of a pure substance that
   transition temperatures can be measured to 0.10C.          Because it is difficult to heat solids to
   temperatures above their transition temperatures, and because pure solids tend to transition
 5 over a very small temperature range, transition temperatures are often used to help identify
   compounds. Measurements of the transition temperature of a solid can also provide information
   about the purity of the substance. Pure, crystalline solids transition over a very narrow range of
   temperatures, whereas mixtures transition over a broad temperature range. Mixtures also tend
   to transition at temperatures below the transition temperatures of the pure solids.
10 TGA data of the monohydrate and anhydrous forms of the maleate salt are summarized in
   Figure 4. Form II of the maleate salt is characterized by a water content of about 2.5 to 2.7% by
   weight, as measured by TGA, based on the weight of the compound as a monohydrate. TGA
   data were collected using a TA Instrument Model Q. A heating rate of 10 'C/min between 30
   220   0C was used and the TGA chamber was under 40 mL/min flow of nitrogen.
15 A third crystalline form of the maleate is salt is observed and referred to as the partial hydrate
   (Form Ill), as observed from XRD. The partial hydrate is a mixture of Form I and Form II of the
   maleate salt. The partially hydrated (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7
   ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate (Form 111), is characterized by a
   water content of about 0.8 to about 2.4% by weight, including about 1.5% to about 2.3% by
20 weight, based on the weight of the compound.
   [0001]Figure 5 includes an XRD scan of each of anhydrous Form I, monohydrate Form 11and
   partial hydrate Form Ill of (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6
   quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate after exposure of the anhydrous form of
   the maleate salt to a relative humidity of 75% at an ambient temperature of 20-250C for 22 days.

   pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyll-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide
   maleate in Form 1. The anhydrous form of the maleate salt absorbs water and partially converts
   to the monohydrate form of the maleate salt at an ambient temperature of 20-250C over 24
   hours. The monohydrate form of the maleate salt is relatively stable at an ambient temperature
30 of 20-250C for 24 hours. Figure 7 illustrates an XRD scan of crystalline (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2
   pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide
   maleate in Form II, before and after exposure to relative humidity of 50-60% at an ambient
   temperature of 20-25'C for 24 hours. Exposing the monohydrate form of the maleate salt to
                                            -17-

   higher temperatures (> 500 C) or heating under reduced pressure promotes water loss and full
   conversion back to the anhydrous form of the maleate salt.
   Form I, the anhydrous form, is readily converted to the monohydrate form, Form II. Form I can
   absorb water and convert partially to the monohydrate at a temperature of 20-25 0 C and a
 5 relative humidity (RH) of 50-60% over time, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 is an XRD scan of
   crystalline        (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4
   (dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate in Form I before (lower scan), and after (upper scan)
   exposure to relative humidity of 50-60% at room temperature of 20-25 0 C for 24 hours. Hydrate
   peaks appear in the upper scan, indicating that the crystals absorb water under these
10 conditions.
   The      stability      of   both      forms       of   the      maleate       salt    of      (E)-N-{4-[3-chloro-4-(2
   pyridinylmethoxy)anilino]-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide                              was
   evaluated in closed and open containers at                   40 0 C  and 75% RH.          Both Form I and Form 11
   remained stable for 6 months under these conditions. In the open containers, the anhydrous
15 form of the maleate salt rapidly absorbed one mole of water to form the monohydrate form of
   the maleate salt.          Samples in the closed containers remained dry.                       HPLC purity analysis
   indicated no significant increase in degradation products in both open and closed conditions for
   up to 6 months. The data is summarized in Table 5.

   The wet cake in all experiments contains the monohydrate form of the maleate salt, which
 5 converts to the anhydrous form of the maleate salt after drying.

   cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl}-4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide maleate salt is dimethylsulf oxide
   (DMSO). Cooling, anti-solvent and evaporative crystallization were performed in mixtures of
    DMSO and isopropanol or t-butyl methyl ether (tBME). The approach led to the decomposition
 5 of the solute in many cases. Anti-solvent and evaporative crystallization did not result in any
   new crystalline forms, as summarized in Tables 8 and 9.

   According to one embodiment, one way to convert anhydrous Form I into monohydrate Form II
   is by dissolving the salt into a solution of an organic solvent, for example such as THF,
   isopropanol (IPA), n-propanol, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and acetonitrile, and water, where in
   the water present is about 5% to about 20% by volume, though typically the water present is
15 about 10% to about 15% by volume. This solution may be heated to increase solubility of the
   maleate salt; in one embodiment it is heated to about 45'C or greater, in another embodiment it
   is heated to about 60"C. The solution is then allowed to sit for a period of hours to allow for
   crystallization, and the crystals are then filtered to give monohydrate Form II (see Table 6). In
   one embodiment the solution is allowed to sit for between about 12 and about 24 hours before
20 filtration.
                                             -20-

   According to a separate embodiment, Form I is converted to Form 11by re-slurrying it in organic
   solvent containing water and allowing the solution to stand exposed to the room temperature for
   several days, as shown in stability studies summarized in Table 10. This conversion will take
   place even in anhydrous solvents that have absorbed up to 1% water because anhydrous Form
 5 I readily absorbs moisture, as evidenced by Figure 8. In one embodiment the re-slurry is
   allowed to stand for about 14 days.

10 The present invention is also directed to compounds associated with the free base or the

   4-(dimethylamino)-2-butenamide, or the methods of this invention.        One or more of these
   associated compounds may be found in the cooled solution in a process of this invention. Since
   these compounds may not be separated from the maleate salt, a pharmaceutical formulation
15 prepared with the maleate salt may contain one or more of these compounds.
   Formulations of the maleate salt were prepared and stored in 40 0C/75%RH stability chambers
   for six months and in a 560C oven for one month. Samples were periodically pulled for testing.
   Samples were dissolved in 50/50 volume/volume acetonitrile/water with a concentration at about
   0.5 mg/mL. The solutions were assayed directly using LC/MS methodology to identify any
20 degradation products and impurities (referred to herein as associated compounds) at six
