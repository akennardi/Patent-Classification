CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]
       This application claims the benefit of Japanese
Patent Application No. 2016-258007 filed on December 30,
2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein
by reference.
FIELD
[0002]
       The present invention relates to a system that
manages playing cards and gaming chips and a storage box
that stores playing cards and gaming chips.
BACKGROUND AND   SUMMARY
[0003]
       Among many table games carried out in casinos and
game facilities, baccarat and blackjack are known.     In
these games, a standard deck composed of 52 playing cards
is used and normally distributed from a chute including a
plurality of shuffled decks    (six to nine or 10 decks)
before a game is started.    Also in casinos and game
facilities, a large number of gaming chips to be used in
these games are used.
[0004]
       Gaming chips are put into a chip tray on a game table
                                1

and after each game ends, the casino side collects and
stores won chips   (loser's chips)   in the chip tray and also
pays out the gaming chips to the winner from the chip tray
as a settlement of bets.
[0005]
       When gaming chips of the chip tray run short, lacking
chips are directly transported from a cage         (cashier) of the
casino to the  chip tray,  which is    filled   therewith.   When
gaming chips are transported from the cage to the chip tray,
gaming chips are housed in a dedicated case         (for example, a
case capable of housing 100 chips) for transportation.
Conversely, when gaming chips in the chip tray become
excessive, excessive chips are directly transported to the
cage of the casino after being housed in the dedicated case.
[0006]
       To measure gaming chips inside a casino, a
conventional technology that measures the quantity and the
amount of money of gaming chips     for monitoring by embedding
RFID in a gaming chip and reading RFID is known.          A
technology that manages gaming chips on the game table,
gaming chips  stored in the chip tray, and gaming chips of
the cage by using an RFID attached chip is publicly known
and disclosed in Patent Document     1    (U.S. Pat. No.
5,735,742).
[0007]
       It is difficult to prevent fraud and losses only by
managing gaming chips in a portion of casinos such as the
                               2

table, the chip tray, or the cage.   Particularly when
gaming chips are moved between the chip tray and the cage,
it is difficult to prevent theft and losses of gaming chips
and so continuous monitoring of gaming chips inside casinos
is demanded.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF NON-LIMITING EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
[0037]
        (First embodiment)
       A  first embodiment provides a system that monitors
gaming chips of a casino in real time and the system can
handle an error when the error occurs by managing all
gaming chips    in the casino.  The first embodiment further
provides a system of continuous monitoring that,     in
addition to management of gaming chips, prevents losses
because if a shuffled playing card package is once lost in
a casino, someone may know the alignment thereof and the
package may not be used in a game.
[0038]
       A  system that manages gaming chips according to the
first embodiment of the present invention will be described
below.    FIG. 1 is an explanatory diagram providing an
overview of a table game of casino according to an
embodiment of the present invention.     In the present
embodiment, a game table 21 includes a betting area 24
where a betting person 2 places a gaming chip 3 as a bet
and a chip tray 17    capable of housing a plurality of gaming
chips to collect a lost chip 3L and redeem a won chip 3W
after each game ends.     Also, a card shooter apparatus 25
placed on the game table 21, having a card reader that
reads the number    (rank) of a mark of the card 6, and having
                                15

a controller 27 that determines the winner according to
rules of a table game based on information of the number
(rank) of the card 6 successively read by the card shooter
apparatus 25 is installed.
[0039]
       An increase/decrease amount of the gaming chips   3 in
the chip tray 17 before/after collection of the lost chip
3L and redemption of the won chip 3W can be calculated by
comparing the total of the gaming chips 3 in the chip tray
17 before collection of the lost chip 3L and redemption of
the won chip 3W and the total of the gaming chips 3 in the
chip tray 17 after collection of the lost chip 3L and
redemption of the won chip 3W.    The total of the gaming
chips 3 in the chip tray 17 before collection of the lost
chip 3L and redemption of the won chip 3W and the total of
the gaming chips   3 in the chip tray 17 after collection of
the lost chip 3L and redemption of the won chip 3W can be
detected by embedding RFID indicating its quantity in the
gaming chip 3 and providing an RFID reader 18 in the chip
tray 17.
[0040]
       FIG. 2A is a perspective view of a dedicated chip
case 100 to house a plurality of gaming chips 3 used in
casinos.   The chip case  100 includes an upper portion 101
and a lower portion 102.    In the present embodiment, the
upper portion 101 and the lower portion 102 are made of
transparent resin.    A light transmission portion that
                               16

allows light to transmit may also be provided so as to be
able to image housed gaming chips using a camera.         Also in
the present embodiment, the case 100 has a sealing
structure made of the upper portion 101 and the lower
portion 102, but the light transmission portion may be in a
perforated state.
[0041]
       In the present embodiment, the case 100 has a shape
in which five columns, in each of which 20 pieces of the
gaming chip 3 are overlaid and housed, are     formed in
parallel and in the example of FIG. 2A, the cross section
of each column is polygonal   (octagonal) so that the upper
portion 101 and the lower portion 102   roughly match the
shape of a gaming chip C.
[0042]
       A unique chip case ID code  103 is attached to the
chip case 100.   The chip case ID code 103  is   related    to a
chip ID code 4 of the gaming chip 3 housed in the chip case.
[0043]
       FIG. 2B is a perspective view of a case 100'
according to a modification.   The case  100' is also made of
an upper portion 101' and the lower portion 102        constructed
of transparent resin.   In the present modification, the top
surface is formed from a flat surface.    By changing to the
flat surface, a linear shadow due to edges of a polygonal
cross section of the case 100'   does not appear in the
camera so that information of the side face of the gaming
                              17

chip 3 can correctly be identified in image analysis of a
shot image of the camera.
[0044]
       FIG. 3 is an explanatory diagram providing an
overview of a management system of gaming chips     installed
beside the game table 21 and using a storage box 200
storing a plurality of the chip cases    100 in which the
gaming chips   3 are housed.  The gaming chips  3 for
replenishment are housed in the storage box 200 while being
put into the chip case 100 and when the gaming chips     3 in
the chip tray 17 run short, a dealer 11 takes out the chip
case 100 together with the gaming chips 3 for replenishment
from the storage box 200 to set the chip case 100 to the
chip tray 17.    When the gaming chips 3 in the chip tray 17
become excessive, the excessive gaming chips 3 can be put
into the chip case 100 and housed in the storage box 200.
Thus, the storage box 200 is placed by the dealer 11 beside
the game table 21.
[0045]
       When the chip cases 100 stored in the storage box 200
and housing the gaming chips 3 run short, as many the chip
cases 100 as necessary can be moved from a cage     (cashier)
201 in a casino for replenishment.    When the chip cases 100
stored in the storage box 200 become excessive, the chip
cases 100 that are excessive are moved to the cage 201.
[0046]
       The chip case ID code  103 is attached to the chip
                               18

case 100 and the chip case   ID code 103 attached to the chip
case 100 is continuously read by one or a plurality of
readers for reading chip case ID 202 installed inside the
storage box 200.
[0047]
       The storage box 200 also includes one or a plurality
of chip readers that reads the chip ID code 4 of all the
gaming chips   3 stored.
[0048]
       A control apparatus 204 has a function to output the
total number of the gaming chips   3 stored in the storage
box and all the chip ID codes 4 stored in the storage box
by monitoring the chip ID code 4 read by a chip reader 203.
[0049]
       The control apparatus 204 has a function to output
whether an increase/decrease amount or increase/decrease
value of the gaming chips 3 placed in the chip tray 17 of
the game table 21 or an increase/decrease amount or
increase/decrease value of the gaming chips 3 placed in the
cage 201 that manages the gaming chips 3 of a casino and an
increase/decrease amount or increase/decrease value of the
gaming chips   3 housed in the storage box 200 match.
[0050]
       Whether the chip case  100 placed in the storage box
200 is inside the storage box 200 may be monitored by the
control apparatus   204 at fixed intervals  (for example,
every one minute, every five minutes, every one hour or
                               19

more) .   The storage   box 200 may have the     reader for reading
chip case ID 202 to read the chip case ID code          103 of the
chip case 100 arranged in a drawer 205 of the storage box
200.    The  reader for reading chip case      ID 202 and the chip
reader 203 of the storage box 200 may be a bar code reader
R  (alternatively, an RFID tag reader or QR code         (registered
trademark) reader      (not shown) may be used instead of the
bar code reader R) .     The  reader for reading chip case     ID
202 and the chip reader 203 may be installed so as to be
able to scan in the X direction and Y direction to read all
ID codes of the chip cases        100 by a scan unit 53   installed
in  the drawer    205.  Also,  a   transmission unit  206 to
transmit    information obtained by the reader for reading
chip case ID 202 and the chip reader 203 to the outside of
the storage box 200 is provided.         The storage box 200 has a
lock unit 207 to prevent the chip case 100 from being taken
out from the storage box 200 by opening the drawer 205.
The lock unit 207 is unlocked only while an authorized
person of a casino puts in or takes out the chip case 100
from the storage box 200.        Only an authorized person of a
casino can operate the lock unit 207.
 [0051]
        The storage box 200 includes the lock unit 207 to
prevent the drawer 205 from opening and the lock unit 207
may include a warning unit        (may be wireless) to notify that
the drawer 205 has opened.        When a notification that the
drawer 205 has opened is received         (or when appropriate),
                                    20

the storage box 200 may be imaged by a nearest monitoring
camera 29 to record taking in or out of the chip case 100
from the storage box 200 by an authorized person or others.
By recording such behavior       (images in which the storage box
200 is opened),     the fact that the chip case 100 can be
taken in or out from the storage box 200 only while the
lock unit 207 is unlocked by an authorized person        (while
the drawer   205 is   opened)  can be  confirmed.  By monitoring
such images, the presence of all the chip cases        100 inside
the storage box 200 can be confirmed.
 [0052]

        <Description of Gaming chip>
        Next, a gaming chip according to an embodiment of the
present invention will be described.        FIG. 4 is a
perspective view of a state in which the gaming chips 3 are
stacked and FIG. 5 is a sectional side elevation of the
                                  21

gaming chip 3.     As shown in FIG. 4, the gaming chip 3 has
at least a 5-layer structure in which a common color layer
122 has printing 123     (such as 100 points) indicating the
kind  (value) of the gaming chip 3 done on the surface         (the
upper surface and the undersurface),        a transparent layer
120 is provided on the outermost        layer, and layers are
thermocompression-bonded.      These gaming chips 3 are formed
by using a plastic material in a long and narrow shape,
forming a closely adhering condition         (such as a 5-layer
structure) in which each layer       (a designated color layer
121, the common color layer 122, and the transparent layer
120) is thermocompression-bonded in a long state, and then
stamping into a circular shape or rectangular shape by
press or the like.     An R finish    (round angle) is given to
edges of the transparent layer 120 in the outermost layer
by designing dimensions of the die and punch of the mold to
stamp when stamped by press.
[0054]
       Further, the gaming chip 3 is provided with a mark M
in UV ink or carbon black ink on the surface of the common
color layer   122.   The mark M indicates     genuineness  of the
gaming chip 3 and becomes visible when an ultraviolet ray
(or an infrared ray) is applied thereto to indicate
authenticity by its shape or a combination of numbers.            The
transparent layer 120 is thermocompression-bonded or coated
as the outermost layer like covering the printing 123 and
the mark M and the transparent layer 120 are embossed to
                                 22

prevent the gaming chips 3 from coming into close contact
with each other.
[0055]
       An R finish  (R) is given to edges of the transparent
layer 120 in the outermost layer where the printing 123
(such as 100 points) is done to prevent the surface of the
common color layer 122   from appearing on the side face
after being discolored during the stamping process of
gaming chip 3.   Also, the R finish prevents hands and other
gaming chips  3 from being damaged by otherwise remaining
sharp edges of the gaming chip 3.
[0056]
       The designated color layer 121 may be formed from, as
shown in FIG. 5, a plurality        (three layers in FIG. 5) of
layers colored in the designated color.         The plurality
(three layers in FIG. 5) of layers colored in the
designated color is thermocompression-bonded to each other
and thus, the 3-layer structure is not visible as shown in
FIG. 5 and FIG. 5   shows the three layers of the designated
color layer  121 from a description       viewpoint.  Further,  a
hollow B is partially provided in the center layer of the
three layers of the designated color layer 121 and an RFID
tag 125 is contained therein.
[0057]
       As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the gaming chip 3 has a
stacked multilayer structure and a striped pattern in a
lamination direction is clearly formed on the side face so
                                  23

that, when compared with a conventional gaming chip, the
color   (the kind of gaming chip) of the designated color
layer 121 and the number can be measured easily and
correctly by the image analysis.    The side face of the
gaming chip 3 can be photographed by a camera so that the
designated color layer 121 can clearly be identified.
Further, if, in addition to the image analysis, an AI
utilizing computer or control system and deep learning
(structure) technology are used, the analysis and
determination of images can be made more correct.     The AI
utilizing computer or control system and deep learning
(structure) technology are already known and available to
persons skilled in the art and so a detailed description
thereof is omitted.
[0058]
       Next, an overview of a management system of gaming
chips and shuffled playing cards using the storage box
according to a second embodiment of the present invention
will be described.    In the second embodiment of the present
invention, both of gaming chips and packages of shuffled
playing cards are managed.
[0059]
       FIG.  6 is an explanatory diagram providing an
overview of a package of shuffled playing cards used in a
table game of a casino and aligned randomly being used in
the casino according to an embodiment of the present
invention.    In the present embodiment, shuffled playing
                               24

cards 301S are packed as a package 302 and the package 302
is unpacked so that the shuffled playing cards       301S can be
used for games on the table and set to the card shooter
apparatus 25.    During the game, the dealer 11 draws out
cards 301 from the card shooter apparatus 25 and
distributes the cards    301 to the game table 21.     Cards of
each shuffled playing card 301S with a predetermined number
of decks   (usually 6,8,9 or  10 decks) are produced so as to
be randomly shuffled and uniquely randomly aligned
individually and packed together with a package ID code 304
attached to the package 302 as a bar code       303 individually
identifiable by the bar code reader R.       RFID  (or an RF tag)
may be attached to the ID code 304     instead of or together
with the bar code 303.
[0060]
       (Second embodiment)
       FIGS. 7 and 8 are explanatory diagrams providing an
overview of a management system of gaming chips and
packages of   shuffled playing cards using the storage box
according to the second embodiment of the present invention.
The embodiment of the present invention provides a
management system of the gaming chips      3 and the packages
302 of the shuffled playing cards 301S to play a game
(baccarat).    The gaming chips   3 for replenishment   are
housed in the storage box 200 while being put into the chip
case 100 and when the gaming chips 3 in the chip tray 17
run short, the dealer 11 takes out the chip case 100
                                25

together with the gaming chips 3 for replenishment from the
storage box 200 to set the chip case    100 to the chip tray
17.  When the gaming chips 3 in the chip tray 17 become
excessive, the excessive gaming chips    3 can be put into the
chip case 100 and housed in the storage box 200.     The
storage box 200 also houses the package 302 to be used for
the next game and the dealer 11 takes out the package 302
to be used for the next game from the storage box 200 and
sets the shuffled playing cards    301S to the card shooter
apparatus 25.
[0061]
       The chip case ID code  103 is attached to the chip
case 100 and the chip case   ID code 103 attached to the chip
case 100 is continuously read by the reader for reading
chip case ID 202 installed inside the storage box 200.
Also, the package ID code 304    is attached to the package
302 and the package ID code 304 attached to the package 302
is continuously read by a reader for reading package ID 305
installed inside the storage box 200.
[0062]
       The storage box 200 includes one or a plurality of
the readers for reading package ID 305 that reads the
playing card ID code of all   stored shuffled playing cards
and also one or a plurality of the chip readers 202,     203
that reads the case ID code of all the stored chip cases.
[0063]
       The control apparatus 204 has a function to output
                               26

the total numbers of the shuffled playing cards     301S and
the chip cases 100 stored in the storage box 200 and all
the package ID codes 304   and all the chip case   ID codes 103
stored in the storage box 200 by monitoring the playing
card ID code read by the reader for reading package ID 305
and the chip case ID code 103 read by the chip reader 203.
[0064]
       The control apparatus 204 has a function to grasp an
increase/decrease of the chip cases 100 housed in the
storage box 200 by periodically monitoring the case     ID code
103 of the chip case 100 and, when the increase/decrease is
grasped, to output the total amount after the
increase/decrease of value of all the gaming chips 3 housed
in the storage box 200.
[0065]
       Whether the chip case  100 and the package 302 placed
in the storage box 200 are inside the storage box 200 may
be monitored by the control apparatus    204 at fixed
intervals   (for example, every one minute, every five
minutes,  every  one hour or more) . The  storage box 200 may
have the reader for reading package ID 305 to read the ID
code 304 of the package 302 of shuffled playing cards and
the reader for reading chip case ID 202 to read the chip

camera 29 to record taking in or out of the package 302 of
the chip case from the storage box 200 by an authorized
                                 28

person or others.    By recording such behavior   (images in
which the storage box 200 is opened),    the fact that the
package 302 can be taken in or out from the storage box 200
only while the lock unit 207 is unlocked by an authorized
person   (while the drawer 205 is opened) can be confirmed.
By monitoring such images, the presence of all the packages
302 inside the storage box 200 can be confirmed.
[0067]
       FIG.  9 is a diagram providing an overview of a system
that manages packages of shuffled playing cards and chip
cases housing gaming chips according to the second
embodiment of the present invention.     As another embodiment
of the storage box 200, the storage box 200 may have a
plurality of the readers for reading package ID 305 to read
the package ID code 304 and a plurality of the readers for
reading chip case ID 202 to read the chip case     ID code 103
in an upper portion inside the storage box 200.      By moving
each of the scan unit 53 arranged in an upper portion of
the storage box 200 in the Y direction, each ID code reader
moves in the Y direction to read all of the package ID code
304 of the package 302    in each column below each ID code
reader and the chip case ID code 103 of the chip case 100.
The storage box 200 has a drawer and the package 302 and
the chip case 100 can be taken in or out by opening or
closing the drawer.    The  storage box 200 includes a lock
unit 56 to prevent illegal pilfering of the package 302 and
the chip case 100.    Further, as another idea, the storage
                                29

box 200 may include as many ID code readers as the maximum
numbers of the packages 302 and the chip cases    100 that can
be stored in an upper portion inside the storage box 200.
[0068]
       (Third embodiment)
       The present embodiment relates to, like the second
embodiment, improvements of technology to read ID of the
gaming chip 3 and the playing card 6 in the storage box 200.
Incidentally, matters described in the first or second
embodiment can also be applied to the third embodiment.
[0069]
       When RFID tags are attached to different items   such
as gaming chips and playing cards for management, RFID tags
of the same frequency are normally used and content of each
item is written into the RFID tag.    Accordingly, content of
the item can be recognized by reading the RFID tag.     In a
clothing store, for example, RF tags using radio waves of
the same frequency are attached to socks and shirts and
information about whether an item is a shirt or socks
(information indicating the type of an item) is written
into each RF tag.   Then, by reading the RF tag, whether the
item is socks or a shirt can be recognized.
[0070]
       For security items like gaming chips and playing
cards used in casinos, however, the security level demanded
may be different  from item to item.   Also, circumstances in
which RFID tags of all kinds of   security items can be read
                              30

by the same reading device         (RFID reader) is dangerous and
it is desirable to use a separate reading device for each
security item.
 [0071]
        The present embodiment is developed in view of the
above circumstances, and an object thereof is to improve
safety when a plurality of types of security items is
managed by RFID.
 [0072]
        Hereinafter, a system according to the present
embodiment will be described specifically with reference to
the drawings.    In  the description      that follows, the
description is omitted when appropriate by attaching the
same reference signs to the same elements as those in the
above embodiments.     FIG. 10 is a diagram showing the
configuration of a system according to the present
embodiment.    A system 500 manages the package 302 of the
shuffled playing cards     301S and the gaming chips 3.       The
system 500 includes the game table 21 to play card games
and the storage box 200 to store the playing cards          6 and
the gaming chips    3 used in card games.
 [0073]
        The game table 21 is formed linearly on a side
corresponding to the dealer position where the dealer is
positioned and formed like an elliptic curve on a side
corresponding to the player position where players are
positioned.    The chip tray 17 to house the gaming chips 3
                                     31

of the game table 21.    Games are played on the game table
21 using the playing cards    6 and the gaming chips 3.
[0074]
       The chip tray 17 is embedded in the game table 21 by
a removable method.    The dealer collects the gaming chips 3
bet by the losing player from the game table 21 and houses
the gaming chips   3 in the chip tray 17 and then pays out
the gaming chips   3 to the winning player from the chip tray
17.
[0075]
       The gaming chip 3 to be used is the same as that
described in the first embodiment and contains the RFID tag
125 as a wireless tag and also has a striped pattern on the
side face.   In the RFID tag 125,   chip ID that uniquely
identifies the gaming chip 3 and information indicating
value of the gaming chip 3 are stored.     Also, the color of
the striped pattern on the side face indicates value of the
gaming chip 3.
[0076]
       The card shooter apparatus 25 is installed on the
game table 21.   The  card shooter apparatus 25 is configured
in the same manner as in the first embodiment and playing
cards of the predetermined number of decks pulled out from
the package 302 are housed in the card shooter apparatus 25
and taken out one by one from an outlet by the dealer to be
submitted to a card game.
                                32

 [0077]
          Playing cards housed in the card shooter apparatus 25
are provided as the package or container              (hereinafter,
simply called      "package")     302.    Playing cards   constituting
the predetermined number of decks are             shuffled randomly and
individually constituted as the package 302.               The package
302     is configured in the same manner as in the first
embodiment.      In the present embodiment, an RFID tag 306 is
attached to the package 302 as a wireless tag.                 Package ID
that uniquely identifies each of the packages 302                   is stored
in the RFID tag 306.        Incidentally, the RFID tag 306 may be
embedded or included in the package 302.
 [0078]
          The storage box 200 has a cabinet form and has a
plurality     of drawers.     In   the present   embodiment,       an upper
drawer is a chip drawer 210 as a chip storage box or chip
storage means that houses the gaming chips              3 and a lower
drawer is a card drawer 220 as a card storage box or card
storage means that houses the packages 302 of shuffled
playing     cards.   That is,    the gaming chips 3 and the
packages 302 are housed in different drawers of the storage
box 200.      Also, the storage box 200 is integrally
configured by including the chip drawer 210 as a chip
storage box and the card drawer 220 as a card storage box.
 [0079]
          The chip drawer 210 stores a plurality of the gaming
chips 3 used on the game table 21.             The  card drawer 220
                                       33

stores a plurality of the packages 302 of    shuffled playing
cards carried from a card room and inserted into the card
shooter apparatus  25 on the game table 21.    The chip drawer
210 and the card drawer 220 include the lock unit 207 as an
opening/closing lock apparatus.
[0080]
       The storage box 200 is arranged in the dealer
position under the game table 21 as a position easy to
access from the dealer and difficult to access from players.
Also, the storage box 200 is provided with the control unit
204 and the transmission unit 206 similar to those in the
first embodiment.   The control unit 204 is configured by a
management program in the present embodiment being executed
by a computer including a storage apparatus.     The
transmission unit 206 communicates with other devices by
wire or by wireless.
[0081]
       FIG. 11 is a perspective view of an example of the
card drawer 220.   The card drawer 220 of the example in FIG.
11 has a size capable of housing three units of the package
302 in the width direction and three units in the depth
direction, and maximally nine units of the package 302.     A

        The storage box 200 further includes a reader for
reading package ID 601     connected to the card antenna 602
and the reader for reading package ID 601 is connected to
the control unit 204.      The reader for reading package ID
601 is an RFID reader and reads information stored in the
RFID tag 306 attached to the package 302 via the card
antenna 602.     The card antenna 602 extends in the depth
direction of the sidewall and can read the RFID tag 306 of
all the packages 302 housed in the card drawer 220.       The
card RFID reader 601,     the card antenna 602,  and the RFID
tag 306 attached to the package 302 constitute a card RFID
system 600.
 [0083]
        FIG. 12   is a plan view of another example of the card
RFID system 600.      The card drawer 220 of the card RFID
system 600 in this example has a size capable of housing
three units of the package 302 in the width direction, six
units in the depth direction, and maximally 18 units of the
package 302.     A total of six units of the card antenna 602,
two units in the width direction and three units in the
depth direction are provided on the undersurface of a
member covering the card drawer 220 on the storage box 200
from above    (a member partitioning the chip drawer 210 and
the  card drawer    220).  Using the six units  of the card
antenna 602,    the RFID tags 306 attached to 18 units of the
package 302 that can be housed.
 [0084]
                                 35

       The six units of the card antenna 602 are connected
to the card RFID reader 601 as a reader for reading package
ID.  In this case, a plurality of the card RFID readers 601
is provided and one of the card RFID readers     601 may be
connected to one of the card antennas    602 or one of the
card RFID readers 601 may be connected to a plurality of
the card antennas    602. Thus, the RFID tags 306 of all the
packages 302 housed in the card drawer 220 can be read by
one or the plurality of card RFID readers 601.
[0085]
       In the example of FIG. 12,  the card antenna 602   is
provided in a plate member partitioning the chip drawer 210
and the card drawer 220 in the storage box 200, but instead,
the card antenna 602 may be provided at the bottom of the
card drawer 220 in the same arrangement as in FIG. 12.
[0086]
       FIG. 13  is a plan view of an example of a chip RFID
system 700.    In the example of FIG. 13,  the chip RFID
system 700 has a size capable of housing three units of the
chip case 100 in the width direction and two units in the
depth direction, and maximally six units of the chip case
100.   Incidentally, the chip case  100 is configured in the
same manner as the chip case 100 in the first embodiment.
That is, the chip case 100 has a plurality of columns
housing the gaming chips 3 by being stacked in the
thickness direction and the chip case 100 can house 100
pieces of the gaming chips    3.
                                36

[0087]
       A pair of left and right chip antennas 702
sandwiching the chip case 100 from both sides are provided
in each housing position of the six units of the chip case
100.   The chip antenna 702   is provided on the undersurface
of a member covering the chip drawer 210     (a top plate of
the storage box 200)    in the storage box 200 and extends
downward.   The  chip antenna 702  is connected to a chip RFID
reader 701 as a reader for reading chip ID.      In this case,
a plurality of the chip RFID readers 701 is provided and
one of the chip RFID readers 701 may be connected to one of
the chip antennas    702 or one of the chip RFID readers 701
may be connected to a plurality of the chip antennas      702.
Thus, information stored in the RFID tags 125 of all the
gaming chips   3 housed in the chip drawer 210 can be read by
one or the plurality of chip RFID readers 701.      The chip
RFID reader 701, the chip antenna 702, and the RFID tag 125
contained in the gaming chip 3 constitute a chip RFID
system 700.
[0088]
       In the example of FIG. 13,   the chip antenna 702   is
provided in the top plate of the storage box 200, but
instead, the chip antenna 702 may also be provided on the
upper surface of the bottom of the chip drawer 210 in the
same arrangement as in FIG. 13.
[0089]
       Hereinafter,   control of the control unit 204 will be
                                37

described.   First, the control unit 204 has a function
similar to that in the first and second embodiments.     The
control unit 204 grasps the number of the packages 302
housed in the card drawer 220 of the storage box 200 and
their package IDs based on read results of the RFID tag 306
attached to the package 302 by the card RFID system 600.
[0090]
       Also, the control unit 204 grasps the number of the
gaming chips   3 housed in the chip drawer 210 of the storage
box 200, their chip IDs,    and value thereof based on read
results of the RFID tag 125 contained in the in the gaming
chip 3 by the chip RFID system 700.     The control unit 204
further determines the total amount of value of the gaming
chips 3 housed in the chip drawer 210 based on the number
of each value of the gaming chips 3 housed in the chip
drawer 210.
[0091]
       The card RFID system 600 and the chip RFID system 700
periodically read the RFID tag 125 and the RFID tag 306 at
predetermined intervals and output read results to the
control unit 204 together with table ID that identifies the
game table 21.    The control unit 204 monitors read results
of the card RFID system 600 and the chip RFID system 700
and, when read results vary, detects the variations and
records the table ID and read results in the storage
apparatus together with the relevant date and time.
Instead, the control unit 204 may record all read results
                                38

of the card RFID system 600 and the chip RFID system 700 in
the storage apparatus together with the relevant date and
time and table ID.    Alternatively, the control unit 204 and
the lock unit 207 may be linked so that the control unit
204 records read results when the lock unit 207 is unlocked.
[0092]
       A warning unit   (for example, a warning lamp or an
alarm output speaker) may be connected to the control unit
204.   In such a case, all package IDs and chip IDs that can
be detected are stored in the storage apparatus of the
control unit 204 and the control unit 204 determines
whether the read package ID or chip ID matches one of
package IDs and chip IDs stored in the storage apparatus.
If the read package ID or chip ID matches none of package
IDs and chip IDs stored in the storage apparatus, the
control unit 204 may control the warning unit to output a
warning   (for example, a warning lamp is turned on or an
alarm is output from an alarm output speaker).
[0093]
       If two units of the package 302 or more decrease at a
time  (the package 302 is normally fetched one unit at a
time) or the number of the gaming chips 3 is not a multiple
of 100   (100 pieces of the gaming chips 3, which is the
maximum number that can be housed, are normally housed in
the chip case 100 before being housed in the chip drawer
210),  the control unit 204 detects such movement as illegal
movement of the package 302 or the gaming chip 3 and may
                                39

record the movement or output an alarm.
 [0094]
        In the storage box 200, as described above, the
housing location of the gaming chips      3 and that of the
packages 302 are physically separated, but are only
separated inside the storage box 200 and are not apart on
the order of meters.     Thus, it is necessary to avoid
interference between the card RFID system 600 and the chip
RFID system 700.
 [0095]
        In the present embodiment, therefore, different
frequencies are adopted for the card RFID system 600 and
the chip RFID system 700.     A  specific example is as
follows:   In the present embodiment, the electromagnetic
induction type is adopted for the chip RFID system 700 and
its  frequency band used is    the HF band  (MODE3) . The HF
band   (MODE3) is a short-wave band of    13.56 MHz.  The chip
antenna 702 is formed in a coil     shape.   Also, the RFID tag
125 contained in the gaming chip 3 is provided with a coil
shaped antenna.    The antenna of the gaming chip 3
transmits/receives    radio waves of the HF band to/from the
chip antenna 702 and also obtains operating power of the
RFID tag 125 by receiving radio waves of the HF band from
the chip antenna 702.
 [0096]
        The HF band has a short communication range and
directivity and thus, the area to be read can be limited to
                                 40

a predetermined range and reading of the gaming chip 3 in a
position that should not be read can intentionally be
prevented.   When the RFID tag 125 of the gaming chip 3
housed in the chip tray 17 is read, the RFID tag 125 of the
gaming chip 3 on the game table 21 can be prevented from
being read.   Further,  when the gaming chip 3 housed in   the
chip tray 17   is read, each column can be read while
avoiding interference between columns by dividing the
antenna for each column.    The gaming chips 3 are used and
managed by being stacked and by using the HF band, reading
can be done even if the gaming chips    3 are stacked and a
plurality of the RFID tags 125 are congested.
[0097]
       On the other hand, the radio wave type is adopted for
the card RFID system 600.    Its frequency band is the UHF
band and ultra-high frequencies in the 900 MHz band are
used.   The card antenna 602 radiates radio waves to space.
The RFID tag 306 is also provided with an antenna and radio
waves radiated to space are    received by this antenna.   The
UHF band   (ultra-high frequency) has higher frequencies than
the HF band   (short-wave band) and thus, the wavelength
becomes shorter, which is advantageous for miniaturization
of the antenna.    In addition, the UHF band generally has a
longer communication range than the HF band.
[0098]
       In the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 12,   a
patch antenna is used as the card antenna 602 of the card
                                41

RFID system 600 using the UHF band and a dipole antenna is
used for the RFID tag 306 of the package 302.       The RFID tag
used in the UHF band is generally small and its memory
capacity is small and so can be manufactured at low cost.
The package 302 is disposed of after playing cards are used
together with playing cards and thus, being at low cost is
advantageous.     Because the communication range of the UHF
band is long, even if the packages 302 are put in a carton
or further stacked on a pallet, the packages 302       contained
in such a carton or pallet can be read together.
[0099]
       FIG. 14   is an explanatory diagram showing movement of
the cards   6 in a management    system using the storage box
according to the third embodiment of the present invention.
The playing cards     6 are housed and stored in the package
302 in a card room.      The package 302  includes the playing
cards  6  (shuffled playing cards    301S) of eight decks
aligned in random order by being shuffled.       The storage box
200 is provided for each of the game tables 21.       When the
stock of the package 302     in the storage box 200 gets   short,
the storage box 200 is replenished with the package 302
from the card room.      In such a case, the storage box 200
may be replenished with a pallet of a plurality of the
packages 302    (for example, nine packages) from the card
room.
[0100]
       The card shooter apparatus 25 is installed on the
                                  42

game table 21.   Also, the game table 21 is provided with a
disposal port 28 into which the playing card 6 to be
disposed of is inserted.    In a card game    (baccarat in the
present embodiment),   the playing cards 6 are pulled out one
by one  from the card shooter apparatus     25 by the dealer and
placed on the game table   21.    When one game ends,   playing
cards  6a on the game table 21 used for the game are
disposed of through the disposal port 28.       When a cut card
is drawn from the card shooter apparatus 25, playing cards
6b remaining in the card shooter apparatus       25 are disposed
of through the disposal port 28.      The playing cards   6
disposed of through the disposal port 28 are transported to
the disposal  location.
[0101]
       According to the present embodiment, as described
above, the card RFID system 600 and the chip RFID system
700 use mutually different     frequencies to prevent
interference of radio waves with each other and read errors
due to interference of package ID attached to the package
302 and chip ID attached to the gaming chip 3 are minimized.
To reliably prevent interference, a shielding means        (for
example, a shielding plate) that blocks radio waves may be
provided between chip drawer 210 and the card drawer 220.
[0102]
       In the above embodiments, card ID that uniquely
identifies the package 302 of shuffled playing cards        is
attached to the package 302, but as a modification, in
                                 43

place thereof or in addition thereto, the card RFID system
600 may be constructed by causing each of the playing cards
6 to contain the RFID tag.    In   such a  case, card  ID that
uniquely identifies each of the playing cards       6 is stored
in the RFID tag contained in each of the playing cards         6.
[0103]
       In the above embodiments, chip ID that uniquely
identifies the gaming chip 3 is attached to each of the
gaming chips   3, but as a modification, in place thereof or
in addition thereto, the chip RFID system 700 may be
constructed by attaching the RFID tag to the chip case 100.
In such a case, chip case ID that uniquely identifies the
chip case is stored in the RFID tag attached to each of the
chip cases 100.
[0104]
       Also in these modifications, mutual interference can
be prevented by adopting frequencies of radio waves used by
the card RFID system 600 and the chip RFID system 700.
[0105]
       Further, in the above embodiments and their
modifications, the RFID tag is caused to store code
information that uniquely identifies an item       (the package
302, the gaming chip 3 and the like) to which the RFID tag
is attached, but information stored in the RFID tag may be
other information.    For example, the RFID tag may be caused
to store information indicating the type of an item to
which the RFID tag is attached      (for example, information
                                44

indicating a package to the RFID tag 306 attached to the
package 302 and information indicating a gaming chip to the
RFID tag 125  contained in  the gaming chip  3) . Also in this
case, the numbers of the packages 302 and the playing cards
6 can be grasped by the card RFID system 600 and the
numbers of the gaming chips   3 and the chip cases 100 can be
grasped by the chip RFID system 700.
[0106]
       Also in the above embodiments, frequencies of the UHF
band are used for the card RFID system 600 and frequencies
of the HF band are used for the chip RFID system 700, but
as long as frequency bands used for the card RFID system
600 and the chip RFID system 700 are different,    frequencies
of radio waves used for the card RFID system 600 and the
chip RFID system 700 are not    limited to the above example.
[0107]
       Also in the above embodiments, the card RFID system
600 adopts the radio wave type and the chip RFID system 700
adopts the electromagnetic induction type, but the types of
the card RFID system 600 and the chip RFID system 700 are
not limited to the above types and appropriate types may be
adopted in accordance with the frequency band of radio
waves to be used and other factors.
