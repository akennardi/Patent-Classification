          PEANUT GLUTAMOYL T-RNA REDUCTASE AND APPLICATION
                                            THEREOF
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001] The invention relates to the field of gene engineering technology, in particular
 5 to a peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase, and further to an application of the peanut
   glutamoyl t-RNA reductase.
   BACKGROUND
   [0002] As a liposoluble pigment, chlorophyll (Chl) exists in chloroplasts of higher
10 plants. Chlorophyll plays an extremely important role in photosynthesis of plants, is
   capable of absorbing and converting solar energy, and decomposing water molecules
   into oxygen molecules and reducible oxygen in the process, and plays a very
   important role in the electron transfer chain of cells, thus starting an energy
   conversion process. Therefore, chlorophyll plays a very important role in plant growth
15 and development, as well as the crop quality and yield formation. The starting
   material of chlorophyll biosynthesis is L-glutamoyl-tRNA, which is reduced to
   L-glutamate-1-semialdehyde through the catalysis by GluTR. Then, aminolevulinic
   acid (ALA), a key precursor substance for chlorophyll biosynthesis, is formed through
   catalysis by glutamate-1-semialdehyde transaminase. GluTR is a central controller in
20 chlorophyll biosynthesis, and is encoded by the glutamoyl t-RNA reductase (HEMA)
   gene. Therefore, HEMA is a key enzyme gene that regulates the chlorophyll synthesis
   pathway. There may be certain differences in the number of HEMA members of
   different plants. There are three HEMA members, namely HEMA1, HEMA2 and
   HEMA3, in a model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and there are only two genes
25 (HEMA1 and HEMA2) in cucumber.
   [0003] However, the peanut HEMA gene has never been reported at home and abroad,
   and its role in regulating the process of stress physiology and senescence physiology
   of plants is still unknown.
30 SUMMARY
   [0004] In order to fill the above gap in the research on the role of the peanut HEMA
   gene in regulating the process of stress physiology and senescence physiology of
   plants in the prior art, the application discloses a peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase.
   [0005] The invention further relates to an application of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA
                                                  1

   reductase.
   [0006] The invention is obtained through the following steps:
   An application of a peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase in regulating the expressions
   of chlorophyll and calmodulin.
 5 [0007] In the application, the amino acid sequence of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA
   reductase is preferably represented by sequence 4 in the sequence list.
   [0008] In the application, the nucleotide sequence of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA
   reductase is preferably represented by sequence 3 in the sequence list.
   [0009] In the application, the application of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase in
10 regulating the expression of calmodulin is preferably reflected as that the expression
   level of calmodulin is also increased in strains with overexpression of the peanut
   glutamoyl t-RNA reductase gene under salt stress conditions.
   [0010] In the application, the application of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase in
   regulating the expressions of chlorophyll and calmodulin is preferably specifically
15 reflected as that the biosynthesis of chlorophyll is also increased after overexpression
   of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase gene under normal conditions and after salt
   stress treatment.
   [0011] As one of the necessary nutrient elements for plant growth and development,
   calmodulin is involved in the whole process of a plant from germination to growth,
20 differentiation, blossom and fructification. The main functions of calcium ion in a
   plant include: (1) promoting the formation of microtubules as a nutrient substance; (2)
   the cell wall structures and tissues and the membrane fluidity; (3) reducing the toxic
   effects of salt stress; and (4) promoting the growth and extension of pollen tubes.
   Peanut is a crop that needs more calcium, and the required quantity of calcium is
25 second only to that of nitrogen, is higher than that of phosphorus, and is equivalent to
   that of potassium. When peanut is short of calcium, the seed development will be
   blocked, the fruit shell tissue will be loose, hollow fruit, blighted fruit and rotten fruit
   will be increased, and the yield will be significantly decreased. Research on the
   mechanism of Ca 2 + in regulating the stress physiology of peanut and relationship
30 between it and chlorophyll synthesis process has very important significance for
   clarifying the calmodulin utilization law in peanut growth and development and
   guaranteeing high peanut yield.
   [0012] The invention has the following beneficial effects: the invention has identified
   functions of the peanut glutamoyl t-RNA reductase, namely, regulating the
                                                2

   expressions of chlorophyll and calmodulin, and clarified the interaction and
   relationship between the reductase and calcium signals, thereby laying the theoretical
   foundation for later researches.

   DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
   [0014] The invention is further described below in conjunction with the embodiments.
   Example 1
   1. Separation of an AhhemA gene
25 RNA was extracted from peanut leaves using RNA kit (purchased from Tiangen
   Biotech Co., Ltd) and reversely transcribed. According to the gene sequence, primers
   were designed. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out between primer
   sequences 5 '-ATGGCTGTTTCGACGAGC-3' and 5 '-TTAGCTGTCACTATGGTT-3'.
   Detection by agarose gel electrophoresis shows that the size of an amplified fragment
30 of the PCR product was consistent with that of the estimated fragment (1626 bp) (Fig.
   1).
   [0015] The resulting PCR product was linked to a pMD18-T cloning vector to
   transform E. coli. Positive clones were quickly selected by colony PCR. Plasmids
   were extracted from the positive clones, and digested using internal enzyme digestion
                                                3

   sites of the vector to obtain a band with the same size as the PCR product. The
   identified bacterial solution was sent to Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd for
   sequencing. As shown in sequence 3 of the sequence list, the resulting fragment
   sequence is found to be the to-be-cloned target gene by comparison with a known
 5 sequence with Blast, DNAman or DNAclub software.
   [0016] 2. Analysis on an AhhemA gene sequence
   Sequence 3 in the sequence list:
   (a) Sequence characteristics
   *Length: 1626 bp
10 *Type: nucleic acid
   *Chain type: double chain
   *Topological structure: linear
   (b) Molecule type: cDNA
   (c) Hypothesis: No
15 (d) Anti-sense: No
   (e) Initial source: peanut
   Sequence 4 in the sequence list:
   (a) Sequence characteristics
   *Length: 541 amino acids
20 *Type: amino acid
   *Chain type: single chain
   *Topological structure: linear
   (b) Molecule type: protein
   3. Analysis on the biochemical properties of an AhhemA gene coding protein
25 3.1 Analysis on the hydrophobicity of an AhhemA gene coding protein
   Analysis on the hydrophobicity of a protein encoded by a peanut glutamoyl t-RNA
   reductase gene shows that the proportion of hydrophilic amino acids is not
   significantly different from that of hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 2), where the
   proportion of hydrophilic amino acids is slightly higher, indicating that the protein is a
30 water-soluble protein.
   [0017] 3.2 Analysis on the transmembrane properties of an AhhemA gene expression
   product
   By submitting the AhhemA amino acid sequence to an online PRED-TMR database
   on the Internet, it is predicted that there is no transmembrane signal region in the
                                              4

   protein structure of the enzyme (Fig. 3).
   [0018] 4. Analysis on the expression of the AhhemA gene in a peanut plant
   4.1 Expressions of AhhemA in different organs of peanut
   In order to know about the endogenous expressions of the AhhemA gene in different
 5 organs, a fragment of cDNA at 3'-terminal of the peanut AhhemA gene was analyzed
   as a primer by fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results show that the Ahhema gene
   is expressed in all organs, which is constitutive expression, its expression in leaf is
   significantly higher than its expression in other organs, and its expression in root is
   the lowest, showing that the expression level of the AhhemA gene is high in tissues
10 with high chlorophyll content (Fig 4).
   [0019] 4.2 After growth under normal conditions for three weeks, peanut plants were
   treated with 200 mM NaCl for 3 days. Then after exogenous application of calcium
   respectively at different concentrations: 0, 10, 20, 40, 80 mM (recorded as CK, C1O,
   C20, C40, C80, Normal (unsalted control group)), samples were collected to detect
15 AhhemA expression by fluorescence quantitative PCR and detect the chlorophyll
   content, as shown in Fig. 5. The results show that the exogenous application of
   calcium plays a role in negatively regulating the peanut hemA under salt stress
   conditions, and the expression of this gene is downregulated. However, the
   chlorophyll content is not affected by calcium application, and shows an upward trend,
20 indicating that the action site of calcium signals in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway
   is very likely to be downstream of hemA.
   [0020] After exogenous spraying of ALA obtained by catalyzed synthesis from
   AhhemA under salt stress conditions, expressions of the catalytic subunit ChlH and
   ChlD genes at the active center of a magnesium chelatase are upregulated, and reach a
25 peak after treatment with 1Omg/l ALA, as shown in Fig. 6.
   [0021] 5. Construction of a plant expression vector of the AhhemA gene
   5.1. Amplification of the AhhemA gene
   A peanut variety "Huayu 22" was provided by Shandong Academy of Agricultural
   Science, and the AhhemA gene coding region was amplified by RT-PCR.
30 [0022] hemA-F (5'-TCTAGAATGGCTGTTTCGACGAGC-3') (XbaI); sequence 5 in
   the sequence list,
   hemA-R(5'-GGATCCTTAGCTGTCACTATGGTT-3')                    (BamiHI); sequence 6 in the
   sequence list, and
   the primer sequences respectively correspond to 1st-18th bases and 1612th-1626th
                                               5

   bases of the Ahhema gene.
   [0023] 5.2 Linkage of the AhhemA gene to a cloning vector pMD18-TSimple and a
   plant expression vector pBIl21
   When a eukaryotic expression vector was constructed, a full-length gene obtained by
 5 PCR was linked to the cloning vector pMD18-TSimple (purchased from TaKaRa),
   and the     linkage  product was transformed        into E.   coli Trans5a    to obtain
   kanamycin-resistant colonies. Plasmids were extracted from the selected positive
   clones after bacterial solution enrichment, and were digested with XbaI and BamHI. A
   band including the full-length AhhemA after enzyme digestion was recycled. Then a
10 vector pBIl21 was digested with an identical enzyme, and the resulting vector
   fragment was recycled. In this way, the resulting full-length sequence and vector
   sequence carried complementary sticky ends, were linked, and then transformed into
   E. coli. Recombinants were identified and selected by enzyme digestion to construct
   an expression vector pBI 121 -AhhemA.

15 for 20 min; and

   [0030] 2xCTAB buffer solution for extraction (100mL): 10mL of IM Tris- Cl; 4mL of
   0.5 MEDTA; 8.182g of NaCl; 2.Og of CTAB; and 3.Og of PVP. The above ingredients
   were dissolved in distilled water, and then diluted to 100 mL. After sterilization,
20 200pL of P-mercaptoethanol (p-ME) was added for later use.
   [0031] 7.2. PCR detection of transgenic plants
   Genomic DNA of regeneration plants was extracted for PCR amplification of primers
   designed using the above vector sequences and the AhhemA gene sequence. PCR
   process: 95'C for 5min; 95'C for 50s, 55'C for 50s, 72'C for 1min and 30s, totally 30
25 cycles; 72'C for 10min. PCR identification of transgenic plants is shown in Fig. 7,
   and the positive rate reaches 76.4%.
   [0032] 8. Identification of functions of plants transformed with the AhhemA gene
   8.1 Determination of chlorophyll content: Strains OE2, OE5 and OE8 with high
   expression levels were selected from transgenic tobacco to determine the chlorophyll
30 content. The results show that the chlorophyll content in transgenic plants is
   significantly higher than that in wild type plants under normal conditions; after salt
   stress treatment, the chlorophyll content is decreased in both plants, but the
   chlorophyll content in transgenic plants is still lower than that in wild type plants,
   suggesting that the chlorophyll biosynthesis is increased to some extent after
                                               8

   overexpression of the AhhemA gene, and contributing to improving the stress
   resistance of plants. (see Fig. 8-2)

   AhhemA gene The expression of the calmodulin gene in wild type plants and
 5 transgenic plants was detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR after treatment with
   200mM NaCl for 3 days. The results in Fig. 8 show that under salt stress conditions,
   the expression level of calmodulin in strains with over-expression of the AhhemA
   gene is also increased, further proving that the action site of calcium signals in the
   chlorophyll synthesis pathway is downstream of hemA.

   embodiments of the invention are not limited to the examples, and all alterations,
   modifications, combinations, substitutions and simplifications made without departing
   from the spiritual essence and principle of the invention shall be equivalent
