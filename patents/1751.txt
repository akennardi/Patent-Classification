                             FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS B
    Background Art
 5  The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
    virus of the Hepadnavirus family (Hepadnaviridae).Its genome contains 4 overlapping
    reading frames: the precore/core gene; the polymerase gene; the L, M, and S genes, which
    encode for the 3 envelope proteins; and the X gene.
    Upon infection, the partially double-stranded DNA genome (the relaxed circular DNA;
10  rcDNA) is converted to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the
    host cell and the viral mRNAs are transcribed. Once encapsidated, the pregenomic RNA
    (pgRNA), which also codes for core protein and Pol, serves as the template for reverse
    transcription, which regenerates the partially dsDNA genome (rcDNA) in the
    nucleocapsid.
15  HBV has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. HBV
    has infected approximately 2 billion people worldwide of which approximately 350
    million people have developed chronic infections. The virus causes the disease hepatitis B
    and chronic infection is correlated with a strongly increased risk for the development
    cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
20  Transmission of hepatitis B virus results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids,
    while viral DNA has been detected in the saliva, tears, and urine of chronic carriers with
    high titer DNA in serum.
    An effective and well-tolerated vaccine exists, but direct treatment options are currently
25  limited to interferon and the following antivirals; tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir,
    entecavir and telbivudine.
    In addition, heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) were identified as a class of HBV
    inhibitors in tissue culture and animal models (Weber et al., Antiviral Res. 54: 69-78).

    There is a need for additional HBV inhibitors that may overcome at least one of these
    disadvantages or that have additional advantages such as increased potency or an increased

    and another HBV inhibitor.
    Definitions
    The term "C1- 3 alkyl" or CI-C 4 alkyl as a group or part of a group refers to a hydrocarbyl
15  radical of Formula C.H        2n+ 1 wherein n is a number ranging from I to 3. In case C 1 _3 alkyl is
    coupled to a further radical, it refers to a Formula C.H        2n.. C 1 _3 alkyl groups comprise from 1
    to 3 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms. C 1 _3 alkyl includes all linear, or
    branched alkyl groups with between 1 and 3 carbon atoms, and thus includes such as for
    example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and i-propyl.
20  C 14 alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated
    hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as the group defined for
    C 1 _3 alkyl and butyl and the like.
    C 1 _6 alkyl, C2 _6 alkyl and C3 _6 alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched
    chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or from 2 to 6
25  carbon atoms or from 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C 1_4alkyl and
    pentyl, hexyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like.
    As used herein, the term "3-7 membered saturated ring" means saturated cyclic
    hydrocarbon with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 carbon atoms and is generic to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,
30  cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl or C3 -, C 4 -, C5 -, C6 - or C7 _cycloalkyl .
    Such saturated ring optionally contains one or more heteroatoms, such that at least one
    carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, 0 and S, in particular from N
    and 0. Examples include oxetane, tetrahydro-2H-pyranyl, piperidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl,
    morpholinyl, thiolane 1,1-dioxide and pyrrolidinyl. Preferred are saturated cyclic
35  hydrocarbon with 3 or 4 carbon atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Examples include oxetane, and
    tetrahydrofuranyl.

   WO 2015/059212                                                            PCT/EP2014/072690
                                                     -4
    The term halo and halogen are generic to Fluoro, Chloro, Bromo or Iodo. Preferred
    halogens are Fluoro and Chloro.
    It should also be noted that the radical positions on any molecular moiety used in the
 5  definitions may be anywhere on such moiety as long as it is chemically stable. For
    instance pyridyl includes 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl; pentyl includes 1-pentyl, 2
    pentyl and 3-pentyl.
    A bond indicated with                 indicates the attachment of the indicated fragment to the
10  main structure of the molecule.
    Positions indicated on phenyl (e.g. ortho, meta and/orpara) are indicated relative to the
    bond connecting the phenyl to the main structure. An example with regard to the position
    of R 1 , any location is indicated relative to the nitrogen (*) connected to the main structure:
                                                        R1

    When any variable (e.g. halogen or C14 alkyl) occurs more than one time in any
    constituent, each definition is independent.
    For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the
20  counter ion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a
    pharmaceutically unacceptable counter ion may also find use, for example, in the
    preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I). All
    salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the
    present invention.
25
    The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the
    compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using
    the appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g.
    hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; hemisulphuric, nitric; phosphoric and the like
30  acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, aspartic, dodecylsulphuric, heptanoic,
    hexanoic, nicotinic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic,

    maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,
    p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.
    Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate
 5  base into the free base form.
    The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms that the
    compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g.
    hydrates, alcoholates and the like.
    The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. For example, tautomeric
10  forms of amide (-C(=O)-NH-) groups are iminoalcohols (-C(OH)=N-). Tautomeric forms,
    although not explicitly indicated in the structural formulae represented herein, are intended
    to be included within the scope of the present invention.
    The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used
15  hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the
    same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not
    interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless
    otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses
    the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may
20  possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic
    molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the
    compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are
    intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.
25  Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are
    defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the
    same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term
    'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric
    excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other
30  possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and
    none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric
    excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94%
    up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%.
    The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a
35  similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the
    diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.

   WO 2015/059212                                                           PCT/EP2014/072690
                                                       -6
    Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be
    obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be
    separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with
    optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid,
 5  ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be
    separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure
    stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure
    stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the
    reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said
10  compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods
    will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.
    The diastereomeric forms of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional
    methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed
15  are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column
    chromatography.
    The present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the
    present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but
20  different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of
    Hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.

    Further combinations of any of the embodiments are also in the scope of the present
    invention.
    Preferred compounds according to the invention are compounds 1-35 or a stereoisomer or
15  tautomeric form thereof as referenced to in Table 1.
    In a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition
    comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of
    formula (I) as specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A prophyl
20  actically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prevent HBV infection
    in subjects being at risk of being infected. A therapeutically effective amount in this
    context is an amount sufficient to stabilize HBV infection, to reduce HBV infection, or to
    eradicate HBV infection, in infected subjects. In still a further aspect, this invention relates
    to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which
25  comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically
    or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein.
    Therefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be
    formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate
30  compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically
    administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an
    effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active
    ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,

   WO 2015/059212                                                           PCT/EP2014/072690

    which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation
    desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary
    dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by
    parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any
 5  of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols,
    oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions,
    syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin,
    lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills,
    capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules
10  represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid
    pharmaceutical carriers are employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually
    comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid
    solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which
    the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose
15  solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid
    carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form
    preparations intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In
    the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises
    a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with
20  suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a
    significant deleterious effect on the skin. The compounds of the present invention may also
    be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation in the form of a solution, a suspension or
    a dry powder using any art-known delivery system.
25  It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical
    compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit
    dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages,
    each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce
    the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.
30  Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets),
    capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions
    and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.
    The compounds of formula (I) are active as inhibitors of the HBV replication cycle and
35  can be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of HBV infection or diseases associated with
    HBV. The latter include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to
    cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

    Due to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HBV properties, the compounds of
    formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, are useful in the inhibition of the HBV replication
    cycle, in particular in the treatment of warm-blooded animals, in particular humans,
    infected with HBV, and for the prophylaxis of HBV infections. The present invention
 5  furthermore relates to a method of treating a warm-blooded animal, in particular human,
    infected by HBV, or being at risk of infection by HBV, said method comprising the
    administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I).
    The compounds of formula (I), as specified herein, may therefore be used as a medicine, in
10  particular as medicine to treat or prevent HBV infection. Said use as a medicine or method
    of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HBV infected subjects or to subjects
    susceptible to HBV infection of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated
    with HBV infection or an amount effective to prevent HBV infection.
15  The present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds in the manufacture
    of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HBV infection.
    In general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from about
    0.01 to about 50 mg/kg, or about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg body weight. It may be
    appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at
20  appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage
    forms, for example, containing about 1 to about 500 mg, or about 1 to about 300 mg, or
    about I to about 100 mg, or about 2 to about 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage
    form.
25  The present invention also concerns combinations of a compound of formula (I) or any
    subgroup thereof, as specified herein with other anti-HBV agents. The term "combination"
    may relate to a product or kit containing (a) a compound of formula (I), as specified above,
    and (b) at least one other compound capable of treating HBV infection (herein designated
    as anti-HBV agent), as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use
30  in treatment of HBV infections. In an embodiment, the invention concerns combination of
    a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof with at least one anti-HBV agent. In a
    particular embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I)
    or any subgroup thereof with at least two anti-HBV agents. In a particular embodiment, the
    invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof
35  with at least three anti-HBV agents. In a particular embodiment, the invention concerns
    combination of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof with at least four anti
    HBV agents.

    The term anti-HBV agent also includes compounds capable of treating HBV infection via
    immunomodulation. Examples of immunomodulators are interferon-a (IFN-a), pegylated
    interferon-a or stimulants of the innate immune system such as Toll-like receptor 7 and/or
    8 agonists. One embodiment of the present invention relates to combinations of a
 5  compound of Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof, as specified herein with an
    immunomodulating compound, more specifically a Toll-like receptor 7 and/or 8 agonist.
    The combination of previously known anti-HBV agents, such as interferon-a (IFN-U),
    pegylated interferon-a, 3TC, adefovir or a combination thereof, and, a compound of
10  formula (I) or any subgroup thereof can be used as a medicine in a combination therapy.
    Generic synthesis:
    The substituents represented by R      , R7 or R6 in this general synthesis section are meant
    to include any substituent or reactive species that is suitable for transformation into any
15  R'2,3 or R6 substituent according to the present invention without undue burden for the
    person skilled in the art.
    A possible synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) is described in scheme 1. A
    N-protected (where Pg is protecting group) aminocarboxylic acid of general formula (IV)
20  can be selectively reacted with an aniline of general formula (V), for example by addition
    of aniline (V) to a mixture of compound (IV), and a coupling agent (e.g. HATU) in an
    aprotic solvent (e.g. dichloromethane, DMF), along with an organic base (e.g.
    triethylamine) resulting in compound (VI). The protecting group (Pg) can subsequently be
    deprotected according to known methods (e.g. For the boc group, deprotection involves
25  addition of a strong acid like HCl. Benzyl protecting groups are removed via catalytic
    hydrogenation via known methods by one skilled in the art.) forming the amine salt which
    after solvent removal and addition of base (e.g. diisopropylethylamine) can be further
    reacted in one pot with ethyl chlorooxoacetate at reduced temperature in an aprotic solvent
    (e.g. dichloromethane) to afford compounds of type (VIII). The ester group of (VIII) is
30  then hydrolyzed by known methods (e.g. addition of an aqueous base). In one pot, the
    newly formed acid is generated after decreasing the pH and removal of the solvent under
    reduced pressure. The acid functional group is converted to an amide functional group by
    use of of a coupling agent (e.g. HATU) in an aprotic solvent (e.g. dichloromethane, DMF),
    along with an organic base (e.g. triethylamine), and amines (IX) resulting in compounds of
35  formula (I). Alternatively, the ester functionality in compounds (VIII) can be converted to
    an amide via reaction with an amine (IX) in a closed vessel, or optionally in the presence
    of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide at 0 0 C in a solvent like THF.

    Scheme 2 describes another possible synthesis of a compound of general formula I. A
 5  compound of general formula X is reacted with ethyl chlorooxoacetate, resulting in a
    compound of general formula XI. After selective hydrolysis, for example in the presence
    of a base like NaOH at 00 C in MeOH, compound XII is formed. This compound can be
    coupled with an amine of general formula IX in the presence of a coupling agent (e.g.
    HATU) in an aprotic solvent (e.g. dichloromethane, DMF), along with an organic base
10  (e.g. triethylamine). Alternatively, compound XI can be directely converted into a
    compound of general formula XIII by reaction with an amine IX (for example in case of
    IX equals isopropylamine,in EtOH at 60'C) resulting in the selective formation of a
    compound of formula XIII. Hydrolysis of the ester functionality of XIII, result in a
    compound of general formula XIV, which can be coupled with an amine of general
15  formula V, for example under influence of a coupling agent (e.g. HATU) in an aprotic

    A reagent of general formula XVI, can be formed starting from reacting ethyl chloro
    oxoacetate with an amine of general formula IX, followed by ester hydrolysis, as shown in
    scheme 3. This reagent XVI, can be coupled with an amine, for example obtained after
    deprotection of VI, in the presence of coupling agent (e.g. HATU) in an aprotic solvent
 5  (e.g. dichloromethane, DMF), along with an organic base (e.g. triethylamine), resulting in
    a compound of general formula I.
    GeneralprocedureLCMS methods
    The High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurement was performed
    using a LC pump, a diode-array (DAD) or a UV detector and a column as specified in the
10  respective methods. If necessary, additional detectors were included (see table of methods
    below).
    Flow from the column was brought to the Mass Spectrometer (MS) which was configured
    with an atmospheric pressure ion source. It is within the knowledge of the skilled person to
    set the tune parameters (e.g. scanning range, dwell time...) in order to obtain ions allowing
15  the identification of the compound's nominal monoisotopic molecular weight (MW). Data
    acquisition was performed with appropriate software.
    Compounds are described by their experimental retention times (R1) and ions. If not
    specified differently in the table of data, the reported molecular ion corresponds to the
    [M+H]- (protonated molecule) and/or [M-H] -(deprotonated molecule). In case the
20  compound was not directly ionizable the type of adduct is specified (i.e. [M+NH 4]f,
    [M+HCOO]-, etc.). All results were obtained with experimental uncertainties that are
    commonly associated with the method used.

    Step 1. Synthesis of (S)-N-(3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenvll)pyrrolidine-3-carboxamide.
    N-Boc-(3S)-1-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid [CAS 140148-70-5] (1 g, 4.65 mmol),
    3-bromo-4,5-difluoroaniline (0.96 g, 4.65 mmol) and HATU (2.12 g, 5.58 mmol) were
    added to CH 2Cl 2 (10 mL). N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.4 mL, 13.9 mmol) was added
 5  and the resultant mixture stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The mixture was
    partitioned with HCl (IM, aq., 20 mL). The organic layer was separated and the solvent
    removed under reduced pressure. The crude was purified via silica gel column
    chromatography using a heptane to ethyl acetate gradient to afford an oil. Subsequent Boc
    deprotection HCl (6 M in isopropanol, 15h at room temperature) afforded (S)-N-(3-bromo
10  4,5-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride that was used as such in the
    next step without further purification.
    Step 2. Synthesis of (S)-ethyl 2-(3-((3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenvl)carbamovl) pyrrolidin-1
      l)-2-oxoacetate. A mixture of (S)-N-(3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenyl) pyrrolidine-3
15  carboxamide hydrochloride (1.8 g), and triethylamine (1.47 mL, 10.54 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2
    (20 mL) was cooled to 00 C. To this mixture was added ethyl chloro oxoacetate (0.65 mL,
    5.8 mmol) dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred for one hour at 00 C, followed by
    the addition of ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer was washed (IM HCl aq.,
    NaHCO 3 aq., and brine), dried over magnesium sulfate, the solids were removed by
20  filtration and the solvent of the filtrate was removed under reduced pressure. The crude
    intermediate was used as such without further purification in the next step.
    Step 3. (S)-2-(3-((3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenyl)carbamoyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxoacetic
    acid was afforded after the corresponding ethyl ester was hydrolyzed using sodium
25  hydroxide in ethanol for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture was
    cooled to 00 C. HCl (IM aq.) was added to bring the mixture to approximately pH 2. Brine
    (30 mL) was added and the mixture was partitioned with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL). The
    organic layers were pooled, washed with brine (20 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, the
    solids were removed by filtration, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to
30  afford the title compound as an oil. No further purification was done.
    Step 4. Preparation of (S)-N-(3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenvl)-1-(2-oxo-2-(((R)-1,1,1-tri
    fluoropropan-2-vl)amino)acetyl)pyrrolidine-3-carboxamide.      A mixture of

35  (450 mg), HATU (0.499 g, 1.31 mmol), diisopropylethylamine (463 mg, 3.58 mmol),
    (R)-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propylamine (135 mg, 1.19 mmol), and DMF (8 mL) were allowed to
    stir at room temperature for 2 hours. To the reaction mixture was added ethyl acetate (100
    mL). The organic layer was washed with IM HCl (aq.), sodium bicarbonate (sat., aq.), and

    reverse phase preperative HPLC (stationary phase: RP Vydac Denali C18 - 10 gm, 200 g,
    5 cm), mobile phase: 0.25% NH 4HCO 3 solution in water, CH 3 CN). The desired fractions

10  92.9 mmol), 4-fluoro-3-methylaniline (11.63 g, 92.9 mmol), and N, N-diisopropylethyl
    amine (48 mL, 279 mmol) were added to CH 2Cl 2 (300 mL) at room temperature. HATU
    (42.4 g, 111.5 mmol) was added in small portions and the resultant mixture stirred at room
    temperature for 15 hours. The mixture was partitioned with HCl (1 M, aq., 20 mL). The
    organic layer was separated and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude
15  was purified via silica gel column chromatography using a heptane to ethyl acetate
    gradient to afford an oil. Subsequent Boc-deprotection HCl (6 M in isopropanol, 15 hours
    at room temperature) afforded (S)-N-(4-fluoro-3-methylphenyl)pyrrolidine-3-carboxamide
    hydrochloride that was used as such in the next step without further purification.

    carboxamide hydrochloride (0.5 g), and triethylamine (587 mg, 5.80 mmol) in CH 2Cl 2
    (10 mL) was cooled to 00 C. To this mixture was added ethyl chlorooxoacetate (290 mg,
    2.13 mmol) dropwise, and the reaction mixture stirred for one hour and 20 minutes at 00 C,
25  followed by the addition of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed (1 M HCl aq.,
    NaHCO 3 aq., and brine), dried over magnesium sulfate, the solids were removed by
    filtration and the solvent of the filtrate was removed under reduced pressure. The crude
    intermediate was used without further purification in the next step.

 5  Step 1. Preparation of 1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-5-methylpyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid. The
    title compound was prepared as a mixture of diastereomers according to methods found in
    W02010059658 (p 211), starting from methyl 2-chloro-5-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3
    carboxylate which is described in Foley, L., Tetrahedron Letters 1994, vol. 35, p. 5989.
10  Step 2. Preparation of t-butyl 4-((4-fluoro-3-methylphenyl)carbamoyl)-2-methyl
    pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate. 4-fluoro-3-methylaniline (1.09 g, 8.72 mmol) was added to a
    solution of 1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-5-methylpyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (2 g, 8.72 mmol),
    DIPEA (4.33 mL, 26.17 mmol), and HATU (4.98 g, 14.09 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (50 mL). The
    reaction mixture stirred for 1h at room temperature, then partitioned with water. The
15  organic layer was removed, dried over MgSO 4 , the solids were removed by filtration, and
    the solvent of the filtrate was removed under reduced pressure. The crude was purified via
    silica gel column chromatography resulting in the title compound. Method C, Rt = 1.96
    min, m/z   = 335.0 (M-H)-, and 1.98 min, m/z   = 335.1 (M-H) - exact mass: 336.2.
20  Step 3. Preparation of ethyl 2-(4-((4-fluoro-3-methylphenyl)carbamoyl)-2-methyl
    pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxoacetate. To a solution of t-butyl 4-((4-fluoro-3-methylphenyl)
    carbamoyl)-2-methylpyrrolidine-1-carboxylate in CH 2 Cl 2 under an atmosphere of nitrogen
    was added TFA dropwise. The reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.
    The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude was reconstituted in
25  CH 2Cl 2 and NaOH (1 M, aq.). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 5 minutes. The
    layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 . The combined
    organic layers were dried over MgSO 4 , the solids were removed by filtration and the
    filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford an oil. To this oil was added
    anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 (50 mL), and triethylamine (1.09 g, 7.83 mmol). To the resulting
30  solution was added ethyl oxalyl chloride (0.44 mL, 3.92 mmol) dropwise at room
    temperature, then stirred for 18 hours. HCl (0.5 M aq.) was added to the reaction mixture.
    The organic layer was removed, dried over MgSO 4 , the solids were removed by filtration
    and the filtrate was concentrated to afford an oil, dried under vacuum at 50 0 C for 4 hours
    and used without further purification.

    Biological examples - anti-HBV activity of compounds of formula (I)
10  The anti-HBV activity was measured using a stable transfected cell line,
    HepG2.2.15. This cell line was described to secrete relatively consistent high levels of
    HBV virion particles, which have been shown to cause both acute and chronic infection
    and disease in chimpanzees.
    For the antiviral, assay cells were treated twice for three days with serially diluted
15  compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 6 days of treatment the antiviral activity
    was determined by quantification of purified HBV DNA from secreted virions using
    realtime PCR and an HBV specific primer set and probe.
    The anti HBV activity was also measured using the HepG2.117 cell line, a stable,
    inducibly HBV producing cell line, which replicates HBV in the absence of doxicycline
20  (Tet-off system). For the antiviral assay, HBV replication was induced, followed by a
    treatment with serially diluted compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 3 days of
    treatment, the antiviral activity was determined by quantification of intracellular HBV
    DNA using realtime PCR and an HBV specific primer set and probe.
    Cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested using HepG2 cells, incubated for 4 days in the
25  presence of compounds. The viability of the cells was assessed using a Resazurin assay.
    Results are displayed in Table 1.
