 4                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5  [0001]     The present disclosure relates to compounds, e.g., multisubstituted aromatic
 6  compounds, which exhibit biological activity, e.g., inhibitory action, against serine proteases,
 7  including thrombin and various kallikreins.
 8  [0002]     Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases, divided into plasma kallikrein and
 9  tissue kallikreins. Plasma kallikrein (KLKB 1) liberates kinins (bradykinin and kallidin) from
10  the kininogens, peptides responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and activation of
11  inflammation. In the contact activation pathway of the coagulation cascade, plasma kallikrein
12  assists in the conversion of factor XII to factor XIIa (Keel, M.; Trentz, 0. Injury 2005, 36,
13  691-709). Factor XIIa converts FXI into FXIa, which in turn activates FIX, which with its
14  co-factor FVIIa forms the tenase complex, which finally activates FX to FXa. In the
15  fibrinolysis part of the coagulation cascade, plasma kallikrein serves to convert plasminogen
16  to plasmin. Thus, it has been proposed that plasma kallikrein inhibitors can be useful in the
17  treatment of thrombotic and fibrinolytic diseases and disease conditions (US Patent #
18  7,625,944; Bird et al. Thrombosis and Hemostasis 2012, 107, 1141).
19  [0003]     In rodent models, it has been shown that activation of plasma kallikrein in the eye
20  increases retinal vascular permeability; whereas inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system
21  reduces retinal leakage induced by diabetes and hypertension. These findings suggest that
22  intraocular activation of the plasma kallikrein pathway can contribute to excessive retinal
23  vascular permeability that can lead to diabetic macular edema (DME). Thus, evidence
24  suggests that plasma kallikrein inhibitors can provide a new therapeutic opportunity to reduce
25  retinal vascular permeability (Feener, E. P. CurrDiab Rep 2010, 10, 270).
26  [0004]     The Kallikrein-kinin system is involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial
27  growth factor (VEGF), endothelial NO synthase, and fibroblast growth factor 2, all of which
28  are involved in angiogenesis (Bader M. 2009, Arteriosclerosis,Thrombosis, and Vascular
29  Biology, 29: 617). Tissue kallikrein (KLK1) has been linked to blood vessel growth (Miura
30  S., 2003, Hypertension, 41, 1118). Therapies that moderate angiogenesis have been proposed
31  for the treatment of both diabetic macular edema (DME) and age-related macular
32  degeneration (AMD) (Syed, B.A.; Evans, J.B.; Bielory, L., 2012, Nature Reviews Drug
                                                     1

     WO 2014/145986                                                            PCT/US2014/030853
33 Discovery, 11, 827). Without further wishing to be bound by any theory, it is therefore
34 reasonable to conclude that KLKlinhibitors can be useful in the treatment of diabetic
35 retinopathy, DME, and AMD.
36 [0005]    Studies have shown that inflammation plays an important role in the origin and
37 development of AMD, and treatment often includes anti-inflammatories such as
38 corticosteroid (Telander, D., 2011, Seminars in Ophthalmology, 26(3), 192). The connection
39 between the kallikrein-kinin system and inflammation is also well established (Duchene,
40 2011, "Kallikrein-kinin kystem in inflammatory diseases". Kinins. De Gruyter. 261). Without
41 further wishing to be bound by any theory, it is reasonable to conclude that the anti
42 inflammatory nature of kallikrein (e.g. KLK1 and KLKB1) inhibitors can be useful in the
43 treatment of AMD.
44 [0006]    Ecallantide (Kalbitor) is a 60-amino acid recombinant protein that acts as a potent
45 reversible inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (Schneider L, et al., JAllergy Clin Immunol 2007,
46  120, 416). Ecallantide has been approvied by the FDA for the treatment of acute attacks of
47 hereditary angioedema (HAE). Without further wishing to be bound by any theory, it is
48 reasonable to believe that plasma kallikrein inhibition in general can be a useful treatment for
49 HAE, and thus there is strong interest in the development of plasma kallikrein inhibitors as a
50 therapy for HAE.
51 [0007]    Tissue kallikreins (KLKs, for example, KLK1) are subdivided into various types,
52 and have been extensively investigated in cancer and inflammation biology. Various
53 kallikrein KLKs have been found to be up- or down-regulated in various cancer types, such
54 as cervical-, testicular-, and non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (Caliendo et al. J. Med.
55 Chem., 2012, 55, 6669). Furthermore, overexpression of various KLKs in the skin has led to
56 the recognition that certain kallikrein inhibitors can be useful for certain dermatological
57 conditions, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and rare skin diseases such as Netherton
58 Syndrome (Freitas et al. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2012, 22, 6072-6075). A
59 thorough discussion of tissue kallikrein, plasma kallikreins, their functions and potential roles
60 in various diseases can be found in a variety of references, including the following which are

68 [0008]     In mammalian systems, blood vessel injuries result in bleeding events, which are
69 dealt with by the blood coagulation cascade. The cascade includes the extrinsic and intrinsic
70 pathways, involving the activation of at least 13 interconnected factors and a variety of co
71 factors and other regulatory proteins. Upon vascular injury, plasma factor VII interacts with
72 exposed Tissue Factor (TF), and the resultant TF-fVIIa complex initiates a complex series of
73 events. Factor fXa is produced directly 'downstream' from the TF-fVIIa complex, and
74 amplified manifold via the intrinsic Pathway. FXa then serves as the catalyst for formation of
75 thrombin (flIa), which in turn is the direct precursor to fibrinolysis. The outcome is a
76 fibrinolytic clot, which stops the bleeding. Fibrinolysis of the polymeric clot into fibrin
77 monomers leads to dissolution and a return of the system to the pre-clot state. The cascade is
78 a complex balance of factors and co-factors and is tightly regulated. In disease states,
79 undesired up- or down-regulation of any factor leads to conditions such as bleeding or
80 thrombosis. Historically, anticoagulants have been used in patients at risk of suffering from
81 thrombotic complications, such as angina, stroke and heart attack. Warfarin has enjoyed
82 dominance as a first-in-line anticoagulant therapeutic. Developed in the 1940s, it is a Vitamin
83 K antagonist and inhibits factors II, VII, IX and X, amongst others. It is administered orally,
84 but its ease of use is tempered by other effects: it has a very long half-life (>2 days) and has
85 serious drug-drug interactions. Importantly, since Vitamin K is a ubiquitous cofactor within
86 the coagulation cascade, antagonism results in the simultaneous inhibition of many clotting
87 factors and thus can lead to significant bleeding complications.
88 [0009]     Much attention has been focused on heparin, the naturally-occurring polysaccharide
89 that activates AT III, the endogenous inhibitor of many of the factors in the coagulation
90 cascade. The need for parenteral administration for the heparin-derived therapeutics, and the
91 inconvenient requirements for close supervision for the orally available warfarin, has resulted
92 in a drive to discover and develop orally available drugs with wide therapeutic windows for
93 safety and efficacy. Indeed, the position of thrombin in the coagulation cascade has made it a
94 popular target for drug discovery. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed
95 that the ultimate development of direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) is usefully based upon the
96 classical D-Phe-Pro-Arg motif, a sequence that mimics fibrinogen, which is a natural
97 substrate of thrombin. Without further wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that
98 the use of DTIs is very well precedented, such as with the hirudin-based anticoagulants, and
99 thus there is strong interest in the discovery and development of novel DTIs.

 ;01 [0018]    Not applicable.
 ;02                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 ;03 I.      Definitions
304  [0019]     The abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical
305  and biological arts. The chemical structures and formulae set forth herein are constructed
306  according to the standard rules of chemical valency known in the chemical arts.
307  [0020] Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae,
308  written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that
309  would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., -CH 20- is equivalent to
310  -OCH 2-.
311  [0021]    As used herein, the term "attached" signifies a stable covalent bond, certain
312  preferred points of attachment being apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
313  [0022]     The terms "halogen" or "halo" include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.
314  Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl" are meant to include monohaloalkyl and
                                                      10

       WO 2014/145986                                                           PCT/US2014/030853
315  polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term "halo(Ci-C 4)alkyl" includes, but is not limited to,
 16  fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3
 17  bromopropyl, and the like.
 18  [0023]     The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise
 19  stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched chain, or combination thereof, which can be
 ;20 fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having
 ;21 the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., Ci-Cio means one to ten carbons). Examples of
 ;22 saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n
 ;23 propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, homologs and
 ;24 isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated
 ;25 alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated
 ;26 alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2
 ;27 (butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and
 ;28 the higher homologs and isomers. Accordingly, the term "alkyl" can refer to Ci-Ci 6 straight
 ;29 chain saturated, Ci-Ci 6 branched saturated, C3 -Cs cyclic saturated and Ci-Ci 6 straight chain or
 ;30 branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups substituted with C3-Cs cyclic saturated
 ;31 aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, this
 ;32 definition shall include but is not limited to methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (Pr), butyl (Bu),
 ;33 pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, isopropyl (i-Pr), isobutyl (i-Bu), tert-butyl
 ;34 (t-Bu), sec-butyl (s-Bu), isopentyl, neopentyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,
 ;35 cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclopropylmethyl, and the like.
 ;36 [0024] The term "alkylene," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless
337  otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by,
338  -CH 2CH 2CH 2 CH 2-. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon
339  atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the compounds
340  disclosed herein. A "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene
341  group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.
342  [0025] The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless
343  otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, consisting of at
344  least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of 0, N,
345  P, Si, and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms can optionally be oxidized, and the
346  nitrogen heteroatom can optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) 0, N, P, S, and Si can
347  be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl
348  group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to:
                                                       11

       WO 2014/145986                                                             PCT/US2014/030853
349  -CH 2-CH 2-0-CH3 , -CH 2-CH 2 -NH-CH 3, -CH 2-CH 2-N(CH 3)-CH 3, -CH 2 -S-CH 2-CH 3 ,
 ;50 -CH 2-CH 2, -S(O)-CH 3, -CH 2 -CH 2-S(O) 2-CH 3 , -CH=CH-0-CH 3, -Si(CH 3) 3 ,
 ;51 -CH 2-CH=N-OCH 3 , -CH=CH-N(CH 3 )-CH 3, -O-CH 3 , -O-CH 2 -CH 3 , and -CN. Up to two
 ;52 heteroatoms can be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH 2-NH-OCH 3.
 ;53 [0026] Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene," by itself or as part of another substituent, means,
 ;54 unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not
 ;55 limited by, -CH 2-CH 2-S-CH 2-CH 2- and -CH 2-S-CH 2-CH 2-NH-CH 2-. For heteroalkylene
 ;56 groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy,
 ;57 alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and
 ;58 heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction
 ;59 in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula -C(O) 2 R'
 ;60 represents both -C(O) 2 R'- and -R'C(O) 2 -. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used
 ;61 herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a
 ;62 heteroatom, such as -C(O)R', -C(O)NR', -NR'R", -OR', -SR', and/or -S0 2 R'. Where
 ;63 "heteroalkyl" is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as
 ;64 -NR'R" or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and -NR'R" are not
 ;65 redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add
 ;66 clarity. Thus, the term "heteroalkyl" should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific
 ;67 heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R" or the like.
 ;68 [0027] The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl," by themselves or in combination with
 ;69 other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl,"
 ;70 respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at
371  which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl
372  include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1
373  cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl
374  include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3
375  piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl,
376  tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A
377  "cycloalkylene" and a "heterocycloalkylene," alone or as part of another substituent, means a
378  divalent radical derived from a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.
379  [0028]    The term "alkenyl" includes C2 -C1 6 straight chain unsaturated, C2 -C 1 branched
380  unsaturated, C5 -C 8 unsaturated cyclic, and C 2-C 1 6 straight chain or branched unsaturated
381  aliphatic hydrocarbon groups substituted with C3 -C8 cyclic saturated and unsaturated
382  aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. Double bonds
                                                      12

       WO 2014/145986                                                           PCT/US2014/030853
383  can occur in any stable point along the chain and the carbon-carbon double bonds can have
 ;84 either the cis or trans configuration. For example, this definition shall include but is not
 ;85 limited to ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl, nonenyl, decenyl,
 ;86 undecenyl, 1,5-octadienyl, 1,4,7-nonatrienyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl,
 ;87 cyclooctenyl, ethylcyclohexenyl, butenylcyclopentyl, 1-pentenyl-3-cyclohexenyl, and the like.
 ;88 Similarly, "heteroalkenyl" refers to heteroalkyl having one or more double bonds.
 ;89 [0029]    The term "alkynyl" refers in the customary sense to alkyl additionally having one or
 ;90 more triple bonds. The term "cycloalkenyl" refers to cycloalkyl additionally having one or
 ;91 more double bonds. The term "heterocycloalkenyl" refers to heterocycloalkyl additionally
 ;92 having one or more double bonds.
 ;93 [0030] The term "acyl" means, unless otherwise stated, -C(O)R where R is a substituted or
 ;94 unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted
 ;95 heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or
 ;96 substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.
 ;97 [0031]    Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "aryl," and "heteroaryl")
 ;98 includes both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred
 ;99 substituents for each type of radical are provided herein.
 100 [0032]    Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often
 101 referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl,
 102 heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of
 103 groups selected from, but not limited to, -OR', =0, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R", -SR', -halogen,
404  -SiR'R"R"', -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO 2 R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R',
405  -NR'-C(O)NR"R"', -NR"C(O) 2R', -NR-C(NR'R")=NR"', -S(O)R', -S(O) 2 R', -S(O) 2NR'R",
406  -NRSO 2 R', -CN, and -NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+ 1), where m' is the total
407  number of carbon atoms in such radical. R', R", and R"' each preferably independently refer
408  to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl,
409  substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl
410  substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy, or thioalkoxy
411  groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound disclosed herein includes more than one R
412  group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", and R"'
413  group when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R" are attached to the
414  same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7
415  membered ring. For example, -NR'R" includes, but is not limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4
                                                     13

       WO 2014/145986                                                                PCT/US2014/030853
416  morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand
 117 that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups
 118 other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF 3 and -CH 2 CF 3) and acyl (e.g.,
 119 -C(O)CH 3, -C(O)CF 3 , -C(O)CH 20CH3, and the like).
 120 [0033]     Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl
 121 and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: -OR', -NR'R", -SR',
 122 -halogen, -SiR'R"R"', -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO 2 R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R',
 123 -NR'-C(O)NR"R"', -NR"C(O) 2R', -NR-C(NR'R")=NR"', -S(O)R', -S(O) 2 R', -S(O) 2NR'R",
 124 -NRSO 2 R', -CN, -NO 2 , -R', -N 3 , -CH(Ph) 2, fluoro(C 1 -C 4 )alkoxy, and fluoro(C 1 -C4 )alkyl, in a
 125 number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system;
 126 and where R', R", and R"' are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or
 127 unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted
 128 cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl,
 129 and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound disclosed herein includes
 130 more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are
 131 each R', R", and R"' groups when more than one of these groups is present.
 132 [0034]     Two or more substituents can optionally be joined to form aryl, heteroaryl,
 133 cycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl groups. Such so-called ring-forming substituents are typically,
 134 though not necessarily, found attached to a cyclic base structure. In one embodiment, the
 135 ring-forming substituents are attached to adjacent members of the base structure. For
 136 example, two ring-forming substituents attached to adjacent members of a cyclic base
 137 structure create a fused ring structure. In another embodiment, the ring-forming substituents
438  are attached to a single member of the base structure. For example, two ring-forming
439  substituents attached to a single member of a cyclic base structure create a spirocyclic
440  structure. In yet another embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to non
441  adjacent members of the base structure.
442  [0035]     Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring can
443  optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein T and U are
444  independently -NR-, -0-, -CRR'-, or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3.
445  Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring can
446  optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH 2)r-B-, wherein A and B are
447  independently -CRR'-, -0-, -NR-, -S-, -S(O) -, -S(O) 2 -, -S(O) 2 NR'-, or a single bond, and r is
448  an integer of from I to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed can optionally be
449  replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the
                                                        14

       WO 2014/145986                                                          PCT/US2014/030853
450  aryl or heteroaryl ring can optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula
 151 -(CRR'),-X'- (C"R.")d-, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X' is -0-,
 152 -NR'-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(0)2-, or -S(0) 2NR'-. The substituents R, R', R", and R." are preferably
 153 independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or

037  [0102]     Inhibitory activity against KLKB1 has an effect on the coagulation cascade and the

 )49 IV.     Methods of Treating and Preventing Disease
 )50 [0104]     Kallikrein-related diseases or disorders are biological conditions associated with or
 )51 moderated by kallikrein. They include, but are not limited by, those conditions associated
 )52 with biological pathways that are moderated by tissue and plasma kallikrein. An example of
 )53 such a pathway is the kallikrein-kinin system (Moreau, M.E. 2005, Journalof
 )54 PharmacologicalSciences, 99, 6). Kallikrein-related diseases or disorders include, but are not
 )55 limited to, fibrosis, inflammation, thrombosis, hereditary angioedema, skin disorders, cancer,
 )56 and ophthalmic diseases. Ophthalmic diseases include, but are not limited to, diabetic
 )57 macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
058  [0105]     Diabetic Macular Edema. In rodent models, it has been shown that activation of
059  KLKB1 in the eye increases retinal vascular permeability; whereas inhibition of the
060  kallikrein-kinin system reduces retinal leakage induced by diabetes and hypertension. These
061  findings suggest that intraocular activation of the KLKB 1 pathway can contribute to
062  excessive retinal vascular permeability that can lead to diabetic macular edema. Thus,
063  evidence suggests that KLKB1 inhibitors can provide a new therapeutic opportunity to reduce
064  retinal vascular permeability (Feener, E. P. 2010, CurrDiab Rep 10, 270).
065  [0106]     Hereditary Angioedema. Ecallantide (Kalbitor) is a 60-amino acid recombinant
066  protein that acts as a potent reversible inhibitor of KLKB1 (Schneider L, et al. 2007, J
067  Allergy Clin Immunol, 120, 416) and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
068  acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE). Thus plasma kallikrein inhibition can be a
                                                      58

069  useful treatment for HAE, and there is strong interest in the development of plasma kallikrein
 )70 inhibitors as a therapy for HAE.
 )71 [0107]     Skin. Overexpression of various KLKs in the skin has led to the recognition that
 )72 certain kallikrein inhibitors can be useful for certain dermatological conditions, including

 )74 Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2012, 22, 6072-6075).
 )75 [0108]     Thrombosis. Thrombotic diseases are the primary indications for thrombin
 )76 inhibition, because of thrombin's location in the coagulation cascade and, in turn, the
 )77 importance of the coagulation cascade in the progression of blood clotting processes.
 )78 However, without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed the coagulation cascade
 )79 in general, and thrombin in particular, is important in a variety other disease states.
 )80 [0109]     It has been discovered that compounds described herein, e.g., multisubstituted
 )81 aromatic compounds, exhibit inhibitory action against thrombin (activated blood-coagulation
 )82 factor II; EC 3.4.21.5). This, in turn inhibits the blood coagulation process.
 )83 [0110]     This inhibitory action is useful in the treatment of a variety of thrombotic disorders,
 )84 such as, but not limited to, acute vascular diseases such as acute coronary syndromes;
 )85 venous-, arterial- and cardiogenic thromboembolisms; the prevention of other states such as
 )86 disseminated intravascular coagulation, or other conditions that involve the presence or the
 )87 potential formation of a blood clot thrombus. Other indications for methods described herein
 )88 include the following.
 )89 [0111]     Cancer. Tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are subdivided into various types, and have been
090  extensively investigated in cancer and inflammation biology. Various kallikrein KLKs have
091  been found to be up- or down-regulated in various cancer types, such as cervical-, testicular-,
092  and non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (Caliendo et al. J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55, 6669). It
093  has been proposed that KLK1 inhibitors will be useful in certain cancers.
094  [0112]     It has long been recognized that cancer progression is accompanied by venous
095  thrombosis, but it has not been understood how each disease is related. From several clinical
096  trials studying the treatment of VTE, meta-analyses have shown that low molecular weight
097  heparins (LMWHs) improve overall survival in subgroups of cancer patients. See e.g.,
098  Zacharski, L. R. & Lee, A. Y., 2008, Expert Opin Investig Drugs, 17:1029-1037; Falanga, A.

101  Haemost, 82:947-952. This finding was substantiated in later clinical trials that measured

102 specifically the survival of cancer patients. See e.g., Lee, A. Y.et al., 2005, J Clin Oncol,
t03 23:2123-2129; Klerk, C. P.et al., J Clin Oncol 2005, 23:2130-2135; Kakkar, A. K., et al.,
t04 2004, J Clin Oncol, 22:1944-1948; Altinbas, M., et al., 2004, J Thromb Haemost, 2:1266
[05  1271.
[06 [0113]    More recently, researchers have focused on the specific anticancer effect of DTIs.
[07 For example, it was shown that heparin significantly prolonged the survival of patients with
t08 limited small cell lung cancer. See e.g., Akl, E. A., et al., 2008, JExp Clin Cancer Res, 27:4.
[09 Other investigators found that systemic use of argatroban reduced tumor mass and prolonged
[10 survival time in rat glioma models leading to the conclusion that argatroban should be
I11 considered as a novel therapeutic for glioma, a notoriously difficult to treat cancer type. See
[12 e.g., Hua, Y., et al., 2005, Acta Neurochir, Suppl 2005, 95:403-406; Hua, Y., et al., 2005, J
t13 Thromb Haemost, 3:1917-1923. Very recently, it was demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate,
t14 a DTI recently FDA-approved (see e.g., Hughes, B., 2010, Nat Rev DrugDiscov, 9:903-906)
[15 for DVT indications, inhibited both the invasion and metastasis of malignant breast tumors.
[16 See e.g., DeFeo, K.et al., 2010, Thrombosis Research, 125 (Supplement 2): S188-S188;
L17 Defeo, K., et al., 2010, CancerBiol Ther, 10:1001-1008. Thus, dabigatran etexilate treatment
t18 led to a 50% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks with no weight loss in treated mice.
[19 Dabigatran etexilate also reduced tumor cells in the blood and liver micrometastases by 50
120 60%. These investigators concluded that dabigatran etexilate can be beneficial in not only
[21 preventing thrombotic events in cancer patients, but also as adjunct therapy to treat malignant
[22 tumors.
[23 [0114]    Further, hirudin and the LMWH nadroparin dramatically reduced the number of
124 lung metastases when administered prior to cancer cell inoculation. See e.g., Hu, L., et al.,
125 2004, Blood, 104:2746-51.
126 [0115]    The de novo thrombin inhibitor d-Arg-Oic-Pro-d-Ala-Phe(p-Me) has been found to
127 block thrombin-stimulated invasion of prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in a concentration
128 dependent manner. See e.g., Nieman, M. T., et al., 2008, J Thromb Haemost, 6:837-845. A
129 reduced rate of tumor growth was observed in mice dosed with the pentapeptide through their
130 drinking water. The mice also showed reduced fold rate in tumor size and reduced overall
131 tumor weight compared to untreated mice. Microscopic examination of treated tumors
132 showed reduced number of large blood vessels thus concluding that the pentapeptide
133 interfered with tumor angiogenesis. Nieman, M. T., et al., Thromb Haemost, 104:1044-8.
                                                    60

      WO 2014/145986                                                             PCT/US2014/030853
134 [0116]      In view of these and related studies, it is suggested that anticoagulants affect tumor
[35 metastasis; that is, angiogenesis, cancer cell adhesion, migration and invasion processes. See
[36 e.g., Van Noorden, C. J., et al., 2010, Thromb Res, 125 Suppl 2:S77-79.
[37 [0117]      Fibrosis. Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases, divided into plasma
t38 kallikrein (KLKB 1) and tissue kallikreins. KLKB 1 liberates kinins (bradykinin and kallidin)
[39 from the kininogens, peptides responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and activation
 40 of inflammation. In the Contact Activation Pathway of the coagulation cascade, KLKB1
 41 assists in the conversion of factor XII to factor XIIa (Keel, M.; Trentz, 0. Injury 2005, 36,
 42 691-709). Factor XIIa converts FXI into FXIa, which in turn activates FIX, which with its
 43 co-factor FVIIIa forms the tenase complex, which finally activates FX to FXa. In the
 44 fibrinolysis part of the coagulation cascade, KLKB1 serves to convert plasminogen to
[45 plasmin. Thus, it has been proposed that KLKB 1 inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of
 46 thrombotic and fibrinolytic diseases and disease conditions (US Patent # 7,625,944; Bird et
 47 al. Thrombosis and Hemostasis 2012, 107, 1141).
 48 [0118]      Several studies have shown the utility of anticoagulant therapy in fibrotic disorders.
 49 For example, in a rat model of CCl 4 -induced chronic liver injury, the DTI SSR182289
[50 decreased liver fibrogenesis significantly after 7 weeks of administration. Similar
[51 observations were made in other studies using the LMWHs nadroparin, tinzaparin,
t52 enoxaparin, and dalteparin sodium. See e.g., Duplantier, J. G., et al., 2004, Gut, 53:1682
t53  1687; Abdel-Salam, O. M., et al., 2005, PharmacolRes, 51:59-67; Assy, N., et al., 2007, Dig
[54 Dis Sci, 52:1187-1193; Abe, W., et al., 2007, JHepatol,46:286-294. Thus a thrombin
[55 inhibitor as an anticoagulant can be useful in the treatment of fibrinolytic diseases.
156 [0119]      In another example, the DTI melagatran greatly reduced ischemia reperfusion injury
157 in a kidney transplant model in the large white pig. This led to a drastically improved kidney
158 graft survival at 3 months. See e.g., Favreau, F., et al., 2010, Am J Transplant, 10:30-39.
159 [0120]      Recent studies have shown that in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary
160 fibrosis, dabigatran etexilate treatment reduced important profibrotic events in lung
161 fibroblasts, including the production of collagen and connective tissue growth factor. See
162 e.g., Silver, R. M., et al., 2010, Am. J. Respir. Crit. CareMed., 181:A6780; Bogatkevich, G.
163 S., et al., 2009, Arthritis Rheum, 60:3455-3464.
164 [0121]      The above experimental evidence points to a close relationship between thrombin
165 and fibrosis and suggests novel therapeutic opportunities for fibrosis using thrombin
166 inhibitors. See e.g., Calvaruso, V., et al., 2008, Gut, 57:1722-1727; Chambers, R. C., 2008,

[69 [0122]    Inflammation. Kallikrein has long been implicated in inflammation (Clements, J.A.
 70 The MolecularBiology of the Kallikreins and Their Roles in Inflammation, Academic Press:
 71 San Diego, CA, 1997; Vol. 5). There is experimental evidence that KLKB1 is associated with
 72 sepsis and inflammatory arthritis (Colman, R.W., 1998, ClinicalReviews in Allergy and
 73 Immunology, 16: 365). Thus a KLKB1 inhibitor can be useful in the treatment of
[74 inflammatory conditions associated with the kallikrein-kinin system, such as systemic
[75 inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel
 76 disease.
[77 [0123]    Age-Related Macular Degeneration. KLK1 has been linked to blood vessel
[78 growth moderated by the VEGF pathway (Miura S., 2003, Hypertension, 41, 1118). Age
t79 related macular degeneration (AMD) is associated with the proliferation of abnormal blood
[80 vessels and VEGF expression (Lopez, P.F., 1996, Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual
t81 Science, 37, 855). Thus, KLK1 inhibitors have been proposed for the treatment of AMD (US
t82 Patent #20120264798; Ferrara, N., 2000, Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 11, 617).
L83 [0124]    Alzheimer's Disease. Very recent experiments confirm higher thrombin levels in
[84 brain endothelial cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease. While 'normal' thrombin levels
t85 are connected to regulatory CNS functions, thrombin accumulation in the brain is toxic. It has
t86 also been found that the neural thrombin inhibitor Protease Nexin 1 (PN-1) is significantly
[87 reduced in the Alzheimer's disease brain, despite the fact that PN-1 mRNA levels are
188 unchanged. These observations have led some investigators to suggest that reduction of CNS
189 resident thrombin will prove useful in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) treatment. See e.g.,
190 Vaughan, P. J., et al., 1994, Brain Res, 668:160-170; Yin, X., et al., 2010, Am JPathol,
191  176:1600-1606; Akiyama, H., et al., 1992, Neurosci Lett, 146:152-154.
192 [0125]    Multiple Sclerosis. Investigators found that hirudin treatment in an animal model of
193 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) showed a dramatic improvement in disease severity. See e.g., Han,
194 M. H., et al., 2008, Nature, 451:1076-1081. Similar results were obtained following treatment
195 with heparin (a DTI) and dermatan sulfate, another coagulation inhibitor. See e.g.,
196 Chelmicka-Szorc, E. & Amason, B. G., 1972, Arch Neurol, 27:153-158; Inaba, Y., et al.,
197  1999, Cell Immunol, 198:96-102. Other evidence shows that naturally occurring antithrombin
198 III has anti-inflammatory effects in diseases such as endotoxemia and other sepsis-related
199 conditions. See e.g., Wiedermann, C. J. & Romisch, J., 2002, Acta Med Austriaca, 29:89-92.

200  Naturally occurring thrombin inhibitors are presumably synthesized in situ and have
 !01 protective roles in CNS inflammation. Therefore, therapeutic thrombin inhibition has been
 !02 proposed as a potential MS treatment. See e.g., Luo, W., et al., 2009, In: THROMBIN,
 !03 Maragoudakis, M. E.; Tsopanoglou, N. E., Eds. Springer New York: 2009; pp 133-159.
 !04 [0126]     Pain. In a rat pain model with partial lesion of the sciatic nerve, intrathecal hirudin
 !05 prevented the development of neuropathic pain and curbed pain responses for 7 days. The
 !06 investigators found that following injury, neuropathic pain was mediated by thrombin
 !07 generation, which in turn activated PAR-I receptor in the spinal cord. Hirudin inhibited
 !08 thrombin generation and ultimately led to pain relief. See e.g., Garcia, P. S., et al., 2010,
 !09 Thromb Haemost, 103:1145-1151; Narita, M., et al., 2005, JNeurosci,25:10000-10009.
 !10 Researchers hypothesize that thrombin and the PARs are involved not just as part of the
 !1  coagulation cascade, but in inflammation, nociception and neurodevelopment. Development
 !12 of a DTI to intersect an unexploited pharmacology will lead to pain therapeutics distinct from
 !13 opioids and NSAIDs, whose shortcomings are well documented. See e.g., Garcia 2010, Id.

 ;75 pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and one or more compounds disclosed
 ;76 herein.
 ;77 [0146]     In some embodiments, tablets contain the acting ingredient in admixture with non
 ;78 toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets.
 ;79 These excipients can be, for example, (1) inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, lactose,
 ;80 calcium phosphate, carboxymethylcellulose, or sodium phosphate; (2) granulating and
 ;81 disintegrating agents, such as corn starch or alginic acid; (3) binding agents, such as starch,
 ;82 gelatin or acacia; and (4) lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.
 ;83 These tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and
 ;84 absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer
 ;85 period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl
 ;86 distearate can be employed.
387  [0147]     For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds disclosed herein,
388  pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations
389  include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A
390  solid carrier can be one or more substance that can also act as diluents, flavoring agents,

397  added or dissolved in an appropriate biologically acceptable buffer and added to a cell or
 ;98 tissue.
 ;99 [0149]    In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid in a mixture with the finely divided
 100 active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the
 101 necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size
 102 desired.
 103 [0150]    The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% to 70% of the active
 104 compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar,
 105 lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium
 106 carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term
 107 "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with
 108 encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or
 109 without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it.
 110 Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and
 II1 lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.
 112 [0151]    For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid
 113 glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed
 114 homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into
 115 convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.
 116 [0152]    Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for
 117 example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid
418  preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.
419  [0153]    When parenteral application is needed or desired, particularly suitable admixtures
420  for the compounds disclosed herein are injectable, sterile solutions, preferably oily or
421  aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. In
422  particular, carriers for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of dextrose, saline,
423  pure water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, peanut oil, sesame oil, polyoxyethylene-block
424  polymers, and the like. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds disclosed
425  herein can also be incorporated into liposomes or administered via transdermal pumps or
426  patches. Pharmaceutical admixtures suitable for use in the pharmaceuticals compositions and
427  methods disclosed herein include those described, for example, in PHARMACEUTICAL
428  SCIENCES   (17th Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA) and WO 96/05309, the teachings of both of
429  which are hereby incorporated by reference.

430  [0154]    In some embodiments, preparations for parenteral administration include sterile
 131 aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous
 132 solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and
 133 injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water,
 134 alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media.
 135 Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium
 136 chloride, lactated Ringer's intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers,
 137 electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives
 138 and other additives can also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants,
 139 chelating agents, growth factors and inert gases and the like.
 140 [0155]    Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active
 141 component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents
 142 as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely
 143 divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums,
 144 resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending
 145 agents.
 146 [0156]    Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly
 147 before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include
 148 solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations can contain, in addition to the
 149 active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners,
 150 dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.
451  [0157]    The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the
452  preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
453  component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
454  discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or
455  ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it
456  can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.
457  [0158]    The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation can be varied or
458  adjusted from 0.1 mg to 10000 mg, more typically 1.0 mg to 1000 mg, most typically 10 mg
459  to 500 mg, according to the particular application and the potency of the active component.
460  The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.
461  [0159]    Some compounds can have limited solubility in water and therefore can require a
462  surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition. Such co-solvents include:
                                                     70

463  Polysorbate 20, 60, and 80; Pluronic F-68, F-84, and P-103; cyclodextrin; and polyoxyl 35
 164 castor oil. Such co-solvents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01 % and about
 165 2% by weight.
 166 [0160]     Viscosity greater than that of simple aqueous solutions can be desirable to decrease
 167 variability in dispensing the formulations, to decrease physical separation of components of a
 168 suspension or emulsion of formulation, and/or otherwise to improve the formulation. Such
 169 viscosity building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
 170 methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl
 171 cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, chondroitin sulfate and salts thereof, hyaluronic acid and
 172 salts thereof, and combinations of the foregoing. Such agents are typically employed at a
 173 level between about 0.01 % and about 2% by weight.
 174 [0161]     The compositions disclosed herein can additionally include components to provide
 175 sustained release and/or comfort. Such components include high molecular weight, anionic
 176 mucomimetic polymers, gelling polysaccharides, and finely-divided drug carrier substrates.
 177 These components are discussed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,920; 5,403,841;
 178 5,212,162; and 4,861,760. The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by

485  prodrug, metabolite, analogue, derivative, solvate or salt.
486  [0163]     Generally, the terms "treating", "treatment" and the like are used herein to mean
487  affecting a subject, tissue or cell to obtain a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect.
488  The effect can be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or
489  disorder or sign or symptom thereof, and/or can be therapeutic in terms of a partial or
490  complete cure for a disorder and/or adverse effect attributable to it. "Treating" as used herein
491  covers any treatment of, or prevention of a disease or disorder in a vertebrate, a mammal,
492  particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease or disorder from occurring in a

316  [0166]    The pharmaceutical compositions are preferably prepared and administered in dose
517  units. Solid dose units are tablets, capsules and suppositories. For treatment of a subject,
518  depending on activity of the compound, manner of administration, nature and severity of the
519  disease or disorder, age and body weight of the subject, different daily doses can be used.
520  [0167]    Under certain circumstances, however, higher or lower daily doses can be
521  appropriate. The administration of the daily dose can be carried out both by single
522  administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller dose units and
523  also by multiple administrations of subdivided doses at specific intervals.
524  [0168]    The pharmaceutical compositions contemplated herein can be administered locally
525  or systemically in a therapeutically effective dose. Amounts effective for this use will, of
526  course, depend on the severity of the disease or disorder and the weight and general state of
527  the subject. Typically, dosages used in vitro can provide useful guidance in the amounts

 )31 Goodman and Gilman's (eds.), 1990, Id., each of which is herein incorporated by reference
 '32 and for all purposes. Dosages for parenteral administration of active pharmaceutical agents
 '33 can be converted into corresponding dosages for oral administration by multiplying
 '34 parenteral dosages by appropriate conversion factors. As to general applications, the
 '35 parenteral dosage in mg/mL times 1.8      = the corresponding oral dosage in milligrams ("mg").
 '36 As to oncology applications, the parenteral dosage in mg/mL times 1.6      = the corresponding
 '37 oral dosage in mg. An average adult weighs about 70 kg. See e.g., Miller-Keane, 1992,

591            B.     Effective Dosages
 '92  [0179]     Pharmaceutical compositions provided herein include compositions wherein the
 '93  active ingredient is contained in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e., in an amount
 '94  effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular
 '95  application will depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated.
 '96  [0180]     The dosage and frequency (single or multiple doses) of compound administered can
 '97  vary depending upon a variety of factors, including route of administration; size, age, sex,
 '98  health, body weight, body mass index, and diet of the recipient; nature and extent of
 599  symptoms of the disease being treated (e.g., the disease responsive to inhibition of thrombin,
 )00  KLK1, and/or KLKB 1); presence of other diseases or other health-related problems; kind of
 _)01 concurrent treatment; and complications from any disease or treatment regimen. Other
 )02  therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in conjunction with the methods and compounds
 )03  disclosed herein.
 )04  [0181]     For any compound described herein, the therapeutically effective amount can be
 )05  initially determined from a variety of techniques known in the art, e.g., biochemical
 )06  characterization of inhibition of enzyme (thrombin, KLK1, or KLKB 1), cell culture assays,
 )07  and the like. Target concentrations will be those concentrations of active compound(s) that
 )08  are capable of decreasing enzymatic activity as measured, for example, using the methods
 )09  described.
 )10  [0182]     Therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can be determined from animal
 4Il  models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that
612   has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans can be adjusted by
613   monitoring enzymatic inhibition and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards, as
614   described above.
615   [0183]     Dosages can be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the
616   compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the methods
617   disclosed herein, should be sufficient to affect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient
618   over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of
619   any adverse side effects. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages, which are less
620   than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small
621   increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In some embodiments of
622   a method disclosed herein, the dosage range is 0.0010%to 10% w/v. In some embodiments,
623   the dosage range is 0. 1% to 50%w/v.

624  [0184]     Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the
 )25 administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will
 )26 provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's
 )27 disease state.
 )28 [0185]    Utilizing the teachings provided herein, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic
 )29 treatment regimen can be planned that does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is entirely
 )30 effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This planning
 -31 should involve the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as
 )32 compound potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, presence and severity of
 )33 adverse side effects, preferred mode of administration, and the toxicity profile of the selected
 )34 agent.
 )35 [0186]    Accordingly, in some embodiments, dosage levels of the compounds disclosed
 )36 herein as used in the present methods are of the order of e.g., about 0.1 mg to about 1 mg,
 )37 about 1 mg to about 10 mg, about 0.5 mg to about 20 mg per kilogram body weight, an
 )38 average adult weighing 70 kilograms, with a preferred dosage range between about 0.1 mg to
 )39 about 20 mg per kilogram body weight per day (from about 7.0 mg to about 1.4 gm per
 )40 patient per day). The amount of the compound disclosed herein that can be combined with the
 )41 carrier materials to produce a single dosage will vary depending upon the host treated and the
  42 particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral
 )43 administration to humans can contain about 5 ig to 1 g of a compound disclosed herein with
 )44 an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material that can vary from about 5 to 95
A5   percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from
646  about 0.1 mg to 500 mg of a compound disclosed herein.
647  [0187]     It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient
648  will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound
649  employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of
650  administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease
651  undergoing therapy.
652           C.       Toxicity
653  [0188]     The ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect for a particular compound is its
654  therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD5 0 (the amount of compound
655  lethal in 50% of the population) and ED5 0 (the amount of compound effective in 50% of the
656  population). Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. Therapeutic

657  index data obtained from in vitro assays, cell culture assays and/or animal studies can be used
 )58 in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds
 )59 preferably lies within a range of plasma concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no
 )60 toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed
 )61 and the route of administration utilized. See, e.g. Fingl et al., In: THE PHARMACOLOGICAL
 )62 BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS,     Ch.1, p.1, 1975. The exact formulation, route of administration, and
 )63 dosage can be chosen by the individual practitioner in view of the patient's condition and the
 )64 particular method in which the compound is used. For in vitro formulations, the exact
 )65 formulation and dosage can be chosen by the individual practitioner in view of the patient's
 )66 condition and the particular method in which the compound is used.

 ;89 Franz chamber (Permegear) suitable for rabbit eyes. Test compound is prepared in PBS
 ;90 buffer. The compound solution is added to the donor chamber of the Franz chamber and the
 ;91 entire apparatus placed in an incubator at 37 0 C for four hours. During incubation and at every
 ;92 subsequent hour, a sample is removed from the receiver chamber and analyzed by HPLC
 ;93 (Shimadzu Prominence) using a C18 column (Phenomenex OOF-4605-EO) in reverse phase
 ;94 with acetonitrile in water. The apparent permeability coefficient Papp (cm/s) is calculated as

403  Example 38 - Pharmacokineticsin mice
404  [0279]    In this example, pharmacokinetics in mice is presented for series of example
405  compounds #4, #23, #24, #25, #26. Each compound is administered intravenously (i.v.) as a
406  single dose via tail vein or orally (p.o.) as a single dose via gastric gavage to male CD-I mice
407  of nominal weights between 20 g and 26 g. Nominal doses are 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg for i.v.
408  and p.o., respectively. In some examples (dose type A), both p.o. and i.v. doses are prepared
409  by dissolving the test compound in 5% dimethyl acetamide and diluted in tetraethylene glycol
                                                       109

410  for a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. In other examples (dose type B), i.v. doses are
 Ill prepared by dissolving test compounds in 20% dimethyl acetamide, 40% polyethylene glycol
 112 300 and 40% phosphate buffered saline, and p.o. doses are prepared by dissolving test
 113 compounds in carboxymethyl cellulose suspension (1% by weight) in water and 2.5 %
 114 dimethyl acetamide.
 115 [0280]        Animals are housed in standard holding cages with food and water available ad
 116 libitum except for animals used for p.o. dosing which are fasted overnight prior to dosing.
 117 Samples are taken in triplicate via cardiac puncture at times prior to dosing and at 0.083 (i.v.
 118 only), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after administration. Plasma is obtained by centrifuge
 119 and stored frozen until analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Shimadzu VP System HPLC coupled
 120 to a Applied Biosystems MDS SCIEX API 3000 triple quadrapole MS. Assay results are
 121 calibrated using reference samples prepared in a range between 1.5 and 5000 ng/mL.
 122 [0281]        Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated from mean concentration values using a
 123 non-compartmental analysis as described in the following and as apparent to those of
 124 ordinary skill in the art. Half-lives (t1 /2 ) and elimination rate constants (X) are determined by
 125 log linear regression using equal weighting on the last three finite sample time points.
 126 Concentration at time zero (Co) for the i.v. data is established by the extrapolation of log
 127 linear regression using equal weighting on the first three sample time points. Area under the
 128 curve (AUC) values are calculated using linear trapezoidal integration. Systemic clearance
 129 (CL) is calculated as the ratio of dosage and AUC. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd)
 130 is calculated as the ratio of CL and X.Percent oral bioavailability (%F) is determined from the
 131 ratio of i.v. and p.o. AUC values weighted by dosage.
