                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]    This disclosure relates to novel compositions of antibodies and carrier proteins and
methods of making and using the same, in particular, as a cancer therapeutic.
                                        STATE OF THE ART
[0003]    Chemotherapy remains a mainstay for systemic therapy for many types of cancer,
including melanoma. Most chemotherapeutics are only slightly selective to tumor cells, and
toxicity to healthy proliferating cells can be high (Allen TM. (2002) Cancer 2:750-763), often
requiring dose reduction and even discontinuation of treatment. In theory, one way to overcome
chemotherapy toxicity issues as well as improve drug efficacy is to target the chemotherapy drug
to the tumor using antibodies that are specific for proteins selectively expressed (or
overexpressed) by tumors cells to attract targeted drugs to the tumor, thereby altering the
biodistribution of the chemotherapy and resulting in more drug going to the tumor and less
affecting healthy tissue. Despite 30 years of research, however, specific targeting rarely
succeeds in the therapeutic context.
[0004]    Conventional antibody dependent chemotherapy (ADC) is designed with a toxic agent
linked to a targeting antibody via a synthetic protease-cleavable linker. The efficacy of such
ADC therapy is dependent on the ability of the target cell to bind to the antibody, the linker to be
cleaved, and the uptake of the toxic agent into the target cell. Schrama, D. et al. (2006) Nature
reviews. Drug discovery 5:147-159.

      WO 2016/057554                                                          PCT/US2015/054295
[0005]    Antibody-targeted chemotherapy promised advantages over conventional therapy
because it provides combinations of targeting ability, multiple cytotoxic agents, and improved
therapeutic capacity with potentially less toxicity. Despite extensive research, clinically
effective antibody-targeted chemotherapy remains elusive: major hurdles include the instability
of the linkers between the antibody and chemotherapy drug, reduced tumor toxicity of the
chemotherapeutic agent when bound to the antibody, and the inability of the conjugate to bind
and enter tumor cells. In addition, these therapies did not allow for control over the size of the
antibody-drug conjugates.
[0006]    There remains a need in the art for antibody-based cancer therapeutics that retain
cytoxic effect for targeted drug delivery to provide reliable and improved anti-tumor efficacy
over prior therapeutics.
[0007]    In addition, as to any therapeutic application, there also remains a need for the
composition to be stable in its physical, chemical and biological properties.
[0008]    Lyophilization, or freeze drying, removes water from a composition. In the process, the
material to be dried is first frozen and then the ice or frozen solvent is removed by sublimation in
a vacuum environment. An excipient may be included in pre-lyophilized formulations to enhance
stability during the freeze-drying process and/or to improve stability of the lyophilized product
upon storage. Pikal, M. Biopharm. 3(9)26-30 (1990) and Arakawa et al., Pharm. Res. 8(3):285
291 (1991).
[0009]    While proteins may be lyophilized, the process of lyophilization and reconstitution may
affect the properties of the protein. Because proteins are larger and more complex than
traditional organic and inorganic drugs (i.e. possessing multiple functional groups in addition to
complex three-dimensional structures), the formulation of such proteins poses special problems.
For a protein to remain biologically active, a formulation must preserve intact the conformational
integrity of at least a core sequence of the protein's amino acids while at the same time
protecting the protein's multiple functional groups from degradation. Degradation pathways for
proteins can involve chemical instability (i.e. any process which involves modification of the
protein by bond formation or cleavage resulting in a new chemical entity) or physical instability
(i.e. changes in the higher order structure of the protein). Chemical instability can result from
                                                    2

deamidation, racemization, hydrolysis, oxidation, beta elimination or disulfide exchange.
Physical instability can result from denaturation. aggregation, precipitation or adsorption, for
example. The three most common protein degradation pathways are protein aggregation,
deamidation and oxidation. Cleland, et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems
10(4): 307-377 (1993).
[0010]    In the present invention, the composition comprises nanoparticles which contain (a)
carrier protein (b) antibody and (c) optionally a therapeutic agent. The antibody is believed to be
bound to the carrier protein through hydrophobic interactions which, by their nature, are weak.
The lyophilization and reconstitution of such a composition must, therefore, not only preserve
the activity of the individual components, but also their relative relationship in nanoparticle.
[0011]    Further challenges are imposed because the nanoparticles are used in therapy.
[0012]    For example, rearrangement of the hydrophobic components in the nanoparticle may be
mitigated through covalent bonds between the components. However, such covalent bonds pose
challenges for the therapeutic use of nanoparticles in cancer treatment. The antibody, carrier
protein, and additional therapeutic agent typically act at different locations in a tumor and
through different mechanisms. Non-covalent bonds permit the components of the nanoparticle to
dissociate at the tumor. Thus, while a covalent bond may be advantageous for lyophilization, it
may be disadvantageous for therapeutic use.
[0013]    The size of the nanoparticles, and the distribution of the size, is also important. The
nanoparticles of the invention may behave differently according to their size. At large sizes, the
nanoparticles or the agglomeration of these particles may block blood vessels either of which can
affect the performance and safety of the composition.
[0014]    Finally, cryoprotectants and agents that assist in the lyophilization process must be safe
and tolerated for therapeutic use.
                                            SUMMARY
[0015]    In one aspect, provided herein are nanoparticle compositions comprising nanoparticles
wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises a carrier protein, between about 100 to about 1000
                                                  3

     WO 2016/057554                                                             PCT/US2015/054295
antibodies, and optionally at least one therapeutic agent, wherein the antibodies are arranged
outward from the surface of the nanoparticles and wherein the nanoparticles are capable of
binding to a predetermined epitope in vivo.
[0016]    When administered intravenously, large particles (e.g. greater than 1gm) are typically
disfavored because they can become lodged in the microvasculature of the lungs. At the same
time, larger particles can accumulate in the tumor or specific organs. See e.g. 20-60 micron glass
particle that is used to inject into the hepatic artery feeding a tumor of the liver, called
"therasphere" (in clinical use for liver cancer).
[0017]    Therefore, for intravenous administration, particles under 1gm are used. Particles over
1gm are, more typically, administered directly into a tumor ("direct injection") or into an artery
feeding into the site of the tumor.
[0018]    In another aspect, provided herein are nanoparticle compositions comprising
nanoparticles wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises a carrier protein that is not albumin,
between about 100 to about 100 antibodies, preferably about 400 to about 800 antibodies, and
optionally at least one therapeutic agent, wherein the antibodies are arranged on an outside
surface of the nanoparticles and wherein the nanoparticles are capable of binding to a
predetermined epitope in vivo. When nanoparticles multimerize, the number of antibodies is
increased proportionally. For example, if a 160 nm nanoparticle contains 400 antibodies, a 320
nm dimer contains about 800 antibodies.
[0019]    In another aspect, provided herein are nanoparticle compositions comprising
nanoparticles, wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises carrier protein, between about 400 to
about 800 antibodies, and optionally at least one therapeutic agent that is not paclitaxel, wherein
the antibodies are arranged on a surface of the nanoparticles such that the binding portion of the
antibody is directed outward from that surface and wherein the nanoparticles are capable of
binding to a predetermined epitope in vivo.
[0020]    In other embodiments, the nanoparticles multimerize, e.g. dimerize. Multimerization
may be observed as multiples of the weight or size of the unit molecule, e.g. 160 nm particles
multimerize to about 320 nm, 480 nm, 640 nm, etc. In some embodiments, less than 20% of the
                                                     4

     WO 2016/057554                                                             PCT/US2015/054295
population are multimers. In some embodiments, more than 80% of the population are
multimers.
[0021]     In one embodiment, the weight ratio of carrier-bound drug to antibody (e.g. albumin
bound paclitaxel to bevacizumab) is between about 5:1 to about 1:1. In one embodiment, the
weight ratio of carrier-bound drug to antibody is about 10:4. In one embodiment, the antibody is
a substantially single layer of antibodies on all or part of the surface of the nanoparticle. In one
embodiment, less than 0.01% of nanoparticles in the composition have a size selected from the
group consisting of greater than 200 nm, greater than 300 nm, greater than 400 nm, greater than
500 nm, greater than 600 nm, greater than 700 nm and greater than 800 nm. Larger sizes are
believed to be the result of multimerization of several nanoparticles, each comprising a core and
antibody coating on all or part of the surface of each nanoparticle. .
[0022]    The invention further includes lyophilized compositions, and lyophilized compositions
that do not materially differ from, or are the same as, the properties of freshly-prepared
nanoparticles. In particular, the lypholized composition, upon resuspending in aqueous solution,
is similar or identical to the fresh composition in terms of particle size, particle size distribution,
toxicity for cancer cells, antibody affinity, and antibody specificity. The invention is directed to
the surprising finding that lyophilized nanoparticles retain the properties of freshly-made
nanoparticles notwithstanding the presence of two different protein components in these
particles.
[0023]     In one aspect, this invention relates to a lyophilized nanoparticle composition
comprising nanoparticles, wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises a carrrier-bound drug
core and an amount of antibody arranged on a surface of the core such that the binding portion of
the antibody is directed outward from that surface, wherein the antibodies retain their association
with the outside surface of the nanoparticle upon reconstitution with an aqueous solution. In one
embodiment, the lyophilized composition is stable at room temperature for at least 3 months. In
one embodiment, the reconstituted nanoparticles retain the activity of the therapeutic agent and
are capable of binding to the target in vivo.
[0024]     In one embodiment, the average reconstituted nanoparticle size is from about 130 nm to
about 1 gm. In a preferred embodiment, the average reconstituted nanoparticle size is from about
                                                    5

     WO 2016/057554                                                            PCT/US2015/054295
130 nm to about 200 nm, and more preferably about 160 nm. In one embodiment, in the average
reconstituted nanoparticle size is from greater than 800 nm to about 3.5 gm, comprising
multimers of smaller nanoparticles, e.g. multimers of 100-200 nm nanoparticles. In one
embodiment, the weight ratio of core to antibody is from greater than 1:1 to about 1:3.
[0025]    In one aspect, this disclosure relates to a lyophilized nanoparticle composition
comprising nanoparticles, wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises: (a) an albumin-bound
paclitaxel core and (b) between about 400 to about 800 molecules of bevacizumab arranged on a
surface of the albumin-bound paclitaxel core such that the binding portion of the antibody is
directed outward from that surface, wherein the antibodies retain their association with the
surface of the nanoparticle upon reconstitution with an aqueous solution, provided that said
lyophilized composition is stable at about 20 'C to about 25 'C for at least 3 months and the
reconstituted nanoparticles are capable of binding to VEGF in vivo.
[0026]    In other aspects, this disclosure relates to a lyophilized nanoparticle composition
comprising nanoparticles, wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises: (a) an albumin-bound
paclitaxel core and (b) an amount of bevacizumab arranged on a surface of the albumin-bound
paclitaxel core such that the binding portion of the antibody is directed outward from that
surface, wherein the antibodies retain their association with the surface of the nanoparticle upon
reconstitution with an aqueous solution, provided that said lyophilized composition is stable at
about 20 'C to about 25 'C for at least 3 months and the reconstituted nanoparticles are capable
of binding to VEGF in vivo, and further wherein the average reconstituted nanoparticle size is
not substantially different from the particle size of the freshly prepared nanoparticles. In some
embodiments, the particle sizes are between 200 and 800 nm, including 200, 300, 400, 500, 600,
700 or 800nm. In other embodiments, the particles are larger, e.g. from greater than 800 nm to
about 3.5 gm. In some embodiments, the particles are multimers of nanoparticles.
[0027]    In some embodiments, the weight ratio of albumin-bound paclitaxel to bevacizumab is
between about 5:1 to about 1:1. In other embodiments, the weight ratio of albumin-bound
paclitaxel to bevacizumab is about 10:4. In further embodiments, the weight ratio of albumin
bound paclitaxel to bevacizumab is from greater than 1:1 to about 1:3.

[0028]    In some embodiments, the core is albumin-bound paclitaxel, and the antibodies are
selected from antibodies that selectively recognize VEGF (e.g. bevacizumab/Avastin), antibodies
that selectively recognize CD20 (e.g. rituximab/Rituxin) and antibodies that selectively
recognize Her2 (Trastuzumab/Herceptin).
[0029]    In some embodiments, the at least one therapeutic agent is located inside the
nanoparticle. In other embodiments, the at least one therapeutic agent is located on the outside
surface of the nanoparticle. In yet other embodiments, the at least one therapeutic agent is
located inside the nanoparticle and on the outside surface of the nanoparticle.
[0030] In some embodiments, the nanoparticle contains more than one type of therapeutic
agent. For example, a taxane and a platinum drug, e.g. paclitaxel and cisplatin.
[0031]    In some embodiments, the antibodies are selected from the group consisting of ado
trastuzumab emtansine, alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, denosumab, dinutuximab,
ipilimumab, nivolumab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, panitumumab, pembrolizumab,
pertuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. In some embodiments, the antibodies are a
substantially single layer of antibodies on all or part of the surface of the nanoparticle.
[0032]    In further embodiments, the antibodies are less glycosylated than normally found in
natural human antibodies. Such glycosylation can be influenced by e.g. the expression system,
or the presence of glycosylation inhibitors during expression. In some embodiments, the
glycosylation status of an antibody is altered through enzymatic or chemical action.
[0033]    In some embodiments, the at least one therapeutic agent is selected from the group
consisting of abiraterone, bendamustine, bortezomib, carboplatin, cabazitaxel, cisplatin,

[0034]    In some emobodiments, the nanoparticle further comprises at least one additional
therapeutic agent that is not paclitaxel or bevacizumab.
[0035]    In some embodiments, the antibodies, carrier protein and, when present, therapeutic
agent, are bound through non-covalent bonds.
[0036]    In some embodiments, the carrier protein is selected from the group consisting of
gelatin, elastin, gliadin, legumin, zein, a soy protein, a milk protein, and a whey protein. In other
embodiments, the carrier protein is albumin, for example, human serum albumin.
[0037]    In some embodiments, the composition is formulated for intravenous delivery. In other
embodiments, the composition is formulated for direct injection or perfusion into a tumor.
[0038]    In some embodiments, the average nanoparticle size in the composition is from greater
than 800 nm to about 3.5 gm.
[0039]    In some embodiments, the nanoparticles have a dissociation constant between about 1 x
10-11 M and about 1 x 10- 9 M.
[0040]    In another aspect, provided herein are methods of making nanoparticle compositions,
wherein said methods comprise contacting the carrier protein and the optionally at least one
therapeutic agent with the antibodies in a solution having a pH of between 5.0 and 7.5 and a
temperature between about 50 C and about 60'C, between about 23'C and about 60'C, or
between about 550 C and about 60'C under conditions and ratios of components that will allow
for formation of the desired nanoparticles. In one embodiment, the nanoparticle is made at 55
60'C and pH 7.0. In another aspect, provided herein are methods of making the nanoparticle
compositions, wherein said method comprises (a) contacting the carrier protein and optionally
the at least one therapeutic agent to form a core and (b) contacting the core with the antibodies in
a solution having a pH of about 5.0 to about 7.5 at a temperature between about 50 C and about
60'C, between about 23'C and about 60'C, or between about 550 C and about 60'C under
conditions and ratios of components that will allow for formation of the desired nanoparticles.
[0041]    The amount of components (e.g., carrier protein, antibodies, therapeutic agents,
combinations thereof) is controlled in order to provide for formation of the desired

nanoporaticles. A composistion wherein the amount of components is too dilute will not form
the nanoparticles as desirbed herein. In a prefered embodiment, weight ratio of carrier protein to
antibody is 10:4. In some embodiments, the amount of carrier protein is between about 1 mg/mL
and about 100 mg/mL. In some embodiments, the amount of antibody is between about 1
mg/mL and about 30 mg/mL. For example, in some embodiments, the ratio of carrier
protein:antibody:solution is approximately 9 mg of carrier protein (e.g., albumin) to 4 mg of
antibody (e.g., BEV) in 1 mL of solution (e.g., saline). An amount of therapeutic agent (e.g.,
taxol) can also be added to the carrier protein.
[0042]    In further embodiments, the nanoparticles are made as above, and then lyophilized.
[0043]    In another aspect, provided herein are methods for treating a cancer cell, the method
comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of a nanoparticle composition disclosed
herein to treat the cancer cell.
[0044]    In another aspect, provided herein are methods for treating a tumor in a patient in need
thereof, the method comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of a nanoparticle
composition disclosed herein to treat the tumor. In some embodiments, the size of the tumor is
reduced. In other embodiments, the nanoparticle composition is administered intravenously. In
yet other embodiments, the nanoparticle composition is administered by direct injection or
perfusion into the tumor.
[0045]    In some embodiments, the methods provided herein include the steps of: a)
administering the nanoparticle composition once a week for three weeks; b) ceasing
administration of the nanoparticle composition for one week; and c) repeating steps a) and b) as
necessary to treat the tumor.
[0046]    In related embodiments, the treatment comprises administration of the targeting
antibody prior to administration of the nanoparticles. In one embodiment, the targeting antibody
is administered between about 6 and 48, or 12 and 48 hours prior to administration of the
nanoparticles. In another embodiment, the targeting antibody is administered between 6 and 12
hours prior to administration of the nanoparticles. In yet another embodiment, the targeting
antibody is administered between 2 and 8 hours prior to administration of the nanoparticles. In

still other embodiments, the targeting antibody is administered a week prior to administration of
the nanoparticles. For example, administration of a dose of BEV 24 hours prior to
administration of AB 160. In another example, prior administration of rituximab prior to
administering AR nanoparticles. The antibody administered prior to the nanoparticle may be
administered as a dose that is subtherapeutic, such as 1/2, 1/ 101h or 1/20 the amount normally
considered therapeutic. Thus, in man, pretreatment with BEV may comprise administration of
1mg/kg BEV which is 1 /1 0 h the ususual dose, followed by administration of AB160.
[0047]     In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount comprises about 75 mg/m 2
to about 175 mg/m 2 of the carrier protein (i.e., milligrams carrier protein per m2 of the patient).
In other embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount comprises about 75 mg/m 2 to about
175 mg/m 2 of therapeutic agent (e.g., paclitaxel). In other embodiments, the therapeutically
effective amount comprises about 30 mg/m 2 to about 70 mg/m 2 of the antibody. In yet other
embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount comprises about 30 mg/m 2 to about 70 mg/m 2
bevacizumab.
[0048]     In one specific embodiment, the lypholized composition comprises from about 75
mg/m 2 to about 175 mg/m 2 of the carrier protein which is preferably albumin; from about 30
mg/m 2 to about 70 mg/m 2 of the antibody which is preferably bevacizumab; and from about
about 75 mg/m 2 to about 175 mg/m 2 of paclitaxel.

[0055]    FIG. 2A shows the size of the complexes (determined by light scattering technology)
formed by adding BEV (bevacizumab) to ABX under conditions where nanoparticles and higher
are formed. Increasing concentrations of BEV (0-25 mg) were added to 10 mg of ABX and the
size of the complexes formed was determined. The average size of the complexes (146 nm to
2,166 nm ) increased as the concentration of BEV was increased. The data is displayed as
volume of sample/size and graphs show the size distribution of the particles. This data is
representative of 5 separate drug preparations. As a comparison, ABX, by itself, has an average
particle size of about 130 nm.

[0094]   After reading this description it will become apparent to one skilled in the art how to
implement the invention in various alternative embodiments and alternative applications.
However, all the various embodiments of the present invention will not be described herein. It
will be understood that the embodiments presented here are presented by way of an example
only, and not limitation. As such, this detailed description of various alternative embodiments
should not be construed to limit the scope or breadth of the present invention as set forth below.
[0095]   Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that the
aspects described below are not limited to specific compositions, methods of preparing such
compositions, or uses thereof as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the
                                                  17

     WO 2016/057554                                                          PCT/US2015/054295
terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not
intended to be limiting.
[0096]    The detailed description of the invention is divided into various sections only for the
reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another
section. Titles or subtitles may be used in the specification for the convenience of a reader,
which are not intended to influence the scope of the present invention.
Definitions
[0097]    Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention
belongs. In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number
of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings:
[0098]    The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments
only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms "a",
"an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise.
[0099]    "Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance
can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance
occurs and instances where it does not.
[0100]    The term "about" when used before a numerical designation, e.g., temperature, time,
amount, concentration, and such other, including a range, indicates approximations which may
vary by (+ ) or ( - ) 10%, 5%,1%, or any subrange or subvalue there between. Preferably, the
term "about" when used with regard to a dose amount means that the dose may vary by +/- 10%.
For example, "about 400 to about 800 antibodies" indicates that an outside surface of a
nanoparticles contain an amount of antibody between 360 and 880 particles.
[0101]    "Comprising" or "comprises" is intended to mean that the compositions and methods
include the recited elements, but not excluding others. "Consisting essentially of" when used to
define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential
                                                  18

     WO 2016/057554                                                             PCT/US2015/054295
significance to the combination for the stated purpose. Thus, a composition consisting
essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude other materials or steps that do
not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. "Consisting
of' shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method
steps. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this
invention.
[0102]    The term "nanoparticle" as used herein refers to particles having at least one dimension
which is less than 5 microns. In preferred embodiments, such as for intravenous administration,
the nanoparticle is less than 1 micron. For direct administration, the nanoparticle is larger. Even
larger particles are expressly contemplated by the invention.
[0103]    In a population of particles, the size of individual particles are distributed about a mean.
Particle sizes for the population can therefore be represented by an average, and also by
percentiles. D50 is the particle size below which 50% of the particles fall. 10% of particles are
smaller than the D10 value and 90% of particles are smaller than D90. Where unclear, the
"average" size is equivalent to D50. So, for example, AB160 refers to nanoparticles having an
average size of 160 nanometers.
[0104]    The term "nanoparticle" may also encompass discrete multimers of smaller unit
nanoparticles. For example, a 320 nm particle comprises a dimer of a unit 160 nm nanoparticle.
For 160 nm nanoparticles, multimers would therefore be approximately 320 nm, 480 nm, 640
nm, 800 nm, 960 nm, 1120 nm, and so on.
[0105]    The term "carrier protein" as used herein refers to proteins that function to transport
antibodies and/or therapeutic agents. The antibodies of the present disclosure can reversibly bind
to the carrier proteins. Exemplary carrier proteins are discussed in more detail below.
[0106]    The term "core" as used herein refers to central or inner portion of the nanoparticle
which may be comprised of a carrier protein, a carrier protein and a therapeutic agent, or other
agents or combination of agents. In some embodiments, a hydrophobic portion of the antibody
may be incorporated into the core.
                                                   19

[0107]    The term "therapeutic agent" as used herein means an agent which is therapeutically
useful, e.g., an agent for the treatment, remission or attenuation of a disease state, physiological
condition, symptoms, or etiological factors, or for the evaluation or diagnosis thereof. A
therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent, for example, mitotic inhibitors,
topoisomerase inhibitors, steroids, anti-tumor antibiotics, antimetabolites, alkylating agents,
enzymes, proteasome inhibitors, or any combination thereof.
[0108]    The term "antibody" or "antibodies" as used herein refers to immunoglobulin molecules
and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules (i.e., molecules that contain
an antigen binding site that immuno-specifically bind an antigen). The term also refers to
antibodies comprised of two immunoglobulin heavy chains and two immunoglobulin light chains
as well as a variety of forms including full length antibodies and portions thereof; including, for
example, an immunoglobulin molecule, a monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a CDR
grafted antibody, a humanized antibody, a Fab, a Fab', a F(ab')2, a Fv, a disulfide linked Fv, a
scFv, a single domain antibody (dAb), a diabody, a multispecific antibody, a dual specific
antibody, an anti-idiotypic antibody, a bispecific antibody, a functionally active epitope-binding
fragment thereof, bifunctional hybrid antibodies (e.g., Lanzavecchia et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 17,
105 (1987)) and single chains (e.g., Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 85, 5879-5883
(1988) and Bird et al., Science 242, 423-426 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference).
(See, generally, Hood et al., Immunology, Benjamin, N.Y., 2ND ed. (1984); Harlow and Lane,
Antibodies. A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988); Hunkapiller and
Hood, Nature, 323, 15-16 (1986), which are incorporated herein by reference). The antibody
may be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE or IgD). Preferably, the antibody is IgG. An
antibody may be non-human (e.g., from mouse, goat, or any other animal), fully human,
humanized, or chimeric.
[0109]    The term "dissociation constant," also referred to as "Kd," refers to a quantity
expressing the extent to which a particular substance separates into individual components (e.g.,
the protein carrier, antibody, and optional therapeutic agent).
[0110]    The terms "lyophilized," lyophilizationn" and the like as used herein refer to a process
by which the material (e.g., nanoparticles) to be dried is first frozen and then the ice or frozen

solvent is removed by sublimation in a vacuum environment. An excipient is optionally
included in pre-lyophilized formulations to enhance stability of the lyophilized product upon
storage. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles can be formed from lyophilized components
(carrier protein, antibodiy and optional therapeutic) prior to use as a therapeutic. In other
embodiments, the carrier protein, antibody, and optional therapeutic agent are first combined into
nanoparticles and then lyophilized. The lyophilized sample may further contain additional
excipients.
[0111]    The term "bulking agents" comprise agents that provide the structure of the freeze-dried
product. Common examples used for bulking agents include mannitol, glycine, lactose and
sucrose. In addition to providing a pharmaceutically elegant cake, bulking agents may also
impart useful qualities in regard to modifying the collapse temperature, providing freeze-thaw
protection, and enhancing the protein stability over long-term storage. These agents can also
serve as tonicity modifiers.
[0112]    The term "buffer" encompasses those agents which maintain the solution pH in an
acceptable range prior to lyophilization and may include succinate (sodium or potassium),
histidine, phosphate (sodium or potassium), Tris(tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane),
diethanolamine, citrate (sodium) and the like. The buffer of this invention has a pH in the range
from about 5.5 to about 6.5; and preferably has a pH of about 6.0. Examples of buffers that will
control the pH in this range include succinate (such as sodium succinate), gluconate, histidine,
citrate and other organic acid buffers.
[0113]    The term "cryoprotectants" generally includes agents which provide stability to the
protein against freezing-induced stresses, presumably by being preferentially excluded from the
protein surface. They may also offer protection during primary and secondary drying, and long
term product storage. Examples are polymers such as dextran and polyethylene glycol; sugars
such as sucrose, glucose, trehalose, and lactose; surfactants such as polysorbates; and amino
acids such as glycine, arginine, and serine.
[0114]    The term "lyoprotectant" includes agents that provide stability to the protein during the
drying or 'dehydration' process (primary and secondary drying cycles), presumably by providing
an amorphous glassy matrix and by binding with the protein through hydrogen bonding,

replacing the water molecules that are removed during the drying process. This helps to maintain
the protein conformation, minimize protein degradation during the lyophilization cycle and
improve the long-term products. Examples include polyols or sugars such as sucrose and
trehalose.
[0115]    The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to preparations which are in such form as
to permit the active ingredients to be effective, and which contains no additional components
which are toxic to the subjects to which the formulation would be administered.
[0116]    "Pharmaceutically acceptable" excipients (vehicles, additives) are those which can
reasonably be administered to a subject mammal to provide an effective dose of the active
ingredient employed.
[0117]    "Reconstitution time" is the time that is required to rehydrate a lyophilized formulation
with a solution to a particle-free clarified solution.
[0118]    A "stable" formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its physical
stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological activity upon storage.
[0119]    The term "epitope" as used herein refers to the portion of an antigen which is
recognized by an antibody. Epitopes include, but are not limited to, a short amino acid sequence
or peptide (optionally glycosylated or otherwise modified) enabling a specific interaction with a
protein (e.g., an antibody) or ligand. For example, an epitope may be a part of a molecule to
which the antigen-binding site of an antibody attaches.
[0120]    The term "treating" or "treatment" covers the treatment of a disease or disorder (e.g.,
cancer), in a subject, such as a human, and includes: (i) inhibiting a disease or disorder, i.e.,
arresting its development; (ii) relieving a disease or disorder, i.e., causing regression of the
disorder; (iii) slowing progression of the disorder; and/or (iv) inhibiting, relieving, or slowing
progression of one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder. In some embodiments
"treating" or "treatment" refers to the killing of cancer cells.
[0121]    The term "kill" with respect to a cancer treatment is directed to include any type of
manipulation that will lead to the death of that cancer cell or at least of portion of a population of
cancer cells.

[0122]     Additionally, some terms used in this specification are more specifically defined below.
Overview
[0123]     The current invention is predicated, in part, on the surprising discovery that optionally
lyophilized nanoparticles comprising a carrier protein, an antibody, and a therapeutic agent
provide targeted therapy to a tumor while minimizing toxicity to the patient. The nanoparticles as
described herein are thus a significant improvement versus conventional ADCs.
[0124]     For conventional ADCs to be effective, it is critical that the linker be stable enough not
to dissociate in the systemic circulation but allow for sufficient drug release at the tumor site.
Alley, S.C., et al. (2008) Bioconjug Chem 19:759-765. This has proven to be a major hurdle in
developing effective drug conjugate (Julien, D.C., et al. (2011) MAbs 3:467-478; Alley, S.C., et
al. (2008) Bioconjug Chem 19:759-765); therefore, an attractive feature of the nano-immune
conjugate is that a biochemical linker is not required.
[0125]     Another shortcoming of current ADCs is that higher drug penetration into the tumor has
not been substantively proven in human tumors. Early testing of ADCs in mouse models
suggested that tumor targeting with antibodies would result in a higher concentration of the
active agent in the tumor (Deguchi, T. et al. (1986) CancerRes 46: 3751-3755); however, this
has not correlated in the treatment of human disease, likely because human tumors are much
more heterogeneous in permeability than mouse tumors. Jain, R.K. et al. (2010) Nat Rev Clin
Oncol 7:653-664. Also, the size of the nanoparticle is critical for extravasation from the
vasculature into the tumor. In a mouse study using a human colon adenocarcinoma
xenotransplant model, the vascular pores were permeable to liposomes up to 400 nm. Yuan, F.,
et al. (1995) Cancer Res 55: 3752-3756. Another study of tumor pore size and permeability
demonstrated that both characteristics were dependent on tumor location and growth status, with
regressing tumors and cranial tumors permeable to particles less than 200 nm. Hobbs, S.K., et
al. (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 95:4607-4612. The nano-immune conjugate described
herein overcomes this issue by the fact that the large complex, which is less than 200 nm intact,
is partially dissociated in systemic circulation into smaller functional units that are easily able to
permeate tumor tissue. Furthermore, once the conjugate arrives to the tumor site, the smaller
                                                  23

      WO 2016/057554                                                         PCT/US2015/054295
toxic payload can be released and only the toxic portion needs to be taken up by tumor cells, not
the entire conjugate.
[0126]     The advent of antibody- (i.e. AVASTIN@) coated albumin nanoparticles containing a
therapeutic agent (i.e., ABRAXANE@) has led to a new paradigm of directional delivery of two
or more therapeutic agents to a predetermined site in vivo. See PCT Patent Publication Nos. WO
2012/154861 and WO 2014/055415, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
[0127]     When compositions of albumin and an antibody are admixed together in an aqueous
solution at specific concentrations and ratios, the antibodies spontaneously self-assemble into
and onto the albumin to form nanoparticles having multiple copies of the antibody (up to 500 or
more). Without being limited to any theory, it is contemplated that the antigen receptor portion
of the antibody is positioned outward from the nanoparticle while the hydrophobic tail in
integrated into the albumin by hydrophobic - hydrophobic interactions.
[0128]     While protein compositions comprising a single source protein are commonly stored in
lyophilized form where they exhibit significant shelf-life, such lyophilized compositions do not
contain a self-assembled nanoparticle of two different proteins integrated together by
hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the nanoparticle configuration wherein a
majority of the antibody binding portions are exposed on the surface of the nanoparticles lends
itself to being susceptible to dislodgement or reconfiguration by conditions which otherwise
would be considered benign. For example, during lyophilization, ionic charges on the proteins
are dehydrated thereby exposing the underlying charges. Exposed charges allow for charge
charge interactions between the two proteins which can alter the binding affinity of each protein
to the other. In addition, the concentration of the nanoparticles increases significantly as the
solvent (e.g., water) is removed. Such increased concentrations of nanoparticles could lead to
irreversible oligomerization. Oligomerization is a known property of proteins that reduces the
biological properties of the oligomer as compared to the monomeric form and increases the size
of the particle sometimes beyond 1 micron.
[0129]     On the other hand, a stable form of a nanoparticle composition is required for clinical
and/or commercial use where a shelf-life of at least 3 months is required and shelf-lives of
                                                  24

      WO 2016/057554                                                           PCT/US2015/054295
greater than 6 months or 9 months are preferred. Such a stable composition must be readily
available for intravenous injection, must retain its self-assembled form upon intravenous
injection so as to direct the nanoparticle to the predetermined site in vivo, must have a maximum
size of less than 1 micron so as to avoid any ischemic event when delivered into the blood
stream, and finally must be compatible with the aqueous composition used for injection.
Compounds
[0130]     As will be apparent to the skilled artisan upon reading this disclosure, the present
disclosure relates to compositions of nanoparticles containing a carrier protein, antibodies, and
optionally at least one therapeutic agent, wherein said compositions are optionally lyophilized.
[0131]    In some embodiments, the carrier protein can be albumin, gelatin, elastin (including
topoelastin) or elastin-derived polypeptides (e.g., a-elastin and elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs)),
gliadin, legumin, zein, soy protein (e.g., soy protein isolate (SPI)), milk protein (e.g., 0
lactoglobulin (BLG) and casein), or whey protein (e.g., whey protein concentrates (WPC) and
whey protein isolates (WPI)). In preferred embodiments, the carrier protein is albumin. In
preferred embodiments, the albumin is egg white (ovalbumin), bovine serum albumin (BSA), or
the like. In even more preferred embodiments, the carrier protein is human serum albumin
(HSA). In some embodiments, the carrier protein is a generally regarded as safe (GRAS)
excipient approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
[0132]    In some embodiments, the antibodies are selected from the group consisting of ado
trastuzumab emtansine, alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, denosumab, dinutuximab,
ipilimumab, nivolumab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, panitumumab, pembrolizumab,
pertuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. In som embodiments, the antibodies are a substantially
single layer of antibodies on all or part of the surface of the nanoparticle.

agents, five therapeutic agents, or more. Furthermore, a nanoparticle may contain the same or
different therapeutic agents inside and outside the nanoparticle.
[0137] In some embodiments any carrier protein, antibody, therapeutic agent, or any
combination thereof is expressly excluded. For example in some embodiments a composition
may comprise any carrier protein and chemotherapeutic except Abraxane@ and/or any targeting
antibody except bevacizumab.
[0138]   In one aspect, the nanoparticle comprises at least 100 antibodies non-covalently bound
to the surface of the nanoparticle. In one aspect, the nanoparticle comprises at least 200
antibodies non-covalently bound to the surface of the nanoparticle. In one aspect, the

antibodies non-covalently bound to the surface of the nanoparticle. In one aspect, the

Contemplated values include any value or subrange within any of the recited ranges, including
endpoints.
[0140] In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is less than about
1 gm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between about
130 nm and about 1 gm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition
is between about 130 nm and about 900 nm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the
nanoparticle composition is between about 130 nm and about 800 nm. In one aspect, the average
particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between about 130 nm and about 700 nm. In one
aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between about 130 nm and
about 600 nm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between
about 130 nm and about 500 nm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle
composition is between about 130 nm and about 400 nm. In one aspect, the average particle size
in the nanoparticle composition is between about 130 nm and about 300 nm. In one aspect, the
average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between about 130 nm and about 200 nm.
In a preferred embodiment, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between
about 150 nm and about 180 nm. In an especially preferred embodiment, the mean particle size
in the nanoparticle composition is about 160 nm. Contemplated values include any value,
subrange, or range within any of the recited ranges, including endpoints.
[0141] In one aspect, the nanoparticle composition is formulated for intravenous injection. In
order to avoid an ischemic event, the nanoparticle composition formulated for intravenous
injection should comprise nanoparticles with an average particle size of less than about 1 gm.
[0142]   In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is greater than
about 1 gm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between
about 1 gm and about 5 gm. In one aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle
composition is between about 1 gm and about 4 gm. In one aspect, the average particle size in
the nanoparticle composition is between about 1 gm and about 3 gm. In one aspect, the average
particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between about 1 gm and about 2 gm. In one
aspect, the average particle size in the nanoparticle composition is between about 1 gm and

about 1.5 gm. Contemplated values include any value, subrange, or range within any of the
recited ranges, including endpoints.
[0143] In one aspect, the nanoparticle composition is formulated for direct injection into a
tumor. Direct injection includes injection into or proximal to a tumor site, perfusion into a tumor,
and the like. When formulated for direct injection into a tumor, the nanoparticle may comprise
any average particle size. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that larger particles (e.g.,
greater than 500 nm, greater than 1 gm, and the like) are more likely to be immobilized within
the tumor, thereby providing a beneficial effect. Larger particles can accumulate in the tumor or
specific organs. See, e.g., 20-60 micron glass particle that is used to inject into the hepatic artery
feeding a tumor of the liver, called "TheraSphere@" (in clinical use for liver cancer). Therefore,
for intravenous administration, particles under 1 gm are typically used. Particles over 1 gm are,
more typically, administered directly into a tumor ("direct injection") or into an artery feeding
into the site of the tumor.
[0144] In one aspect, less than about 0.01% of the nanoparticles within the composition have a
particle size greater than 200 nm, greater than 300 nm, greater than 400 nm, greater than 500 nm,
greater than 600 nm, greater than 700 nm, or greater than 800 nm. In one aspect, less than about
0.001% of the nanoparticles within the composition have a particle size greater than 200 nm,
greater than 300 nm, greater than 400 nm, greater than 500 nm, greater than 600 nm, greater than
700 nm, or greater than 800 nm. In a preferred embodiment, less than about 0.0 1% of the
nanoparticles within the composition have a particle size greater than 800 nm. In a more
preferred embodiment, less than about 0.001% of the nanoparticles within the composition have
a particle size greater than 800 nm.
[0145] In a preferred aspect, the sizes and size ranges recited herein relate to particle sizes of
the reconstituted lyophilized nanoparticle composition. That is, after the lyophilized
nanoparticles are resuspended in an aqueous solution (e.g., water, other pharmaceutically
acceptable excipient, buffer, etc.), the particle size or average particle size is within the range
recited herein.
[0146] In one aspect, at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%,97%, 98%, 99%,
99.5%, or 99.9% of the nanoparticles are present in the reconstituted composition as single
                                                   40

nanoparticles. That is, fewer than about 50%, 40%, 30%, etc. of the nanoparticles are dimerized
or multimerized (oligomerized).
[0147] In some embodiments, the size of the nanoparticle can be controlled by the adjusting the
amount (e.g., ratio) of carrier protein to antibody. The size of the nanoparticles, and the size
distribution, is also important. The nanoparticles of the invention may behave differently
according to their size. At large sizes, an agglomeration may block blood vessels. Therefore,
agglomeration of nanoparticles can affect the performance and safety of the composition. On the
other hand, larger particles may be more therapeutic under certain conditions (e.g., when not
administered intravenously).
[0148]    In one aspect, the nanoparticle composition comprises at least one additional therapeutic
agent. In one embodiment, the at least one additional therapeutic agent is non-covalently bound
to the outside surface of the nanoparticle. In one embodiment, the at least one additional
therapeutic agent is arranged on the outside surface of the nanoparticle. In one embodiment, the
at least one additional therapeutic agent is selected from the group consisting of abiraterone,
bendamustine, bortezomib, carboplatin, cabazitaxel, cisplatin, chlorambucil, dasatinib, docetaxel,
doxorubicin, epirubicin, erlotinib, etoposide, everolimus, gemcitabine, gefitinib, idarubicin,

cyclophosphamide. In one embodiment, the at least one additional therapeutic agent is an anti
cancer antibody.
Methods of Making Nanoparticles
[0149]    In some aspects, the current invention relates to methods of making nanoparticle
compositions as described herein.
[0150]    In one aspect, the nanoparticles of the nanoparticle composition are formed by
contacting the carrier protein or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle with the antibody at a
ratio of about 10:1 to about 10:30 carrier protein particle or carrier protein-therapeutic agent
particle to antibody. In one embodiment, the ratio is about 10:2 to about 10:25. In one
                                                   41

     WO 2016/057554                                                           PCT/US2015/054295
embodiment, the ratio is about 10:2 to about 1:1. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio is about
10:2 to about 10:6. In an especially preferred embodiment, the ratio is about 10:4.
Contemplated ratios include any value, subrange, or range within any of the recited ranges,
including endpoints.
[0151] In one embodiment, the amount of solution or other liquid medium employed to form the
nanoparticles is particularly important. No nanoparticles are formed in an overly dilute solution
of the carrier protein (or carrier protein-therapeutic agent) and the antibodies. An overly
concentrated solution will result in unstructured aggregates. In some embodiments, the amount
of solution (e.g., sterile water, saline, phosphate buffered saline) employed is between about 0.5
mL of solution to about 20 mL of solution. In some embodiments, the amount of carrier protein
is between about 1 mg/mL and about 100 mg/mL. In some embodiments, the amount of
antibody is between about 1 mg/mL and about 30 mg/mL. For example, in some embodiments,
the ratio of carrier protein:antibody:solution is approximately 9 mg of carrier protein (e.g.,
albumin) to 4 mg of antibody (e.g., BEV) in 1 mL of solution (e.g., saline). An amount of
therapeutic agent (e.g., taxol) can also be added to the carrier protein. For example, 1 mg of
taxol can be added 9 mg of carrier protein (10 mg carrier protein-therapeutic) and 4 mg of
antibody in 1 mL of solution. When using a typical i.v. bag, for example, with the solution of
approximately 1 liter one would need to use 1000x the amount of carrier protein/carrier protein
therapeutic agent and antibodies compared to that used in 1 mL. Thus, one cannot form the
present nanoparticles in a standard i.v. bag. Furthermore, when the components are added to a
standard i.v. bag in the therapeutic amounts of the present invention, the components do not
self-assemble to form nanoparticles.
[0152] In one embodiment, the carrier protein or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle is
contacted with the antibody in a solution having a pH between about 4 and about 8. In one
embodiment, the carrier protein or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle is contacted with the
antibody in a solution having a pH of about 4. In one embodiment, the carrier protein or carrier
protein-therapeutic agent particle is contacted with the antibody in a solution having a pH of
about 5. In one embodiment, the carrier protein or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle is
contacted with the antibody in a solution having a pH of about 6. In one embodiment, the carrier
protein or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle is contacted with the antibody in a solution

      WO 2016/057554                                                           PCT/US2015/054295
having a pH of about 7. In one embodiment, the carrier protein or carrier protein-therapeutic
agent particle is contacted with the antibody in a solution having a pH of about 8. In a preferred
embodiment, the carrier protein or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle is contacted with the
antibody in a solution having a pH between about 5 and about 7.
[0153]    In one embodiment, the carrier protein particle or carrier protein-therapeutic agent
particle is incubated with the antibody at a temperature of about 5 'C to about 60 'C, or any
range, subrange, or value within that range including endpoints. In a preferred embodiment, the
carrier protein particle or carrier protein-therapeutic agent particle is incubated with the antibody
at a temperature of about 23 'C to about 60 'C.
[0154]    Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the stability of the nanoparticles
within the nanoparticle composition is, at least in part, dependent upon the temperature and/or
pH at which the nanoparticles are formed, as well as the concentration of the components (i.e.,
carrier protein, antibody, and optionally therapeutic agent) in the solution. In one embodiment,
the Kd of the nanoparticles is between about 1 x 10-11 M and about 2 x 10-5 M. In one
embodiment, the Kd of the nanoparticles is between about 1 x 10-"1 M and about 2 x 10-8 M In
one embodiment, the Kd of the nanoparticles is between about1        x 10-" M and about 7 x 10-9M.
In a preferred embodiment, the Kd of the nanoparticles is between about        x 10-" M and about 3
x 10-8 M. Contemplated values include any value, subrange, or range within any of the recited
ranges, including endpoints.
Lyophilization
[0155]    The lyophilized compositions of this invention are prepared by standard lyophilization
techniques with or without the presence of stabilizers, buffers, etc. Surprisingly, these conditions
do not alter the relatively fragile structure of the nanoparticles. Moreover, at best, these
nanoparticles retain their size distribution upon lyophilization and, more importantly, can be
reconstituted for in vivo administration (e.g., intravenous delivery) in substantially the same form
and ratios as if freshly made.

Formulations
[0156]    In one aspect, the nanoparticle composition is formulated for direct injection into a
tumor. Direct injection includes injection into or proximal to a tumor site, perfusion into a
tumor, and the like. Because the nanoparticle composition is not administered systemically, a
nanoparticle composition is formulated for direct injection into a tumor may comprise any
average particle size. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that larger particles (e.g.,
greater than 500 nm, greater than 1 gm, and the like) are more likely to be immobilized within
the tumor, thereby providing what is believed to be a better beneficial effect.

device may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack, or glass, and
rubber stoppers such as in vials. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by
instructions for administration. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention
formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate
container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition.

[0171]     In general, the compounds of this invention will be administered in a therapeutically
effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar
utilities. The actual amount of the compound of this invention, i.e., the nanoparticles, will
depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and
relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of
administration, and other factors well known to the skilled artisan.
[0172]     An effective amount of such agents can readily be determined by routine
experimentation, as can the most effective and convenient route of administration, and the most
appropriate formulation. Various formulations and drug delivery systems are available in the art.
See, e.g., Gennaro, A.R., ed. (1995) Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences,        1 8 th ed., Mack
Publishing Co..
[0173]     An effective amount or a therapeutically effective amount or dose of an agent, e.g., a
compound of the invention, refers to that amount of the agent or compound that results in
amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a subject. Toxicity and therapeutic
efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell
cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50 %of the
population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50 %of the population). The
dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the
ratio LD50/ ED50. Agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.
[0174]     The effective amount or therapeutically effective amount is the amount of the
compound or pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a
tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical
doctor or other clinician. Dosages may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form
employed and/or the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of

administration, dosage, and dosage interval should be chosen according to methods known in the
art, in view of the specifics of a subject's condition.
[0175]     Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of
the active moiety that are sufficient to achieve the desired effects; i.e., the minimal effective
concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from, for
example, in vitro data and animal experiments. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will
depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. In cases of local administration
or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma
concentration.

Example 1: Nanoparticle Preparation
[0179]   Abraxane (ABX) (10 mg) was suspended in bevacizumab (BEV) (4 mg [160 gl] unless
otherwise indicated), and 840 gl of 0.9% saline was added to give a final concentration of 10
                                              49

      WO 2016/057554                                                         PCT/US2015/054295
mg/ml and 2 mg/ml of ABX and BEV, respectively. The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes
at room temperature (or at the temperature indicated) to allow particle formation.             For
Mastersizer experiments to measure particle size of ABX:BEV complexes, 10 mg of ABX was
suspended in BEV at concentrations of 0 to 25 mg/ml. Complexes of ABX with rituximab (0-10
mg/ml) or trastuzumab (0-22 mg/ml) were formed under similar conditions.
[0180]     For use in humans, the ABX:BEV complexes may be prepared by obtaining the dose
appropriate number of 4 mL vials of 25 mg/mL BEV and diluting each vial per the following
directions to 4 mg/mL. The dose appropriate number of 100 mg vials of ABX can be prepared
by reconstituting to a final concentration containing 10 mg/mL ABX nanoparticles. Using
a sterile 3 mL syringe, 1.6 mL (40 mg) of bevacizumab (25 mg/mL) can be withdrawn and
slowly injected, over a minimum of 1 minute, onto the inside wall of each of the vials containing
100 mg of ABX. The bevacizumab solution should not be injected directly onto the lyophilized
cake as this will result in foaming. Then, using a sterile 12 mL sterile syringe, 8.4 mL 0.9%
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, can be withdrawn and slowly injected, over a minimum of 1
minute, 8.4 mL onto the inside wall of each vial containing ABX 100 mg and BEV 40 mg. Once
the addition of BEV 1.6 mL and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 8.4 mL is completed,
each vial can be gently swirled and/or inverted slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete
dissolution of any cake/powder occurs. Generation of foam should be avoided. At this point,
the concentration of each vial should be 100 mg/10 mL ABX and 40 mg/10 mL BEV. The vials
containing the ABX and BEV should sit for 60 minutes. The vial(s) should be gently swirled
and/or inverted every 10 minutes to continue to mix the complex. After 60 minutes has elapsed,
the calculated dosing volume of ABX and BEV should be withdrawn from each vial and slowly
added to an empty viaflex bag. An equal volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is
then added to make the final concentration of ABX 5 mg/mL and BEV 2 mg/mL. The bag should
then be gently swirled and/or inverted slowly for 1 minute to mix. The ABX:BEV nanoparticles
can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature following final diluation.
Example 2: Binding of ABX and BEV in vitro
[0181]     To determine whether ABX and BEV interact, the nanoparticles formed in Example 1
were analyzed by flow cytometry and electron microscopy.

Methods
[0182]    Flow Cytometry: AB160 was produced as described in Example 1 above. To determine
binding of BEV to ABX, visualization of AB160 was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer
(BD Franklin Lakes, NJ) and data analysis was done using Accuri C6 software. Biotinylated
(5gg) goat anti-mouse IgG (Abeam, Cambridge, MA) was labeled with 5 gg of streptavidin PE
(Abeam, Cambridge, MA). The goat anti-mouse IgG was chosen to label AB160 because the
Fab portion of the BEV is mouse derived. ABX and AB160 were incubated with the PE-labeled
goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed and visualized by flow
cytometery.
[0183]     Electron Microscopy: Five gl ABX, dissolved in PBS at 6 mg/ml, was added to a 300
mesh parlodian-carbon coated copper grid and allowed to sit for 1 minute. A pointed piece of
filter paper was touched to the drop to remove excess liquid, leaving a thin film on the grid. The
grids were allowed to dry. To dissolve the buffer crystals left on the dried grid, the sample was
washed three times in dH20. A small drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid (PTA), pH 7.2, was
added to the grid. The grid was then again touched by a pointed piece of filter paper to remove
excess liquid, leaving a thin film on the grid and allowed to dry. BEV (Genentech) at 25 mg/ml
in 0.9% sodium chloride solution was diluted with PBS at 1:10 ratio. Five gl of BEV was loaded
on nickel formvar-coated grid and allowed to air dry for 30 minutes to 1 hour. For the AB160,
10 mg/ml ABX, dissolved in PBS, and 4mg/ml BEV, in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, were
mixed at 2.5:1 ratio. The complex was further diluted with PBS at 1:5. Five gl of the complex
was loaded on nickel formvar-coated grid and air dried for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Both samples

Results
[0184]     ABX (10 mg/ml) was co-incubated with 4 mg/ml BEV in vitro and found that they
formed 160 nm nanoparticles (referred to herein as AB160).        Because the Fab portion of the
IgGI (BEV) is of mouse origin, particles containing BEV were selectively labeled with purified
goat anti-mouse IgG followed by anti-goat PE as a secondary antibody. As a negative control,
samples were stained with the anti-goat PE only. Particles were visualized by flow cytometry
and demonstrated a bright signal of anti-mouse IgGI binding to AB160 (41.2% positive) relative
to ABX (6.7% positive) alone (FIG. 1A). To validate binding of BEV to ABX, the BEV were
labeled with gold-labeled mouse anti-human IgG and the particles were visualized with electron
microscopy (FIG 1B). Surprisingly, the EM pictures suggest a monolayer of BEV surrounding
ABX nanoparticles.
[0185]    To determine what protein (albumin or BEV) the paclitaxel remains bound to when the
complex breaks down, AB160 were made and collected fractions: the particulate (nanoAB160),
proteins greater than 100 kD and proteins less than 100 kD. Paclitaxel was measured in each
fraction by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Roughly 75% of the paclitaxel
remained within the particulate, and the majority of the remaining paclitaxel was associated with
the fraction containing proteins 100 kD or greater (FIG. 1C, top), suggesting that when the
particulate dissociates the paclitaxel is bound to BEV alone or a BEV and albumin heterodimer.
This indicates that the dissociated complexes contain the chemotherapy drug with the antibody,
which would still traffic to the high-VEGF tumor microenvironment. These findings were
confirmed by Western blot analysis of the supernatants from AB160, which showed that BEV
and paclitaxel co-localize at approximately 200 kD, a size consistent with a paclitaxel-BEV
albumin protein complex (FIG. IC, bottom).
Example 3: Function of AB160 in vitro
[0186]       Confirmation that the two key elements in the complexes, the antibody and the
paclitaxel, retained their function when present in the complexes was demonstrated.

Methods
[0187]    In vitro toxicity: The A375 human melanoma cell line (ATCC Manassa, VA) and Daudi
B-cell lymphoma line (ATCC Manassa, VA) were cultured in DMEM with 1% PSG and 10%
FBS. Cells were harvested and plated at 0.75 x 106 cells per well in 24 well plates. Cells were
exposed to ABX or AB160 at paclitaxel concentrations from 0 to 200 gg/ml overnight at 37 0C
and 5% CO 2. To measure proliferation, the Click-iT EdU (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) kit
was utilized. Briefly, 10 mM EdU was added to the wells and incubated overnight with the cells
and ABX or AB 160. The cells were permeabilized with 1% saponin and intercalated EdU was
labeled with a FITC-conjugated antibody. The proliferation index was determined by dividing
the FITC positive cells from each treatment by the maximum proliferation of untreated EdU
labeled cells.
[0188]      VEGF ELISA: To determine whether BEV can still bind its ligand, VEGF, when
bound to ABX, a standard VEGF ELISA (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was employed.
AB160 was prepared as described and 2000 pg/ml VEGF was added to the AB160 complex or
ABX alone. The VEGF was incubated with the nanoparticles for 2 hours at room temperature.
The suspension was spun at 6000 rpm for 15 minutes, supernatants were collected and free
VEGF was measured by ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with capture antibody
overnight at 40C. Plates were washed, blocked and standards and samples were added. After
washing, detection antibody was added and plates were developed with substrate (R and D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Versamax ELISA
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The concentration of unbound VEGF was
determined with a standard curve from 0 to 2000 pg/ml.
Results
[0189]     AB160 has similar toxicity relative to ABX alone in an in vitro toxicity assay with the
human melanoma cell line, A375, suggesting that the paclitaxel functions equally in either
formulation (FIG. ID).
[0190]     To test the binding of VEGF to BEV in the AB160 complex, AB160 or ABX was co
incubated with VEGF, the particulate removed, and the supernatant tested for VEGF content.

The lack of VEGF in the supernatant measured from AB160 (<10% VEGF unbound) indicated
that the VEGF was bound by the BEV in the AB160 complex, while it remained free when
incubated with the ABX (>80% VEGF unbound) alone (FIG. 1E).
[0191]     Importantly, these assays demonstrated that the paclitaxel in AB160 retains its toxicity
to tumor cells and the bound BEV maintains the ability to bind its ligand, VEGF.
 Example 4: Particle Size and Protein Affinity
[0192]      To understand the characteristics of the nanoparticles formed when binding BEV to
ABX, the size of the ABX:BEV complexes was determined relative to ABX.
Methods
[01931       Mastersizer and Nanosight: The particle size of ABX and antibody-ABX drug
complexes were measured by dynamic light scattering on a Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern
Instruments, Westborough, MA).       To measure particle size, 2 ml (5 mg/ml) of Abraxane or
complex was added to the sample chamber.         Data were analyzed with Malvern software and
particle size distributions were displayed by volume. The particle sizes and stability were later
validated using the Nanosight System (Malvern Instruments, Westborough, MA). The ABX or
complex particles were diluted to the appropriate range to accurately measure particle sizes.
Data was displayed by particle size distribution; however, the nanoparticle tracking analysis uses
Brownian motion to determine particle size.
[0194]    Binding Assay: Biotinylated BEV, rituximab or trastuzumab at 100 gg/ml was bound to
the streptavidin probe (ForteBio Corp. MenloPark, CA). The binding of ABX was measured by
light absorbance on the BLItz system (ForteBio Corp. MenloPark, CA) at 1000, 500 and 100
mg/ml. The association and dissociation constants were calculated using the BLItz software.
[0195]    Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLItz) technology was utilized to assess the binding affinity
of BEV to ABX. Biotinylated BEV was bound to the streptavidin probe and exposed to ABX
(1000, 500, and 100 gg/ml). The dissociation constant (Kd) of BEV and ABX is 2.2 x 10-8 M at
room temperature and pH 7, consistent with a strong non-covalent interaction.        The binding
affinity of BEV and ABX is within the range of dissociation constants observed between

Results
[0196]    ABX:BEV nanoparticles were consistently larger (approximately 160 nm) than the 130
nm ABX alone (Fig 2a). The size of the nanoparticle created directly correlated to the
concentration of BEV used, with median sizes ranging from 0.157 to 2.166 gm. (FIG. 2A). With
the goal of these studies being a Phase I clinical trial, the smallest ABX:BEV particle (AB160)
were focused on because it is the most similar to the 130 nm ABX. The size of the AB160
particle was consistent with ABX plus a monolayer of BEV surrounding it and with the EM
image of the particle (see FIG. IB).
[0197]      To determine whether intravenous administration conditions affect nanoparticle size
distributions, the particle size distributions of AB160 (or ABX) incubated in saline for up to 24
hours at room temperature were evaluated.          AB160 size distribution does not significantly
change for up to 24 hours (FIGs. 9A and 9B). However, by 4 hours at room temperature, there is
some evidence of AB 160 breakdown by ELISA (FIG. 9C).
[0198]    To determine the stability of AB160 in plasma, ABX or AB160 was incubated in saline
or heparinized human plasma at relative volume ratios of 9:1 or 1:1. Notably, no particles (0.01
to 1 gm) were detected when either ABX (FIG. 10, top panel) or AB 160 (FIG. 10, bottom panel)
is incubated in plasma at equal volumes (1:1).
[0199]     Western blot (data not shown) indicated that, in saline or heparinized human plasma,
the AB160 dissociated into smaller protein conjugates that still contain the tumor-targeting
antibody, albumin and the cytotoxic agent, paclitaxel.       These protein conjugates retain their
ability to target the tumor and, once at the tumor site, can quickly dissolve and release the
cytotoxic payload to effectively initiate tumor regression without internalization of the entire
nanoparticle by tumor cells.
[0200]    Next, the ABX was suspended in BEV and the mixture diluted with saline at pH 3, 5, 7,
or 9 prior to incubation at various temperatures (RT, 37 0C and 58 0 C) to allow particle formation
                                                  55

     WO 2016/057554                                                        PCT/US2015/054295
in order to test whether binding affinity was pH- and/or temperature-dependent. The binding
affinity of ABX and BEV is both pH- and temperature-dependent, with the highest binding
affinity observed when the particles are formed at pH 5 and 58 0 C (FIG. 2B).
[0201]      To determine if the higher affinity binding of BEV and ABX at 58 0 C and pH 5
translated into stability of the complex, various preparations were compared by nanoparticle
tracking analysis (Nanosight). The stability of AB160 prepared at 58 0C and pH 5 (AB1600558),
room temperature and pH 7 (AB 16007), or 58 0C and pH 7 (AB 1600758) was compared to ABX
exposed to the same conditions (ABX0558, ABX07, and ABX0758,                   respectively) after
incubation in human AB serum for 0, 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
[0202]     The particles made under higher affinity conditions (pH 7 and 58 0C) were also more
stable, as indicated by the number of particles present per mg ABX after exposure to human AB
serum. The AB160 particles exhibited increased stability in human serum that correlated with
their binding affinities. In particular, AB16007 and AB1600558 were more stable in both saline
and human serum than ABX alone, as determined by size and number of particles measured per
mg ABX (FIG. 2C and Table 3).            This shows that the stability of AB160 particles can be
manipulated by changing the conditions under which the AB160 particles are formed.

Example 5: Efficacy of AB160 in Mice
[0204]     A xenograft model of A375 human melanoma cells implanted into athymic nude mice
was employed to test AB160 efficacy in vivo.
Methods
[0205]     In vivo experiments were performed at least 2 times. The number of mice required for
those experiments was determined by power analysis.            Mouse tumors were measured 2-3
times/week and mice were sacrificed when the tumor was 10% by weight.               Mice that had
complete tumor responses were monitored for 60-80 days post-treatment. The end point of the
mouse studies was median survival. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and Mantle-Cox test
was performed to determine significance of median survival between treatment groups. The in
vitro results presented are representative of at least 5 repeated experiments. Statistical analyses
of in vitro and in vivo percent change from baseline experiments were done using the Student's t
test.
[0206]      Mouse Model:     To test tumor efficacy, 1 x 106 A375 human melanoma cells were
implanted into the right flank of athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN).
When the tumors had reached a size of about 700 mm 3, the mice were randomized and treated
with PBS, ABX (30 mg/kg), BEV (12 mg/kg), BEV followed by ABX, or AB160 at the above
concentrations. For the mouse experiments testing bigger AB particles, the highest dose of BEV
(45 mg/kg) necessary to create the larger particles was used in the BEV-only treatment group.
Tumor size was monitored 3 times/week and tumor volume was calculated with the following
equation: (length*width 2 )/2.   Mice were sacrificed when the tumor size equaled 10% of the
mouse body weight or about 2500 mm3 . The day 7 percent change from baseline was calculated
as follows: [(tumor size on treatment day-tumor size on day 7)/tumor size on treatment
day]*100. The in vivo testing of the AR160 was similar except 5x 106 Daudi cells were injected
into the right flank of athymic nude mice.

      WO 2016/057554                                                          PCT/US2015/054295
Results
[0207]     AB160 was tested relative to PBS, the single drugs alone, and the drugs administered
sequentially. Mice treated with AB160 had significantly reduced tumor size compared to all
other treatment groups (p=0.0001 to 0.0089) at day 7 post-treatment, relative to baseline (FIG.
3A).    Tumors in all of the mice treated with AB160 had regressed at day 7, and this tumor
response translated into significantly increased median survival of the AB160 group relative to
all other groups (FIG. 3B), with a survival of 7, 14, 14, 18 and 33 days for the PBS (p<0.0001),
BEV (p=O.003), ABX (p=O.0003), BEV + ABX (p=O.0006) and AB160 groups, respectively.
[0208]    It is likely that larger tumors have a higher local VEGF concentration. When data were
analyzed based on the size of the tumor on day of treatment (<700mm3 and >700mm3 ), the larger
tumors were shown to have a greater response to AB160, suggesting that higher tumor VEGF
concentration attracts more BEV-targeted ABX to the tumor.            The difference in the percent
change from baseline was significant for the AB160 groups (p=0.0057). This observation was
not seen in the ABX only (p=0.752) group, where the ABX has no targeting capability (FIG.
3C).
[0209]     Particles of increasing size were prepared using increasing BEV:ABX ratios as shown
in FIG. 2A. Tumor regression and median survival positively correlated with increasing particle
size, indicating that biodistribution of larger particles may be altered relative to the smaller ones
(FIGs. 3D and 3E).       Full toxicity studies were performed on the mice and no toxicities were
noted.
Example 6: Paclitaxel Pharmakokinetics in Mice
[0210]        To compare the pharmacokinetics (pk) of AB160 and ABX, plasma paclitaxel
concentrations were measured in mice administered AB160 or ABX at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours.
Methods
[0211]     Paclitaxel Pharmacokinetics: The liquid chromatographic separation of paclitaxel and
d5 paclitaxel were accomplished using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 precolumn (2.1 x 5
mm, 2.7 gm, Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN) attached to an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18

analytical column (2.1 x 100 mm, 2.7 gm Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN) at 40 'C, eluted with
a gradient mobile phase composed of water with 0.l1% formic acid (A) and ACN with 0.l1%
formic acid (B) with a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/minute. The elution was initiated at 60% A
and 40% B for 0.5 minutes, then B was linearly increased from 40-85% for 4.5 minutes, held at
85% B for 0.2 minutes, and returned to initial conditions for 1.3 minutes. Autosampler
temperature was 10 'C and sample injection volume was 2 gl. Detection of paclitaxel and the
internal standard d5-paclitaxel were accomplished using the mass spectrometer in positive ESI
mode with capillary voltage 1.75 kV, source temp 150 'C, desolvation temp 500 'C, cone gas
flow 150 L/hr, desolvation gas flow 1000 L/hr, using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan
mode with a dwell time of 0.075 seconds. The cone voltages and collision energies were
determined by MassLynx-Intellistart, v4.1, software and varied between 6-16 V and 12-60 eV,
respectively. The MRM precursor and product ions were monitored at m/z 854.3>105.2 for
paclitaxel and 859.3>291.2 for d5 paclitaxel. The primary stock solutions of paclitaxel (1 mg/ml
in EtOH) and d5 paclitaxel (1 mg/ml in EtOH) were prepared in 4 ml amber silanized glass vials
and stored at -20 'C.   Working standards were prepared by dilution of the stock solution with
ACN in 2 ml amber silanized glass vials and stored at -20 'C. Plasma samples were extracted as
follows, 100 gl plasma sample was added to a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube containing d5
paclitaxel (116.4 nM or 100 ng/ml) and 300 gl ACN, vortexed, incubated at room temperature
for 10 minutes to precipitate proteins, and centrifuged (14,000 rpm) for 3 minutes. The
supernatant was filtered on an Agilent Captiva NDlipids plate (Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN),
collected in a deep 96-well plate, and dried using nitrogen gas. The samples were reconstituted
using 100 gl ACN and shaken on a plate shaker (high speed) for 5 minutes. Plasma standard
curves were prepared daily containing paclitaxel (0.59-5855 nM or 0.5-5000 ng/ml) and d5
paclitaxel (116.4 nM) for paclitaxel quantitation. Mouse tumors were thawed on ice, weighed,
and diluted 2 parts (weight to volume) in 1x PBS. Tumors were then homogenized using a
PRO200 tissue homogenizer using the saw tooth probe (5 mm x 75 mm). Tumor homogenate
was than processed the same as the human plasma samples.
[0212]    Mouse Imaging: Avastin and IgG control solutions were prepared and 1-125 labeled per
protocol (Imanis Life Sciences). Briefly, Tris Buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.15 M NaCl)
and 5 mCi Na     I were added directly to iodination tubes (ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham,

MA). The iodide was allowed to activate and was swirled at room temperature. Activated iodide
was mixed with the protein solution. 50 gl of Scavenging Buffer (10 mg tyrosine/mL in PBS, pH
7.4) was added and incubated for five minutes. After addition of Tris/BSA buffer and mixing,
samples were applied in 10K MWCO dialysis cassettes against pre-cooled PBS for 30 minutes, 1
hour, 2 hours, and overnight at 4 'C. Radioactivity was determined by Gamma counter, then
disintegrations per minute (DPM) and specific activity were calculated. Mice were injected in
their tail vein with Avastin 1-125, Abraxane-Avastin 1-125, Abraxane-human IgG 1-125, or
Abraxane only. Animals were imaged at 3, 10, 24 and 72 hours post-administration via SPECT
CT imaging using the U-SPECT-II/CT scanner (MILabs, Utrecht, The Netherlands). SPECT
reconstruction was performed using a POSEM (pixelated ordered subsets by expectation
maximization) algorithm. CT data were reconstructed during the Feldkamp algorithm. Co
registered images were further rendered and visualized using PMOD software (PMOD
Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). Animals were sacrificed and dissected at 72 hours post
injection. Selected tissues and organs of interest were measured using radioisotope dose
calibrator (Capintec CRC-127R, Capintec Inc.).
Results
[0213]    Results of the first pk experiment are provided in FIGs. 4A and 4B. The area under the
curve (AUC) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) were calculated in A375 tumor bearing
and non-tumor bearing mice. In the first pk experiment the Cmax and AUC were very similar in
the non-tumor bearing mice for AB160 and ABX (63.3+/-39.4 vs. 65.5+/-14.4 and 129 vs. 133
gg/ml, respectively). However, in the tumor bearing mice, the Cmax and AUC for the treatment
groups were different (55.7+/-21.2 vs 63.3+/-17.3 and 112 vs 128 gg/ml, respectively) (FIG.
4C). Although this difference was not statistically significant, it is consistent with superior
targeting by AB160, relative to ABX.
[0214]     A second pk experiment was performed with additional early time points and large
versus small tumor sizes (FIGs. 4D-4F). The results of this experiment demonstrated smaller
AUC in tumor bearing mice relative to non-tumor bearing mice, with the lowest blood values of
paclitaxel in the large tumor mice relative to the small tumor mice (80.4+/- 2.7, 48.4+/-12.3, and
30.7+/-5.2 for ABX-treated non-tumor, small tumor and large tumor bearing mice, respectively;

      WO 2016/057554                                                          PCT/US2015/054295
66.1+/-19.8, 44.4+/-12.1 and 22.8+/-6.9 for AB160-treated). Similarly, the Cmax dropped in both
treatment groups in mice with larger tumors (47.2, 28.9 and 19.7 gg/ml for ABX and 40.1, 26.9
and 15.3 gg/ml for AB160) (FIG. 4G). The AUC and Cmax of paclitaxel in blood were lower in
AB160-treated mice relative to ABX-treated mice. Although not statistically significant, this
data is further consistent with higher deposition of paclitaxel in the tumors treated with AB160.
[0215]       To directly test this hypothesis, tumor paclitaxel concentrations by LC-MS were
measured. The tumor paclitaxel concentration was significantly higher in tumors treated with
AB160 relative to ABX at the 4 hour (3473 gg/mg of tissue +/-340 vs 2127 gg/mg of tissue +/
3.5; p=0.02) and 8 hour (3005 gg/mg of tissue +/- 146 vs 1688 gg/mg of tissue +/- 146; p=0.01)
time points, suggesting paclitaxel stays in the tumor longer when targeted by the antibody (FIG.
4H). This explains the blood pk and is consistent with redistribution of drug to tissues including
the tumor.
[0216]     Live in vivo imaging of 1-125 labeled AB160 (Abx-AvtIl25) and IgG isotype bound
ABX (Abx-IgGI125) confirmed the results of the LC-MS, with higher levels of 1-125 in the
tumor of mice treated with AB160 relative to IgG-ABX at 3 hours (32.2 uCi/g +/- 9.1 vs 18.5
uCi/g +/- 1.65; p=0.06) and 10 hours (41.5 uCi/g +/- 6.4 vs 28.7 uCi/g +/- 2.66; p=0.03) post
injection (FIGs. 41 and 4J). Taken together, these data demonstrate that binding BEV to ABX
alters blood pk, and this alteration is due to a redistribution of the drug to the tumor tissue as
shown by both LC-MS of paclitaxel and 1-125 labeling of BEV relative to an isotype matched
IgGI.
[0217]    Without being bound by theory, it is believed that by binding a tumor-targeted antibody
to ABX, the pk is altered more dramatically than ABX alone, lowering the Cmax and AUC in the
blood because of redistribution of AB160 to the tumor tissue. These results from mouse blood
paclitaxel pk, tumor tissue levels of paclitaxel, and 1-125 radioactivity levels in mice treated with
AB160 relative to ABX alone suggest that antibody targeting of the ABX alters biodistribution
of paclitaxel such that increased levels reach the tumor and are retained there for a longer period
of time, yielding enhanced tumor regression.

[0218]      The binding of the anti-human CD20 antibody (rituxamab) and the anti-HER2/neu
receptor antibody (trastuzumab) to ABX was tested to determine if other IgG therapeutic
antibodies also exhibit binding to ABX when combined ex vivo.
Methods
[0219]       Nanoparticles containing rituximab or trastuzumab were prepared and tested as
described in the above examples.
Results
[0220]     The particle size of the complexes with both BEV and trastuzumab (HER) were very
similar, with average sizes ranging from 0.157 to 2.166 gm (FIG. 2A) and 0.148 to 2.868 gm
(FIG. 5B), respectively.    In contrast, particles formed with rituximab became much larger at
lower antibody:ABX ratios, with particle sizes ranging from 0.159 to 8.286 gm (FIG. 5A).
[0221]      The binding affinities of rituximab and trastuzumab with ABX were determined by
BLItz under variable pH. Both antibodies bind with relatively high affinity in the picomolar
range (FIG. 5C).     The rituximab affinity to ABX decreased with higher pH, but trastuzumab
affinity to ABX was unaffected by pH (FIG. 5C).
[0222]     The efficacy of the 160 nm particle made with rituximab (AR160) was tested in vitro
and in vivo. In vitro, the B-cell lymphoma cell line Daudi was treated with AR160, ABX, or
rituximab alone at increasing concentrations (0 to 200 gg/ml) of paclitaxel.                  AR160
(IC 5 o=10pg/ml) significantly inhibited proliferation of Daudi cells treated for 24 hours (p=0.024)
compared to either ABX (IC 5o>200gg/ml) or rituximab (IC 5 o>200gg/ml) alone (FIG. 6A).
[0223]     In vivo, a xenotransplant model of Daudi cells was established in athymic nude mice.
Once tumors were established, mice were treated with PBS, ABX, rituximab, ABX and
rituximab given sequentially, or AR160. On day 7 post treatment, tumors were measured and the
percent change in tumor size from baseline was calculated. AR160-treated tumors regressed or
remained stable, while tumors in all other treatment groups progressed (FIG. 6B). The percent
change from baseline tumor size in the AR160 group compared to all other groups was
significant (p<0.0001). The mice treated with AR160 had a significantly longer median survival
                                                  62

       WO 2016/057554                                                       PCT/US2015/054295
of greater than 60 days compared to 12, 16, and 12 days for mice treated with PBS (p<0.0001),
ABX (p<0.0001), or rituximab (p=0.0002), respectively (FIG. 6C). However, the difference in
median survival was not significant between AR160 and the sequentially treated groups
(p=0.36). This may be because the rituximab binds to the tumor cells and remains on the cell
surface, allowing the subsequently-administered ABX to bind to the antibody when it enters the
tumor site, unlike BEV which binds a soluble target and not a cell surface marker.
Example 8: Binding of Other Chemotherapy Drugs to AB160
[0224]       The efficacy of other chemotherapy drugs to form functional nanoparticles was
evaluated.
Methods
[0225]     Nanoparticles containing cisplatin were prepared and tested as described in the above
examples.
Results
[0226]     To test if another chemotherapy drug could bind to the AB160 particles, cisplatin and
ABX were co-incubated and the amount of free cisplatin remaining in the supernatant was
measured by HPLC. Approximately 60% (i.e., only 40% remains in the supernatant) of the
cisplatin bound to the ABX (FIG. 7A).
[0227]     Next, tumor toxicity of AC relative to ABX and cisplatin alone was tested using A375
cells.    The complexes were centrifuged to remove highly toxic unbound cisplatin, and
reconstituted in media to ensure that any additional toxicity of AC relative to ABX is due only to
ABX-bound cisplatin.      For parity, the ABX only was centrifuged in a similar manner.        AC
(IC 5 o=90pg/ml) inhibited proliferation of A375 cells to a greater extent than ABX alone
(IC 5 o>10OOgg/ml) (FIG. 7B).      The diminished toxicity in this experiment relative to other
toxicity experiments is due to some loss of drug in the centrifugation step, but the comparison of
ABX to AC remains relevant.

     WO 2016/057554                                                        PCT/US2015/054295
[0228]    To determine the tumor toxicity of cisplatin-containing AB160 complexes, AB160 was
co-incubated with cisplatin to form cisplatin containing particles (ABC complex). The ABC
complex was tested in the A375 melanoma xenotrasplant model relative to each drug alone and
AB160.     Tumors treated with AB160, AB160 + cisplatin given sequentially, and the ABC
complex all showed regression in tumor size at 7 days post treatment (FIG. 7C), but the ABC
complex conferred the longest median survival (35 days, relative to AB160 and AB160 +
cisplatin at 24 and 26 days, respectively). Although the difference was not statistically significant
(p= 0.82 and 0.79) (FIG. 7D), the data is consistent with benefits of the ABC complex to long
term survival rates.
[0229]     These data demonstrated that the albumin portion of the ABX provides a platform for
other therapeutic antibodies to bind, such as rituximab and trastuzumab, as well as other
chemotherapy agents (e.g., cisplatin), which all had similar efficacy in vitro and in vivo as
AB160.
[0230]     Together these data demonstrate a simple way to construct a versatile nano-immune
conjugate, which allows multiple proteins or cytotoxic agents to be bound to a single albumin
scaffold.    Improved efficacy of the targeted drug relative to the single agents alone was
demonstrated in the mouse model, which is at least in part due to altered pk of the antibody
targeted drug. Furthermore, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the versatility of
the presently disclosured nano-immune conjugate that does not require a linker or target cell
internalization will overcome the obstacles faced by other nanomedicines in translating results
from mice to humans.
Example 9: Lyophilization of AB160
[0231]    AB160 was synthesized by adding 8mg (320gl) of bevacizumab to 20mg of Abraxane.
1.66ml of 0.9% saline was then added for a final volume of 2ml for a final concentration of
4mg/ml bevacizumab and 1Omg/ml Abraxane, and the mixture was allowed to incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes in a 15ml polypropylene conical tube.

[0232]    After the 30 minute room temperature incubation, the mixture was diluted 1:2 in 0.9%
saline to 2mg/ml and 5mg/ml bevacizumab and Abraxane, respectively. These are the
concentrations of the 2 drugs when prepared by the pharmacy for administration to patients.
[0233]    AB160 was divided into twenty 200gl aliquots in 1.5 ml polypropylene eppendorfs and
frozen at -80 'C.
[0234]    Once frozen, the aliquots were lyophilized overnight with the Virtis 3L benchtop
lyophilizer (SP Scientific, Warmister, PA) with the refrigeration on. A lyophilized preparation
was generated.
[0235]    The dried aliquots were stored at room temperature in the same 1.5ml polypropylene
eppendorfs. These samples were readily reconstituted in saline at room temperature for 30
minutes, followed by centrifugation for 7 minutes at 2000x g. The resulting sample was then
resuspended in the appropriate buffer, as needed.
[0236]    By comparison, a sample that was dried with heat and a speed vacuum was impossible
to reconstitute.
Example 10: Testing of lyophilized preparations
[0237]    Samples were reconstituted at different time points after lyophilization and tested for
their physical properties against ABX, and freshly made AB160.
[0238]    Particle size distribution was evaluated as described above.
[0239]    VEGF binding was evaluated by incubation of the sample with VEGF for 2 hours at
room temperature, centrifuged at 2000 x g for 7 minutes. The amount of VEGF bound to the
pellet (corresponding to the nanoparticles) or remaining in the supernatant was measured with
ELISA.
[0240]    Paclitaxel activity was assessed by cytotoxicity against A375 cells in vitro.
[0241]    Surprisingly, lyophilization did not significantly affect either the particle size, VEGF
binding, or the activity of paclitaxel as shown by the ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.

This result held for lyophilized samples stored for 1 month (FIGs. 8A-8C) or 10 months (FIGs.
8D-8F).
[0242]    Further surprising is that these results were observed with nanoparticles lyophilized
without the use of cryoprotectants or other agents that may adversely effect human therapeutic
use.
Example 11: Efficacy of AB160 in Humans
[0243]    AB160 was tested in a phase 1, first-in-man, clinical trial testing the safety of AB160

minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle. Treatments were
continued until intolerable toxicity, tumor progression or patient refusal. Prior to every
treatment cycle, patients were evaluated for toxicity; tumor evaluations were performed every
other cycle (RECIST).

with dose 1 of cycles 1 and 2 of therapy.

[0250]    In the current trial, administration of AB 160 particles is equivalent to a dose of 100
mg/m 2 of abraxane, and 40 mg/m 2 of bevacizumab. The only study that used BEV and ABX
alone was Spitler. Spitler, however, used a higher dose of ABX. The present study also used
less than than 10% of the dose of BEV reported in previous studies, if the doses are adjusted to
the average patient (assumed to have a surface area of 1.9 m 2 and a mass of 90 kg).
[0251]    Spilter also examined patients who had not been previously treated, while the current
study examined patients who had failed previous treatments. Ineffective prior treatment not only
takes time from the expected PFS, but selects for cancer cells that are more resistant to
treatment, and typically leaves a patient in poorer physical condition. Thus, the PFS for a
population of patients on a "rescue" therapy (as here, with AB160) is expected to have a lower
PFS than a naive population. This can be seen in a Phase 2 clinical trial (Hersh et al., Cancer,
January 2010, 116:155) that examined both rescue and naive patients with Abraxane alone. For
previously treated patients with Abraxane alone, the PFS was 3.5 months. Hersh et al. Ann.
Oncol 2015, (epub September 26, 2015), reported a 4.8 month PFS for naYve patients treated
with ABX alone.

[0252]     Thus, early results of the Phase I clinical trial with AB160 indicate an increase in PFS
in late-stage metastatic malignant melanoma in previously treated patients. This increase is
particularly surprising given that the PFS was greater than those in Spitler, who were
chemotherapy naYve and were given a higher dose of Abraxane, and an almost 12 fold higher
dose of bevacizumab. The dose of BEV used in AB160 is far lower than any other study, so the
best comparison is not Spitler, but Hersh.
[0253]     Thus, the ABX/BEV complex (AB160) is superior to sequential administration of ABX
and BEV, or ABX alone, and achieves this superior result with a very low effective dose of
BEV. The data is therefore consistent with AB 160 having improved targeting of the
chemotherapeutics to the tumor, and that this targeting is mediated by BEV. It is possible that the
ABX nanoparticle aids in targeting the BEV to the tumor, as albumin is selectively taken up by
tumors. It is also possible that the existence of the BEV/ABX complex shows greater stability in
vivo than Abraxane.
Example 12:       Follow up study to investigate whether pretreatment with BEV improves
targeting
[0254]     Following the general protocol above, athymic nude mice were injected with 1 x 106
A375 human melanoma cells in the right flank and then treated with PBS, 12 mg/kg BEV, 30
mg/kg ABX, AB160, or pretreated with 1.2 mg/kg BEV and, 24hr later, AB160.                     Data is
represented at day 7-post and day 10-post treatment as tumor volume in mm3 . F 1 1A-E track
tumor size over 10 days.       Only mice treated with AB160 (with or without pretreatment with
BEV) showed a reduction in average tumor volume. See also FIG. 1 IF and FIG. 11G.
[0255]      The day 7-post treatment data, as summarized in Figure 1 IF, show that pretreatment
with BEV was associated with a stastically significant reduction in tumor volume over control or
BEV alone (p<0.000 1), or ABX alone (p<0.0001).
[0256]       The day 10-post treatment data, as summarized in Figure 1 IG, again show that
pretreatment with BEV was associated with a stastically significant reduction in tumor volume
over control or BEV alone (p<0.0001), or ABX alone (p<0.0001).               Pretreatment with BEV

before AB160 was also associated with a reduction in tumor volume over AB160 alone (p=0.02),
with complete response in two mice.
[0257]    In this experiment, a 12 mg/kg dose of BEV was not therapeutic. The amount of BEV
added in the pretreatment group was only 1.2 mg/kg, which is 1/10 the usual dose in mice. Yet
pretreatment with a subtherapeutic dose appears to show improved efficacy of the AB160
nanoparticle. This data support the idea that pretreatment with a subtherapeutic amount of BEV
can clear systemic levels of VEGF, leaving a greater relative concentration at the tumor such that
tumor-associated VEGF targeting by the AB160 nanoparticles is more effective.
Example 13: Alternative means of delivering nanoparticles
[0258]    It is contemplated that nanoparticles of this invention can be directly delivered to the
tumor. For example, nanoparticles can be delivered via intra-arterial cannula or by direct
injection into the turmor. In such embodiments, it is contemplated that large nanoparticles (e.g.,
580 nm or 1130 nm) can be delivered by direct injection into or proximate to a tumor.
