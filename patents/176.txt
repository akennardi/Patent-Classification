                    Protransduzin B, an Enhancer of Gene Transfer
This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014261381, the originally
filed specification of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The present application relates to an N-terminally protected peptide, to a medica
ment containing said peptide, to said peptide for use in gene therapy, to a method
for enhancing the infection of a cell by a genetically engineered viral construct, and
to the use of said peptide for amplification for transfection or transduction.
The importance of genetic engineering has increased in recent years because of an
enormous progress in the applied methods, because it is predictable that not only
the production of protein/peptide active substances, but also the transfection of
cells with stable genes as a laboratory tool and ultimately the introduction of genes
in cells as a remedy for gene defects will be highly relevant to the therapy of
numerous diseases.
The introduction of genetic material for changing specific cell functions has become
an indispensable tool of biological-medical basic and applied research since the
cloning of the first human genes and recombinant production, since the methods of
gene transfer undergo continuous progress with increasing efficiency. Numerous
methods of gene introduction have led to optimization. The corresponding experi
ences have been collected over many years of history, which was very slow at first.
Even before the elucidation of the function of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 1953
by F. Crick and J. Watson, F. Griffith had succeeded towards the end of the 1920's
in experiments in transforming apathogenic Pneumococcus strains into pathogens.
This transformation was due to a lucky circumstance, because the pneumococci
had a rare natural competence of DNA uptake. A specific introduction of DNA into
prokaryotes was achieved by J. Lederberg, M. DelbrOck and S. Luria, among
others, by means of phages, the so-called transduction. With the establishing of

                                          -2
cell culture, the culturing of eukaryotic cells under in vitro conditions, a number of
physical and chemical methods for transfection have been developed. The physical
methods, which are more frequently utilized, but require more expensive equip
ment, include electroporation and microinjection, which competed with the more
simply applicable chemical methods, such as the calcium phosphate precipitation
method usual in the 1980's and still today, or the methods widespread in the early
1990's, which were based on cationic lipids or cationic polymers. However, the use
of these methods has always been dependent on the cells or the DNA. Also, the
DNA introduced into the cells was generally extrachromosomal (transient transfec
tion), and thus it was not passed on to the daughter cells. However, phages (e.g.,
lambda phage) were known to be able to integrate their DNA into the host genome
(prophage, lysogenic infection pathway). From here, it was only a small step
(1981/1982) to the "Establishing of retroviruses as gene vectors" (by Doehmer et
al. and Tabin et al.). Viruses are species-specific and organ/tissue-specific, which is
why all viruses do not infect all (eukaryotic) cells. Alterations in the viral envelope
(exchange of glycoproteins, so-called pseudotyped viruses) and additions of mostly
cationic peptides are supposed to enhance transduction efficiency.
First enhancers of the uptake of virus particles attracted attention in the study of
HIV. During analyses of in vitro infection by means of a specific cell test, the
inhibition of the fusion of HIV by blood filtrate peptides was observed (MOnch et
al., VIRIP).
It has been shown that these fragments of proteins, which surprisingly are
naturally occurring, form fibrous structures as enhancers in human sperm, "Semen
derived Enhancer of Virus Infection" (SEVI), which are characterized as amyloid
fibrils. These nanofibrils enhance the docking of viruses to their target cells,
increasing the rate of viral infection by several powers of ten.
This was utilized for improving retroviral gene transfer for basic research and for
possible future therapeutic applications. Thus, it could be shown that lentiviral and
gamma-retroviral viruses, which are used for gene therapy, exhibit a many times
higher gene transfer rate in the presence of the SEVI protein for different cell
types, such as human T cells, cervical carcinoma cells, leukemia cells, hematopoi-

                                          -3
etic stem cells, and embryonic stem cells (Wurm et al., J. Gene Med. 2010, 12,
137-46; Wurm et al., Biol. Chem. 2011, 392, 887-95).
Studies for the development of further enhancers, such as SEVI and seminogelin,
led to the assumption that peptides from viral envelope proteins may also be
suitable as enhancers of transfection, which surprisingly was an unexpectedly
great success (Maral Yolamanova, Nature Nanotechnology). Thus, it could be
shown, for example, that HIVs preincubated with different concentrations (1
100 pg/ml) of protransduzin A (synonym: EF-C) exhibit an infection rate with
reporter cells that is increased by several powers of ten. As the mechanism of
action, it was assumed that EF-C forms fibrillary structures that are capable of
binding and concentrating viruses and accordingly amplifying the entry of the
viruses into the cell. In addition to the infection with viral particles, EF-C enhances
the transduction of lentiviral and retroviral particles with high efficiency in a wide
variety of human cell types (T cells, glial cells, fibroblasts, hematopoietic stem
cells) applied in gene therapy (Jan MOnch et al., Nature Nanotechnology, Vol. 8,
No. 2, pp. 130-136). EP 2 452 947 Al also relates to protransduzin A.
Because of the increasing importance of gene technology as set forth above, more
effective enhancers of gene transfer are desirable. The object of the invention is to
provide an improved enhancer of gene transfer.
Surprisingly, it has been found that an N-terminally protected peptide having the
sequence
        X-Glu-Cys-Lys-Ile-Lys-Gln-Ile-Ile-Asn-Met-Trp-Gln (SEQ ID NO: 1),
wherein X is a group protecting the N-terminal of the peptide, achieves the object
of the invention. In particular, X represents one or two alkyl groups, such as
methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups, an acyl group, such as an acetyl or propionyl
group, or the group X-Glu is the amino acid pyroglutamic acid:
                                    O    NKCOOH
                                         H

                                          -4
Surprisingly, it has been found that it is the modification of the N-terminal end by
pyroglutamic acid in vitro (without cellular influences, especially the presence of
enzymes), in particular, that results in an enormous increase in stability of the
protransduzin in aqueous solution. This is clear from the results shown in Figure 1.
In the left column of Figure 1 (HPLC chromatogram), results for protransduzin A
upon storage for 0-13 days at -20 IC and at 4 IC (13 days) are compared with the
results for protransduzin B under the same conditions. It is clear that protrans
duzin A is degraded almost to one half upon storage at 4 0 C for 13 days, whereas
protransduzin B is hardly degraded at all under the same storage conditions (the
height of the peaks corresponds to the concentration of the components contained
in the sample).
In Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 286, No. 45, pp. 38825-38832, S. Jawhar
et al. report on the state of the science relating to amyloid peptides, especially
pyroglutamate-modified amyloid polypeptides. Such amyloid polypeptides have a
large number of amino acids and are basically not comparable to short-chained
peptides, to which those according to the invention also belong. Incidentally, this
mini review relates to cellular events occurring under in vivo conditions in the
presence of enzymes, which is by no means comparable, however, to the condi
tions under which the stability of protransduzin has been improved according to
the invention, i.e., in vitro conditions.
The peptide according to the invention may also be used as a medicament.
The invention also relates to the use of the peptide according to the invention in
gene therapy for treating diseases that are treatable with gene therapy.
The invention also relates to a method for enhancing the infection of a cell by a
virus, comprising the steps:
-       providing the peptide according to claim 1 dissolved in an organic solvent;

                                          - 5
-       adding the peptide to an aqueous solution to form insoluble aggregates of
        the peptide;
-       mixing the solution from the last preceding step; and
-       culturing the cells.
The present invention also relates to the use of the peptide according to the
invention for enhancing the infection of a cell with a virus.
Finally, a kit containing the peptide according to the invention is also claimed.
The peptide according to the invention (protransduzin B) can be prepared, for
example, by the method according to Merrifield with Fmoc-protected amino acids.
This     method     works     with   Fmoc-protected    derivatives,   i.e.,  with (9
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-protected       amino acids, in a stepwise solid phase
synthesis according to the Merrifield principle, especially on a Wang resin preload
ed with Fmoc-L-glutamine (0.59 mmol/g, 100-200 mesh) as a solid support on the
synthesizer ABI-433.
The activation of the Fmoc-L-amino acids, which were typically employed in a
tenfold   molar excess,      is performed   with [(2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3
tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate] (HBTU, 100 mmol/I) with additions of
0.5 M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and 2 M diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) at room temperature.
The individual acylation reactions take 45 minutes, and the Fmoc deprotection with
20% piperidine takes 15 minutes.
The following amino acid derivatives and related orthogonal acid-cleavable side
chain protective groups are employed for synthesis:
Fmoc-L-Asn(Trt), Fmoc-L-Cys(Trt), L-pGlu, Fmoc-L-Gln(Trt), Fmoc-L-Ile, Fmoc
L-Lys(Boc), Fmoc-L-Met and Fmoc-L-Trp(Boc).

                                          -6
After cleaving the resin support from the peptidyl resin with 94% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA), 3% ethanedithiol (EDT) and 3% demineralized water, the raw peptide
is precipitated in cold tert-butyl methyl ether, the raw peptide is centrifuged off as
a pellet, and the supernatant is discarded.
The subsequent chromatographic purification of the raw peptide is effected in a
preparative way by gradient elution.
The difference between protransduzin A according to EP 2 452 947 Al and
protransduzin B resides in the fact that the synthetic L-pyroglutamic acid (pGlu) is
inserted N-terminally in exchange for synthetic L-glutamine (GIn) in protransduzin
B. The original glutamine is modified by ring closure to form a lactam.
Purification:
Preparative separation: The purification is performed on an HPLC from the Gilson
company. The UV/VIS detector is from the Kronwald company, and the separation
is detected at the wavelength 230 nm. The flow rate is 40 ml/min.
The column is a Waters Prep-Pak C18 cartridge (47 x 300 mm).
Eluent A: 0.1% TFA in demineralized water; eluent B: 0.1% TFA in 80% acetoni
trile and 2 0%  demineralized water.
The gradient for protransduzin B is 35%-55% eluent B in 40 min, i.e., 0.5% eluent
B per minute.
Protransduzin B elutes at 40% eluent B and is collected in several fractions of 0.5
to 1 min. The analytically clean fractions are pooled and lyophilized.

                                          -7
Processing for application:
Lyophilization:
The unit Epsilon 1/45 of the Christ company, whose technical data are set as
follows, is used for freeze drying: shelf area 3.78 M 2 ; ice capacity about 60 kg; ice
condenser performance max. 45 kg/24 h; final partial pressure of vacuum pump
1 x 10-3/10-4 mbar with/without gas ballast; freeze-drying data (unit operated
manually with gas ballast): final partial pressure 1 x       10-2 mbar; ice condenser
temperature -50 OC; shelf temperature +15 *C; operating point of shelf heating
0.5 mbar; freeze-drying time up to 3 days.
Transduction of cells with protransduzin B
Dissolve 0.5 mg of protransduzin B in 50 pl of DMSO. Then add 450 pl of PBS to
the solution, fibrils forming within 3 min. Add this stock solution (1 mg/ml) to the
vectors to obtain a concentration of protransduzin B of 25 pg/ml. Vortex the
solution for 1 min, then centrifuge with 5000 g for 5 min. The supernatant is
discarded, and the pellet is suspended in a little PBS and added to the cells. The
cells are incubated in an incubator for 2 days.
The transduction rate is significantly enhanced by protransduzin B. Up to      96%   of
the cells can be transduced by means of protransduzin B.
