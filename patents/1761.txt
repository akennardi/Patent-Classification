                                       TECHNICAL FIELD
            This invention relates to consumable products and more particularly, to non
   animal based replicas of animal-based food products, that can be produced, in some
   embodiments, by breaking down non-animal materials into their constituent parts and
15 reassembling those parts into the consumables.
                                         BACKGROUND
            Animal farming has a profound negative environmental impact. Currently it is
   estimated that 30% of Earth's land surface is dedicated to animal farming and that
   livestock account for 20% of total terrestrial animal biomass. Due to this massive scale,
20 animal farming accounts for more than 18% of net greenhouse gas emissions. Animal
   farming may be the largest human source of water pollution, and animal farming is by far
   the world's largest threat to biodiversity. It has been estimated that if the world's human
   population could shift from a meat containing diet to a diet free of animal products, 26%
   of Earth's land surface would be freed for other uses. Furthermore the shift to a
25 vegetarian diet would massively reduce water and energy consumption.
            The consumption of meat has a profound negative impact on human health. The
   health benefits of a vegetarian diet are well established. If the human population would
   shift to a more vegetarian diet, there would be a decrease in health care costs.
                                                  1

            Hunger is a worldwide problem, yet the world's 4 major commodity crops
   (soybeans, maize, wheat, and rice) already supply more than 100% of the human
   population's requirements for calories and protein, including every essential amino acid.
            Plant based meat substitutes have largely failed to cause a shift to a vegetarian
 5 diet. The current state of the art for meat substitute compositions involves the extrusion
   of soy/grain mixture, resulting in products which largely fail to replicate the experience
   of cooking and eating meat. Common limitations of these products are a texture and
   mouthfeel that are more homogenous than that of equivalent meat products.
   Furthermore, as the products must largely be sold pre-cooked, with artificial flavors and
10 aromas built in, they fail to replicate aromas, flavors, and other key features associated
   with cooking meat. As a result, these products appeal mainly to a limited consumer base
   that is already committed to vegetarianism/veganism, but have failed to appeal to the
   larger consumer segment accustomed to eating meat.
            Food is any substance that is either eaten or drunk by any animal, including
15 humans, for nutrition or pleasure. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains
   essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The
   substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells in an effort
   to produce energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
            Food typically has its origin in a photosynthetic organism, typically from plants.
?0 Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food
   sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. Edible fungi and bacteria
   are used to transform materials from plants or animals into other food products,
   mushrooms, bread, yogurt and the like.
            In most cases, the plant or animal is fractionated into a variety of different
25 portions, depending upon the purpose of the food. Often, certain portions of the plant,
   such as the seeds or fruits, are more highly prized by humans than others and these are
   selected for human consumption whilst other less desirable portions, such as the stalks of
   grasses, are typically used for feeding animals.
            Animals are typically butchered into smaller cuts of meat with specific flavor and
30 handling properties before consumption.
                                                   2

            While many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation
   for reasons of safety, palatability, texture, or flavor. At the simplest level, this may
   involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients. It may also
   involve mixing, heating or cooling or fermentation and individual foods may be
 5 combined with other food products to achieve the desired mix of properties.
            In recent years, attempts have been made to bring scientific rigor to the process of
   food preparation, under the fields of food science and molecular gastronomy. Food
   science broadly studies the safety, microbiology, preservation, chemistry, engineering
   and physics of food preparation, whereas molecular gastronomy focuses on the use of
10 scientific tools such as liquid nitrogen, emulsifying agents such as soy lecithin and
   gelling agents such as calcium alginates to transform food products into unexpected
   forms.
            However, the raw material is typically an entire organism (plant or animal) or an
   isolated tissue such as a steak, the fruiting body of a fungus, or the seed of a plant. In
15 some cases, the isolated tissue is modified before food preparation, such as making flour
   or isolating oils and bulk proteins from seeds.
            Despite that fact that all of these items comprise a mixture of proteins,
   carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, the physical arrangement of these materials in
   the original plant or animal determines the use to which the plant or animal tissue will be
?0 put. Disclosed herein are improved methods and composition for the production of
   consumables.
                                              SUMMARY

   I. Consumables
           Methods and compositions for producing consumables are described herein. In
   some cases, the consumables are non-animal based replicas of animal-based food
   products that can be produced by breaking down non-animal materials into their
25 constituent parts and reassembling those parts into the consumables. In certain instances,
   the consumables are not intended to replicate an animal-based food and instead have their
   own unique characteristics desirable as a food. Additionally, the consumables may, in
   some instances, act as nutraceuticals or carriers for pharmaceutical compositions rather
   than serving a primary function as food.
                                                 12

            The advantages of the consumables described herein can include, for example, the
   using less energy or water in the production of the consumable compared to similar food
   products, using no animals in the production of the consumable, making a healthier
   product, using raw materials that would otherwise be discarded, or allowing for the
 5 elimination (or lack of incorporation) of certain components (e.g., allergens) from the
   consumables. The consumables also may have a higher degree of production
   consistency, allowing for improved quality control of the products. Another advantage is
   that the consumables can be designed intentionally to have desirable characteristics for
   food preparation that are superior to traditional food products.
10          The consumables can be for animal consumption, including human consumption.
   The consumables can be food for domestic animals (e.g., dog food could be produced
   according to the present inventions) or wild animals (e.g., food for non-domesticated
   predatory animals).
            The consumables can be sold in grocery stores, convenience stores, mass
15 merchandisers, and club stores or prepared in restaurants, including fast food restaurants,
   schools, event locations, hospitals, military facilities, prisons, shelters, or long-term care
   facilities, similar to already existing human foods.
            The consumable can be approved by suitable regulatory authorities. For example,
   the consumable could be prepared to be suitable for the U.S. Food and Drug
?0 Administration. Methods of the invention can include steps necessary to satisfy
   regulatory agencies.
            The consumables of the present invention can replicate, compete with,
   supplement or replace conventional food products (herein referred to as "food products").
   Food products can be any foods which presently exist. The consumables of the invention
25 can be made to replicate the food products, e.g., an equivalent meat product. The
   equivalent meat product can be a white meat or a dark meat. The equivalent meat
   product can be derived from any animal. Non-limiting examples of animals used to
   derive the equivalent meat product include farmed animals such as, e.g., cattle, sheep,
   pig, chicken, turkey, goose, duck, horse, dog or game animals (whether wild or farmed)
30 such as, e.g., rabbit, deer, bison, buffalo, boar, snake, pheasant, quail, bear, elk, antelope,
                                                  13

   pigeon, dove, grouse, fox, wild pig, goat, kangaroo, emu, alligator, crocodile, turtle,
   groundhog, marmot, possum, partridge, squirrel, raccoon, whale, seal, ostrich, capybara,
   nutria, guinea pig, rat, mice, vole, any variety of insect or other arthropod, or seafood
   such as, e.g., fish, crab, lobster, oyster, muscle, scallop, abalone, squid, octopus, sea
 5 urchin, tunicate and others.
           Many meat products are typically derived from skeletal muscle of an animal but it
   is understood that meat can also come from other muscles or organs of the animal. In
   some embodiments, the equivalent meat product is a cut of meat derived from skeletal
   muscle. In other embodiments, the equivalent meat product is an organ such as, e.g.,
10 kidney, heart, liver, gallbladder, intestine, stomach, bone marrow, brain, thymus, lung, or
   tongue. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the compositions of the present invention
   are consumables similar to skeletal muscle or organs.
           A consumable (e.g., a meat substitute) can comprise one or more of a first
   composition comprising a muscle tissue replica, a second composition comprising an
15 adipose tissue replica, and/or a third composition comprising a connective tissue replica,
   wherein the one or more compositions are combined in a manner that recapitulates the
   physical organization of meat. The present invention also provides distinct compositions
   for a muscle tissue replica (herein referred to as "muscle replica"), an adipose tissue
   replica (herein referred to as an "adipose replica" or "fat replica"), and a connective
?0 tissue replica (herein referred to as "connective tissue replica"). In some embodiments,
   these compositions are principally or entirely composed of ingredients derived from non
   animal sources (e.g., 10% or less of the ingredients are from animal sources). In
   alternative embodiments, the muscle, fat, and/or connective tissue replica, or the meat
   substitute products comprising one or more of the replicas, are partially derived from
25 animal sources but supplemented with ingredients derived from non-animal sources. In
   some embodiments, as much as 90% of the food product is derived from animal sources.
   In some embodiments about 75% of the food product is derived from animal sources. In
   some embodiments, about 50% of the food product is derived from animal sources. In
   some embodiments about 10% of the food product is derived from animal sources. In yet
30 other alternative embodiments, the invention provides meat products substantially
                                                   14

   derived from animal sources (e.g., a beef, chicken, turkey, or a pork product) that are
   supplemented with one or more of a muscle tissue replica, a fat replica, and/or a
   connective tissue replica, wherein the replicas are derived substantially or entirely from
   non-animal sources. A non-limiting example of such a meat product is an ultra-lean
 5 ground beef product supplemented with a non-animal derived fat replica which improves
   texture and mouthfeel while preserving the health benefits of a consumable low in animal
   fat. Such alternative embodiments can result in products with properties that more
   closely recapitulate key features associated with preparing and consuming meat but
   which are less costly and associated with a lesser environmental impact, less animal
10 welfare impact, or improved health benefits for the consumer.
           Examples of other food products which the consumable can replicate or replace
   include: beverages (e.g., cream liquor or milk), protein drinks (e.g., RuBisCo can be used
   as a protein supplement in beer, distilled alcohol beverages such as vodka, fruit juices,
   meal replacement beverages, or water), pastes (e.g. NutellaT M , cream, nacho cheese or
15 mayonnaise replicas), pate, blood sausage, meat extenders, eggs, fish, sausage, tenders ,
   spam or chilled foods (e.g., ice cream , yogurt, kefir, sour cream or butter replicas).
           The consumables can be a meat replica. The consumables can be made to mimic
   the cut or appearance of meat. For instance, a consumable may be visually similar to or
   indistinguishable from ground beef or a particular cut of beef. In an example
?0 embodiment, the replicas are combined in a manner that approximates the physical
   organization of natural ground meat (e.g., ground beef, ground chicken, or ground
   turkey). In other embodiments, the replicas are combined in a manner that approximates
   different cuts of beef, such as, e.g., rib-eye, filet mignon, London broil, among others.
   Alternatively, the consumables can be a made with a unique look or appearance. For
25 instance, the consumable could contain patterns (e.g., lettering or pictures) that are
   formed from the structure of the consumable. In some instances, the consumables look
   like traditional food products after they are prepared. For example, a consumable may be
   produced which is larger than a traditional cut of beef but which, after the consumable is
   sliced and cooked, appears the same as a traditional cooked meet. In some embodiments
30 the consumable may resemble a traditional food product shape in two dimensions, but not
                                                   15

   in a third. For example the consumable may resemble a cut of meat in two dimensions
   (for example when viewed from the top), but may be much longer (or thicker) than the
   traditional cut. In this example the composition can be cut repeatedly into traditionally
   meat shaped products.
 5          The consumables can be made from local products. For instance the consumables
   can be made from plants grown within a certain radius of the eventual consumer. That
   radius could be 1, 10, 100, or 1000 miles for example. Thus, in some embodiments, the
   invention provides method for producing a consumable which does not contain products
   which have been shipped over 1, 10, 100, or 1000 miles.
10          The present invention provides methods for producing consistent properties from
   the consumables when they are produced from various sources. For example, a plant
   based meat replica produced from local plants in Iowa, USA, will have substantially
   similar taste, odor, and texture as a plant based meat replica produced from local plants in
   Lorraine, France. This consistency allows for methods for advertising locally grown
15 foods with consistent properties. The consistency can arise from the concentration or
   purification of similar components at different locations. These components can be
   combined in predetermined ratios to insure consistency. In some embodiments, a high
   degree of characteristic consistency is possible using components (e.g. isolated or
   concentrated proteins and fats) which come from the same plant species. In some
?0 embodiments, a high degree of characteristic consistency is possible using components
   (e.g., isolated or concentrated proteins and fats) which come from the different plant
   species. In some embodiments, the same proteins can be isolated from different plant
   species (i.e. homologous proteins). In some embodiments, the invention provides for a
   method comprising isolating similar plant constituents from plant sources in different
25 locations, assembling in both locations compositions provided herein, and selling the
   compositions, wherein the compositions assembled and sold at different the geographic
   locations have consistent physical and chemical properties. In some embodiments, the
   isolated constituents are from different plant populations in different locations. In some
   embodiments one or more of the isolated constituents are shipped to the separate
30 geographic locations.
                                                  16

            The consumables may require fewer resources to produce than consumables
   produced from domesticated animals. Accordingly, the present invention provides for
   meat replicates which require less water or energy to produce than meat. For example a
   consumable described herein can require less than about 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, or
 5 1000 gallons of water per pound of consumable. For comparison producing beef can
   require over 2000 gallons of water per pound of meat.
            The consumable may require less land area to produce than a meat product with
   similar protein content. For example, a consumable described herein may require 30% or
   less of the land area required to produce a meat product with similar protein content.
10          The consumable may have health benefits compared to an animal product it
   replaces in the diet. For example it may have less cholesterol or lower levels of saturated
   fats than comparable meat products. The American Heart Association and the National
   Cholesterol Education Program recommends limiting cholesterol intake from food to 300
   mg per day, which is equivalent to the consumption of 12 ounces of beef or two egg
15 yolks. Consumables described herein that are indistinguishable to animal products such
   as ground beef, and having a reduced cholesterol content or no cholesterol, can help
   maintain a low cholesterol diet. In another example, a consumable described herein may
   contain no cholesterol, or higher levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids compared to the
   animal product it replaces.
?0          The consumable may have animal welfare benefits compared to an animal
   product it replaces in the diet. For instance, it may be produced without requiring
   confinement, forced feeding, premature weaning, disruption of maternal-offspring
   interactions, or slaughter of animals for their meat.
            The consumable may have a smaller "carbon footprint" than the meat products
25 they replace. For example the consumable may result in net greenhouse gas emissions of
   1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% or 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the
   animal product it replaces. By way of example, according to the Environmental Working
   Group (2011) "meat eaters guide to Climate Change and Health," the production of beef
   causes the emission of 27 kg equivalents of carbon dioxide per kilogram of beef that is
                                                  17

   consumed, and the production of lamb causes the emission of 39 kg equivalents of carbon
   dioxide per kilogram of beef that is consumed.
           The consumable described herein may provide alternatives to animal products or
   combinations of animal products whose consumption is forbidden by religious beliefs.
 5 For example, the consumable may be a kosher replica pork chop.
           The consumable can also be shipped in components and produced or assembled at
   a different location. When available, local components can be used for production of the
   consumable. The local components can be supplemented with components that are not
   locally available. This allows for methods of producing consumables, for instance meat
10 replicates, using less energy in shipment than is required for meat. For example, local
   water can be used in combination with a kit which provides other components of the
   consumable. Using local water reduces shipping weight, thereby reducing cost and
   environmental impact.
           The consumables described herein can be produced or assembled wholly or in
15 part in areas where animal farming is not practical or is not allowed. The consumable can
   be produced or assembled within an urban environment. For example, a kit may be
   provided to a user to enable the user to produce the consumable. The user could use local
   water or use plants from a rooftop garden, for instance in Shanghai. In another example,
   the consumables could be produced aboard a space craft, space station, or lunar base.
20 Accordingly, the present invention provides methods and systems for the production of
   meat replicas for use in space travel or for training for the same. For instance the present
   invention could be used in earth based training for space travel. The consumables could
   also be produced on an island or upon a manmade platform at sea where the keeping of
   livestock is difficult or prohibited.
25
   II. Properties of the Consumable
           The consumables described herein are typically designed to replicate the
   experience of eating a food product, e.g., meat. The look, texture, and taste of the
   consumable can be such that it is similar to, or indistinguishable from, a food product,
30 e.g., meat. The consumable can also be produced to have the desirable characteristics of
                                                  18

   food products without incorporating other undesirable characteristics. For example, a
   consumable can be a replica steak that does not have gristle or other components not
   typically consumed in a predicate food product.
           The invention provides, in certain embodiments, methods for determining the
 5 suitability for a consumable to qualify as a replica of a food product, for example, by
   determining whether an animal or human can distinguish the consumable from a
   predicate food product, e.g., a particular meat. One method to determine whether the
   consumable is comparable to a food product (e.g. meat) is to a) define the properties of
   meat and b) determine whether the consumable has similar properties.
10         Properties that can be tested or used to compare or describe a food product or the
   consumable include mechanical properties such as hardness, cohesiveness, brittleness,
   chewiness, gumminess, viscosity, elasticity, and adhesiveness. Properties of food
   products that can be tested also include geometric properties such as particle size and
   shape, and particle shape and orientation. The three dimensional organization of particles
15 may also be tested. Additional properties can include moisture content and fat content.
   These properties can be described using terms such as "soft," "firm" or "hard" describe
   hardness; "crumbly," "crunchy," "brittle," "chewy," "tender," "tough," "short,"
   "mealy," "pasty," or "gummy,"        to describe cohesiveness; "thin" or "viscous" to
   describe viscosity; "plastic" or "elastic" to describe elasticity; "sticky," "tacky" or
?o "gooey" to describe adhesiveness; "gritty," "grainy" or "course" to describe particle
   shape and size; "fibrous," "cellular" or "crystalline" to describe particle shape and
   orientation, "dry," "moist," "wet," or "watery" to describe moisture content; or "oily" or
   "greasy" to describe fat content. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a group of people can
   be asked to rate a certain food product, for instance ground beef, according to properties
25 which describe the food product. A consumable described herein can be rated by the
   same people to determine equivalence.
           Flavor of the food product can also be assessed. Flavors can be rated according to
   similarity to food products, e.g., "eggy," "fishy," "buttery," "chocolaty," "fruity",
   "peppery," "baconlike," "creamy," "milky," "or "beefy." Flavors can be rated according
30 to the seven basic tastes, i.e., sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami (savory), pungent (or
                                                   19

   piquant), and metallic. Flavors can be described according to the similarity to an
   experience caused by a chemical, e.g., diacetyl (buttery), 3-hydroxy-2 butanone (buttery),
   nona-2E-enal (fatty), 1-octene-3-ol (mushroom), hexanoic acid (sweaty), 4-hydroxy-5
   methyl furanone (HMF, meaty), pyrazines (nutty), bis(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide (roast
 5 meat), decanone (musty/fruity), isoamyl acetate (banana), benzaldehyde (bitter almond),
   cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamon), ethyl propionate (fruity), methyl anthranilate (grape),
   limonene (orange), ethyl decadienoate (pear), allyl hexanoate (pineapple), ethyl maltol
   (sugar, cotton candy), ethylvanillin (vanilla), butanoic acid (rancid), 12-methyltridecanal
   (beefy), or methyl salicylate (wintergreen). These ratings can be used as an indication of
10 the properties of the food product. The consumables of the present invention can then be
   compared to the food product to determine how similar the consumable is to the food
   product. In some instances the properties of the consumables are then altered to make the
   consumable more similar to the food product. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the
   consumable is rated similar to a food product according to human evaluation. In some
15 embodiments the consumable is indistinguishable from real meat to a human.
           The consumables can be made to eliminate properties associated with the source
   of the components of the consumables. For example a consumable can be made from
   components obtained from beans but can be made to lack a "beany" flavor or texture.
   One way this can be achieved is by breaking down the component source materials into
?0 isolated and purified components and not using components that cause undesired
   characteristic properties of the source. In addition, as described herein, off-flavors or
   aromas (e.g., undesirable flavors or aromas) in isolated and/or purified components can
   be minimized by deodorizing with activated charcoal or by removing enzymes such as
   lipoxygenases (LOX), which can be present in trace amounts and which can convert
25 unsaturated triacylglycerides (such as linoleic acid or linolenic acid) into smaller and
   more volatile molecules. LOX are naturally present in legumes such as peas, soybeans,
   and peanuts, as well as rice, potatoes, and olives. When legume flours are fractionated
   into separate protein fractions, LOX can act as undesirable "time-bombs" that can cause
   undesirable flavors or aromas on aging or storage. As shown in Example 34,
30 compositions containing plant proteins (e.g., from ground plant seeds) can be subjected to
                                                 20

   purification to remove LOX using, for example, an affinity resin that binds to LOX and
   removes it from the protein sample. The affinity resin can be linoleic acid, linolenic acid,
   stearic acid, oleic acid, propyl gallate, or epigalloccatechin gallate attached to a solid
   support such as a bead or resin. See, e.g., WO2013138793. In addition, depending on
 5 the protein component, certain combinations of antioxidants and/or LOX inhibitors can
   be used as effective agents to minimize off-flavor or off-odor generation in protein
   solutions, especially in the presence of fats and oils. Such compounds can include, for
   example, one or more of 0-carotene, a-tocopherol, caffeic acid, propyl gallate, or
   epigallocatechin gallate. These may be included during purification of the proteins or
10 during subsequent food processing steps to mitigate generation of off-flavors or off-odors
   in protein-based foods.
           In some compositions, subjects asked to identify the consumable identify it as a
   form of a food product, or as a particular food product, e.g., a subject will identify the
   consumable as meat. For example, in some compositions a human will identify the
15 consumable as having properties equivalent to meat. In some embodiments one or more
   properties of the consumable are equivalent to the corresponding properties of meat
   according to a human's perception. Such properties include the properties that can be
   tested. In some embodiments a human identifies a consumable of the present invention
   as more meat like than any meat substitutes found in the art.
?0         Experiments can demonstrate that a consumable is acceptable to consumers. A
   panel can be used to screen a variety of consumables described herein. A number of
   human panelists can test multiple consumable samples, namely, natural meats vs. the
   consumable compositions described herein, or a meat substitute vs. a consumable
   composition described herein. Variables such as fat content can be standardized, for
25 example to 20% fat using lean and fat meat mixes. Fat content can be determined using
   the Babcock for meat method (S. S. Nielson, Introduction to the Chemical Analysis of
   Foods (Jones & Bartlett Publishers, Boston, 1994)). Mixtures of ground beef and
   consumables of the invention prepared according to the procedure described herein can
   be formulated.
                                                  21

            Panelists can be served samples (e.g., in booths), under red lights or under white
   light, in an open consumer panel. Samples can be assigned random three-digit numbers
   and rotated in ballot position to prevent bias. Panelists can be asked to evaluate samples
   for tenderness, juiciness, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability using a hedonic scale
 5 from 1 =dislike extremely, to 9=like extremely, with a median of 5=neither like nor
   dislike. Panelists can be encouraged to rinse their mouths with water between samples,
   and given opportunity to comment on each sample.
            The results of this experiment can indicate significant differences or similarities
   between the traditional meats and the compositions of the invention.
10          These results can demonstrate that the compositions described herein are judged
   as acceptably equivalent to real meat products. Additionally, these results can
   demonstrate that compositions described herein are preferred by panelist over other
   commercially available meat substitutes. Thus, in some embodiments the present
   invention provides for consumables that are similar to traditional meats and are more
15 meat like than previously known meat alternatives.
            Consumables of the invention can also have similar physical characteristics as
   food products, e.g., traditional meat. In one embodiment, the force required to pierce a 1
   inch thick structure (e.g., a patty) made of a consumable of the invention with a fixed
   diameter steel rod is not significantly different than the force required to pierce a 1 inch
?0 thick similar food product structure (e.g., a ground beef patty) with a similar fixed
   diameter steel rod. Accordingly, the invention provides for consumables with similar
   physical strength characteristics to meat. In another embodiment, the force required to
   tear a sample of the invention with a cross-sectional area of 100 mm2 is not significantly
   different than the force required to tear a sample of animal tissue (muscle, fat or
25 connective tissue) with a cross-sectional area 100 mm 2 measured the same way. Force
   can be measured using, for example, TA.XT Plus Texture Analyzer (Textrue
   Technologies Corp.). Accordingly, the invention provides for consumables with similar
   physical strength characteristics to meat.
            Consumables described herein can have a similar cook loss characteristic as a
30 food product, e.g., meat. For example a consumable can have a similar fat and protein
                                                  22

   content to ground beef and have the same reduction in size when cooked as real ground
   beef. Similarities in size loss profiles can be achieved for various compositions of
   consumables described herein matched to various meats. The cook loss characteristics of
   the consumable also can be engineered to be superior to food products. For example a
 5 consumable can be produced that has less loss during cooking but achieves similar tastes
   and texture qualities as the cooked products. One way this is achieved is by altering the
   proportions of lipids based on melting temperatures in the consumable composition.
   Another way this is achieved is by altering the protein composition of the consumable by
   controlling the concentration of protein or by the mechanism by which the tissue replica
10 is formed.
           In some embodiments, the consumable is compared to an animal based food
   product (e.g., meat) based upon olfactometer readings. In various embodiments the
   olfactometer can be used to assess odor concentration and odor thresholds, or odor
   suprathresholds with comparison to a reference gas, hedonic scale scores to determine the
15 degree of appreciation, or relative intensity of odors. In some embodiments, the
   olfactometer allows the training and automatic evaluation of expert panels. So in some
   embodiments the consumable is a product that causes similar or identical olfactometer
   readings. In some embodiments the differences are sufficiently small to be below the
   detection threshold of human perception.
?0         Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) is a method that combines the
   features of gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to separate and identify
   different substances within a test sample. GCMS can, in some embodiments, be used to
   evaluate the properties of a consumable. For example volatile chemicals can be isolated
   from the head space around meat. These chemicals can be identified using GCMS. A
25 profile of the volatile chemicals in the headspace around meat is thereby created. In
   some instances each peak of the GCMS can be further evaluated. For instance, a human
   could rate the experience of smelling the chemical responsible for a certain peak. This
   information could be used to further refine the profile. GCMS could then be used to
   evaluate the properties of the consumable. The GCMS profile can be used to refine the
30 consumable.
                                                 23

           Characteristic flavor and fragrance components are mostly produced during the
   cooking process by chemical reactions molecules including amino acids, fats and sugars
   which are found in plants as well as meat. Therefore, in some embodiments, the
   consumable is tested for similarity to meat during or after cooking. In some
 5 embodiments human ratings, human evaluation, olfactometer readings, or GCMS
   measurements, or combinations thereof, are used to create an olfactory map of cooked
   meat. Similarly, an olfactory map of the consumable, for instance a meat replica, can be
   created. These maps can be compared to assess how similar the cooked consumable is to
   meat. In some embodiments the olfactory map of the consumable during or after cooking
10 is similar to or indistinguishable from that of cooked or cooking meat. In some
   embodiments the similarity is sufficient to be beyond the detection threshold of human
   perception. The consumable may be created so its characteristics are similar to a food
   product after cooking, but the uncooked consumable may be have properties that are
   different from the predicate food product prior to cooking.
15         Shelf life is the length of time that consumables are given before they are
   considered unsuitable for sale, use, or consumption. Generally, it is important to maintain
   a meat product at about 2'C as the shelf life decreases with exposure to higher
   temperatures.
           The shelf life of meat is determined through research into the meat products'
?0 sensory cues over time (odor, visual appearance of the package, color, taste and texture),
   and through laboratory analysis under controlled conditions to determine how long a
   product remains safe, wholesome and enjoyable. Ground beef is being used as an
   example, but similar conditions would apply to steaks, chops and roasts from other meat
   types. Beef in its natural state is dark bluish-purple. However, oxygen can permeate into
25 the meat and cause a chemical reaction with the myoglobin in meat, leading to a red
   color. Ongoing exposure to oxygen causes oxidation of myoglobin and causes red meat to
   become brown and develop "off' flavors. To control this oxidation, there has been
   significant research into different methods of storing and displaying meat products to
   increase the shelf life of meat products. These include the use of vacuum packing,
                                                  24

   modified atmosphere packing (high oxygen), modified atmosphere packaging (low
   oxygen with carbon monoxide), and/or High Pressure Pasteurization (HPP).
            The main determinant of the color of meat is the concentration of iron carrying
   proteins in the meat. In the skeletal muscle component of meat products, one of the main
 5 iron-carrying proteins is myoglobin. It is estimated that the white meat of chicken has
   under 0.05% myoglobin; pork and veal have 0.1-0.3% myoglobin; young beef has 0.4
   1.0% myoglobin; and old beef has 1.5-2.0% myoglobin. Normally, myoglobin in meat
   exists in three states: Oxymyoglobin (Fe 2 -) (oxygenated = bright red); myoglobin (Fe 2 +)
   (non-oxygenated    =  purplish/magenta); and metmyoglobin (Fe3 ) (oxidized    = brown). The
10 transition of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin in the presence of oxygen is thought to be
   the cause of the color change of ground meat from red to brown. Meat shelf life
   extenders have been developed to extend the lifetime of the red color of meat products
   including but not limited to carbon monoxide, nitrites, sodium metabisulfite, Bombal,
   vitamin E, rosemary extract, green tea extract, catechins and other anti-oxidants.
15          However an intrinsically more stable heme protein such a hemoglobin isolated
   from Aquifex aeolicus (SEQ ID NO:3) or Methylacidiphilum infernorum (SEQ ID NO: 2)
   will oxidize more slowly than a mesophilic hemoglobin such as myoglobin. The heme
   proteins described herein (see, e.g., FIG. 1) also may have the lifetime of the reduced
   heme-Fe2 + state extended by meat shelf life extenders such as carbon monoxide and
?0 sodium nitrite. Heme proteins may be selected for the desired color retention properties.
   For example for low temperature sous-vide cooking, a relatively unstable heme protein
   such as one from Hordeum vulgare may provide a brown product that appears cooked
   under conditions wherein myoglobin would retain its red, uncooked appearance. In some
   embodiments the heme protein may be selected to have increased stability where for
25 example the meat replica may retain an attractive medium rare appearance despite being
   thoroughly cooked for food safety.
            The main determinant of rancidity and production of off flavors or off odors is the
   oxidation of components of the consumable, including but not limited to, the fats. For
   example, oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids is a known cause of rancid odors. In some
30 embodiments, meat replicas have extended shelf life because the makeup of the chemical
                                                 25

   properties of the meat replica are controlled such that the taste, texture, smell, and
   chemical properties do not react with oxygen to create off flavors or off odors. In some
   embodiments the meat replicas are less sensitive to oxidation due to the presence of
   higher degree of unsaturated fatty acids than present in beef. In some embodiments the
 5 meat replica contains no unsaturated fatty acids. In other embodiments the meat replica
   contains higher levels of anti-oxidants such as glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin A, and
   vitamin E as well as enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and various
   peroxidases than are present in meat. In other embodiments, off flavor or off odor
   generating components such as lipoxygenase are not present.
10          In some embodiments, a consumable described herein shows increased stability
   under commercial packaging conditions. In some embodiments, the improved shelf life
   is improved by using components with increased oxidative stability such as lipids with
   reduced levels of unsaturated fatty acids, and/or by using a more stable heme protein such
   a hemoglobin isolated from Aquifex aeolicus (SEQ ID NO:3) or Methylacidiphilum
15 infernorum (SEQ ID NO: 2). In some embodiments, the improved shelf life is due to the
   combination of components used in the consumable. In some embodiments, the
   consumable is designed specifically for the desired packaging method.
   III. Composition of the Consumables
?0         A consumable described herein includes one or more isolated and purified
   proteins. "Isolated and purified protein" refers to a preparation in which the cumulative
   abundance by mass of protein components other than the specified protein, which can be
   a single monomeric or multimeric protein species, is reduced by a factor of 2 or more, 3
   or more, 5 or more, 10 or more, 20 or more, 50 or more, 100 or more or 1000 or more
25 relative to the source material from which the specified protein was isolated. For clarity,
   the isolated and purified protein is described as isolated and purified relative to its
   starting material (e.g., plants or other non-animal sources). In some embodiments, the
   term "isolated and purified" can indicate that the preparation of the protein is at least 60%
   pure, e.g., greater than 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% pure. The fact
30 that a consumable may comprise materials in addition to the isolated and purified protein
                                                 26

   does not change the isolated and purified nature of the protein as this definition typically
   applies to the protein before addition to the composition.
            In some embodiments, the one or more isolated and purified proteins accounts for
   at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least
 5 50% of the protein content of the consumable by weight. In some embodiments, each of
   the one or more isolated proteins is isolated and purified separately.
            A consumable described herein may be substantially or entirely composed of
   ingredients derived from non-animal sources, e.g., plant, fungal, or microbial based
   sources. The plant sources can be organically grown sources. Proteins can be extracted
10 from the source material (e.g., extracted from animal tissue, or plant, fungal, algal, or
   bacterial biomass, or from the culture supernatant for secreted proteins) or from a
   combination of source materials (e.g., multiple plant species). The consumables also can
   be made from a combination of plant based and animal based sources. For instance, the
   consumable may be a ground beef product supplemented with plant based products of the
15 invention.
   A. SOURCES OF COMPONENTS OF THE CONSUMABLE
            As described above, isolated and purified proteins can be derived from non
   animal sources such as plants, algae, fungi (e.g., yeast or filamentous fungi), bacteria, or
?0 Archaea. In some embodiments, the isolated and purified proteins can be obtained from
   genetically modified organisms such as genetically modified bacteria or yeast. In some
   embodiments, the isolated and purified proteins are chemically synthesized or obtained
   via in vitro synthesis.
            In some embodiments, the one or more isolated and purified proteins are derived
25 from plant sources. The isolated and purified proteins can be isolated from a single plant
   source or, alternatively, multiple plant sources can serve as the starting material for the
   isolation and purification of proteins. As described herein, isolated and purified plant
   proteins are soluble in solution. The solution can comprise EDTA (0 - O.1M), NaCl (0
   IM), KCl (0-IM), NaSO 4 (0 - 0.2M), potassium phosphate (0-1M), sodium citrate (0
30 IM), sodium carbonate (0-IM), sucrose (0-50%), Urea (0-2M) or any combination
                                                  27

   thereof. The solution can have a pH of 3 to 11. In some embodiments, plant proteins can
   have a solubility in a solution of >25 g/L (e.g., at least 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100,
   125, 150, 175, 200, or 225 g/L) at a temperature between about 2'C and about 32'C (e.g.,
   between 3C and 8'C, 10 C and 25'C, or 18'C and 25'C), wherein the solution has a pH
 5 between 3 and 8 (e.g., pH of 3-6, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, or 8), and has a sodium
   chloride content of 0 to 300 mM (e.g., 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 mM). In some
   embodiments, the isolated and purified proteins are soluble in solution at greater than 10,
   15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250g/L.
           One of skill in the art will understand that proteins that can be isolated from any
10 organism in the plant kingdom may be used to produce the consumables described herein.
   Non-limiting examples of plant sources include grain crops such as, e.g., maize, oats,
   rice, wheat, barley, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa, triticale (a wheat
   rye hybrid), teff (Eragrostistef); oilseed crops including cottonseed, sunflower seed,
   safflower seed, Crambe, Camelina, mustard, rapeseed (Brassicanapus); Acacia, or plants
15 from the legume family, such as, e.g., clover, Stylosanthes, Sesbania, vetch (Vicia),
   Arachis, Indigofera,Leucaena, Cyamopsis, peas such as cowpeas, english peas, yellow
   peas, or green peas, or beans such as, e.g., soybeans, fava beans, lima beans, kidney
   beans, garbanzo beans, mung beans, pinto beans, lentils, lupins, mesquite, carob, soy, and
   peanuts (Arachis hypogaea); leafy greens such as, e.g., lettuce, spinach, kale, collard
?0 greens, turnip greens, chard, mustard greens, dandelion greens, broccoli, or cabbage; or
   green matter not ordinarily consumed by humans, including biomass crops such as
   switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), Miscanthus, Arundo donax, energy cane, Sorghum, or
   other grasses, alfalfa, corn stover, kelp or other seaweeds, green matter ordinarily
   discarded from harvested plants, sugar cane leaves, leaves of trees, root crops such as
25 cassava, sweet potato, potato, carrots, beets, or turnips; or coconut.
           Protein can be isolated from any portion of the plant, including the roots, stems,
   leaves, flowers, or seeds. For example, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
   (RuBisCo) can be isolated from, for example, alfalfa, carrot tops, corn stover, sugar cane
   leaves, soybean leaves, switchgrass, Miscanthus, energy cane, Arundo donax, seaweed,
30 kelp, algae or mustard greens.
                                                  28

            Proteins that are abundant in plants can be isolated in large quantities from one or
   more source plants and thus are an economical choice for use in any of compositions
   provided herein (e.g., the muscle, fat, or connective tissue replicas, meat substitute
   products or others). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the one or more isolated and
 5 purified proteins comprise an abundant protein found in high levels in a plant and capable
   of being isolated and purified in large quantities. In some embodiments, the abundant
   protein comprises about 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%,
   250%, 30%, 350%, 40%, 450%, 50%, 550%, 60%, 650%, or 70% of the total protein content of
   the source plant material. In some embodiments, the abundant protein comprises about
10 0.5-10%, about 5-40%, about 10-50%, about 20-60%, or about 30-70% of the total
   protein content of the source plant material. In some embodiments, the abundant protein
   comprises about 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
   30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% of the total weight of the dry matter of the source plant
   material. In some embodiments, the abundant protein comprises about 0.5-5%, about 1
15 10%, about 5 -20%, about 10-30%, about 15 -40%, or about 20-50% of the total weight of
   the dry matter of the source plant material.
            The one or more isolated and purified proteins can comprise an abundant protein
   that is found in high levels in the leaves of plants. In some embodiments, the abundant
   protein comprises about 0.5 %, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8 %, 9%, 10%, 15 %, 20%,
?0 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 7 0%, 75%, or 80% of the total
   protein content of the leaves of the source plant. In some embodiments, the abundant
   protein comprises about 0.5-10%, about 5%-40%, about 10%-60%, about 20%-60%, or
   about 30-70% of the total protein content of the leaves of the source plant. In some
   embodiments, the one or more isolated proteins comprise RuBisCo, which is a
25 particularly useful protein for meat replicas because of its high solubility and an amino
   acid composition that is close to the optimum proportions of essential amino acids for
   human nutrition. In particular embodiments, the one or more isolated proteins comprise
   ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase activase (RuBisCo activase). In some
   embodiments, the one or more isolated and purified proteins comprise a vegetative
30 storage protein (VSP).
                                                  29

             The one or more isolated proteins can comprise an abundant protein that is found
    in high levels in the seeds of plants. In some embodiments, the abundant protein
    comprises about 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
    30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% or 90% or more of
  5 the total protein content of the seeds of the source plant. In some embodiments, the
    abundant protein comprises about 0.5-10%, about 5%-40%, about 10%-60%, about 20%
    60%, or about 30-70% or > 7 0% of the total protein content of the seeds of the source
    plant. Non-limiting examples of proteins found in high levels in the seeds of plants
    include seed storage proteins, e.g., albumins, glycinins, conglycinins, legumins,
 10 globulins, vicilins, conalbumin, gliadin, glutelin, gluten, glutenin, hordein, prolamins,
    phaseolin (protein), proteinoplast, secalin, triticeae gluten, or zein, or oil body proteins
    such as oleosins, caloleosins, or steroleosins.
             The one or more isolated and purified proteins can include highly soluble proteins
    such as dehydrins, hydrophilins, natively unfolded proteins (also referred to as
 15 intrinsically disordered proteins), or other proteins of the late-embryogenesis abundant
    (LEA) family. LEA proteins have been found in animals, plants and microorganisms and
    are thought to act as osmoprotectants and stress response proteins. See, e.g., Battaglia, et
    al., PlantPhysiol., 148:6-24 (2008). Such proteins also are heat stable. Such LEA
    protiens can have a solubility in a solution of at least 1 g/L (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25,
 ?0 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250g/L) at a temperature of between 90'C and 1 10 C (e.g., between
    95'C and 105'C, 95'C, or 100 C), wherein the solution has a pH between 5 and 8 (e.g.,
    pH of 5, 5.5., 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, or 8) and has a sodium chloride content of 0 to 300 mM (e.g.,
    50, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 mM). In some cases, the LEA proteins may be isolated by
    heating a protein extract to 90'C-1 10 C (e.g., 95'C or 1000) and, after centrifugation or
25  filtration of insoluble material, concentrating the LEA protein fraction by, for example,
    ultrafiltration. In some cases, isoionic pH precipitation, trichloroacetic acid precipitation,
    and/or ammonium sulfate precipitation steps can be done before or after the heating step
    to additionally remove non-LEA proteins. Heating the solution to 90'C-1 10 C denatures
    most proteins, allows the majority of the proteins to be removed from solution.

   B. PROTEINS
           Without being bound by theory, it is believed that by isolating and purifying non
   animal proteins (e.g., plant proteins), consumables can be made with greater consistency
   and greater control over the properties of the consumable. In some embodiments, about
 5 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%,
   35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more
   of the protein component of the consumable is comprised of one or more isolated and
   purified proteins. The isolated and purified protein may be greater than 60%, 70%, 80%,
   85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 100% pure.
10         The isolated and purified proteins can be isolated from one or more other
   components of a non-animal source. For example, a protein fraction may be isolated
   from an isolate of a plant. The isolated proteins may in some cases be purified, wherein a
   certain kind of protein is separated from other components found in the non-animal
   source. Proteins can be separated on the basis of their molecular weight, for example, by
15 size exclusion chromatography, ultrafiltration through membranes, or density
   centrifugation. In some embodiments, the proteins can be separated based on their
   surface charge, for example, by isoelectric precipitation, anion exchange
   chromatography, or cation exchange chromatography. Proteins also can be separated on
   the basis of their solubility, for example, by ammonium sulfate precipitation, isoelectric
?0 precipitation, surfactants, detergents or solvent extraction. Proteins also can be separated
   by their affinity to another molecule, using, for example, hydrophobic interaction
   chromatography, reactive dyes, or hydroxyapatite. Affinity chromatography also can
   include using antibodies having specific binding affinity for the protein of interest, nickel
   NTA for His-tagged recombinant proteins, lectins to bind to sugar moieties on a
25 glycoprotein, or other molecules which specifically binds the protein of interest.
           Isolating proteins allows for the elimination of unwanted material. In some
   embodiments, an isolated and purified protein is a protein that has been substantially
   separated from unwanted material (e.g., nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA, lipid
   membranes, phospholipids, fats, oils, carbohydrates such as starch, cellulose, and
                                                 31

   glucans, phenolic compounds, polyphenolic compounds, aromatic compounds, or
   pigments) in the seeds, leaves, stems, or other portion of the plant.
           The isolated and purified proteins also can be recombinantly produced using
   polypeptide expression techniques (e.g., heterologous expression techniques using
 5 bacterial cells, insect cells, fungal cells such as yeast cells, plant cells, or mammalian
   cells). In some cases, standard polypeptide synthesis techniques (e.g., liquid-phase
   polypeptide synthesis techniques or solid-phase polypeptide synthesis techniques) can be
   used to produce proteins synthetically. In some cases, cell-free translation techniques can
   be used to produce proteins synthetically.
10         The protein or proteins incorporated into the consumable can serve a nutritional
   function. In some instance, the protein also serves to alter the properties of the
   consumable, e.g., the flavor, color, odor, and/or texture of the consumable. For example,
   a meat substitute product can comprise a protein indicator that indicates cooking
   progression from a raw state to a cooked state, wherein the meat substitute product is
15 derived from non-animal sources.
           Examples of proteins that can be isolated and purified, and used in the
   consumables described herein include ribosomal proteins, actin, hexokinase, lactate
   dehydrogenase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, phosphofructokinases, triose phosphate
   isomerases, phosphoglycerate kinases, phosphoglycerate mutases, enolases, pyruvate

            In some embodiments, an isolated and purified protein can be a protein that
   interacts with lipids and helps to stabilize lipids in a structure, a protein that binds lipids
   and helps crosslink lipid structures, or a protein that binds lipids and helps crosslink lipid
   structures and non-lipid interacting proteins. Without wishing to be bound by a particular
 5 theory, using such proteins in a consumable described herein may improve the integration
   of lipids and/or fat replicas with other components of the meat substitute product,
   resulting in improved mouthfeel and texture of the final product. A non-limiting example
   of a lipid-interacting plant protein includes proteins in the oleosin family. Oleosins are
   lipid-interacting proteins that are found in oil bodies of plants. Other non-limiting
10 examples of plant proteins that can interact with lipids and stabilize emulsions include
   seed storage proteins from Great Northern beans, albumins from peas, globulins from
   peas, 8S globulins from moong bean, 8S globulins from Kidney bean, prolamin and lipid
   transfer proteins.
            In some embodiments, one or more of the isolated and purified proteins can be an
15 iron-carrying protein such as a heme-containing protein. As used herein, the term "heme
   containing protein" can be used interchangeably with "heme containing polypeptide" or
   "heme protein" or "heme polypeptide" and includes any polypeptide that can covalently
   or noncovalently bind a heme moiety. In some embodiments, the heme-containing
   polypeptide is a globin and can include a globin fold, which comprises a series of seven
?0 to nine alpha helices. Globin type proteins can be of any class (e.g., class I, class II, or
   class III), and in some embodiments, can transport or store oxygen. For example, a
   heme-containing protein can be a non-symbiotic type of hemoglobin or a leghemoglobin.
   A heme-containing polypeptide can be a monomer, i.e., a single polypeptide chain, or can
   be a dimer, a trimer, tetramer, and/or higher order oligomers. The life-time of the
25 oxygenated Fe      state of a heme-containing protein can be similar to that of myoglobin or
   can exceed it by 10%, 20%, 30% 50%, 100% or more under conditions in which the
   heme-protein-containing consumable is manufactured, stored, handled or prepared for
   consumption. The life-time of the unoxygenated Fe2 + state of a heme-containing protein
   can be similar to that of myoglobin or can exceed it by 10%, 20%, 30% 50%, 100% or
                                                  33

   more under conditions in which the heme-protein-containing consumable is
   manufactured, stored, handled or prepared for consumption
            Non-limiting examples of heme-containing polypeptides can include an
   androglobin, a cytoglobin, a globin E, a globin X, a globin Y, a hemoglobin, a
 5 leghemoglobin, a flavohemoglobin, Hell's gate globin I, a myoglobin, an erythrocruorin,
   a beta hemoglobin, an alpha hemoglobin, a protoglobin, a cyanoglobin, a cytoglobin, a
   histoglobin, a neuroglobins, a chlorocruorin, a truncated hemoglobin (e.g., HbN or HbO),
   a truncated 2/2 globin, a hemoglobin 3 (e.g., Glb3), a cytochrome, or a peroxidase.
            Heme-containing proteins that can be used in the consumables described herein
10 can be from mammals (e.g., farms animals such as cows, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, ox, or
   rabbits), birds, plants, algae, fungi (e.g., yeast or filamentous fungi), ciliates, or bacteria.
   For example, a heme-containing protein can be from a mammal such as a farm animal
   (e.g., a cow, goat, sheep, pig, ox, or rabbit) or a bird such as a turkey or chicken. Heme
   containing proteins can be from a plant such as Nicotiana tabacum or Nicotianasylvestris
15 (tobacco); Zea mays (corn), Arabidopsis thaliana, a legume such as Glycine max
   (soybean), Cicer arietinum (garbanzo or chick pea), Pisum sativum (pea) varieties such as
   garden peas or sugar snap peas, Phaseolusvulgaris varieties of common beans such as
   green beans, black beans, navy beans, northern beans, or pinto beans, Vigna unguiculata
   varieties (cow peas), Vigna radiata(Mung beans), Lupinus albus (lupin), or Medicago
?0 sativa (alfalfa); Brassica napus (canola); Triticum sps. (wheat, including wheat berries,
   and spelt); Gossypium hirsutum (cotton); Oryza sativa (rice);Zizania sps. (wild rice);
   Helianthus annuus (sunflower); Beta vulgaris (sugarbeet); Pennisetum glaucum (pearl
   millet); Chenopodium sp. (quinoa); Sesamum sp. (sesame); Linum usitatissimum (flax); or
   Hordeum vulgare (barley). Heme-containing proteins can be isolated from fungi such as
25 Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Pichiapastoris,Magnaportheoryzae, Fusarium
   graminearum,or Fusariumoxysporum. Heme-containing proteins can be isolated from
   bacteria such as Escherichiacoli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Synechocistis
   sp., Aquifex aeolicus,Methylacidiphilum infernorum, or thermophilic bacteria (e.g, that
   grow at temperatures greater than 45'C) such as Thermophilus. Heme-containing
30 proteins can be isolated from algae such as Chlamydomonas eugametos. Heme
                                                   34

   containing proteins can be isolated from protozoans such as Paramecium caudatum or
   Tetrahymenapyriformis. In some embodiments, the bacterial hemoglobins are selected
   from the group consisting of Aquifex aeolicus, Thermobifidafusca,Methylacidiphilum
   infernorum (Hells Gate), Synechocystis SP, or Bacillus subtilis. The sequences and
 5 structure of numerous heme-containing proteins are known. See for example, Reedy, et
   al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue D307-D313 and the Heme
   Protein Database available on the world wide web at httg_:/hemeprotein.info/herneshp.
           For example, a non-symbiotic hemoglobin can be from a plant selected from the
   group consisting of soybean, sprouted soybean, alfalfa, golden flax, black bean, black
10 eyed pea, northern, garbanzo, moong bean, cowpeas, pinto beans, pod peas, dried peas,
   quinoa, sesame, sunflower, wheat berries, spelt, barley, wild rice, or rice.
           Any of the heme-containing proteins described herein that can be used for
   producing consumables can have at least 70% (e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%,
   97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%) sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of the
15 corresponding wild-type heme-containing protein or fragments thereof that contain a
   heme-binding motif. For example, a heme-containing protein can have at least 70%
   sequence identity to an amino acid sequence set forth in FIG. 1, including a non
   symbiotic hemoglobin such as that from Vigna radiata(SEQ ID NO: 1), Hordeum vulgare
   (SEQ ID NO:5), Zea mays (SEQ ID NO:13), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (rice) (SEQ
?0 ID NO:14), or Arabidopsis thaliana (SEQ ID NO:15), a Hell's gate globin I such as that
   from Methylacidiphilum infernorum (SEQ ID NO:2), a flavohemoprotein such as that
   from Aquifex aeolicus (SEQ ID NO:3), a leghemoglobin such as that from Glycine max
   (SEQ ID NO:4), Pisum sativum (SEQ ID NO:16), or Vigna unguiculata (SEQ ID
   NO: 17), a heme-dependent peroxidase such as from Magnaporthe oryzae, (SEQ ID
25 NO:6) or Fusariumoxysporum (SEQ ID NO:7), a cytochrome c peroxidase from
   Fusariumgraminearum (SEQ ID NO:8), a truncated hemoglobin from Chlamydomonas
   moewusii (SEQ ID NO:9), Tetrahymenapyriformis (SEQ ID NO:10, group I truncated),
   Paramecium caudatum (SEQ ID NO: 11, group I truncated), a hemoglobin from
   Aspergillus niger (SEQ ID NO:12), or a mammalian myoglobin protein such as the Bos
30 taurus (SEQ ID NO:18) myoglobin, Sus scrofa (SEQ ID NO:19) myoglobin, or Equus
                                               35

   caballus (SEQ ID NO:20) myoglobin, a heme-protein from Nicotiana benthamiana(SEQ
   ID NO:21), Bacillus subtilis (SEQ ID NO:22), Corynebacteriumglutamicum (SEQ ID
   NO:23), Synechocystis PCC6803 (SEQ ID NO:24), Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335 (SEQ
   ID NO:25), Nostoc commune (SEQ ID NO:26), or Bacillus megaterium (SEQ ID
 5 NO:27). See FIG. 1.
           The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined as
   follows. First, the amino acid sequences are aligned using the BLAST 2 Sequences
   (Bl2seq) program from the stand-alone version of BLASTZ containing BLASTP version
   2.0.14. This stand-alone version of BLASTZ can be obtained from Fish & Richardson's
10 web site (e.g., www.fr.com/blast/) or the U.S. government's National Center for
   Biotechnology Information web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Instructions explaining
   how to use the B12seq program can be found in the readme file accompanying BLASTZ.
   Bl2seq performs a comparison between two amino acid sequences using the BLASTP
   algorithm. To compare two amino acid sequences, the options of Bl2seq are set as
15 follows: -i is set to a file containing the first amino acid sequence to be compared (e.g.,
   C:\seql.txt); -j is set to a file containing the second amino acid sequence to be compared
   (e.g., C:\seq2.txt); -p is set to blastp; -o is set to any desired file name (e.g., C:\output.txt);
   and all other options are left at their default setting. For example, the following
   command can be used to generate an output file containing a comparison between two
?0 amino acid sequences: C:\Bl2seq -i c:\seql.txt -j c:\seq2.txt -p blastp -o c:\output.txt. If
   the two compared sequences share homology, then the designated output file will present
   those regions of homology as aligned sequences. If the two compared sequences do not
   share homology, then the designated output file will not present aligned sequences.
   Similar procedures can be following for nucleic acid sequences except that blastn is used.
25         Once aligned, the number of matches is determined by counting the number of
   positions where an identical amino acid residue is presented in both sequences. The
   percent identity is determined by dividing the number of matches by the length of the
   full-length polypeptide amino acid sequence followed by multiplying the resulting value
   by 100. It is noted that the percent identity value is rounded to the nearest tenth. For
30 example, 78.11, 78.12, 78.13, and 78.14 isrounded down to 78.1, while 78.15, 78.16,
                                                     36

   78.17, 78.18, and 78.19 is rounded up to 78.2. It also is noted that the length value will
   always be an integer.
           It will be appreciated that a number of nucleic acids can encode a polypeptide
   having a particular amino acid sequence. The degeneracy of the genetic code is well
 5 known to the art; i.e., for many amino acids, there is more than one nucleotide triplet that
   serves as the codon for the amino acid. For example, codons in the coding sequence for a
   given enzyme can be modified such that optimal expression in a particular species (e.g.,
   bacteria or fungus) is obtained, using appropriate codon bias tables for that species.
           Heme-containing proteins can be extracted from the source material (e.g.,
10 extracted from animal tissue, or plant, fungal, algal, or bacterial biomass, or from the
   culture supernatant for secreted proteins) or from a combination of source materials (e.g.,
   multiple plant species). Leghemoglobin is readily available as an unused by-product of
   commodity legume crops (e.g., soybean, alfalfa, or pea). The amount of leghemoglobin
   in the roots of these crops in the United States exceeds the myoglobin content of all the
15 red meat consumed in the United States.
           In some embodiments, extracts of heme-containing proteins include one or more
   non-heme-containing proteins from the source material (e.g., other animal, plant, fungal,
   algal, or bacterial proteins) or from a combination of source materials (e.g., different
   animal, plant, fungi, algae, or bacteria).
?0         In some embodiments, heme-containing proteins are isolated and purified from
   other components of the source material (e.g., other animal, plant, fungal, algal, or
   bacterial proteins) using techniques described above. As used herein, the term "isolated
   and purified" indicates that the preparation of heme-containing protein is at least 60%
   pure, e.g., greater than 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% pure.
25         Heme-containing proteins also can be recombinantly produced using polypeptide
   expression techniques (e.g., heterologous expression techniques using bacterial cells,
   insect cells, algal cells, fungal cells such as yeast cells, plant cells, or mammalian cells).
   For example, the heme-containing protein can be expressed in E. coli cells. The heme
   containing proteins can be tagged with a heterologous amino acid sequence such as
30 FLAG, polyhistidine (e.g., hexahistidine, HIS tag), hemagluttinin (HA), glutathione-S
                                                   37

   transferase (GST), or maltose-binding protein (MBP) to aid in purifying the protein. In
   some embodiments, a recombinant heme containing protein including a HIS-tag and a
   protease (e.g., TEV) site to allow cleavage of the HIS-tag, can be expressed in E.coli and
   purified using His-tag affinity chromatography (Talon resin, CloneTech). In some cases,
 5 standard polypeptide synthesis techniques (e.g., liquid-phase polypeptide synthesis
   techniques or solid-phase polypeptide synthesis techniques) can be used to produce
   heme-containing proteins synthetically. In some cases, cell-free translation techniques
   can be used to produce heme-containing proteins synthetically..
            In some embodiments, the isolated and purified protein is substantially in its
10 native fold and water soluble. In some embodiments, the isolated and purified protein is
   more than 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% in its native fold. In some embodiments, the isolated
   and purified protein is more than 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% water soluble.
            The proteins used in the consumable can be altered (e.g., hydrolyzed, cleaved,
   crosslinked, denatured, polymerized, extruded, electrospun, spray dried or lyophilized, or
15 derivatized or chemically modified). For example, the proteins can be modified by
   covalent attaching sugars, lipids, cofactors, peptides, or other chemical groups including
   phosphate, acetate, methyl, and other natural or unnatural molecule. For example, the
   peptide backbones of the proteins can be cleaved by exposure to acid or proteases or
   other means. For example, the proteins can be denatured, i.e., their secondary, tertiary, or
?0 quaternary structure can be altered, by exposure to heat or cold, changes in pH, exposure
   to denaturing agents such as detergents, urea, or other chaotropic agents, or mechanical
   stress including shear. The alignment of proteins in a solution, colloid, or a solid
   assembly can be controlled to affect the mechanical properties including tensile strength,
   elasticity, deformability, hardness, or hydrophobicity.
25          Proteins also can be assembled into fibers that can form a matrix for a structure
   for the compositions. A 3-dimensional matrix of protein fibers can, for example, contain
   chemicals that promote formation of inter-molecular disulfide cross-links (mixed
   glutathione, dithiothreitol (DTT), beta-mercaptoethanol (BME)). In some embodiments,
   the chemicals are proteins (thioredoxin, glutaredoxin). In some embodiments, the
30 proteins are enzymes (disulfide isomerase). In some embodiments, fibers are crosslinked
                                                 38

   by chemical cross-linkers with two reactive groups selected from the group consisting of
   N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, imidoesters, aryl fluorides, aldehydes, maleimides,
   pyridyldithiols, haloacetyls, aryl azides, diazirines, carbodiimides, hydrazides and
   isocyanates.
 5          In some embodiments, coacervates comprising one or more plant proteins can be
   formed and used, for example, as binding agents in meat or other replicas. Coacervation
   is the process during which a homogeneous solution of charged polymers undergoes a
   phase separation to result in a polymer-rich dense phase (the 'coacervate') and a solvent
   rich phase (supernatant). Protein-polysaccharide coacervates have been used in the
10 development of biomaterials. See, for example, Boral and Bohidar (2010) Journalof
   Physical Chemistry B. Vol 114 (37): 12027-35; and Liu et al., (2010) Journalof
   Agriculturaland Food Chemistry, Vol 58:552-556. Formation of such coacervates is
   driven by associative interactions between oppositely charged polymers. However, as
   described herein, coacervates can be formed using proteins (e.g., plant proteins comprise
15 one or more pea proteins, chickpea proteins, lentil proteins, lupine proteins, other legume
   proteins, or mixtures thereof). In general, a coacervate can be formed by acidifying a low
   ionic strength solution (e.g., a buffered solution at or below100 mM sodium chloride)
   comprising one or more isolated and purified plant proteins such as pea legumins or
   vicilins (e.g., a vicilin fraction comprising convicilins), a combination of both vicilins and
?0 legumins, or unfractionated pea proteins to a pH of 3.5 to 5.5. (e.g., pH 4 to 5). Under
   these conditions, the proteins separate out of solution and the mixture can be centrifuged
   to cleanly separate out the coacervate. This coavervate, unlike a precipitate, is a viscous
   material that can be stretched by pulling and that melts on heating. The process can be
   carried out in the presence of oils (up to 70%, e.g., palm or other oil), to form a creamy
25 material. By varying the composition of the solution (ratio of vicilin: legumin, type and
   amount of oil used), the binding properties of the coacervate can be tuned as desired. In
   some embodiments, one or more gums (e.g., acacia gum or xanthan gum) can be used to
   form a coacervate. Coacervates can be used as binding agents in beef patty replicas to
   bind and hold together the adipose-, muscle- and connective tissue replicas.
                                                  39

            Binding materials with different adhesive and cooking characteristics can be
   prepared by combining wheat gluten (0-20%) and pea protein fractions (0-50%) in the
   presence of a plasticizer such as glycerol (0-30%) or polyethylene glycol. Leghemoglobin
   or other heme-containing protein can be added to the mixture if necessary. Upon mixing
 5 to remove any clumps, the material may be incorporated into beef patty replicas.
            In some embodiments, proteins can be subjected to freeze alignment to texturize
   the proteins without extrusion. The method involves slow freezing of protein comprising
   materials to allow for formation of ice crystals. When cooled from one side, ice crystals
   form preferentially in a direction perpendicular to the cooled side. After freezing, the ice
10 can be removed from the material in a freeze-dryer, leaving behind material with several
   layers. The structure can then be stabilized by heating under pressurized, moist conditions
   to produce a material that can be used in meat replicas. Freeze-alignment of soy proteins
   has been described by Lugay and Kim (1981) (see Freeze alignment: A novel method for
   protein texturization. Page 177-187, Chapter 8 in: D.W. Stanley, E.D. Murray and D.H.
15 Lees eds. 1981. Utilization of Protein Resources. Westport, CT: Food & Nutrition Press,
   Inc). The freeze-aligned proteins can be subjected to further processing (by soaking in
   solutions comprising beef flavors and/or leghemoglobin) and used in combination with
   adipose- and connective-tissue replicas to form beef replicas. The replicas may also be
   used as structures around which cold-set gels (comprising, for example, pea proteins and
?0 myoglobin) or crosslinked gels (comprising, for example, pea proteins and
   leghemoglobin) can be formed prior to their combination with adipose- and connective
   tissues.
   C. LIPIDS
25          Consumables described herein can include a lipid component. Lipids can be
   isolated and/or purified and can be in the form of triglycerides, monoglycerides,
   diglycerides, free fatty acids, sphingosides, glycolipids, phospholipids, or oils, or
   assemblies of such lipids (e.g., membranes, lecithin, lysolecithin, or fat droplets

   phospholipids can comprise a plurality of amphipathic molecules comprising fatty acids
   (e.g., see above), glycerol and polar groups. In some embodiments, the polar groups are,
   for example, choline, ethanolamine, serine, phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, inositol or
   inositol phosphates. In some embodiments, the lipids are, for example, sphingolipids,

   the term "cream fraction" can refer to an isolated emulsion comprising lipids, proteins
   and water.
10          To obtain a cream fraction from seeds, nuts, or legumes, one or more of the
   following steps can be performed. Seeds, nuts or legumes can be blended from 1 minute
   up to 30 minutes. For example, the seeds, nuts, or legumes can be blended by increasing
   the speed gradually to maximum speed over 4 minutes, then blending at maximum speed
   for 1 minute. The seeds, nuts or legumes can be blended in water or solutions that contain
15 all or some of the following: EDTA (0 - 0.1M), NaCl (0-1M), KCl (0-1M), NaSO 4 (0
   0.2M), potassium phosphate (0-1M), sodium citrate (0-1M), sodium carbonate (0-1M),
   and/or sucrose (0-50%), from pH of 3 to 11 to obtain a slurry. The slurry can be heated
   to 20'C to 50'C and centrifuged to obtain the cream fraction (the top layer, also referred
   to as the "cream"). Further purification of the cream fraction may be achieved by
?0 washing the cream fraction with 0.1 M to 2M urea solution before re-isolating the cream
   fraction by centrifugation. The residual liquid (referred to as the "skim" layer) that is a
   solution comprising proteins in water can also be used.
            The "cream" can be used as is, or subjected to further purification steps. For
   example, washing and heating can remove color and flavor molecules (e.g., unwanted
25 molecules), or unwanted grainy particles to improve the mouth feel and creaminess. In
   particular, washing with a high pH buffer (pH >9) can remove bitter tasting compounds
   and improve mouth feel, washing with urea can remove storage proteins, washing below
   pH 9, followed by washing with a pH above pH 9 can remove unwanted color molecules,
   and/or washing with salts can decrease taste compounds. Heating can increase the
30 removal of grainy particles, color and flavor compounds. For example, the cream
                                                42

   fraction can be heated from 0-24 hours, at temperatures ranging from 25'C to 80'C. In
   some embodiments, the resulting creamy fraction comprises seed storage proteins. In
   some embodiments, the seed storage proteins are substantially removed from the
   resulting creamy fraction.

   D. FIBER
           Fiber can be isolated and/or purified for inclusion in the consumables described
   herein. Fiber can refer to non-starch polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans, cellulose,
   and other plant components such as resistant starch, resistant dextrins, inulin, lignin,
10 waxes, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans, and oligosaccharides from any plant source.
           Fibers can refer to extruded and solution spun proteins as described herein.
   E. SUGARS
           In some embodiments, the consumable also can comprise sugars. For example
15 the consumable can comprise: monosaccharides, including but not limited to glucose
   (dextrose), fructose (levulose), galactose, mannose, arabinose, xylose (D- or L-xylose),
   and ribose, disaccharides including but not limited to sucrose, lactose, melibiose,
   trehalose, cellobiose, or maltose, sugar alcohols such as arabitol, mannitol, dulcitol, or
   sorbitol, sugar acids such as galacturonate, glucuronate, or gluconate, oligosaccharides
?0 and polysaccharides such as glucans, starches such as corn starch, potato starch, pectins
   such as apple pectin or orange pectin, raffinose, stachyose, or dextrans; plant cell wall
   degradation products such as salicin, and/or sugar derivatives such as N
   acetylglucosamine.
25 F. GEL FORMATION
           The components of the composition can be formed into a gel. In some
   embodiments, gels comprise protein, where the protein is derived from non-animal
   source (e.g., a plant source or other non-animal source such as a genetically modified
   yeast or bacteria). Gels can be formed using a variety of methods. The protein
                                                43

   concentration, enzyme concentration, pH, and/or process temperature will affect the rate
   of gel formation and quality of the final tissue replica.
            Gels can be stabilized entirely by physical cross-links between the components. In
   some embodiments, gels can be produced by heat/cool cycles, in which case the gel is
 5 stabilized by physical interactions (entanglements, hydrophobic interactions) between
   protein molecules. For example, a gel can be formed by heating a protein solution to a
   temperature of at least 40'C, 45'C, 50'C, 60'C, 70'C, 80'C, 90'C, or 1000 C and then
   cooling to room temperature, or to a temperature below 40'C.
            In some embodiments, a gel can be formed by subjecting the composition
10 containing the protein and any other components (e.g., a lipid) to high pressure
   processing.
            In some embodiments, gels can be produced by adjusting the pH of the solution.
   For example, the pH of a concentrated protein solution can be adjusted to near the
   isolectric pH of the main protein component by adding hydrochloric acid or other acid, or
15 sodium hydroxide or other base.
            In some embodiments, gels can be produced by soaking protein powders in
   solutions. For example, protein powder can be soaked with at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%
   (wt/v) or more of a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. In other examples, protein
   powder can be soaked in mixed water/ethanol solutions.
?0          In some embodiments, a cold set gel is formed to avoid denaturing or the
   breakdown of any heat-labile components (e.g., oxidizing the iron in a heme moiety or
   generating undesirable flavors). See, Ju and Kilara A. (1998) J. Food Science, Vol 63(2):
   288-292; and Maltais et al., (2005) J. Food Science, Vol 70 (1): C67-C73) for general
   methodologies for forming cold set gels. In general, cold set gels are formed by first heat
25 denaturing a protein solution below its minimum gelling concentration (dependent on pH
   and type of protein, typically <8% (w/v) at pH 6-9 for globular plant proteins such as pea
   proteins). The protein solution can heated to a temperature above the denaturation
   temperature of the protein under conditions where it does not precipitate out of solution
   (e.g., 0-500 mM sodium chloride, pH 6-9). The solution can be cooled back to room
30 temperature or below, and any heat-labile components (e.g., heme-containing proteins
                                                 44

   and/or oils) can be mixed in when the solution is sufficiently cool, but before gelling..
   Gelation can be induced by adding sodium chloride or calcium chloride (e.g., 5 to 100
   mM), and the solution can be incubated at or below room temperature to allow for gel
   formation (typically minutes-hours). The resulting gel can be used as-is in meat replicas
 5 or processed further (e.g., stabilized) before incorporation in meat replicas.
            In some embodiments, gels can comprise or be produced (e.g., stabilized by) at
   least in part by a cross-linking enzyme. The cross-linking enzyme can be, for example, a
   transglutaminase, a tyrosinase, a lipoxygenase, a protein disulfide reductase, a protein
   disulfide isomerase, a sulfhydryl oxidase, a peroxidase, a hexose oxidase, a lysyl oxidase,
10 or an amine oxidase.
            In some cases, gels can comprise chemicals that promote formation of inter
   molecular disulfide cross-links between the proteins. In some embodiments, the
   chemicals are proteins (e.g., thioredoxin, glutaredoxin). In some embodiments, the
   proteins are enzymes (disulfide isomerase).
15          Gels can be stabilized by chemical crosslinking by chemical cross-linkers with
   two reactive groups selected from the group consisting of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
   esters, imidoesters, aryl fluorides, aldehydes, maleimides, pyridyldithiols, haloacetyls,
   aryl azides, diazirines, carbodiimides, hydrazides and isocyanates.
            In some embodiments, gels can be stabilized by the addition of starches and
?0 gums.
            In some embodiments, more than one of these approaches are used in
   combination. For example, a transglutaminase cross-linked gel can be further stabilized
   by a heat/cool treatment.
25 G. MUSCLE REPLICAS
            A large number of meat products comprise a high proportion of skeletal muscle.
   Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition, which can be derived from
   non-animal sources which replicates or approximates key features of animal skeletal
   muscle. A composition derived from non-animal sources, which replicates or
30 approximates animal skeletal muscle can be used as a component of a consumable, for
                                                 45

   example, a meat replica. Such a composition will be labeled herein as "muscle replica."
   In some embodiments, the muscle replica and/or meat substitute product comprising the
   muscle replica are partially derived from animal sources. In some embodiments, the
   muscle replica and/or meat substitute product comprising the muscle replica are entirely
 5 derived from non-animal sources.
           The muscle tissue replica can comprise a protein content, wherein the protein
   content comprises one or more isolated and purified proteins, wherein the muscle tissue
   replica approximates the taste, texture, or color of an equivalent muscle tissue derived
   from an animal source.
10         Many meat products comprise a high proportion of striated skeletal muscle in
   which individual muscle fibers are organized mainly in an anisotropic fashion.
   Accordingly, in some embodiments, the muscle replica comprises fibers that are to some
   extent organized anisotropically. The fibers can comprise a protein component. In some
   embodiments, the fibers comprise about 1% (wt/wt), about 2%, about 5%, about 10%,
15 about 15%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about           7 0 %,
   about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99% (wt/wt) or more of a protein component.
           The connective tissue component of skeletal muscle substantially contributes to
   texture, mouth feel and cooking behavior of meat products. Connective tissue is
   composed of protein (collagen, elastin) fibers in the range of 0.1 - 20 microns. In some
?0 embodiments, a mixture of fibers of diameters of <1-10 microns, and 10-300 microns is
   produced to replicate the fiber composition of animal connective tissue. In some
   embodiments, the 3-dimensional matrix of fibers is stabilized by protein crosslinks to
   replicate the tensile strength of animal connective tissue. In some embodiments, the 3
   dimensional matrix of fibers contains an isolated, purified cross-linking enzyme. The
25 cross-linking enzyme can be, for example, a transglutaminase, a tyrosinase, a
   lipoxygenase, a protein disulfide reductase, a protein disulfide isomerase, a sulfhydryl
   oxidase, a peroxidase, a hexose oxidase, a lysyl oxidase, or an amine oxidase.
           Some proteins (e.g., 8S globulin from Moong bean seeds, or the albumin or
   globulin fraction of pea seeds) have favorable properties for constructing meat replicas
30 because of their ability to form gels with textures similar to animal muscle or adipose
                                                 46

   tissue. See also the proteins identified in Section III A and B. The proteins may be
   artificially designed to emulate physical properties of animal muscle tissue.
            In some embodiments, one or more isolated and purified proteins accounts for
   about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
 5 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or
   more of the protein component by weight of the meat replica. In some embodiments, one
   or more isolated and purified proteins accounts for about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%,
   4%, 5%, 6%, 7 %, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%,
   60%, 65%, 7 0%, 7 5%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more of the protein content of a
10 consumable.
            Skeletal muscles of animals such as beef cattle typically contain substantial
   quantities of glycogen, which can comprise on the order of 1% of the mass of the muscle
   tissue at the time of slaughter. After slaughter, a fraction of this glycogen continues to be
   metabolized, yielding products including lactic acid, which contributes to lowering the
15 pH of the muscle tissue, a desirable quality in meat. Glycogen is a branched polymer of
   glucose linked together by alpha (1->4) glycosidic bonds in linear chains, with branch
   points comprising alpha (1->6) glycosidic bonds. Starches from plants, particularly
   amylopectins are also branched polymers of glucose linked together by alpha (1->4)
   glycosidic bonds in linear chains, with branch points comprising alpha (1->6) glycosidic
20 bonds and can therefore be used as an analog of glycogen in constructing meat replicas.
   Thus, in some embodiments, the muscle or meat replica includes a starch or pectin.
            Additional components of animal muscle tissue include sodium, potassium,
   calcium, magnesium, and other metal ions, lactic acid and other organic acids, free amino
   acids, peptides, nucleotides, and sulfur compounds. Thus, in some embodiments, a
25 muscle replica can include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, other metal ions
   such as iron, zinc, copper, nickel, lithium, or selenium, lactic acid, and other organic
   acids such as fatty acids, free amino acids, peptides, nucleotides and sulfur compounds
   glutathione, beta mercaptoethanol, or dithiothreitol. In some embodiments, the
   concentration of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, other metal ions, lactic acid,
30 other organic acids, free amino acids, peptides, nucleotides and/or sulfur compounds in
                                                 47

   the muscle replica or consumable are within 10% of the concentrations found in a muscle
   or meat being replicated.
           The invention also provides methods for making a muscle replica. In some
   embodiments, the method includes forming the composition into asymmetric fibers prior
 5 to incorporation into the consumable. In some embodiments, these fibers replicate
   muscle fibers. In some embodiments the fibers are spun fibers. In other embodiments the
   fibers are extruded fibers. Accordingly, the present invention provides for methods for
   producing asymmetric or spun protein fibers. In some embodiments, the fibers are
   formed by extrusion of the protein component through an extruder. Methods of extrusion
10 are well known in the art, and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,379,738,
   U.S. Patent No. 3,693,533, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20120093994, which are
   herein incorporated by reference. These methods can be applied to making the
   compositions provided herein.
           Extrusion can be conducted using, for example, a Leistritz Nano-16 twin-screw
15 co-rotating extruder (American Leistritz Extruder Corp. USA, Sommerville, NJ). Active
   cooling of the barrel section can be used to limit denaturation of proteins. Active cooling
   of the die section can be used to limit expansion of the extruded product and excessive
   moisture loss. Protein feed and liquid are added separately: protein is fed by a volumetric
   plunger feeder or a continuous auger-type feeder, and liquid can be added into the barrel
?0 through a high pressure liquid injection system. Die nozzles with various inner diameters
   and channel length can be used for precise control of extrudiate pressure, cooling rate and
   product expansion. In some examples, extrusion parameters were: screw speed 100-200
   rpm, die diameter 3 mm, die length 15 cm, product temperature at the end of the die of
   50'C, feed rate of 2 g/min, and water-flow rate of 3 g/min. Product temperature at the die
25 during extrusion is measured by a thermocouple.
           Spun fibers can be produced by preparing a high viscosity protein "dope" by
   adding sodium hydroxide to concentrated protein solutions or to precipitated proteins,
   and forcing the solution with a plunger-type device (in some examples, a syringe with a
   syringe pump) through a small steel capillary (in some examples, 27 gauge hypodermic
30 needle) into a coagulating bath. In some examples, the bath is filled with a concentrated
                                                48

   acid solution (e.g. 3 M hydrochloric acid). In some examples, the bath is filled with a
   buffer solution at a pH approximately equal to the isoionic point of the protein.
   Coagulating protein solution jet forms a fiber that collects at the bottom of the bath.
           Bundles of spun fibers can be produced by forcing protein "dope" through
 5 spinnerets with many small holes. In some examples, spinnerets are stainless steel plates
   with approximately 25,000 holes per cm 2, with diameter of each hole approximately 200
   microns. In some embodiments muscle tissue replica is produced by immersing the 3
   dimensional matrix of fibers (connective tissue replica) in solutions of proteins and
   creating protein gels incorporating 3-dimensional matrix of fibers.
10
   H. FAT REPLICAS
           Animal fat is important for the experience of eating cooked meat and are
   important for some of the nutritional value of meat. Accordingly, the present invention
   provides compositions derived from non-animal sources, which recapitulate key features
15 of animal fat, including the texture and/or flavor, by using components that mimic the
   chemical composition and physical properties of, for example, ground beef. In another
   aspect, the present invention provides a meat substitute product that comprises a
   composition derived from non-animal sources, which recapitulates animal fat. Such a
   composition will be labeled herein as an "adipose replica" or a "fat replica." In some
?0 embodiments, the adipose replica and/or meat substitute product comprising the adipose
   replica are partially derived from animal sources. The consumable can also include
   adipose replicas that recapitulate key features of non-animal fats, including texture,
   flavor, firmness, percent fat release, and/or temperature of fat release. The fat content of
   the consumable can be at least 1%, 50%, 10%, 15 %, 20%, 25 %, 30%, 350%, 40%, 450%,
25 50%, 55%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95% fat.
           Ground beef is typically prepared by mixing lean beef with adipose (fat) that is
   cut from steaks, with the adipose tissue added to 16-30% (Cox 1993). Without adipose,
   meat passed through a grinder is tough, crumbly, and dries out quickly. Fat is added to
   lean beef so that fat released during cooking provides a liquid surface to aid in cooking,
30 and to generate key beef flavors, which largely are products of the fatty acids.
                                                  49

   Engineering an adipose tissue replica that plays the same key roles in texture and flavor
   of the plant-based ground beef is an important driver for texture and flavor.
            The adipose tissue replicas described here have a great health benefit over the
   beef adipose tissue as the fatty acid composition can be controlled such that the amount
 5 of saturated fats can be decreased. Additionally, the plant-based adipose replicas are
   cholesterol free. The plant-based adipose replicas can contain a lower percent total fat,
   and still have the same amount of fat being released or retained for the desired cooking
   properties, flavor, and texture.
            As described herein, adipose replicas comprising emulsions of plant-derived
10 lipids and one or more isolated and purified proteins can be produced in which the
   composition (e.g., fatty acid composition), cooking characteristics (e.g., fat release
   temperature or percent fat release), and physical properties (e.g., firmness) can be
   controlled, allowing the plant based composition to mimic animal based adipose. The
   adipose tissue replica includes (1) a vegetable oil containing triacylglycerides of fatty
15 acids; (2) one or more isolated and purified proteins from non-animal sources (e.g., a
   plant protein); and (3) a phospholipid such as lecithin. The proteins can be plant or
   microbial proteins as described above (e.g., RuBisCo, an oleosin, an albumin, a globulin,
   or other seed storage protein). See, also the proteins described in Sections III A and B.
   The vegetable oils can be any of the oils described herein. See, e.g., Section III C.
?0          The fat replica can be a gelled emulsion. In some embodiments, the gel is a soft,
   elastic gel comprising proteins and optionally carbohydrates. The gelled emulsion can
   comprise a protein solution comprising multiple proteins, e.g., 1-5 or 1-3 isolated and
   purified proteins, wherein the protein solution accounts for 1-30% of the volume of the
   emulsion. The gelled emulsion can comprise a fat droplet, wherein the fat droplet
25 accounts for 70-99% of the volume of the emulsion. The gelled emulsion can comprise
   an isolated, purified cross-linking enzyme, wherein the cross-linking enzyme accounts for
   0.0005% to 0.5% of the emulsion weight by volume, 0.5-2.5% of the emulsion weight by
   volume, or 0.001% or lower of the emulsion weight by volume. The emulsion of fat
   droplets in the protein solution can be stabilized by forming the emulsion into a gel by the
30 cross-linking enzyme, e.g., a transglutaminase, by gelling proteins via heating and
                                                 50

   cooling protein solutions, by forming a cold-set gel, by formation of a coacervate, or by
   combinations of these techniques as described for coacervates in section C and gel
   formation in section F.
            In some embodiments, the fat replica comprises cross-linking enzymes that
 5 catalyze reactions leading to covalent crosslinks between proteins. Cross-linking
   enzymes can be used to create or stabilize the desired structure and texture of the adipose
   tissue replica, to mimic the desired texture of an equivalent desired animal fat. In some
   embodiments, the cross-linking enzymes are isolated and purified from a non-animal
   source, examples and embodiments of which are described herein. In some
10 embodiments, the fat replica comprises at least 0.00010%, at least 0.0010%, at least 0.01%,
   at least 0.1%, or at least% (wt/vol) of a cross-linking enzyme. The cross-linking
   enzyme can be selected from, for example, transglutaminases, tyrosinases, lipoxygenases,
   protein disulfide reductases, protein disulfide isomerases, sulfhydryl oxidases,
   peroxidases, hexose oxidases, lysyl oxidases, and amine oxidases. In some embodiments,
15 the cross-linking enzyme is transglutaminase, a lysyl oxidase (e.g., a Pichiapastorislysyl
   oxidase), or other amine oxidase.
            The fat replica can comprise a gel with droplets of fat suspended therein. The fat
   droplets used in some embodiments of the present invention can be from a variety of
   sources. In some embodiments, the sources are non-animal sources (e.g., plant sources).
?0 See, e.g., the examples provided in Section III C. In some embodiments, the fat droplets
   are derived from animal products (e.g., butter, cream, lard, and/or suet). In some
   embodiments, fat droplets are derived from pulp or seed oil. In other embodiments, the
   source may be algae, yeasts, oleaginous yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica, or mold. For
   instance, in one embodiment, triglycerides derived from Mortierella isabellinacan be
25 used. In some embodiments, the fat droplets contain synthetic or partially synthetic lipids
            In some embodiments, the fat droplets are stabilized by addition of surfactants,
   including but not limited to phospholipids, lecithins, and lipid membranes. The lipid
   membranes may be derived from algae, fungi or plants. In some embodiments the
   surfactants comprise less than 5% of the fat replica. The fat droplets can in some
30 examples range from 100 nm to 150 gm in diameter. The diameter of these stabilized
                                                 51

   droplets may be obtained by homogenization, high-pressure homogenization, extrusion or
   sonication.
           In some embodiments, plant oils are modified to resemble animal fats. The plant
   oils can be modified with flavoring or other agents such as heme proteins, amino acids,
 5 organic acids, lipids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, furans, sugars, or other
   flavor precursor, to recapitulate the taste and smell of meat during and after cooking.
   Accordingly, some aspects of the invention involve methods for testing the qualitative
   similarity between the cooking properties of animal fat and the cooking properties of
   plant oils in the consumable.
10         In some embodiments, additional polysaccharides can be added to a fat replica,
   including flax seed polysaccharides and xanthan gum.
           The creation of a plant-based adipose replica requires stabilization of the oil in
   water emulsions. Typically animal adipose tissue contains ~95% fat, and is stabilized by
   the phospholipid bilayer and associated proteins. Adipose replicas described herein can
15 be created with up to 95% fat in some instances, with 80% fat under many conditions, or
   with lower amounts of fat (e.g., 50% or less) while mimicking the properties of animal
   fat. Achieving a high percent fat is controlled by the stabilization of the emulsion.
           The composition (e.g., fatty acid composition), cooking characteristics (e.g., fat
   release temperature or percent fat release), and physical properties (e.g., firmness) can be
?0 manipulated by controlling the type and amount of fat, the amount of protein, the type
   and amount of lecithin, the presence of additives, and the method of gelling.
           In some embodiments, the protein component comprises about 0.1%, 0.50%, 1%,
   2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%, 25%, or more of the fat replica by dry weight or total
   weight. In some embodiments, the protein component comprises about 0.1-50% or about
25 0.5-10% or more of the fat replica by dry weight or total weight. In some embodiments,
   the protein component is 0.5 to 3.5% or I to 3% of the fat replica by dry weight or total
   weight. In some embodiments, the protein component comprises a solution containing
   one or more isolated, purified proteins. The type of protein can affect the stability of the
   emulsion, RuBisCo and pea albumins allow for fat replicas to made a greater than 90%
                                                 52

   fat. Addition of polysaccharides including flax seed and xanthan gum aid in emulsifying
   the mixture, allowing for an increase in fat content.
            The type and amount of fat can be controlled by choosing the source of the fat and
   its lipid composition. In general, oils with higher amounts of saturated fatty acids are
 5 better able to be emulsified at lower protein concentrations, while oils with more
   unsaturated fatty acids require higher protein concentrations to be emulsified. Protein is
   required to stabilize the emulsion, and an increase in protein content increases the
   stability. If the amount of protein added is too little to emulsify the amount of fat, the
   mixture will separate into layers.
10          Lecithin also is a modulator of emulsion, and can either stabilize or disrupt the
   emulation depending on the amount of protein present and type of oil used. For example,
   lecithin may disrupt the protein/fat matrix to make a less stable emulsion, but can be
   added at low levels to modulate other physical properties. Emulsions made from oils with
   higher amounts of unsaturated fats can be de-stabilized by a high amount of lecithin
15 (1%), such that the emulsion does not solidify. Emulsions made from oils with higher
   amounts of saturated fats can solidify at high amounts of lecithin (1%), but are very soft.
            As described herein adipose replicas can be prepared that can range from very
   soft to very firm. The composition and amount of the fat controls the firmness of the
   replica. Firmer oils, which contain more long-chained saturated fats, make firmer gels.
?0 Oils that produce softer gels typically contain more unsaturated fatty acids or short
   chained saturated fatty acids. In general, the firmness of the gel increases as total percent
   fat increases, as long as the emulsion is held and does not separate. The amount of protein
   also contributes to the firmness of the replica. In general, an increase in protein
   concentration increases replica firmness. The amount of lecithin is a modulator of replica
25 firmness. Higher amounts of lecithin (1%) are much softer than lower amounts of lecithin
   (0.05%) when gels are formed with high percent protein (3%). When protein is decreased
   (1.8%), all gels are softer, and there is little difference in firmness between low level of
   lecithin (0.05%) and high (1%) if emulsion is held.
            Addition of polysaccharides to replicas including but not limited to xanthan gum
30 and flax seed paste can increase the firmness of adipose-replica gels.
                                                    53

            When an adipose replica is cooked, fat leaks from the structured replica as it is
   cooked. Often there is fat that remains in the cooked product; it is important to achieve
   the balance between fat released to aid in cooking and fat retained for texture and taste.
   The percent fat released (per total fat) can be determined by measuring the amount of fat
 5 released upon cooking to completion. Percent fat released is reported as the weight of fat
   released per the total fat of the replica. For example, the percent fat release of an adipose
   tissue replica described herein can be 0 to 10%, 10% to 20%, 20% to 30%, 30% to 40%,
   40% to 50%, 50% to 60%, 60% to 70%, 70% to 80%, 80% to 90%, or 90% to 100% upon
   cooking. Adipose replicas typically release 0- 90% fat under standard cooking
10 conditions. In comparison, beef adipose tissue typically releases 40-55% fat under
   equivalent conditions.
            While vegetable oils have set melting temperatures, the range of temperatures
   over which adipose replicas can be made to release fat is wide. Fat release temperature is
   the temperature at which fat is visibly released from the replica at the cooking surface. As
15 described herein, the fat release temperature of the adipose replica can be tailored based
   on the type and amount of fat, the amount of protein, the type and amount of lecithin, the
   presence of additives, the method of emulsification, and the method of gelling. The
   resulting adipose replicas can have a fat release temperature of between 23'C to 33'C,
   34'C to 44'C, 45'C to 550 C, 56'C to 66'C, 67'C to 77'C, 78'C to 88'C, 89'C to 99'C,
?0 100 C to l10 C, Il    0 C to 121'C, 122'C to 132'C, 133'Cto 143'C, 144'C to 154'C,
   155 0 C to 165'C, 166'C to 167'C, 168'C to 169'C, 170'C to 180'C, 181 0 C to 191 C,
   192'C to 202'C, 203'C to 213'C, 214'C to 224'C, 225'C to 235'C, 236'C to 246'C,
   247'C to 257'C, 258'C to 268'C, 269'C to 279'C, 280'C to 290'C, or 291'C to 301'C.
   Beef fat was measured to release fat at 100-150 C.
25          Emulsification also is a factor in controlling the temperature of fat release: Once
   fats are incorporated into a replica with protein, or protein and lecithin, the temperature at
   which the fat is released increases significantly above the temperature at which the fat
   alone melts.
            Fatty acid composition also is a factor in the fat release temperature and percent
30 fat release. Vegetable oils that contain a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids have
                                                  54

   low melting temperatures and many are liquid at room temperature. Vegetable oils that
   contain a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids have a higher melting temperature,
   and are solid at room temperature. Replicas with a greater amount of unsaturated fats
   have a higher temperature of fat leakage than the same replica made with more saturated
 5 fatty acids. Gels made from 75% oils with higher amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, a
   high protein content (3%), and minimal lecithin content (0.05%), where the mixture was
   emulsified by a hand-held homogenizer and gelled using the heat-cool method, can be
   heated to 200'C with little or no fat release. Replicas containing oils with more long
   chained saturated fats typically have more fat release at high protein content, but release
10 less percent total fat compared to replicas containing oils with more short chained fats
   and at low percent protein. Gels made from oils with a higher proportion of short-chained
   saturated fatty acids, high protein content (3%), and minimal lecithin content (0.05%),
   can be heated to 200'C with little fat release.
            The percent of fat release as an adipose replica is cooked is also is a function of
15 the amount of protein and the amount of lecithin. Typically, the adipose replica contains
   1-3% protein by mass. Increasing protein content leads to increasing temperatures of fat
   release, and reduces the fraction of fat released. Increasing the lecithin content to 1% can
   decrease the fat release temperature to 60-115'C, and increase the fraction of fat released
   (e.g., 25-30%). The source or composition of the lecithin used can modulate the amount
20 of fat release and the temperature threshold for fat release. Without being bound to a
   particular mechanism, it is thought that lecithin destabilizes the emulsion by disrupting
   the protein-protein interactions. In one embodiment, at a high protein concentration of
   30%, increasing the lecithin content to 10% decreased the fat release temperature to 55
   60'C, and increased the percent fat leaked to 60-65%.
25          The method of making the emulsion also is a factor in determining the amount of
   fat release. Emulsification forms a homogenous mixture of the fat held in a matrix of
   proteins and lecithin. Methods of emulsification can include high-pressure
   homogenization, sonication, or hand homogenization. The alternative methods result in
   characteristic differences in the size of the oil droplets in the emulsion, which influences
30 the stability of the resulting emulsions and the maximum fat concentration at which
                                                  55

   stable emulsions can be formed.
            The method of gelling the replica also is a factor in determining the amount of fat
   release. While adipose replicas can be formed without forming gels, gelation results in a
   firmer and more stable emulsion. Methods of gelling are described above, and can
 5 include, for example, the addition of a crosslinking enzyme such as a transglutaminase
   (TG), or subjecting the emulsion to a heat/cool cycle. For example, either treatment with
   TG or the heat/cool method can convert an emulsion, as described above, into a gel.
   Furthermore, gelled emulsions formed by crosslinking catalyzed by TG typically release
   fat at a temperature higher than that at which emulsions gelled by the heat/cool technique
10 do so. Gels formed by crosslinking with a TG also typically release less fat than do gels
   formed by the heat-cool technique.
            In some embodiments, a fat replica can be made with a protein content <1.5% and
   a minimal lecithin content (0.05%) and have a fat release temperature of 45-65'C, and a
   high amount of fat released (e.g., 70-90%). These gels are at the higher end of percent fat
15 released.
            In some embodiments, a fat replica can be made with a lower protein content
   (<1.5%) and a high lecithin (>1%), and have a lower fat release temperature (e.g., 30
   50'C, e.g., 30 to 45'C), and with an intermediate percent fat leaked (45-65%). Thus, in
   gels formed from oils with short-chained fatty acids or long-chained fatty acids at low
?0 protein concentrations, lecithin may play a role in stabilizing the emulsion.
            In some embodiments, >2% rubisco or pea albumin can be used to produce
   adipose replicas with greater than 70% fat. In some embodiments, gels formed with >
   3% isolated and purified protein can result in adipose replicas with greater than 70% fat.
            In some embodiments, adipose replicas made from oils with a higher proportion
25 of long-chained saturated fatty acids, a protein content of 3%, and a minimal lecithin
   content (0.05%), can release fat at a temperature similar to that at which beef fat does so
   (50-100 C), and can release a low to intermediate level of fat (15-450%).
            In some embodiments, an adipose replica with a higher protein concentration (>
   3%), and a lecithin content > 1% can have a fat release temperature of 50-70'C, and a
30 higher amount of fat release (50-80%). At high protein and low lecithin concentration,
                                                 56

   gels with higher saturated fatty acids typically leak about 10% more fat than do
   corresponding gels formed with unsaturated fats.
            In some embodiments, protease treatment of the protein constituents before gel
   formation can lead to an increase in fat release.
 5          In some embodiments, a adipose tissue replica matrix stabilized by crosslinking
   enzymes releases more fat than a adipose tissue replica matrix stabilized by heat/cool
   protein denaturation. In one embodiment, an adipose tissue matrix comprised of moong
   bean 8S protein and canola oil, or an equal mixture of coconut, cocoa, olive, and palm
   oils, retains more mass when formed upon heat/cool denaturation than when formed by
10 cross-linking with an enzyme. In one embodiment, an adipose tissue matrix formed by
   heat/cool denaturation of a preformed protein-oil emulsion containing Rubisco and cocoa
   butter, has a higher melting temperature than an adipose replica of similar composition
   stabilized by a cross-linking enzyme.
            In some embodiments, adipose tissue replicas constructed from 1.4% wt/v moong
15 bean 8S protein with 90% v/v canola oil and 0.45% wt/v soybean lecithin, can be
   homogenized in the presence of variable concentrations of sunflower oleosins.
   Concentration of oleosins can be varied from 1:10 to 1:106 molar ratio of
   oleosin:triglyceride. An increase in mass retention after cooking is observed as the
   concentration of oleosins in the adipose tissue replica increase.
?0          Firmness of an adipose tissue replica constructed as stabilized protein-fat
   emulsion can be modified by varying the concentration of the protein within adiopose
   tissue replica matrix. For example, a series of adipose tissue replicas formed with varying
   concentrations of Rubisco with 70-80% v/v sunflower oil, varied in firmness. Adipose
   tissue replicas with 0% and 0.18% (wt/vol) Rubisco were very soft, whereas replicas
25 formed with 1.6% (wt/vol) Rubisco were soft, and replicas formed with 1.9% (wt/vol)
   Rubisco were medium in firmness.
            In one embodiment, the firmness of adipose replica formed by stabilizing protein
   oil emulsion can be modified by varying amount of protein in the adipose replica. In one
   embodiment, adipose tissue replicas made from Rubisco and 70% sunflower oil are softer
                                                 57

   at lower concentrations, such as 1%, of RuBisCo than at higher concentrations of
   Rubisco, such as 3%, in adipose tissue replicas.
           In another aspect, the invention provides methods for making a fat replica. The
   fat can be isolated and homogenized. For example an organic solvent mixture can be
 5 used to help solubilize a lipid in a gel and then removed to provide the final gel. At this
   point, the lipid can be frozen, lyophilized, or stored. So in one aspect, the invention
   provides for a method for isolating and storing a lipid, which has been selected to have
   characteristics similar to animal fat. The lipid film or cake can then be hydrated. The
   hydration can utilize agitation or temperature changes. The hydration can occur in a
10 precursor solution to a gel. After hydration the lipid suspension can be sonicated,
   homogenized, high-pressure homogenized or extruded to further alter the properties of
   the lipid in the solution.
           In some embodiments, the fat replica is assembled to approximate the
   organization of adipose tissue in meat. In some embodiments some or all of the
15 components of the fat replica are suspended in a gel (e.g., proteinaceous gel). In other
   embodiments, the gel can be a hydrogel, an organogel, or a xerogel. In some
   embodiments, the gel can be thickened to a desired consistency using an agent based on
   polysaccharides or proteins. For example fecula, arrowroot, cornstarch, katakuri starch,
   potato starch, sago, tapioca, alginin, guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, collagen,
?0 egg whites, furcellaran, gelatin, agar, carrageenan, cellulose, methylcellulose,
   hydroxymethylcellulose, acadia gum, konjac, starch, pectin, amylopectin or proteins
   derived from legumes, grains, nuts, other seeds, leaves, algae, bacteria, of fungi can be
   used alone or in combination to thicken the gel, forming an architecture or structure for
   the consumable.
25         In some embodiments, the tensile strength of the fat replica mimics the tensile
   strength of adipose tissue. The tensile strength of the gelled emulsions can be increased
   by incorporation of fibers. The fibers may be derived from non-animal sources
   including, but not limited to, watermelon, jack fruit, squash, coconut, green hair algae,
   corn and/or cotton. In some embodiments, the fibers are derived from self
30 polymerization of proteins, e.g., oleosins and prolamins. In some embodiments the fibers
                                                  58

   are derived from electrospun or extruded proteins. The fibers may form a three
   dimensional mesh or strands wherein each fiber may be less than 1 mm in diameter.
           The adipose replica can be an emulsion comprising a solution of one or more
   proteins and one or more fats suspended therein as droplets. Slowly adding the oil phase
 5 to the aqueous phase can provide a more robust emulsion and prevents occasional failures
   to emulsify. Adding lecithin can, in some circumstances, destabilize a protein-stabilized
   emulsion, allowing for increased fat leakage when the replica is cooked. In some
   embodiments, the emulsion is stabilized by one or more cross-linking enzymes into a gel.
   In some embodiments, the emulsion is stabilized by a matrix formed by proteins induced
10 to gel by a heat-cool technique or a cold-set-gel technique. Heating a protein-stabilized
   emulsion can heat denature the proteins leading to an increase in the firmness of the
   adipose replica. Heating to a sufficient temperature also can reduce the viability of
   natural microflora by at least 100x. In some embodiments, the emulsion is stabilized by
   gelled protein matrix formed by a combination of one or more protein cross-linking
15 enzymes and a heat/cool technique or a cold-set gel technique. After the emulsion has
   sufficiently cooled, but before gelling is complete, one or more optional ingredients can
   be added, such as a heme-containing protein (e.g., up to about 0.4% such as 0.15, 0.2.,
   0.25, 0.3, or 0.4%) to give the adipose a more natural looking pink color and/or one of
   more flavor compounds such as amino acids, sugars, thiamine, or phospholipids to
?o provide an improved flavor to the final product.
           The one or more proteins in solution can comprise isolated and purified proteins,
   e.g. a purified pea albumin enriched fraction, a purified pea globulin enriched fraction, a
   purified Moong bean 8S globulin enriched fraction, and/or a Rubisco enriched fraction.
   In other embodiments, the one or more fats are derived from plant-derived oils (a rice
25 bran oil or canola oil). See, e.g., Section III C. In some cases the composition comprises
   a cross-linking enzyme such as a transglutaminase, lysyl oxidase, or other amine oxidase.
   Thus, in some embodiments, an adipose tissue replica can be made by isolating and
   purifying one or more proteins; preparing a solution comprising one or more proteins;
   emulsifying one or more fats in the solution; and stabilizing the solution into a gelled
30 emulsification with one or more cross-linking reagents.
                                                   59

            In some embodiments, the fat replica is a high fat emulsion comprising a protein
   solution of purified pea albumin emulsified with 40-80% rice bran oil, stabilized with
   0.5-5% (wt/vol) transglutaminase into a gel.
            In some embodiments, the fat replica is a high fat emulsion comprising a protein
 5 solution of isolated moong bean 8S globulin emulsified with 40-80% rice bran oil or 40
   80% canola oil, stabilized with 0.5-5% (wt/vol) transglutaminase into a gel.
            The fat can be isolated from plant tissues and emulsified. The emulsification can
   utilize high-speed blending, homogenization, high pressure homogenization, sonication,
   shearing, agitation or temperature changes. The lipid suspension can be sonicated or
10 extruded to further alter the properties of the lipid in the solution. At this point, in some
   embodiments other components of the consumable are added to the solution followed by
   a gelling agent. In some embodiments crosslinking agents (e.g. transglutaminase or lysyl
   oxidase) are added to bind the components of the consumable. In other embodiments the
   gelling agent is added and the lipid/gel suspension is later combined with additional
15 components of the consumable.
   CONTROL OF MELTING POINT BY CONTROL OF FAT COMPOSITION
            The process of cooking meat is integral to the experience of using and enjoying
   meat. One important property of meat is that as the meat is heated, fats are released from
?0 the meat, which lubricates the cooking surface and increases heat transfer and is a
   component of the visual, aural and olfactory experience of cooking meat. The amount of
   fat that is released rather than retained during cooking varies with cooking temperature
   and contributes to the visual, aural and olfactory experience of cooking meat.
            The composition and ratio of fatty acids in triglycerides and phospholipids, along
25 with the ratio of phospholipid headgroups, contribute to the generation of distinct flavor
   profiles of cooked meat. For example, increased levels of phosphatidylcholine and
   phosphatidylethanolamine in fat provide a more intense beef flavor. As discussed above,
   the flavor of meat replicas can be modified by varying the ratios and type of different
   oils, and phospholipids that comprise the meat replica. For example, the flavor of the
30 cooked meat replica can be controlled by varying the amount of phospholipids, sterols
                                                  60

   and lipids (e.g., 0.2-1% wt/wt). In one embodiment, the flavor of the cooked meat replica
   can be controlled by varying the ratio of different phospholipid headgroups.
           In some embodiments, the phospholipids comprise a plurality of amphipathic
   molecules comprising fatty acids, glycerol and polar groups. See, e.g., Section III C for
 5 examples of fatty acids, phospholipids, polar groups, and sterols associated with
   phospholipids. See also section III C for examples of useful plant oils.
           In different cuts of meat, the fat has different properties, ranging from the
   structurally important nature of fat in bacon to the soft melting behavior of the marbling
   fat in Wagyu beef.
10         By controlling the melting point of adipose tissue replicas in the consumables, it
   is possible to replicate the cooking experience of different meat types. For example,
   adipose tissue replicas created from fats with a melting point of 23'C to 27'C can have
   melting points analogous to adipose tissue from wagyu beef; adipose tissue replicas
   created from fats with a melting point of 35'C to 40'C can have melting points analogous
15 to adipose tissue from regular ground beef; and adipose tissue replicas created from fats
   with a melting point of 36'C to 45'C can have melting points analogous to adipose tissue
   from bacon. Adipose tissue replicas can be created and incorporated into consumables
   such that a ratio of fat which is released and the ratio of fat which is retained by adipose
   tissue replica during cooking is similar to the fat properties of meat, e.g. from ground
?0 beef.
           In some embodiments, the fat release temperature of a fat replicas can be
   controlled by mixing different ratios of vegetable oils containing triacylglycerides and
   phospholipids (e.g., lecithin). The melting point of fats is governed by the chemical
   composition of fatty acids. In general, fats comprising saturated fatty acids (e.g., C 10:0,
25 C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0) are solid at refrigeration temperatures (e.g.,
   about 1C to about 5'C and at room temperature (e.g., about 20'C to 25'C). By
   controlling the fat release temperature upon cooking in a adipose tissue replica, the
   firmness of a adipose tissue replica during refrigeration (e.g., about 1.5'C to about 4C)
   and at ambient temperature (e.g., about 20'C to 25C) can be controlled. Fats comprising
30 monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:1 or C18:1) are generally solid at refrigeration
                                                  61

   temperatures and liquid at room temperatures. Fats comprising polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (e.g., C18:2, C18:3, C20:5, or C22:6) are generally liquid at refrigeration
   temperatures and at room temperatures. For example, virgin coconut oil melts at about
   24'C while hydrogenated coconut oil melts at 36-40'C.
 5         For example, adipose tissue replicas containing triglycerides and phospholipids
   that are liquid at room temperature (about 20'C to 25C) will be softer than adipose
   tissue replicas containing triglycerides and phospholipids that are solid at refrigeration
   temperatures.
           Adipose tissue replicas can contain oils from a single or multiple sources that are
10 liquid at both refrigeration and ambient room temperatures (e.g., canola oil, sunflower
   oil, and/or hazelnut oil). In one embodiment, a adipose tissue replica contains oils from
   single or multiple sources that are solid at refrigeration temperature, but liquid at room
   temperature (e.g., olive oil, palm oil, and/or rice brain oil). In one embodiment, a adipose
   tissue replica contains oils from single or multiple sources that are solid at room
15 temperature but liquid at mouth-temperatures (about 37C) (e.g., palm kernel oil, coconut
   oil, and/or cocoa butter. In one embodiment, a adipose tissue replica contains oils from
   single or multiple sources that are solid at mouth temperature (about 37C) (e.g., oil from
   mango butter).
           In one embodiment, a adipose tissue replica includes triglycerides and
?0 phospholipids with a high ratio of saturated fatty acids, and is firmer than a adipose tissue
   replica containing a higher ratio of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated triglycerides
   and lipids. For example, a adipose tissue replica containing sunflower oil is softer than a
   adipose tissue replica containing cocoa butter. Adipose tissue replicas can be formed
   with 0%, 0.18%, 1.6%, or 2.4% wt/v Rubisco with 70%, 80%, or 90% v/v sunflower or
25 cocoa butter. Each adipose tissue replica that contained cocoa butter was firmer than the
   replicas that were formed with sunflower oil.
           In one embodiment, a adipose tissue replica made as a stable emulsion of moong
   bean 8S protein with sunflower oil is softer than a adipose tissue replica made as a stable

   firmer than the replicas that were formed with sunflower oil.
           In one embodiment, a adipose tissue replica made as a stable emulsion of moong
   bean 8S protein with canola oil is softer than a adipose tissue replica made as a stable
 5 emulsion of moong bean 8S protein with an equal mixture of coconut, cocoa, olive, and
   palm oils. Adipose tissue replicas can be formed with 1.4% wt/v moong bean 8S protein
   with 50%, 70%, or 90% v/v sunflower or a mixture of oils. Each adipose tissue replica
   that contained a mixture of oils was firmer than the replicas that were formed with
   sunflower oil.
10         In one embodiment, an adipose tissue replica made as a stable emulsion of soy
   proteins with sunflower oil is softer than a adipose tissue replica made as a stable

15 replicas that were formed with sunflower oil.
           In some embodiments, the adipose tissue replicas comprising 0%, 0.18%, 1.6%,
   and 2.4% wt/v Rubisco with 70%, 80%, and 90% v/v cocoa butter are solid at room
   temperature but melt at about mouth temperature. In some embodiments, the adipose
   tissue replicas comprising 0.6%, 1.6%, and 2.6% wt/v soy with 50%, 70%, 80%, and
?0 90% v/v cocoa butter are solid at room temperature but melt at about mouth temperature.
   In some embodiments, the adipose tissue replicas comprising 1.4% wt/v moong bean 8S
   protein with 50%, 70%, and 90% v/v of an equal mixture of coconut, cocoa, olive, and
   palm oil is solid at room temperature but melts at about mouth temperature. In one
   embodiment, the melting temperature of adipose tissue replicas will be similar to beef fat.
25 In some embodiments the fat replicas comprise oils with a 1:1 ratio of saturated to
   unsaturated fatty acids. In some embodiments, the adipose tissue replica contains equal
   amounts of cocoa and mango butters. In some embodiments, the adipose tissue replica
   contains equal amounts of coconut oil, cocoa butter, olive oil and palm oil.
           In one embodiment, a adipose tissue replica that comprises triglycerides and
30 phospholipids will contain a ratio of fatty acids similar to that found in beef (C 14:0 0-5 %

   the adipose tissue replica may comprise equal proportions of olive oil and rice brain oil.
 5         In one embodiment, the melting temperature of adipose tissue replicas will be
   similar to Wagyu beef fat. In some embodiments the fat replicas comprise oils with a 1:2

   I. CONNECTIVE TISSUE REPLICA
           Animal connective tissue provides key textural features that are an important
   component of the experience of eating meat. Accordingly, the present invention provides
   a composition derived from non-animal sources which recapitulates key features of
15 animal connective tissue. The present invention additionally provides a meat substitute
   product that comprises a composition derived from non-animal sources, which
   recapitulates important textural and visual features of animal connective tissue. Such
   compositions will be labeled herein as "connective tissue replicas". In some
   embodiments, the connective tissue replica and/or meat substitute product comprising the
?0 connective tissue replica are partially derived from animal sources.
           Animal connective tissue can generally be divided into fascia-type and cartilage
   type tissue. Fascia-type tissue is highly fibrous, resistant against extension (has high
   elastic modulus), and has a high protein content, a moderate water content (ca. 50%), and
   low-to-no fat and polysaccharide content. Accordingly, the present invention provides a
25 connective tissue replica that recapitulates key features of fascia type tissue. In some
   embodiments, the connective tissue replica comprises about 50% protein by total weight,
   about 50% by liquid weight, and has a low fat and polysaccharide component.
           The fibrous nature of fascia type connective tissue is largely comprised of
   collagen fibers. Collagen fibers are observed to be cord or tape shaped species, 1-20
30 microns wide. These fibers consist of closely packed thin collagen fibrils 30 to 100
                                                  64

   nanometers thick. These fibrils also associate into elastic and reticular fibrous networks
   with individual fibers that may be 200 nanometers thick.
            In one embodiment, the fascia-type connective tissue replica consists of a fibrous
   or fibrous-like structure which can consist of proteins. In some embodiments, the protein
 5 content is derived from non-animal source (e.g., a plant source, algae, bacteria, or fungi,
   see e.g., Sections IIIA and B). In some embodiments, the isolated proteins account for
   50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% or more of the protein content by weight. In some
   embodiments, multiple isolated proteins are isolated and purified separately and account
   for the total protein content.
10          In fascia-type connective tissue, the prolamin family of proteins, individually or
   combinations thereof, demonstrates suitability for the protein component because they
   are highly abundant, similar in global amino acid composition to collagen (high fraction
   of proline and alanine), and amenable to processing into films. In some embodiments, the
   prolamin family proteins are selected from the group consisting of zein (found in corn),
15 hordein from barley, gliadin from wheat, secalin, extensins from rye, kafirin from
   sorghum, or avenin from oats. In some embodiments, the one or more isolated and
   purified proteins is zein. In some embodiments, other proteins can be used to supplement
   prolamins in order to achieve targets specifications for physicochemical and nutritional
   properties. See, the list in Sections III A and B, including any major seed storage
?o proteins, animal-derived or recombinant collagen, or extensins (hydroxyproline-rich
   glycoproteins abundant in cell walls e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana,monomers of which are
   "collagen-like" rod-like flexible molecules).
            The proteins can be freeze-dried and milled and combined with one or more other
   ingredients (e.g., wheat gluten, fiber such as bamboo fiber, or soy protein isolate).
25          The fibrous or fibrous-like structures can be formed by extrusion. In some
   embodiments extrusion are conducted using Leistritz Nano- 16 twin-screw co-rotating
   extruder (American Leistritz Extruder Corp. USA, Sommerville, NJ). Active heating and
   cooling of the barrel section is used to optimize the mechanical properties, extent of
   puffing and water content of fibers. For example, water content can be adjusted to about
30 50% to make a hard connective tissue replica. Protein feed and liquid are added
                                                  65

   separately: protein is feed by a volumetric plunger feeder, and liquid is added into the
   barrel through a high pressure liquid injection system. In some examples, extrusion
   parameters were: screw speed 200 rpm, product temperature at the die of 120'C, feed rate
   of 2.3 g/min, and water-flow rate of 0.7 g/min. Product temperature at the die during
 5 extrusion is measured by a thermocouple.
           The fibrous or fibrous-like structures can be formed by extrusion through filament
   and multi-filament dies to produce fibrous structures. In some embodiments, dies
   incorporating multiple different orifice sizes in the range 10-300 microns can be used to
   create mixed fibrous tissue replicas with precise control over dimensions and
10 compositions of fibers. Fibers of different sizes can be incorporated into the
   compositions to control the properties of the compositions.
           Electrospinning can be used to create fibers in the <1-10 micron range. In some
   embodiments, electrospinning is used to create fibers in the <1-10 micron diameter
   range. For example, a concentrated solution of moong bean globulin (140 mg/ml)
15 containing 400 mM sodium chloride can be mixed with solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) or
   poly(ethylene oxide) (9% w/v) to obtain mixed solutions with 22.5 mg/ml moong bean
   globulin and 6.75% w/v of the respective polymer. The resulting solution is slowly (for
   example, at 3 gl/min) pumped, using a syringe pump, from a 5 ml syringe through a
   Teflon tube and a blunted 21gauge needle. The needle is connected to a positive terminal
?0 of a high voltage supply (for example, Spellman CZE 30 kV) and fixed 20-30 cm from a
   collection electrode. Collection electrode is an aluminum drum (ca. 12 cm long, 5 cm in
   diameter) that is wrapped in aluminum foil. The drum is attached to a spindle that is
   rotated by an IKA RW20 motor at about 600 rpm. The spindle is connected to a ground
   terminal of the high voltage supply. Portein/polymer fiber accumulate on foil and, after
25 electrospinning is completed, are removed from foil and added to tissue replicas.
           The dimension and composition of the fibers produced by the methods of the
   invention has an effect upon the taste, texture, and mechanical properties of the tissue
   replicas. Tissues comprising between 1 and 50% of the fibers in the <1-10 micron range,
   and between 10 and 50% of fibers in the 10-300 micron range most closely approach
30 animal connective tissues in terms of taste, mouthfeel and mechanical properties.
                                                 66

            Cartilage-type tissue is macroscopically homogenous, resistant against
   compression, has higher water content (up to 80%), lower protein (collagen) content, and
   higher polysaccharide (proteoglycans) contents (ca. 10% each). Compositionally,
   cartilage-type connective tissue replicas are similar to fascia-type tissue replicas with the
 5 relative ratios of each adjusted to more closely mimic 'meat' connective tissue. During
   extrusion, water content can be adjusted to about 60% to make a soft connective tissue
   replica.
            Methods for forming cartilage-type connective tissue are similar to those for
   fascia-type connective tissue, but methods that produce isotropic non-fibrous gels are
10 preferred.
            A connective tissue replica can be made by isolating and purifying one or more
   proteins; and precipitating the one or more proteins, wherein the precipitating results in
   the one or more proteins forming physical structures approximating the physical
   organization of connective tissue. The precipitating can comprise solubilizing the one or
15 more proteins in a first solution; and extruding the first solution into a second solution,
   wherein the one or more proteins is insoluble in the second solution, wherein the
   extruding induces precipitation of the one or more proteins.
            In some embodiments some or all of the components of the consumable are
?0 suspended in a gel (e.g., a proteinacious gel). In various embodiments the gel can be a
   hydrogel, an organogel, or a xerogel. The gel can be thickened using an agent based on
   polysaccharides or proteins. For example fecula, arrowroot, cornstarch, katakuri starch,
   potato starch, sago, tapioca, alginin, guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, collagen,
   egg whites, furcellaran, gelatin, agar, carrageenan, cellulose, methylcellulose,
25 hydroxymethylcellulose, acadia gum, konjac, starch, pectin, amylopectin or proteins
   derived from legumes, grains, nuts, other seeds, leaves, algae, bacteria, of fungi can be
   used alone or in combination to thicken the gel, forming an architecture or structure for
   the consumable. Enzymes that catalyze reactions leading to covalent crosslinks between
   proteins can also be used alone or in combination to form an architecture or structure for
30 the consumable. For example transglutaminase, tyrosinases, lysyl oxidases, or other
                                                 67

   amine oxidases (e.g. Pichiapastorislysyl oxidase (PPLO)) can be used alone or in
   combination to form an architecture or structure for the consumable by crosslinking the
   component proteins. In some embodiments, multiple gels with different components are
   combined to form the consumable. For example a gel containing a plant-derived protein
 5 can be associated with a gel containing a plant-derived fat. In some embodiments fibers
   or strings of proteins are oriented parallel to one another and then held in place by the
   application of a gel containing plant based fats.
           The compositions of the invention can be puffed or expanded by heating, such as
   frying, baking, microwave heating, heating in a forced air system, heating in an air
10 tunnel, and the like, according to methods well known in the art.
           In some embodiments multiple gels with different components are combined to
   form the consumable. For example a gel containing a plant-derived protein can be
   associated with a gel containing a plant-derived fat. In some embodiments fibers or
   strings of proteins are oriented parallel to one another and then held in place by the
15 application of a gel containing plant based fats.
   J. OMISSIONS FROM THE COMPOSITIONS
           Because the consumable can be put together from defined ingredients, which may
   themselves be isolated and purified, it is possible to produce consumables that do not
?0 contain certain components. This, in some cases, allows for the production of
   consumables that are lacking ingredients that may be not desirable to consumers (e.g.,
   proteins that some humans are allergic to can be omitted or additives). In some
   embodiments, the consumable contains no animal products. In some embodiments the
   consumable contains no or less than 1% wheat gluten. In some embodiments the

 5 contains less than 1%insoluble carbohydrates. In some embodiments the consumable
   contains no artificial color. In some embodiments the consumable contains no artificial
   flavorings.
           In some embodiments the consumable contains one or more of the following
   characteristics: no animal products; no methylcellulose; no carrageenan; no Konjac flour;
10 no gum arabic; less than 1% wheat gluten; no wheat gluten; no tofu; about 5%
   carbohydrates; less than 5% cellulose; less than 5% insoluble carbohydrates; less than 1%
   insoluble carbohydrates; no edible colorants such as caramel color, paprika, cinnamon,
   beet color, carrot oil, tomato lycopene extract, raspberry powder, carmine, cochineal
   extract, annatto, turmeric, saffron, F.D&C Red No.3, Yellow number 5, Yellow No 6.,

   and/or E129 (red shade); and/or no artificial flavorings. In some embodiments the
   consumable contains no soy protein isolate. In other embodiments, the consumable
   contains no soy protein or protein concentrate.
           In some embodiments, the muscle tissue replica additionally contains less than
?0 10%, less than 5%, less than 1%, or less than 0.10% wheat gluten. In some embodiments,
   the muscle tissue replica contains no wheat gluten.
   IV. Combinations of the components
           A. MEAT REPLICAS
25         A meat substitute product (alternatively a meat replica) can comprise
   compositions described herein. For example a meat replica can comprise a muscle
   replica; a fat tissue replica; and a connective tissue replica (or a sub-combination thereof).
   The muscle replica, adipose tissue replica, and/or connective tissue replica can be
   assembled in a manner that approximates the physical organization of meat. In some
                                                  69

   embodiments, a binding agent such as a coacervate is used to help binding the replicas to
   each other.
            The percentage of different components may also be controlled. For example
   non-animal-based substitutes for muscle, adipose tissue, connective tissue, and blood
 5 components can be combined in different ratios and physical organizations to best
   approximate the look and feel of meat. The various components can be arranged to
   insure consistency between bites of the consumable. The components can be arranged to
   insure that no waste is generated from the consumable. For example, while a traditional
   cut of meat may have portions that are not typically eaten, a meat replicate can improve
10 upon meat by not including these inedible portions (e.g, bone, cartilage, connective
   tissue, or other materials commonly referred to as gristle). Such an improvement allows
   for all of the product made or shipped to be consumed, which cuts down on waste and
   shipping costs. Alternatively, a meat replica may include inedible portions to mimic the
   experience of meat consumption. Such portions can include bone, cartilage, connective
15 tissue, or other materials commonly referred to as gristle, or materials included
   simulating these components. In some embodiments the consumable may contain
   simulated inedible portions of meat products which are designed to serve secondary
   functions. For example a simulated bone can be designed to disperse heat during
   cooking, making the cooking of the consumable faster or more uniform than meat. In
?0 other embodiments a simulated bone may also serve to keep the consumable at a constant
   temperature during shipping. In other embodiments, the simulated inedible portions may
   be biodegradable (e.g., a biodegradable plastic).
            In some embodiments, a meat substitute composition comprises between 10-30%
   protein, between 5-80% water, and between 5-70% fat, wherein the composition includes
25 one or more isolated and purified proteins. Such a meat substitute can include no animal
   protein. In some embodiments, the meat substitute compositions comprise a
   transglutaminase.
            In some embodiments, a meat substitute product includes a muscle replica, an
   adipose tissue replica, and connective tissue replica, where the muscle replica accounts
30 for 40-90% of the product by weight, the adipose tissue replica accounts for 1-60% of the
                                                70

   product by weight, and the connective tissue replica accounts for 1-30% of the product by
   weight.
           In some embodiments, the meat substitute product comprises 60-90% water; 5
   30% protein content; and 1-20% of a fat; wherein the protein content comprises one or
 5 more isolated and purified plant proteins.
           In some embodiments the consumable contains components to replicate the
   components of meat. The main component of meat is typically skeletal muscle. Skeletal
   muscle typically consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent
   intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent carbohydrates and 2.3 percent other soluble non-protein
10 substances. These include organic acids, sulfur compounds, nitrogenous compounds,
   such as amino acids and nucleotides, and inorganic substances such as minerals.
   Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention provide for replicating
   approximations of this composition for the consumable. For example, in some
   embodiments, the consumable is a plant-based meat replica comprising roughly 75%
15 water, 19% protein, 2.5% fat, 1.2% carbohydrates; and 2.3 percent other soluble non
   protein substances. In some embodiments the consumable is a plant-based meat replica
   comprising between 60-90% water, 10-30% protein, 1-20% fat, 0.1-50% carbohydrates;
   and 1-10 percent other soluble non-protein substances. In some embodiments the
   consumable is a plant-based meat replica comprising between 60-90% water, 5-10%
?0 protein, 1-20% fat, 0. 1-5 % carbohydrates; and 1-10 percent other soluble non-protein
   substances. In some embodiments the consumable is a plant-based meat replica
   comprising between 0-50% water, 5-30% protein, 20-80%% fat, 0.1-5% carbohydrates;
   and 1-10 percent other soluble non-protein substances.
           In some embodiments, a meat replica contains between 0.01% and 50% by weight
25 of a heme containing protein. In some embodiments, the replica contains between 0.01%
   and 5% by weight of leghemoglobin. Some meat also contains myoglobin, a heme
   containing protein, which accounts for most of the red color and iron content of some
   meat. It is understood that these percentages can vary in meat and the meat replicas can
   be produced to approximate the natural variation in meat. In embodiments that include a
30 heme-containing protein and optional flavors, k-carrageenan can be used absorb some of
                                                71

   the liquid contributed from the flavor and heme solution so the ground tissue is not
   excessively wet. During addition of flavor heme mix solution and the k-carrageenan
   powder are distributed evenly over the tissue mixture to ensure homogeneity in the final
   ground product.
 5          It will be appreciated that when proteins are supplied as a solution, water removal
   techniques such as freeze-drying or spray drying can optionally be used to concentrate
   the protein. The proteins may then be reconstituted in an amount of liquid that prevents
   the ground tissue from being too moist.
            Additionally, in some instances, the present invention provides for improved meat
10 replicas, which comprise these components in unnatural percentages. The concentration
   of heme containing protein is an important determinant of meat flavor and aroma. Thus
   for example a meat replica could have a higher heme protein content than typical beef.
   For example a meat replica can be produced with a higher than typical average fat
   content. The percentages of these components may also be altered to increase other
15 desirable properties.
            In some instances a meat replica is designed so that, when cooked, the
   percentages of components are similar to cooked meat. So, in some embodiments, the
   uncooked consumable has different percentages of components than uncooked meat, but
   when cooked, the consumable is similar to cooked meat. For example, a meat replica
?o may be made with a higher than typical water content for raw meat, but when cooked in a
   microwave, the resulting product has non-starch polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans,
   cellulose, and many other plant components such as resistant starch, resistant dextrins,
   inulin, lignin, waxes, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans, and oligosaccharide percentages of
   components similar to meat cooked over a fire.
25          In some embodiments, the consumable is a meat replica with a lower that typical
   water content for meat. In some embodiments the inventions provides for methods for
   hydrating a meat replica to cause the meat replica to have a water content similar to meat.
   For example a meat replica with a water content that would be low for meat, for example
   1%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% water, can be hydrated to roughly 75% water. Once
30 hydrated, in some embodiments, the meat replica is then cooked for human consumption.
                                                  72

           The consumable can have a protein component. In some embodiments the protein
   content of the consumable is 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40%. In some embodiments the protein
   content of the consumable is similar to meat. In some embodiments the protein content
   in the consumable is greater than that of meat. In some embodiments the consumable has
 5 less protein than meat.
           The protein in the consumable can come from a variety or combination of
   sources. Non-animal sources can provide some or all of the protein in the consumable.
   Non-animal sources can include vegetables, non food biomass such as carrot tops and
   Miscanthus, seaweed, fruits, nuts, grains, algae, bacteria, or fungi. See, e.g, Sections III
10 A and B. The protein can be isolated or concentrated from one or more of these sources.
   In some embodiments the consumable is a meat replica comprising protein only obtained
   from non-animal sources.
           In some embodiments protein is formed into asymmetric fibers for incorporation
   into the consumable. In some embodiments these fibers replicate muscle fibers. In some
15 embodiments the protein are spun fibers. Accordingly, the present invention provides for
   methods for producing asymmetric or spun protein fibers. In some embodiments the
   consumable contains a protein or proteins that have all of the amino acids found in
   proteins that are essential for human nutrition. In some embodiments the proteins added
   to the consumable are supplemented with amino acids.
?0         The physical organization can be a determinant of the response of the meat
   substitute to cooking. For example, the flavor of meat is modified by the size of the
   particles. Ground meat that has been reduced to a paste provides different flavors than
   more crudely ground beef upon cooking. The ability to control the relative size and
   orientation of individual tissue replicas enables the flavor and aroma profile of
25 consumables to be modified during cooking. For example, muscle tissue replicas and
   adipose tissue replicas provide different flavor profiles when cooked independently or
   when mixed. Further changes in the flavor profile are observed based on the method by
   which the different tissue replicas are mingled.
           The physical organization of the meat substitute product can be manipulated by
30 controlling the localization, organization, assembly, or orientation of the muscle, fat,
                                                 73

   and/or connective tissue replicas described herein. In some embodiments the product is
   designed in such a way that the replicas described herein are associated with one another
   as in meat. In some embodiments the consumable is designed so that after cooking the
   replicas described herein are associated with one another as in cooked meat.
 5          Characteristic flavor and fragrance components of meat are mostly produced
   during the cooking process by chemical reactions, the substrates for which are amino
   acids, fats and sugars which are found in plants as well as meat. Therefore in some
   embodiments the consumable is tested for similarity to meat during or after cooking. In
   some embodiments human ratings, human evaluation, olfactometer readings, or GCMS
10 measurements, or combinations thereof, are used to create an olfactory map of cooked
   meat. Similarly, an olfactory map of the consumable, for instance a meat replica, can be
   created. These maps can be compared to assess how similar the cooked consumable it so
   meat. In some embodiments the olfactory map of the consumable during or after cooking
   is similar to or indistinguishable from that of cooked or cooking meat. In some
15 embodiments the differences are sufficiently small as to be below the detection threshold
   of human perception.
            In some embodiments the individual tissue replicas are assembled in layers,
   sheets, blocks and strings in defined positions and orientations.
            In some embodiments, the replicas are combined in the process of passing
?0 through the plates of a meat grinder with the holes set at less than 1/2 inch (e.g., at 1/4
   inch). The grinder provides multiple functions of reducing the particle size, providing
   additional mixing or working, and forming the material into cylindrical portions like what
   is typically done for ground beef. During the assembly, grinding, and forming, it is
   important to keep the replica tissues cold (e.g., 4 - 15'C) to control microbial growth,
25 limit flavor reactions, and also to maintain the adipose in a solid state so discrete pieces
   of adipose will be maintained through the grinding process.
            Prior to grinding, the replica tissues are usually broken down in some manner to a
   defined particle size. For example, in some embodiments, the individual tissue replicas
   can be formed into small pieces less than 1 cm in diameter or less than 5 mm in diameter
30 before combination with the other tissue replicas. Adipose tissue can be crumbled into
                                                   74

   about 3 - 7 mm particles. This is important to both the appearance of the final material
   and the behavior of fat leakage during cooking. This size range allows for a natural
   appearance of adipose flecks in the final raw product. If the adipose tissues are too small
   (e.g., less than 2 mm), there will be an insufficient amount of fat leaked from the product
 5 when cooked.
            Soft connective tissue replicas can be broken down into pieces of about 1 - 3 mm
   in length with ragged edges. If the pieces are too large (e.g., greater than about 4 mm),
   the texture of the final product can be too beady.
            Sticky tissue or noodles tissue replicas, composed of amorphous or long noodle
10 like tissue replica pieces, respectively, and raw tissue replicas can be manually broken
   down into pieces about 1 - 3 cm in diameter. Achieving particles in this size range allows
   for adequate mixing and suitable homogeneity in the final ground material.
            In some embodiments, hard connective tissue replicas can be chopped to three
   levels, (e.g., coarse, intermediate, and fine). Chopping to three levels provides a greater
15 amount of heterogeneity than a single step chopping process, and makes the mouthfeel of
   the final product more similar to ground beef.
            In formulations containing gluten an additional function of the food grinder is to
   work the gluten and develop a gluten network of aligned gluten molecules. For gluten
   containing formulations it is important to minimize interaction of the adipose with the
?0 gluten network. This is done by prechilling the adipose replicas and ground tissue
   replicas prior to combining and also by minimizing the amount of manipulation after the
   adipose is added. Overworking of adipose replicas into the gluten will break down or
   "shorten" the gluten network.
            Finally for gluten containing formulations the patties are allowed to rest at room
25 temperature for 30 min or overnight at 4C prior to cooking. This allows time for the
   gluten network to relax, giving an overall better texture.
            In some embodiments, the connective tissue replica is incorporated into the
   protein solution before formation of the muscle tissue replica.
            In some embodiments, the connective tissue replica is directly incorporated into
30 the emulsion before formation of the adipose tissue replica.
                                                  75

           In some embodiments, the adipose tissue replica is added to the muscle tissue
   replica in strands and sheets to replicate the effect of "marbling," or streaky bacon.
           Mixed meat tissue replicas can increase the sense of flavors, such flavors
   including, but not limited to, multiple aromatic compounds associated with fruity/grean
 5 bean/metallic, nutty/green, peanut butter/musty, raw potato/roasted/earthy, vinegary,
   spicy/caramel/almond, creamy, sweet, fruity/stale beer,
   musty/nutty/coumarin/licorice/walnut/bread, coconut/woody/sweet,
   penetrating/sickening, minty, or toasty caramel aromas.
           In some embodiments the mixed meat replicas increase the presence of volatile
10 odorants, such as 2-pentyl-furan; 4-methylthiazole; ethyl pyrazine,; 2,3
   dimethylpyrazine, acetic acid; 5-methyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde; butyrolactone; 2,5
   dimethyl-3-(3-methyl butyl) pyrazine; 2-cyclopentene-1-one, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl; 3
   acetyl-lh-pyrolline; pantolactone; 1-methyl 1(H)-pyrrole-2-2carboxaldehyde,;
   caprolactam; 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-one.          in some
15 embodiments, the undesired flavors including but not limited to gasoline-like, petroleum,
   sour/putrid/fish-like, bland/woody/yogurt, fatty/honey/citrus, pungent/sweet/caramelic
   and nutty/burnt green aromas, form only in individual tissue replicas, but do not
   accumulate in mixed meat replicas. In some embodiments, the individual tissue replicas
   increase the presence of volatile odorants including but not limited to nonane, 2,6
?0 dimethyl, 3-methyl 3-hexene,; pyridine; acetoin; octanal; 1-hydroxy-2-propanone; and/or
   ethenyl pyrazine. In some embodiments the levels to which all of the above compounds
   accumulate during cooking depend on the sizes of tissue replica units and how they are
   mixed (coarse, fine, or blended).
           In some embodiments, the mixed meat tissue replicas increase the sense of flavors
25 including but not limited to, multiple aromatic compounds associated with fruity/grean

   levels to which all of the above compounds accumulate during cooking depend on the
   sizes of tissue units and how they are mixed (coarse, fine, or blended).
           The production of volatile odorants can be enhanced when the adipose, muscle
25 and connective tissue replicas are contacting one another. In some embodiments, the
   production of volatile odorants is enhanced when the adipose, muscle and connective
   tissues are intimately mixed with a mean size of the individual tissue replicas of 5 mm. In
   some embodiments, the production of volatile odorants is enhanced when the fat, muscle
   and connective tissues are intimately mixed with mean size of the individual tissue
30 replicas of 2 mm. In some embodiments, said production of volatile odorants is enhanced
                                                 77

   when the fat, muscle and connective tissue replicas are intimately mixed with mean size
   of the individual tissue replicas of 1 mm.
            In some embodiments, the meat substitute is optimized for particular cooking
   methods (optimized for cooking in a microwave oven, or optimized for cooking in a
 5 stew).
            In some embodiments, the meat substitute is optimized for dehydration.
            In some embodiments, said meat substitute is optimized for fast rehydration upon
   exposure of the dehydrated meat replica to water.
            In some embodiments, said meat substitute is optimized for use as emergency,
10 camping or astronaut food.
            The methods described herein can be used to provide a meat replica with defined
   cooking characteristics to allow the production of meat replicas that are optimized for
   particular cooking techniques. For example, stews require slow cooking to gelatinize the
   connective tissue in the meat, whereas meat replicas can be designed wherein the
15 connective tissue replica is more easily gelatinized thus allowing stews to be prepared
   quickly.
   B. INDICATORS OF COOKING MEAT
            The consumable can include compositions which can indicate that the consumable
?0 is cooking or has cooked. The release of odorants upon cooking is an important aspect of
   meat consumption. In some embodiments, the consumable is a meat replica entirely
   composed of non-animal products that when cooked generates an aroma recognizable by
   humans as typical of cooking beef. In some embodiments, the consumable when cooked
   generates an aroma recognizable by humans as typical of cooking pork, bacon, chicken,
25 lamb, fish, or turkey. In some embodiments the consumable is a meat replica principally
   or entirely composed of ingredients derived from non-animal sources, with an odorant
   that is released upon cooking or that is produced by chemical reactions that take place
   upon cooking. In some embodiments the consumable is a meat replica principally or
   entirely composed of ingredients derived from non-animal sources, containing mixtures
30 of proteins, peptides, amino acids, nucleotides, sugars and polysaccharides and fats in
                                                78

   combinations and spatial arrangements that enable these compounds to undergo chemical
   reactions during cooking to produce odorants and flavor-producing compounds.
            In some embodiments, the consumable is a meat replica principally or entirely
   composed of ingredients derived from non-animal sources, with a volatile or labile
 5 odorant that is released upon cooking.
            In some embodiments, the indicator is a visual indicator that accurately mimics
   the color transition of a meat product during the cooking progression. The color
   transition can be, for example, from red to brown, from pink to white or tan, or from a
   translucent to opaque color during the cooking progression.
10          In some embodiments, the indicator is an olfactory indicator that indicates
   cooking progression. In one embodiment, the olfactory indicator is one or more volatile
   odorants released during cooking.
            In some embodiments, the indicator comprises one or more isolated, purified iron
   containing proteins. In some embodiments, the one or more isolated, purified iron
15 containing proteins (e.g., a heme-containing protein, see section III B) is in a reduced
   state before cooking. In some embodiments, the one or more isolated and purified iron
   carrying proteins in a reduced or oxidized state has a similar UV-VIS profile to a
   myoglobin protein derived from an animal source when in an equivalent reduced or
   oxidized state. The Aquifex aeolicus hemoglobin has a peak absorbance wavelength at
?0 413 nm; the Methylacidiphilum infernorum hemoglobin has a peak absorbance
   wavelength at 412 nm; the Glycine max leghemoglobin has a peak absorbance
   wavelength at 415 nm; the Hordeum vulgare and Vigna radiatanon-symbiotic
   hemoglobins each have a peak absorbance wavelength at 412 nm. The Bos taurus
   myoglobin has a peak absorbance wavelength at 415 nm.
25          In some embodiments, the difference between the peak absorbance wavelength of
   the one or more isolated and purified iron-containing proteins and the peak absorbance
   wavelength of myoglobin derived from an animal source is less than 5%.
            Odorants released during cooking of meat are generated by reactions that can
   involve as reactants fats, protein, amino acids, peptides, nucleotides, organic acids, sulfur
30 compounds, sugars and other carbohydrates. In some embodiments the odorants that
                                                79

   combine during the cooking of meat are identified and located near one another in the
   consumable, such that upon cooking of the consumable the odorants combine. So, in
   some embodiments, the characteristic flavor and fragrance components are produced
   during the cooking process by chemical reactions involving amino acids, fats and sugars
 5 found in plants as well as meat. So, in some embodiments, the characteristic flavor and
   fragrance components are mostly produced during the cooking process by chemical
   reactions involving one or more amino acids, fats, peptides, nucleotides, organic acids,
   sulfur compounds, sugars and other carbohydrates found in plants as well as meat.
           Some reactions that generate odorants released during cooking of meat can be
10 catalyzed by iron, in particular the heme iron of myoglobin. Thus in some embodiments,
   some of the characteristic flavor and fragrance components are produced during the
   cooking process by chemical reactions catalyzed by iron. In some embodiments, some of
   the characteristic flavor and fragrance components are produced during the cooking
   process by chemical reactions catalyzed by heme. In some embodiments, some of the
15 characteristic flavor and fragrance components are produced during the cooking process
   by chemical reactions catalyzed by the heme iron in leghemoglobin. In some
   embodiments, some of the characteristic flavor and fragrance components are produced
   during the cooking process by chemical reactions catalyzed by the heme iron in a heme
   protein. For example, hemeproteins (e.g., from Aquifex aeolicusm, Methylacidiphilum
?0 infernorum, Glycine max, Hordeum vulgare, or Vigna radiate)provide a significantly
   different profile of volatile odorants when heated in the presence of cysteine and glucose
   than any subset of the three components when analysed by GC-MS. Volatile flavor
   components that are increased under these conditions include but are not limited to furan,
   acetone, thiazole, furfural, benzaldehyde, 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, 5-methyl-2
25 thiophenecarboxaldehyde, 3-methyl-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde, 3-thiophenmethanol
   and decanol. Under these conditions, cysteine and glucose alone or in the presence of
   iron salts such as ferrous glucanate produced a sulfurous, odor but addition of heme
   proteins reduced the sulfurous odor and replaced it with flavors including but not limited
   to chicken broth, burnt mushroom, molasses, and bread.
                                                80

            Additionally, a hemeprotein (e.g., from Aquifex aeolicus,Methylacidiphilum
   infernorum, Glycine max, Hordeum vulgare, or Vigna radiata)when heated in the
   presence of ground chicken increased specific volatile odorants that are elevated in beef
   compared to chicken when analyzed by GC-MS. Volatile flavor components that are
 5 increased under these conditions include but are not limited to propanal, butanal, 2-ethyl
   furan, heptanal, octanal, trans-2-(2-pentenyl)furan, (Z)-2-heptenal (E)-2-octenal pyrrole,
   2,4-dodecadienal, 1-octanal, or (Z)-2-decenal 2-undecenal.
   C. COLOR INDICATORS
10          The color of meat is an important part the experience of cooking and eating meat.
   For instance, cuts of beef are of a characteristic red color in a raw state and gradually
   transition to a brown color during cooking. As another example, white meats such as
   chicken or pork have a characteristic pink color in their raw state and gradually transition
   to a white or brownish color during cooking. The amount of the color transition is used
15 to indicate the cooking progression of beef and titrate the cooking time and temperature
   to produce the desired state of done-ness. In some aspects, the invention provides a non
   meat based meat substitute product that provides a visual indicator of cooking
   progression. In some embodiments, the visual indicator is a color indicator that undergoes
   a color transition during cooking. In some embodiments, the color indicator recapitulates
?0 the color transition of a cut of meat as the meat progresses from a raw to a cooked state.
   In more embodiments, the color indicator colors the meat substitute product a red color
   before cooking to indicate a raw state and causes the meat substitute product to transition
   to a brown color during cooking progression. In other embodiments, the color indicator
   colors the meat substitute product a pink color before cooking to indicate a raw state and
25 causes the meat substitute product to transition to a white or brown color during cooking
   progression.
            The main determinant of the nutritional definition of the color of meat is the
   concentration of iron carrying proteins in the meat. In the skeletal muscle component of
   meat products, one of the main iron-carrying proteins is myoglobin. As described above,
30 the myoglobin content of varies from under 0.05% in the white meat of chicken to 1.5
                                                 81

   2.0% in old beef. So, in some embodiments, the consumable is a meat replica which
   comprises an iron-carrying protein (e.g., a heme-containing protein). In some
   embodiments, the meat replica comprises about 0.05%, about 0. 1%, about 0.2%, about
   0.3%, about 0.4%, about 0. 5 %, about 0.6%, about 0. 7 %, about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about
 5 1%, about 1.1%, about 1.2%, about 1.3%, about 1.4%, about 1.5 %, about 1.6%, about
   1.7%, about 1.8%, about 1.9%, about 2%, or more than about 2% of an iron-carrying
   protein (e.g., a heme-containing protein) by dry weight or total weight. In some cases,
   the iron carrying protein has been isolated and purified from a source. In other cases, the
   iron carrying protein has not been isolated and purified. In some cases, the source of the
10 iron-carrying protein is an animal source, or a non-animal source such as a plant, fungus,
   or genetically modified organisms such as, e.g., plant, algae, bacteria or fungus. In some
   cases, the iron-carrying protein is myoglobin. In some embodiments the consumable is a
   plant based meat replica that has animal myoglobin added. So, for example a replica of
   young beef can have about 0.4-1% myoglobin. In some embodiments the consumable is a
15 plant based meat replica that has a leghemoglobin or a cytochrome added. So, for
   example, a replica of young beef can have about 0.4-1% leghemoglobin or cytochrome.
           Another example of iron-carrying proteins is hemoglobin, the iron-containing
   oxygen-binding protein in the red blood cells of vertebrates. Hemoglobin is similar in
   color to myoglobin. In some embodiments the invention provides methods of saving and
?0 recycling blood from animal farming to supplement the color of a consumable. For
   example, blood is saved from a slaughter house, and hemoglobin from the blood is used
   to enhance the color of a consumable. In some aspects the consumable is a plant-based
   meat replica containing hemoglobin.
           Additional iron containing proteins exist in nature. In some embodiments the
25 consumable comprises an iron containing protein that is not myoglobin. In some
   embodiments the consumable does not contain myoglobin. In some embodiments the
   consumable does not contain hemoglobin. In some embodiments the consumable is a
   meat replica that comprises an iron containing protein other than myoglobin or
   hemoglobin. See, for example, Section III B for examples of heme-containing proteins,
30 as well as FIG. 3. For example, in some embodiments the consumable comprises a
                                                82

   hemoprotein (e.g., a hemoglobin, myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, leghemoglobin,
   non-symbiotic hemoglobin, Hell's gate globin I, a bacterial hemoglobin, a ciliate
   myoglobin, or a flavohemoglobin).
            Leghemoglobin, similar in structure and physical properties to myoglobin, is
 5 readily available as an unused by-product of commodity legume crops (e.g., soybean or
   pea). The leghemoglobin in the roots of these crops in the US exceeds the myoglobin
   content of all the red meat consumed in the US.
            In some embodiments, the consumable is a meat replica principally or entirely
   composed of ingredients derived from non-animal sources, and containing a heme protein
10 (e.g., a leghemoglobin or member of the globin protein family). For example, a meat
   replica can be principally or entirely composed of ingredients derived from non-animal
   sources, including a muscle tissue replica, an adipose tissue replica, a connective tissue
   replica, and a heme protein. In some embodiments the consumable is a meat replica
   principally or entirely composed of ingredients derived from non-animal sources, with a
15 high iron content from a heme protein. In some embodiments the iron content is similar
   to meat. In some embodiments the consumable has the distinctive red color of meat, such
   color provided by leghemoglobin.
            A heme protein (e.g., a heme-containing protein described in Section III B) can be
   used as an indicator that the consumable is finished cooking. So, one embodiment of the
?0 invention is a method for cooking a consumable comprising detecting leghemoglobin,
   which has migrated from the interior of the consumable to the surface when the product
   is cooked. Another embodiment of the invention is a method for cooking a consumable
   comprising detecting the change in color of from red to brown when the product is
   cooked.
25          In some embodiments, the increased shelf life is provided by an extension of the
   lifetime of the desired red color of food products (e.g., a non-meat based meat substitute).
            In one embodiment, this invention provides hemoproteins that provide a desired
   color to non-meat meat substitutes. In some embodiments, the hemoproteins are derived
   from a non-animal source such as a plant, fungus, or genetically modified organisms such
                                                83

   as, e.g., plant, algae, bacteria or fungus. See, e.g., section III B. In some embodiments
   the life time of the hemoproteins is extended by treatment with meat shelf life extenders.
            In some embodiments, the meat shelf life extenders are selected from a groups
   consisting of carbon monoxide, nitrites, sodium metabisulfite, Bombal, rosemary extract,
 5 green tea extract, catechins and other anti-oxidants.
            In one embodiment, this invention provides hemoproteins that provide a desired
   flavor profiles to food products (e.g., non-meat meat substitutes). In some embodiments,
   the ability of the hemoproteins to generate the desired flavor profile is similar to that of
   myoglobin
10          In some embodiments, the life time of the ability of the hemoproteins to generate
   the desired flavor profile is 10%, 20%, 30% 50%, or 100% or more greater than that of
   myoglobin.
   D. Food products comprising isolated, purified heme proteins
15          In some embodiments, heme proteins described herein are added to meat or a
   consumable described herein to enhance the properties of the meat or consumable. For
   example, a heme protein containing solution can be injected into raw (e.g., raw white
   meat) or cooked meat to improve the organoleptic properties of the meat during cooking
   adding a "beefy" flavor (e.g., to white meats such as chicken).
?0          In another example, a heme protein solution can be dripped over meat or a
   consumable of the invention to enhance appearance. In one embodiment, advertising,
   photography, or videography of food products such as meat or a meat substitute can be
   enhanced with a heme protein.
            In another embodiment, a heme protein is added to the consumable as an iron
25 supplement.
            In one application of the invention, hemeproteins may be used as food dyes. In
   one embodiment, the heme proteins may be used as a safe, digestible replacement for
   FD&C Red No. 40 - Allura Red AC, E129 (red shade) in a variety of applications. A
   non-limiting list of such potential uses would include making pictures, especially in
30 forms such as body-painting or as theatrical blood.
                                                  84

            In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for obtaining
   hemeproteins (e.g., leghemoglobin) from a plant. Leghemoglobin can be obtained from a
   variety of plants. Various legumes species and their varieties (e.g., soybean, fava bean,
   lima bean, cowpeas, English peas, yellow peas, Lupine, kidney beans, garbanzo beans,
 5 peanuts, Alfalfa, Vetch hay, clover, Lespedeza, or pinto bean) contain nitrogen-fixing
   root nodules in which leghemoglobin has a key role in controlling oxygen concentrations
   (for example root nodules from a pea plant). In one embodiment leghemoglobin protein is
   purified from root nodules of legume plants (e.g., soybeans, favabeans, or peas) using
   ion-exchange chromatography. In an embodiment, leghemoglobin is purified from
10 soybean, favabean or sweet pea root nodules.
            Plants can be grown using standard agricultural methods, with the exception that,
   in some instances, fertilizer is not applied and soil is enriched in natural nitrogen-fixing
   bacteria from the Rhizobium genus. Either whole roots or root nodules can be harvested
   and lysed, for example in 20mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100mM potassium
15 chloride and 5mM EDTA using grinder-blender. During this process, leghemoglobin is
   released into the buffer. Root-nodule lysate containing leghemoglobin can be cleared
   from cell debris by filtration through 5pam filter. In some embodiments, filtration is
   followed by centrifugation (7000g, 20min). Clarified lysate containing leghemoglobin is
   then filtered through 200nm filter and applied onto anion-exchange chromatography
?0 column (High Prep     Q; High Prep DEAE,    GE Healthtcare) on fast protein liquid
   chromatography machine (GE Healthcare). Leghemoglobin is collected in the
   flowthrough fraction and concentrated over 3kDa filtration membrane to a desired
   concentration. Purity (partial abundance) of purified leghemoglobin is analyzed by SDS
   PAGE gel: in lysate leghemoglobin is present at 20-40%, while after anion-exchange
25 purification it is present at 70-80%. In another embodiment, soybean leghemoglobin
   flowthrough from anion-exchange chromatography is applied onto size-exclusion
   chromatography (Sephacryl S-100 HR, GE Healthcare). Soybean leghemoglobin is eluted
   as two fractions corresponding to dimer and monomer species. Purity (partial abundance)
   of leghemoglobin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and determined to be ~ 90-100%.
                                                 85

            Proteins in legume root-nodule lysate can be transferred into 10 mM sodium
   carbonate pH 9.5, 50mM sodium chloride buffer, filtered through 200nm filter and
   applied onto anion-exchange chromatography column on fast protein liquid
   chromatography instrument (GE Healthcare). Leghemoglobin can be bound to anion
 5 exchange chromatography matrix and eluted using sodium chloride gradient. Purity
   (partial abundance) of leghemoglobin can be analyzed by SDS-PAGE and determined to
   be ~ 60-80%.
            Undesired small molecules from legume roots can be removed from purified
   leghemoglobin by passing leghemoglobin in solution over anion-exchange resin. These
10 small molecules imbue varying shades of brown color to root-root nodule lysates, thus
   decreasing the color quality of leghemoglobin solution. In one embodiment, anion
   exchange resin is FFQ, DEAE, Amberlite IRA900, Dowex 22, or Dowex 1x4.
   Leghemoglobin purified either by ammonium sulfate fractionation (60% wt/v and 90%
   wt/v ammonium sulfate) or by anion-exchange chromatography was buffer exchanged
15 into 20mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100mM sodium chloride and solution passed
   over one of the above mentioned anion-exchange resins. Flowthrough can be collected
   and its colored compared to the color of the solution before passage over anion-exchange
   resins. Color improvement to purified leghemoglobin solution as evaluated by visual
   inspection can be observed (from yellow/brown to more apparent red), however to
?0 different extent of removal of yellow-brown tinge.
            Alternatively, the heme-containing protein can be recombinantly produced as
   described in section III B. For example, a non-symbiotic hemoglobin from moong bean
   can be recombinantly expressed in E.coli and purified using anion-exchange
   chromatography or cation-exchange chromatography. A cell lysate can be loaded over
25 FF-Q resin on fast protein liquid chromatography instrument (GE Healthcare). Moong
   bean non-symbiotic hemoglobin eluted in the flowthrough fractions. Purity (partial
   abundance) of Moong bean non-symbiotic hemoglobin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
   determined to be as a fraction of total protein: 12 % in E.coli lysate, and 31 % after
   purification on FFQ. UV-Vis analysis of purified protein showed spectra characteristic
30 of heme bound protein.
                                                 86

           Alternatively, the cell lysate can be loaded over a FF-S resin on a fast protein
   liquid chromatography instrument (GE Healthcare). Moong bean non-symbiotic
   hemoglobin can be bound to FF-S column and eluted using sodium chloride gradient
   (50mM- 1000mM). Purity (partial abundance) of Moong bean non-symbiotic
 5 hemoglobin can be analyzed by SDS-PAGE and determined to be: E.coli lysate 13 %,
   after purification on FFQ 35%. UV-Vis analysis of purified protein can show spectra
   characteristic of heme bound protein.
           In some embodiments, the heme proteins are utilized as ingredients in food
   products where the flavor of blood is desired. Heme-containing proteins of the invention
10 were tasted by a panel of volunteers and in each case described as tasting like blood.
           Heme proteins, for example leghemoglobin, can be combined with other plant
   based meat replica components. In some embodiments the heme proteins are captured in
   a gel which contains other components, for example lipids and or other proteins. In some
   aspects, multiple gels are combined with non-gel based heme proteins. In some
15 embodiments, the combination of the heme proteins and the other compounds of the
   consumable are done to insure that the heme proteins are able to diffuse through the
   consumable. In some embodiments the consumable is soaked in a heme-protein
   containing solution, for instance a leghemoglobin solution, e.g., for 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 45
   minutes or for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 hours.
?0         Given the usefulness of heme proteins for coloring consumables, it is useful to
   detect whether a product contains a particular heme protein. Accordingly the present
   invention includes in some embodiments methods to determine whether a product
   contains a heme protein. For example, an ELISA, a proximity-ligation assay, a luminex
   assay, or western blot analysis can be performed to determine whether leghemoglobin or
25 other heme-containing protein is present in a food product such as meat or a meat replica.
   In one embodiment the detection methods are performed to determine whether meat has
   been altered with leghemoglobin or other heme-containing protein.
   E. MAYONNAISE SPREAD REPLICA.
                                                  87

            Mayonnaise is thick, creamy sauce. Traditional mayonnaise is a stable emulsion
   of oil and egg yolk. It is thought that lecithin and proteins from egg yolk stabilize the
   emulsion. Traditional commercial mayonnaise typically contains 70-80% (wt/wt) fat and
   5% (wt/wt) of egg yolk. Lower fat commercial products can contain ~ 20% wt/wt fat.
 5 The consumable can comprise a composition that has comparable properties to
   mayonnaise.
            In one embodiment, purified plant proteins can be used as substitute for egg
   proteins to make stable, creamy protein-fat emulsions whose visual and mouth-feel
   appearance resemble traditional mayonnaise. Fat (~ 20- 80% wt/wt) can be from a single
10 source or from multiple sources as described herein. Non-traditional mayonnaise
   products can be used for all the culinary applications that traditional mayonnaise is used
   for. In one embodiment, vinegar and/or lemon and/or lime juice are added as flavor
   additives. In one embodiment, the purified plant proteins are not soy proteins. In one
   embodiment, the flavor can be modified by addition of mustard, spices, herbs, and/or
15 pickles.
            A mayonnaise replica can comprise a mixture of non-animal proteins. In one
   embodiment, a mayonnaise replica is a mixture of 50% (wt/v) rice bran oil and 7% (wt/v)
   Moong bean 8S protein. In one embodiment, a mayonnaise replica is a mixture of 70%
   (wt/v) sunflower oil or cocoa butter, 2.4% (wt/v) RuBisCo,0.29% (wt/wt) soybean
?0 lecithin, and optionally 8 gM oleosin.
            The mixture can be emulsified, and the stability of the emulsion can be controlled
   by modifying the size of the oil-water-protein particles by high pressure homogenization
   or sonication. Oil can be added as liquid. Protein can be added as solution in buffer.
   Soybean lecithin can be resuspended in water and sonicated prior to mixing with an oil
25 and protein solution. A resulting oil, protein and lecithin solution can be homogenized,
   for example, first at 5000psi and then at 8000psi, or can be sonicated at 40% duty cycle
   for 2 minutes at maximum setting. Thickness, texture, creaminess and visual appearance
   of resulting products are similar to one of traditional mayonnaise. In some instances (e.g.
   using Moong bean 8S protein and rice bran oil), a product is a light off-white in color.

   F. CREAM LIQUOR REPLICA
           Traditionally, cream liquors contain dairy cream and liquor as their base.
   Examples of liquor include whiskey, Irish whiskey, Scotch whiskey, rum, vodka, grappa,
   or fermented fruits (e.g., cherry liquor), plum brandy, tequila, or herbal bitters. A cream
 5 liquour replica can be produced by substituting the dairy cream in cream liquor with a
   non-dairy cream fraction from plant sources. In one embodiment, dairy cream in a cream
   liquor can be substituted by a stable emulsion of plant fats and isolated or purified
   proteins of a consistency similar to dairy cream. In one embodiment, purified plant
   proteins and/or plant fats can be from single or multiple sources as described herein. For
10 example, a cream liquor can include a sunflower cream fraction, RuBsiCo and whiskey,
   and one or more optional flavorings (e.g., vanilla, chocolate, and or coffee).
   G. PROTEIN ENRICHED ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE
           Traditionally, alcoholic beverages contain negligible to low amounts of protein.
15 Addition of plant proteins to various alcoholic beverages would positively modify their
   flavor, mouthfeel, physical state and increase their nutritional protein content. In addition,
   the presence of protein in various alcoholic beverages used in cocktails would positively
   modify the cocktail's flavor, mouthfeel, physical state and increase their nutritional
   protein content. Different classes of alcoholic beverages contain different amounts of
?0 alcohols. For example, wine coolers contain about 4-7% alcohol, beer contains about ~ 3
   10% alcohol, wine contains about 8-14% v/v alcohol, dessert wines contain about 17
   20% alcohol, whiskey contains about ~ 40% alcohol, and vodka contains about 35-50%
   alcohol. In addition, some traditional alcoholic beverages include sugars (for example,
   Bacardi Razz at 10% wt/v).
25         Accordingly beverages containing alcohol can be supplemented by addition of
   purified plant proteins at for example 0. 1-5% wt/v and optionally sugar (1-15% wt/v).
   The sugar can be, for example, cane sugar, brown sugar, sucrose, or glucose. For
   example, purified Rubisco at 180mg/ml in 20mM K-phosphate pH 7.0, 15OmM NaCl can
   be added to a whiskey. Jameson whiskey supplemented with 5% wt/v Rubsico formed a
30 soft gel, with a consistency similar to traditional Jello shots.
                                                  89

           For example, Rubsico, moong bean 8S, and pa Globulin enriched alcoholic
   beverages were made by adding purified Rubsico, Moong bean 8S and pea globulin
   proteins at final protein concentrations of 0.5%, 1% and 5% wt/v, respectively, to Corona
   beer, Pinot grigio wine and Jameson whiskey. Zein was added at 0.5%, 1% and 5% wt/v
 5 to a 60% ethanol, 5% sucrose solution in water.
           Pea proteins were extracted from pea flour by resuspending the flour in 5%, 20%
   or40% ethanol, 50%sucrose solutions in water, followed by incubation for 1hr at room
   temperature. Any undissolved solids were removed by centrifugation at 500Og for 10min.
   The resultant supernatant solution was clear in appearance. The 5% ethanol solution was
10 particularly useful.
           A sensory panel evaluated all protein enriched alcoholic beverages as having
   aromas and flavors different from beverages not-enriched in protein. In some cases,
   generated aromas and flavors were judged as neutral, in some cases as more appealing
   and in some cases as less appealing than controls. In particular example, addition of both
15 0.5 % wt/v and 1% wt/v of Moong bean 8S protein to Jameson whiskey softened the
   aroma and mouthfeel of Jameson. Addition of 0.5% wt/v of moong bean to Jameson
   whisky added a slightly creamy flavor to Jameson, with an aroma similar to a traditional
   White Russian cocktail. Addition of 5% wt/v zein to Jameson whiskey generated aromas
   and flavor characterized as moldy beans and raw potato.
?0         In another example where Corona beer was enriched with 0.5% wt/v pea
   Globulin, the aroma changed to hoppy and resembled one of Indian Pale Ale, and the
   flavor changed to carrying pea notes. Addition of 0.5% wt/v and 5% wt/v of moong bean
   8S protein changed the Corona aroma towards sweet peony flower with an intensified
   hop aroma. The flavor was neutral in the case of 0.5% wt/v moong bean 8S and carried
25 planty-nutty notes in the case of 5% wt/v moong bean 8S.
           In another example where Pinot Grigio wine was enriched with 1% wt/v moong
   bean 8S protein, additional aroma notes of sweet and citrus were detected, and the flavor
   changed to that of carrying notes of peanut-butter. Addition of 1% wt/v of Pea Globulins
   modified the aroma to that of strong moldy oak and wet leaves. Flavor was modified to
                                                 90

   carry notes of mud. Addition of 5% wt/v of Rubisco generated aroma and flavor of wet
   hay.
           A zein enriched 60% ethanol, 5% sucrose solution carrried burnt tortilla chip
   aroma notes compared to a corresponding solution without zein. There was no difference
 5 in flavor.
           Pea proteins enriched 5%, 20% and 40% ethanol, 5% sucrose solutions all
   developed earthy aroma and flavor compared to protein free controls. In addition, flavor
   of peas was detected and bitter flavor increased at higher alcohol content.
10 H. CHOCOLATE SPREAD
           Chocolate spread is a chocolate flavored spread whose traditional main
   ingredients are cocoa powder, dairy milk, plant oil, and sugar. Traditional chocolate
   spreads are either firm or soft solids at ambient room temperature and melt at
   temperatures below that of cocoa butter. The product can be used as a spread on bread,
15 crepes, pancakes, icing for cakes and cookies, filling for chocolate confectionary, or non
   dairy chocolate cake filling.
           In one embodiment, dairy milk and milk products such as ice cream, whey,
   cream, yoghurt, sour cream or butter fat are substituted by a non-dairy cream fraction
   made as described herein. In one embodiment, a non-dairy cream fraction comes from a
20 single source or multiple sources described herein. In one embodiment, dairy milk and
   milk products are substituted by any non-dairy milk described herein. In one
   embodiment, dairy milk and milk products are substituted by purified plant proteins
   described herein. In one embodiment, dairy milk and milk products are substituted by
   soft solid stable emulsions made from single or multiple plant oil and single or multiple
25 purified plant proteins.
   I. OTHER APPLICATIONS:
           In one embodiment, non-dairy plant cream fraction can be used as a substitute for
   dairy milk and dairy milk products to make non-dairy milk chocolate bars or non-dairy
30 milk chocolate confectionary.
                                                 91

           In one embodiment, non-dairy plant cream fraction and purified plant proteins can
   be used as substitute for dairy milk and dairy milk products to make non-dairy milk
   chocolate bars or a non-dairy milk chocolate confectionary.
           In one embodiment, non-dairy plant cream fraction and plant proteins can be used
 5 to make chocolate mousse. Traditional main chocolate mousse ingredients are bittersweet
   or semisweet chocolate, dairy butter and eggs. In one embodiment, dairy butter can be
   substituted by a non-dairy plant cream fraction. In one embodiment, dairy butter and
   eggs can be substituted by a non-dairy plant cream fraction and a foam stabilizing plant
   seed storage proteins such as pea albumin.
10         In one embodiment, a vegan consumable such as pate analog can be made. Vegan
   pate analog can be made by finely chopping 10 g of fat replica and heating it on a frying
   pan with finely chopped shallots for 2-3 min. Muscle replica (20 g) made without
   connective tissue replica fibers can be chopped into %-inch cubes and browned in the fat
   and shallots mix for another 3-5 min. The mixture can be forced through a sieve until
15 homogeneous. The pan, while still warm, can be rinsed with a tablespoon of madeira
   without allowing it to evaporate fully. The liquid from the pan is added to the
   homogenized mix, spices (salt, pepper) are added to taste, and the mix is forced through a
   sieve again. After chilling in a refrigerator (e.g., for 15 minutes), the pate is ready to be
   served.
?0         In some embodiments, other fat-to-muscle replica ratios are used to create leaner
   or richer pates. For example, pate can contain 0.5-10%, about 5%-40%, about 10%-60%,
   or about 30-70%, or >70% of an adipose tissue replica.
           In some embodiments, a muscle tissue replica with a higher iron content can be
   used for pate to make it a closer imitation of pig or bird liver pate. For example, muscle
25 tissue replica can contain about 1%, about 1.5%, about 2%, or >2% of a heme protein.
           In some embodiments, muscle tissue replica with lower iron content can be used
   for pate to make it closer imitation of bird meat or fish pate. For example, muscle tissue
   replica can contain about 1%, about 0.5%, about 0.2%, or <0.2% of a heme protein.
           In one embodiment, a vegan consumable such as a blood sausage analog can be
30 made. Vegan blood sausage is made from a blood analog created by mixing solutions of
                                                  92

   heme protein and purified plant protein. For example, 35 ml of a mixed solution of
   leghemoglobin (120 mg/ml) and pea albumin (100 mg/ml), which approximates the
   composition of blood, can be carefully mixed with a slurry of corn flour in salt water (6:5
   w/v flour to water ratio). A tablespoon of chopped onion can be fried with 10 g of
 5 chopped adipose tissue replica, mixed with a few raisins and cooled to room temperature
   before mixing with blood/flour mix. The mixture can be seasoned to taste (for example,
   using salt, pepper, parsley and/or cinnamon), loaded into vegetarian sausage casings, and
   poached in near-boiling water for about 45 min. After cooling, the sausage can be
   consumed as is or further cooked, for example smoked, crisped in an oven or roasted.
10         In some embodiments, muscle replica can be included in the recipe to imitate
   meat/blood sausages. In some embodiments, barley, buckwheat, oat, rice, rye, sorghum,
   wheat or other grains can be used in the blood sausage. In some embodiments, bread,
   chestnuts, potato, sweet potato, starch or other fillers can be added to, or substitute for,
   grains in blood sausage.
15                                              EXAMPLES
           EXAMPLE 1: PROTEIN ISOLATION.
           All steps were carried out at 4'C or room temperature. Centrifugation steps were
   at 8000 g for 20 mins, 4'C or room temperature. The flour is suspended in a specific
   buffer, the suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant is microfiltered through a 0.2
?0 micron PES membrane and then concentrated by ultrafiltration on a 3 kDa, 5 kDa, or 10
   kDa molecular weight cutoff PES membrane on a Spectrum Labs KrosFlo hollow fiber
   tangential flow filtration system.
           Once fractionated, all ammonium sulfate precipitate fractions of interest were
   stored at -20'C until further use. Prior to their use in experiments, the precipitates were
25 resuspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM K Phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, + 0.5 M NaCl. The
   suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatants microfiltered through a 0.2 micron
   PES membrane and then concentrated by ultrafiltration on a 3 kDa, 5 kDa, or 10 kDa
   molecular weight cutoff PES membrane on a Spectrum Labs KrosFlo hollow fiber
   tangential flow filtration system. Protein composition at individual fractionation steps
                                                  93

   was monitored by SDS-PAGE and protein concentrations were measured by standard
   UV-Vis methods.
            (i)     Pea-albumins: Dry green or yellow pea flour was used as a source of pea
   albumins. The flour was suspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5
 5 and stirred for 1 hr. Soluble protein was separated from un-extracted protein and pea seed
   debris by either centrifugation (8000 g, 20 minutes) or filtration through a 5 micron filter.
   Supernatant or filtrate, respectively, was collected. To this crude protein extract, solid
   ammonium sulfate was added to 50% wt/v saturation. The solution was stirred for 1 hour
   and then centrifuged. To the supernatant from this step, ammonium sulfate was added to
10 bring to 90% wt/v saturation. The solution was stirred for 1 hour, and then centrifuged to
   collect the pea albumin proteins in the pellet. The pellet was stored at -20'C until further
   use. Protein was recovered from the pellet and prepared for use as described above, with
   the exception that final buffer can contain 0-500 mM sodium chloride.
            In some embodiments, the flour was suspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM NaCl,
15 pH 3.8 and stirred for 1 hour. Soluble protein was separated from un-extracted protein
   and pea seed debris by centrifugation (8000 g, 20 minutes). The supernatant was
   collected and filtered through a 0.2 micron membrane and concentrated using a 10 Kda
   cutoff PES membrane.
            (ii)     Pea-globulins: Dry green pea flour was used to extract pea globulin
?0 proteins. The flour was suspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer
   pH 8 and 0.4M sodium chloride and stirred for lhr. Soluble protein was separated from
   pea seed debris by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate
   fractionation in two steps at 50% and 80% saturation. The 80% pellet containing
   globulins of interest was stored at -20'C until further use. Protein was recovered from the
25 pellet and prepared for use as described above.
            iii) Soybean 7S and 11S globulins: Globulins from soybean flour were isolated by
   first suspending lowfat/defatted soy flour in 4-15 volumes of 10 (or 20) mM potassium
   phosphate pH 7.4. The slurry was centrifuged at 8000 rcf for 20 mins or clarified by 5
   micron filtration and the supernatant was collected. The crude protein extract contained
30 both the 7S and 11S globulins. The solution then was 0.2 micron filtered and
                                                 94

   concentrated using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff PES membrane on a Spectrum Labs
   KrosFlo hollow fiber tangential flow filtration system or by passing over anion-exchange
   resin prior to use in experiments. The 11S globulins were separated from the 7S proteins
   by isoelectric precipitation. The pH of the crude protein extract was adjusted to 6.4 with
 5 dilute HCl, stirred for 30 min-I hr and then centrifuged to collect the 11S precipitate and
   7S proteins in the supernatant. The 11S fraction was resuspended with 1OmM Potassium
   phosphate pH 7.4 and the protein fractions were microfiltered and concentrated prior to
   use.
            Soybean proteins also can be extracted by suspending the defatted soy flour in 4
10 15 volumes (e.g., 5 volumes) of 20 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9 (or water, pH adjusted to
   9 after addition of the flour) or 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 100 mM
   sodium chloride to decrease off-flavors in the purified protein. The slurry is stirred for
   one hour and centrifuged at 8000 xg for 20 minutes. The extracted proteins are
   ultrafiltered and then processed as above or alternatively, the supernatant was collected
15 and filtered through a 0.2 micron membrane and concentrated using a 10 KDa cutoff PES
   membrane.
             (iv) Moong bean 8S globulins: Moong bean flour was used to extract 8S
   globulins by first suspending the flour in 4 volumes of 50 mM KPhosphate buffer pH 7
   (+ 0.5M NaCl for lab scale purifications). After centrifugation, proteins in the
?0 supernatant were fractionated by addition of ammonium sulfate in 2 steps at 50% and
   90% saturation respectively. The precipitate from the 90% fraction contained the 8S
   globulins and was saved at -20'C until further use. Protein was recovered from the pellet
   and prepared for use as described above.
            Moong bean globulins also can be extracted by suspending the flour in 4 volumes
25 of 20 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9 (or water adjusted to pH 9 after addition of the

   and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour then centrifuged. Acid (HCl or acetic acid)
   was added to the supernatant to a 5% concentration (v/v), stirred at room temperature
   then centrifuged. The supernatant was heated to 95'C for 15 minutes, and then
   centrifuged. The supernatant was precipitated by adding Trichoroacetic acid to 25%,

   with 4 volumes of cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 buffer (0.5M NaCl +
   2mM DTT + 1mM EDTA) in a blender. The resulting slurry was centrifuged to remove
?0 debris, and the supernatant (crude lysate) was used in further purification steps. Proteins
   in the crude lysate were fractionated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 30% (wt/v)
   saturation. The solution was stirred for 1hr and then centrifuged. The pellet from this step
   was discarded and additional ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 50 %
   (wt/v) ammonium sulfate saturation. The solution was centrifuged again after stirring for
25 lhr. The pellet from this step contains RuBisCO, and was kept at -20"C until used.

           A 40 ml aliquot of rice bran oil and a 40 ml aliquot of moong bean protein (114
   mg/ml) were combined in a 250ml Pyrex beaker. The beaker was placed in a water bath
   and emulsified using a Branson Sonifer 450 sonicator with a 12mm tip for a 6 minute,
   60% duty cycle at power level 5.
 5         In an 18cm x 18cm x 2.5cm synthetic rubber Ikea plastic ice cube tray, 48 mg of
   electrospun fibers (from connective tissue Example 14) were laid longitudinally and as
   homogenously as possible across the bottom of one triangular 13.97cm x 1.27cm x
   1.5875cm mold. Approximately 20 ml of the rice bran oil/moong bean protein emulsions
   then were poured on top of the fibers. An additional 20 ml of the emulsions were then
10 poured into a similarly sized blank mold on the same tray to be used as a control.
           The ice cube tray was floated in boiling water for 15 minutes, removed, and
   cooled to room temperature.
           Using a razor blade, each of the resulting gels was cut into 3 segments, each
   4.66cm long with a cross-sectional area of 1cm 2 . A Stable Micro Systems TA
15 XTExpress Enhanced texture analyser with attached TA-96B probe was used to assess
   the tensile strength. The fiber containing the fat replica had a tensile strength of 23 kPa,
   whereas the fat replica with no fibers had a tensile strength of 20 kPa.
           EXAMPLE 4 HIGH PERCENTAGE FAT ADIPOSE-REPLICA
?0         An adipose tissue replica comprising a protein-oil emulsification formed with
   3.3% wt/v pea globulin, 70% v/v oil that consisted of an equal mixture of coconut, cocoa,
   olive, and palm oils, and 0.5% wt/v lecitin, was cross-linked with a 2% transglutaminase
   (Ajinomoto Activa@ TI). After draining and dehydrating, the resulting gel was medium
   soft and the fat content was confirmed to be 75% (wt/wt).
25         An adiose tissue matrix comprising a protein-oil emulsification was formed with
   1.6 % wt/v Rubisco and 80% v/v cocoa butter. The resulting gel was soft.
           EXAMPLE 5: METHOD OF PREPARING ADIPOSE TISSUE REPLICAS
           Oils are melted if necessary by warming to room temperature or gently heated. If
30 the oils are solid at room temperature, they are kept near the melting point during the rest
                                                103

   of the procedure. Proteins are obtained per specified protocols (see Example 1). Lecithin
   is weighed and resuspended in water, then sonicated to create a homogenous solution.
   Components are combined at specified ratios and brought to volume with buffer if
   necessary (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 with 50 mM sodium chloride) then are
 5 subjected to homogenization or sonication to control particle size within an emulsion.
   Afterwards, emulsions are gelled by either: (a) heating/cooling, (b) cross-linking with a
   transglutaminase enzyme or (c) heating/cooling followed by addition of a
   transglutaminase enzyme. Control samples (no heating/cooling nor transglutaminase
   cross-linking treatments) were prepared for comparisons. Emulsions stabilized by
10 heating/cooling treatment are prepared by placing emulsion in 90-100 C water bath for
   five minutes, then letting samples slowly cool to room temperature. Emulsions stabilized
   by transglutaminase cross-linking are prepared by adding transglutaminase to 2% wt/v
   and incubating at 37'C for 12-18hr. Emulsions stabilized by heating/cooling followed by
   addition of transglutaminase enzyme were prepared by first undergoing the heat/cool
15 protocol, then adding the enzyme once the samples cooled to room temperature. All
   emulsifications are incubated for 8-12 hours at 37'C.
           EXAMPLE 6: METHOD TO ANALYZE ADIPOSE TISSUE REPLICAS
           After different gelling treatments, gelled emulsions are moved to room
?0 temperature for evaluation. The total volume of gelled emulsions, and volumes of phase
   separated water and/or oil volumes (if gelled emulsions are not in a single phase) are
   recorded. Firmness of the adipose tissue replica is evaluated by gentle poking of gelled
   emulsions. Cooking experiments are performed by transferring the mass to a heated
   surface and measuring the temperature of the liquid immediately after cooking.

30 concentration of 140 mg/ml in 20mM K-phosphate pH 7.4, 400mM NaCl. A fat mixture
                                                104

   was prepared by melting individual fats from solid to liquid state at 45'C for 30 min.
   Individual fats (cocoa butter, coconut butter, olive oil and palm oil) in liquid states were
   then mixed at a 1:1:1:1 (v/v) ratio. A protein-fat emulsion was formed by mixing a 70%
   v/v liquid fat mixture with 4.2% wt/v moong bean 8S protein, 0.4% wt/v soybean lecithin
 5 and emulsified by vortexing for 30 see followed by sonication for 1 min. After
   homogenization, the fat-protein emulsion was in a single liquid phase as judged by visual
   observation.
           One adipose tissue replica emulsion was stabilized by cross-linking with 0.2%
   wt/v transglutaminase enzyme at 37'C for 12hr. Another fat tissue replica was stabilized
10 by gelling of proteins by heating to 100 C in a water bath followed by cooling to ambient
   room temperature. The resulting adipose tissue replicas were in a single phase. The
   adipose tissue replica matrix formed by the transglutaminase was a softer solid than the
   adipose tissue replica matrix formed by heat/cool induced gelling.
15         EXAMPLE 8: AN ADIPOSE REPLICA OF WAGYU BEEF FAT
           An adipose tissue replica was made by gelling an emulsion of purified pea
   globulin proteins and equal amounts of cocoa butter, coconut butter, olive oil and palm
   oil. Pea globulin proteins were purified as described in Example 1 and had a
   concentration of 100 mg/ml, in 20mM K-phosphate pH 8, 400mM NaCl. A fat mixture
?0 was prepared by melting individual fats from solid to a liquid state at 45'C for 30 min.
   Individual fats (cocoa butter, mango butter, olive oil) in liquid state where then mixed at
   2:1:1 (olive oil: cocoa butter: mango butter) v/v ratio. A protein-fat emulsion was formed
   by mixing a liquid fat mixture with a 5% wt/v solution of pea globulins in a 1:1 ration,
   and emulsifying using a hand-held homogenizer at the maximum setting for 30sec. After
25 homogenization, the fat-protein emulsion was in a single liquid phase as judged by visual
   observation. Emulsion was stabilized by cross-linking with 0.2% wt/v transglutaminase
   enzyme at 37'C for 12hr. The resulting adipose tissue replica was in a single phase, was
   a soft solid and was salty in flavor.

                                    DISTRIBUTION OF BEEF:
            An adipose tissue replica was made by gelling an emulsion of purified pea
   globulin proteins and equal amounts of cocoa butter, mango butter, olive oil and rice bran
 5 oil. Pea globulin proteins were purified as described in Example 1, and had a
   concentration of 100mg/ml, in 20mM K-phosphate pH 8, 400mM NaCl. A fat mixture
   was prepared by melting individual fats from solid to liquid state at 45'C for 30min.
   Individual fats (cocoa butter, mango butter, olive oil and rice bran oil) in a liquid state
   where then mixed at 1:1:1:1 v/v ratio. A protein-fat emulsion was formed by mixing
10 50% v/v liquid fat mixture with 5% wt/v Pea globulins, and emulsifying using a hand
   held homogenizer at the maximum setting for 30sec. After homogenization, the fat
   protein emulsion was in a single liquid phase as judged by visual observation. The
   emulsion was stabilized by cross-linking with 0.2% wt/v transglutaminase enzyme at
   37'C for 12hr. The resulting adipose tissue replica was in a single phase, was a soft solid
15 and was salty in flavor.

            A adipose tissue replica made as a stable emulsion of RuBisCo with sunflower oil
   is softer than a adipose tissue replica made as a stable emulsion of RuBisCo and cocoa
   butter. Adipose tissue replicas were formed with 0.18%, 1.6%, and 2.4% wt/v Rubisco

   with 70%, 80%, and 90% v/v cocoa butter were solid at room temperature but melted at
   close to mouth temperature. In the adipose tissue replicas formed with varying
   concentrations of Rubisco (0.18, 1.6 1.9 % wt/v) and 70-80% v/v sunflower oil, the
30 replicas were firmer as the amount of protein in the adipose tissue replica matrix

   palm oils. Adipose tissue replicas were formed with 1.4% wt/v Moong Bean 8S protein
   with 50%, 7 0%, and 90% v/v sunflower or mixture of oils. Each adipose tissue replica
15 that contained a mixture of oils was firmer than the corresponding replica that was
   formed with sunflower oil. A adipose tissue replica comprising 1.4% wt/v Moong Bean
   8S protein with 50%, 7 0%, and 90% v/v of an equal mixture of coconut, cocoa, olive, and
   palm oil was solid at room temperature but melted at close to mouth temperature.
           Adipose tissue replica made as a stable emulsion of soy proteins with sunflower
?0 oil was softer than the adipose tissue replica made as stable emulsion of soy proteins and
   cocoa butter. Adipose tissue replicas were formed with 0.6%, 1.6%, and 2.6% wt/v Soy
   with 50%, 7 0%, 80%, and 90% v/v sunflower or mixture of oils. Each adipose tissue
   replica that contained mixture of oils was firmer than the corresponding replica that was

           EXAMPLE 14: CONNECTIVE TISSUE ANALOG
           Connective tissue fiber replicas were manufactured by electrospinning a solution
   of moong bean globulin (22.5 mg/ml) containing 400 mM sodium chloride, 6.75% w/v of
10 poly(vinyl alcohol) and trace amounts of sodium azide (0.007% w/v). The resulting
   solution was pumped at 3 gl/min using a syringe pump, from a 5 ml syringe through a
   Teflon tube and a blunted 21gauge needle. The needle was connected to a positive
   terminal of a Spellman CZE 30 kV high voltage supply set at 17kV and fixed 12 cm from
   a an aluminum drum (ca. 12 cm long, 5 cm in diameter) that was wrapped in aluminum
15 foil. The drum was attached to a spindle that is rotated by an IKA RW20 motor at about
   220 rpm. The spindle was connected to a ground terminal of the high voltage supply. The
   protein/polymer fibers that accumulated on the foil were scraped off and used as the
   connective tissue replicas.
?0 EXAMPLE 15: EXTENDING THE LIFETIME OF REDUCED (HEME-FE2+)
   LEGHEMOGLOBIN
           Equine myoglobin was purchased from Sigma. Myoglobin was resuspended at 10
   mg/ml in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl. SDS-PAGE analysis
   suggested that protein purity was ~ 90%.
25         Soy leghemoglobin was purified from Glycine max root nodules via ammonium
   sulfate precipitation (60%/90% fractionation) as detailed in Example 1. Resuspended
   90% ammonium sulfate leghemoglobin was further purified by anion-exchange
   chromatography (HiTrap     Q FF 5mL   FPLC column) in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH
   8.0, 100 mM NaCl. The leghemoglobin eluted in flow through fractions. SDS-PAGE
30 analysis suggested that protein purity was ~ 70%. Leghemoglobin was buffer exchanged
                                                 109

   into 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and concentrated to 10 mg/ml
   on 3.5kDa membrane concentrators.
           Carbon monoxide treatment: Myoglobin at 10 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium
   phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and leghemoglobin at 10 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium
 5 phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl were first degassed under vacuum for 1 hour at 4'C
   then perfused with carbon monoxide gas for 2 minutes. Globins were then reduced from
   heme-Fe"3 to heme-Fe2 - state by adding 10 mM sodium dithionite, 0. mMi sodium
   hydroxide for 2 minutes. Sodium dithionite and sodium hydroxide were removed from
   the protein solution by using size-exclusion chromatography (PD-10 desalting column) in
10 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM potassium phosphate,
   pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl respectively. Globins fractions were collected as a peak red
   colored fractions as evaluated by visual estimation. UV-VIS spectra confirmed the
   presence of heme-Fe     state for both proteins. After desalting, the solution was again
   perfused with gas for another 2 minutes. The color of the solutions was evaluated by
15 taking UV-Vis spectra (250nm- 700nm) every 20 minutes using the nanodrop
   spectrophotometer. Control samples were not treated with carbon monoxide.
           Sodium nitrite treatment: Myoglobin at 10 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium phosphate,
   pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and leghemoglobin at 10 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium phosphate,
   pH 7.4, 100mM NaCl were reduced from heme-Fe"3 to heme -Fe 2 + by adding 10 mM
?0 sodium dithionite, 0. 1mM sodium hydroxide for 2 minutes. Sodium dithionite and
   sodium hydroxide were removed from the protein solution by using size-exclusion
   chromatography (PD-10 desalting column) in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100
   mM NaCl and 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, respectively.
   Globins fractions were collected as peak red colored fractions as evaluated by visual
25 estimation. UV-VIS spectra confirmed the presence of heme-Fe 2 + state for both proteins.
   Sodium nitrite was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM from 100 mM nitrite in
   phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The lifetime of heme-Fe 2 + state was followed by recording UV
   VIS spectra (250-700nm) using spectrophotometer as a function of time. Control
   samples were not treated with sodium nitrite.
                                                 110

           Data analysis of heme-Fe2 - life-times for myoglobin and leghemoglobin samples
   treated with carbon monoxide and sodium nitrite was performed in Microsoft Excel by
   plotting the amplitude of the absorbance peak at the 540nm wavelength. The "baseline"
   of the 540 nm absorbance was determined by the state of the UV-vis spectrum of the
 5 globin solutions prior to the addition of any additives, dithionite reduction, or desalting.
   The built-in curve fit function was used to produce an exponential line-of-best-fit, the
   exponent of which directly relates to the half life of the peak amplitude.
           The life-time of the heme-Fe2 - state and accompanying red color of myoglobin
   and leghemoglobin solutions in the absence of carbon monoxide and sodium nitrite were
10  ~ 6hr and ~ 4hr respectively. Addition of sodium nitrite extended the life-time of the
   heme-Fe2   - state and accompanying red color to more than seven days. Addition of
   carbon monoxide extended the life-time of heme-Fe2+ state and accompanying red color
   to more than two weeks.
15 EXAMPLE 16: PREPARATION OF MEAT REPLICAS IN WHICH THE
   PARTICLE SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL TISSUE REPLICA UNITS IS VARIED TO
   CONTROL AROMA GENERATION DURING COOKING.
           Muscle tissue replica and adipose tissue replica were prepared separately and then
   combined into a meat tissue replica such that the size of individual tissue replica units
?0 was varied to control aroma generation during cooking. Individual fat, muscle and
   connective tissue replicas were constructed in the following manner.
           A muscle tissue replica was prepared as in Example 2. The muscle tissue replica
   formed an opaque gel of reddish-brown color, with small amounts (< 1 ml) of inclusions
   of dark red, venous blood colored liquid. A connective tissue replica was prepared as in
25 Example 14. An adipose tissue replica was prepared as in Example 7.
           Meat replicas with a lean-to-fat ratio 85/15 were prepared by combining
   individual muscle, connective and adipose tissues such that particle size of individual
   tissues replicas varied. (a) 2.1 g of muscle replica with 0.9 g of chunks of fat replica 5-10
   mm in size ("coarse mix"); (b) 2.1 g of muscle replica with 0.9 g of fat replica chopped to
30 2-3 mm in size ("fine mix"); and (c) 2.1 g of muscle replica with 0.9 g of fat replica
                                                 111

   thoroughly blended to <1 mm in size ("blend"). "Muscle only" control sample contained
   3 g of muscle replica alone. "Fat only" control sample contained 3 g of fat replica alone
   as 5-10 mm sized particle. Meat, muscle and fat tissue samples were cooked in sealed
   glass vials at 150 C for 10 min. Aroma profiles of the samples were analyzed by a panel
 5 of testers, and by GC-MS.
            Sensory olfactory analysis of meat replica samples performed by a panel of
   testers, suggested that the size of individual tissue units and the extent of their mixing
   within meat tissue replicas correlated with generation of different aromas. Muscle tissue
   replica cooked by itself generated aromas associated with store-bought gravy, faint citrus
10 and star anise. Adipose tissue replica cooked by itself generated aromas associated with
   musty, rancid and sweet aromas. Cooked meat tissue replica (coarse particle size)
   generated aromas of store-bought gravy, sweet, slightly musty and star-anise. Cooked
   meat tissue replica (fine particle size) generated aromas associated with soy sauce, musty,
   slightly rancid and beef bouillon. Cooked meat tissue replica (very fine particle size)
15 generated aromas associated with sweet, musty and soy-sauce. All samples with the
   exception of adipose tissue replica generated aromas associated with burnt meat smell,
   however to varying intensities.
            Analysis of GCMS data indicated that the size of individual tissue units and the
   extent of their mixing within meat tissue replicas had profound effects on the generation
?0 of aromatic compounds upon cooking. In particular, multiple aromatic compounds
   associated with fruity/grean bean/metallic (2-pentyl-furan); nutty/green (4
   methylthiazole); peanut butter/musty (pyrazine, ethyl); raw potato/roasted/earthy
   (Pyrazine, 2,3-dimethyl); vinegary (acetic acid); spicy/caramel/almond (5-methyl-2
   furancarboxaldehyde); creamy (butyrolactone); sweet (2,5-dimethyl-3-(3-methyl butyl)
25 pyrazine); fruity/stale beer (2-cyclopentene- 1-one, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl);
   musty/nutty/coumarin/licorice/walnut/bread (3-acetyl-1H-pyrolline);
   coconut/woody/sweet (pantolactone); penetrating (1-H-pyrrole-2-2carboxaldehyde, 1
   methyl); minty (caprolactam); toasty caramel (4H-pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5
   dihydroxy-6-methyl) aromas appeared only in mixed meat replicas, but not in individual
30 tissue replicas. Some other aromatic compounds, for example associated with gasoline
                                                 112

   like (nonane, 2,6-dimethyl), petroleum-like (3-hexene, 3-methyl); sour/putrid/fish-like
   (pyridine); bland/woody/yogurt (acetoin); fatty/honey/citrus (octanal);
   pungent/sweet/caramelic (2-propanone, 1-hydroxy) and nutty/burnt green (ethenyl
   pyrazine) aromas appeared only in individual tissue replicas, but did not accumulate in
 5 mixed meat replicas. Furthermore, the levels to which all of the above compounds
   accumulated during cooking depended on the sizes of tissue units and how they are
   mixed (coarse particle size, fine particle size, or very fine particle size (blended)).
           Similar to meat tissue replica, it was found that structural organization and
   particle size of beef tissues modify response of beef tissues to cooking. For example, the
10 flavor of meat is modified by the size of the particles. Beef samples were prepared as
   following: samples of beef muscle and beef fat were cut separately with a knife and: (a)
   "ground", where knife-cut tissue cubes were passed through standard meat grinder.
   80/20 (wt/wt) lean/fat ground beef sample was prepared by mixing muscle and fat tissue
   cubes at appropriate ratio prior to grinding. This sample preparation is referred to as a
15 "fine size particle mix". (b) Ground tissue particle size was further reduced by freezing
   ground tissue in liquid nitrogen and crushing it using mortar and pestle to a very fine
   powder (particle size <1mm). This sample preparation is referred to as a "very fine size
   particle mix". All samples were cooked in sealed glass vials at 150 'C for 10 min.
   Aroma profiles of the samples were analyzed by a panel of testers, and by GC-MS, as
?0 described in Example 1. "Muscle only" control sample contained 3 g of muscle tissue
   alone. "Fat only" control sample contained 3 g of fat tissue alone. Ground beef sample
   contained 3 g of a 80/20 (wt/wt) muscle/fat mixture.
           Sensory olfactory analysis of beef samples performed by a panel of testers,
   suggested that the size of individual tissue units and the extent of their mixing within the
25 samples correlated with generation of different aromas. Beef muscle cooked by itself
   generated typical aromas associated with cooked ground beef. Fat tissue replica cooked
   by itself generated slightly sweet aromas, and aromas associated with burnt mushrooms.
   Cooked ground beef with "fine size particle mix" generated typical aromas associated
   with cooked ground beef, with presence of slightly sweet aromas characteristic of cooked
30 fat. Cooked ground beef with "very fine size particle mix" generated aromas associated
                                                 113

   with cooked ground beef, but no slightly sweet aroma characteristic of cooked fat was
   detected.
            Analysis of GCMS data indicated that the particle size of the individual tissue
   units has effect on generation of aromatic compounds upon cooking. In particular
 5 generation and/or amount of multiple aromatic compounds by individual tissue samples
   or ground beef sample varied in correlation with particle size of the tissue. Some of the
   aromatic compounds that differed between fine and very fine particle size of muscle
   tissue: 4H-Pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl, 3-Acetyl-1H-pyrolline, 1
   (6-methyl-2-pyrazinyl)- 1-ethanone, 2,5 -dimethyl-3 -(3 -methyl butyl) pyrazine, 2
10 furancarboxyaldehyde, 5-methyl, Acetic acid, Ethenyl pyrazine, Pyrazine, 2,3-dimethyl ,
   2-Propanone, 1-hydroxy, Octanal, Acetoin, 4-Methylthiazole, Pseudo-2-pentyl-furan, 2
   pentyl-furan. Some of the aromatic compounds that differed between fine and very fine
   particle size of fat tissue: triethylene glycol: 4H-Pyran-4-one, 2,3-dihydro-3,5
   dihydroxy-6-methyl, Caprolactam, 1-(6-methyl-2-pyrazinyl)- 1-ethanone, 2

   EXAMPLE 17: LEGHEMOGLOBIN CONTRIBUTION TO FLAVOR
            Beef flavors and aromas can be created in non beef consumables by addition of
   heme proteins. Ground chicken (90% lean, 10% fat) was strained with cheesecloth and
30 mixed with recombinant soy leghemoglobin or recombinant bovine myoglobin to a final
                                                   114

   concentration of 0.5-1.0% wt/wt. The recombinant heme proteins were expressed in E.
   coli and purified by nickel affinity purification as described in Example 1. Prior to being
   mixed with chicken, the heme proteins were reduced with 20 mM Na Dithionite. Na
   dithionite was removed from the sample with a Zeba desalting column (Thermo
 5 Scientific). Leghemoglobin was desalted into 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100
   mM NaCl. Myoglobin was desalted into either 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100
   mM NaCl or 20 mM Na citrate pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl. The reduced heme protein
   samples were divided in two, and half the sample was bubbled with carbon monoxide
   (CO) for 2 minutes. After mixing the heme protein samples with ground chicken, the
10 mixture was poured into nugget-shaped molds and incubated overnight at 4'C. The
   nuggets were oven baked or pan fried at 165'C until each nugget reached an internal
   temperature of 165 C. A panel ofjudges tasted nuggets containing chicken alone,
   chicken mixed with buffer, chicken mixed with either leghemoglobin or myoglobin +/
   CO, or beef (90% lean, 10% fat). Judges filled out a survey to evaluate the aroma and
15 flavor of each nugget. Judges rated the aroma and flavor of each nugget as follows: 1 =
   chicken, 2  = chicken + faint beef, 3 =  50/50 chicken + beef, 4 = beef + faint chicken, 5 =
   beef. Shown in Table 2 are the average scores received for each nugget. Percentages
   indicate the final concentration of heme protein wt/wt (abbreviations: KP     = 20 mM
   potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl buffer. NC         = 20 mM Na citrate pH 6.0, 100
?0 mM NaCl buffer. n/d     = not determined). Adding recombinant leghemoglobin or
   myoglobin to chicken resulted in an increased beef aroma and flavor. The perceived
   levels of beef flavor and aroma increased with the myoglobin and leghemoglobin content.
   Leghemoglobin and myoglobin provide the same benefit to the flavor and aroma.

           EXAMPLE 18: PREPARATION OF A NON-DAIRY CREAM LIQUOR
           A cream liquor was made from a sunflower cream fraction, RuBsiCo and whiskey
   (Jameson). A sunflower cream fraction was made by blending sunflower seeds in 40 mM
 5 sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 400 mM sodium chloride buffer. Seed debris was pelleted by
   centrifugation at 50OOg for 20 min, and the cream fraction collected. The cream fraction
   was resuspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4 buffer and collected by
   centrifugation at 5000g, 20 min. Rubsico was purified as described in Example 1 and
   used as 25mg/ml stock solution in 20mM K-phosphate pH 7.0, 15OmM NaCl.
10         In one example, cream liquor was made as follows: 11.4% wt/v of sunflower
   cream fraction, 40% v/v Jameson whiskey, 0.4-1.6% wt/v Rubsico, 0.5% wt/v vanilla
   extract, 0.5% v/v espresso coffee, and 1.5% wt/v chocolate powder. The resulting
   mixture was homogenized at 5000 psi.
           In another example, cream liquor was made from sunflower cream fraction and
15 whiskey (Jameson) and sugar: 11.4% wt/v of sunflower cream fraction, 40% v/v Jameson
   whiskey, 0.5% v/v vanilla extract, 0.5% v/v espresso coffee, 1.5% wt/v chocolate powder
   and 8% wt/v sugar.
           Beverages were served either at ambient room temperature or chilled. Resulting
   beverages were beige to light chocolate in color. The tasting results suggested that the
20 beverage had a very creamy alcoholic flavor similar to dairy cream liquor. Chilled
   product was preferred. The emulsion was stable at room temperature for at least 1 week
   (maximum time tested).
                                               116

           EXAMPLE 19 -CHOCOLATE SPREAD
           A chocolate spread was made from 34% (wt/wt) cane sugar, 22 % (wt/wt) cocoa
   powder, 19 % (wt/v) pistachio cream fraction, and 12 % (v/v) almond milk. Cane sugar
   and cocoa powder (Ghirardelli) were commercially purchased. Almond skim milk was
 5 made in a following manner: Almonds were blanched by immersion into 100 C water
   for 30 sec. Blanched nuts were recovered and cooled by immersion into ice-cold water.
   Almonds were air dried. Almonds were then rehydrated by immersion in 2'C water for
   16hr. Rehydrated almonds were drained, mixed with water at 1:2 wt/v ratio and blended
   in a Vitamix blender for 5 min. The blended slurry was collected in chilled container and
10 stirred with a frozen cooling stick to cool. Once the slurry cooled to 10 C, the slurry was
   placed at 2'C for up to 12 hours. Almond skim and cream were separated by
   centrifugation at 7480g for 30min at 4'C. Almond milk separated into 3 layers, a dense
   pellet of insoluble solids, a clear to translucent aqueous layer (which is referred to as the
   "almond skim milk"), and a lighter, creamy, opaque layer (which is referred to as the
15 "almond cream"). Almond milk was then was pasteurized at 75'C for 16 seconds, chilled
   and stored at 2'C.
           A pistachio cream fraction was prepared by blending pistachios in 100 mM
   sodium carbonate pH 9.5 buffer with 400 mM sodium chloride and 1 mM EDTA, then
   centrifuging 5000xg for 20 min. The cream fraction was collected and washed into the
?0 same buffer once more. After centrifugation at 50OOg for 20 min, the cream fraction was
   collected and washed into 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 buffer with 50 mM sodium
   chloride and 1 mM EDTA. After centrifugation at 50OOg for 20 min, the cream fraction
   was collected an washed once more in the neutral (pH 7.4) buffer, centrifuged at 50OOg
   for 20 min. Pistachio cream fraction was collected and stored at 4'C.
25         Chocolate spread was made in the following way. Cane sugar was melted in
   almond milk, cocoa powder was added to sugar-milk mixture with stirring and melted.
   Sugar, milk and cocoa were then added to the pistachio cream fraction and whisked
   together. Resulting mixture was then poured into molds and let sit for 24 hours at
   refrigeration and freezer temperatures.
                                                  117

           In another example, chocolate spread was made from 42% (wt/wt) cane sugar, 27
   % (wt/wt) cocoa powder, 31 % (wt/v) sunflower cream fraction, and 23% (v/v) almond
   skim milk. All ingredients and procedures apart from sunflower cream fraction were as
   described above.
 5         The sunflower cream fraction was created from blending sunflower seeds in 5
   times the weight to volume of a solution of 40 mM potassium phosphate pH 8, with 400
   mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, then cooled to 20'C, and the slurry was then centrifuged. The
   top cream layer was removed and is blended in the same buffer, followed by heating for 1
   hour at 40'C. The slurry is cooled down to 20'C then centrifuged; the cream layer is
10 removed and mixed with 5 times the weight to volume of 100 mM sodium carbonate pH
   10 with 400 mM NaCl, then centrifuge. The top layer is then mixed with 5 times the
   weight to volume of water and centrifuged again, the resulting cream fraction is very
   creamy, white, and neutral tasting.
           In another example, a chocolate spread was made from 37% (wt/wt) cane sugar,
15 23 % (wt/wt) cocoa powder, 13 % (wt/v) sunflower cream fraction, and 7 % (wt/wt)
   cocoa butter, and 20 % v/v almond skim milk.
           In another example, a chocolate spread was made from 37% (wt/wt) cane sugar,
   23 % (wt/wt) cocoa powder, 13 % (wt/v) sunflower cream fraction, and 7 % (wt/wt)
   coconut oil 20 % v/v almond skim milk.
?0         In another example a chocolate spread was made from 37% (wt/wt) cane sugar,
   23 % (wt/wt) cocoa powder, 13 % (wt/v) sunflower cream fraction, and 7 % (wt/wt) palm
   oil, and 20 % v/v almond skim milk.
           In another example a chocolate spread was made from 1.8% (wt/wt) cane sugar,
   1.130%(wt/wt) cocoa powder, 88 % (wt/v) pistachio cream fraction, and 9 % almond
25 skim milk, by whisking equal amounts of spread described above and pistachio oil
   bodies.
           In another example, a chocolate spread was made from 8.5 % (wt/wt) cane sugar,
   5.4 % (wt/wt) cocoa powder, 81 % (wt/v) sunflower cream fraction, and 4.6 % (v/v)
   almond skim milk, by mixing chocolate spread described above with sunflower cream at
30 ratio 2:1.
                                              118

           Visual and textural inspection of all products suggested that they formed stable,
   solid, creamy spreads at room temperatures. All products were firm solids at refrigeration
   and freezer temperatures. Tasting results of all products suggested very pleasant, rich
   creamy texture with product melting in the mouth reviewed positively by tasters.
 5 Individual tasters preferences varied with respect to like or dislike of pistachio flavor,
   coconut flavor, preference for more or less sweet product and more or less cocoa flavor.
   One particular sample was described as being similar to a milk chocolate spread, as the
   sunflower cream fraction contributed a neutral flavor.

           Lecithin (SOLECTM F Deoiled Soy Lecithin, The Solae Company, St. Louis, MO)
   was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM
15 NaCl, pH 8.0 buffer and sonicated (Sonifier Analog Cell Disruptor model 102C,
   BRANSON Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, Connecticut) for 30 seconds.
           The pea vicilin protein was supplied as a liquid containing approximately 140
   mg/g pea vicilin in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 buffer.
           Coconut oil (Shay and Company, Milwaukie, OR) and cocoa butter (Cocoa
20 Family, Duarte, CA) were melted by heating to 50 - 70'C and then combined and held
   warm until needed.
           The buffered protein solution, additional buffer, and lecithin slurry were mixed in
   a 32 ounce sized metal beaker and equilibrated to room temperature. An emulsion was
   formed using a hand held homogenizer (OMNI model GLH fitted with G20-195ST
                                                 119

   20mm generator probe, OMNI International, Kennesaw, GA). The homogenizer probe
   was put into the protein lecithin mixture and turned on to speed 4. The warmed oil was
   then added slowly over the course of about 2 minutes while continuously moving the
   probe around in the mixture.
 5         The emulsion was then heat set by placing the metal beaker into a 950 C
   waterbath. Using a clean spatula, the emulsion was stirred every 20 seconds for 3
   minutes total. The beaker was then removed from the waterbath and stored at 40 C for
   several hours until thoroughly cooled.
10 EXAMPLE 21 - Generation of Raw Tissue Replica
           A raw tissue replicawas generated using the ingredients recited in Table 4.

15         The buffer was 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The heme
   protein was prepared at a concentration of 55 mg/g in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100
   mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer. The 17x flavor precursor mix precursor is described in
   Example 27. The pea legumin was prepared in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 500 mM
   NaCl, pH 8 buffer and then freeze dried prior to use. The final protein concentration of
20 the dried material was 746 mg/g. The pea vicilin was prepared in 20 mM potassium
   phosphate, 200mM NaCl, pH 8 buffer and then freeze dried prior to use. The final
   protein concentration of the dried material was 497 mg/g.
                                                 120

           The liquid ingredients (buffer, heme, and flavor precursor mix) were mixed in a
   plastic beaker. The dry pea legumin and pea vicilin were then added and allowed to fully
   rehydrate while gently stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. The dry transglutaminase
   preparation (ACTIVA@ TI, Ajinomoto, Fort Lee, NJ) was then added and stirred for
 5 about 5 minutes until dissolved. The stirring was then turned off and the mixture was
   allowed to gel at room temperature until firm. After the gel had formed the raw tissue
   replicawas stored refrigerated until used.
   EXAMPLE 22 - Hard Connective tissue replica
10         A hard connective tissue replica was made as following using soy protein isolate
   (Supro Ex38, Solae), wheat gluten (Cargill), and bamboo fiber (Alpha-Fiber B-200, The
   Ingredient House). The purified proteins were freeze-dried and milled using a standard
   coffee grinder. Commercially available powders of soy protein isolate and wheat gluten
   were used as received.
15         The connective tissue replica contained 49% soy protein isolate, 49% wheat
   gluten and 2% bamboo fiber. The ingredients were thoroughly mixed and loaded into the
   loading tube of the extruder's batch feeder. A twin-screw extruder (Nano 16, Leistritz
   Extrusion Corp.), with a high-pressure water injection pump (Eldex) and custom-made
   die nozzles (stainless steel tube, 3 mm ID, 15 cm length, pressure rating 3000+ PSI)
?0 attached using a Hy-Lok two-ferule tube fitting and a custom-made die with a threaded
   nozzle and 10 mm ID, 20 mm long flow channel was used.
           The dry mixture was fed into the extruder at the rate 1 g/min. Water was fed by
   the pump into the second zone of the extruder's barrel. The rate of water feeding is
   adjusted to the rate of dry mixture feeding such as to provide 550% moisture level in the
25 final extrudiate. A temperature gradient was maintained along the extruder barrel as
   follows: feed zone - 25'C, zone 1 - 30'C, zone 2 - 60'C, zone 3 - 130'C, zone 4
   130'C. The die plate was neither actively heated, nor cooled. The die nozzle was actively
   cooled (by applying moist tissue replica) to maintain extrudate temperature below 100 0 C.
                                                121

           Hard connective tissue replica obtained by this process was dark off-white
   ("cappuccino") colored material shaped into 3 mm thick filaments that had tensile
   strength similar to animal connective tissue (3 MPa).
 5         Example 23. Soft Connective tissue replica
           A soft connective tissue replica was made as in Example 22, except that the rate
   of water feeding was adjusted to the rate of dry mixture feeding to provide 60% moisture
   level in the final extrudate. A temperature gradient was maintained along the extruder
   barrel as follows: feed zone - 25'C, zone 1 - 30'C, zone 2 - 60'C, zone 3 - 115'C, zone
10 4 - 115 0C. The die plate was neither actively heated, nor cooled. The die nozzle was
   actively cooled (by applying moist tissue) to maintain extrudate temperature below
   1000C.
           Soft connective tissue replica obtained by this process was light off-white colored
   material shaped into 3 mm thick filaments that had low tensile strength (< 0.1 MPa) and
15 had a significant propensity to split longitudinally into bands and thin fibers
           EXAMPLE 24. Thin connective tissue replica (zein fibers) process:
           A thin connective tissue replica was prepared using zein protein powder, glycerol
   (FCC grade), polyethylene glycol (PEG 400 or PEG3350), ethanol, sodium hydroxide
?0 (FCC grade), and water. The zein powder and PEG3350 at a 35% w/w ratio to zein were
   dissolved in 85% aqueous ethanol to reach a final zein concentration of 57% w/w. The
   pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 with IM solution of sodium hydroxide in ethanol.
   A syringe pump with A 1-12 ml syringe, spinning nozzle (hypodermic needle, 18-27
   gauge, or a plastic nozzle, 18-24 gauge), heating silicon tape, and a heating fan was used,
25 with a collector assembled using a computer-controlled motor rotating a Delrin rod,
   which serves as a collector.
           This solution was loaded into the syringe, which was mounted onto the syringe
   pump, with an 18 gauge plastic tip attached. A silicon heating tape was looped around the
   tip to maintain it at elevated temperature. After solution was extruded out of the tip and
30 forms a drop, it was picked up with a spatula and carefully transferred towards the
                                                122

   collector rod to form a filament between the tip and the collector. The extrusion rate was
   optimized to produce even flow of material from the tip (5 ml/h for a 12 ml syringe and
   18 gauge tip). The collector rotation speed was 3 RPM. The heating fan was positioned to
   blow hot air onto the spooling fiber. After spooling, the fibers were cured in a 120'C
 5 oven for 24 hours.
            Thin connective tissue replica obtained by this process was semi-clear yellow
   colored material shaped into 300-micrometer thick fibers that were semi-flexible in air,
   and became very flexible and elastic in presence of water, maintaining high tensile
   strength similar to animal connective tissue (6 MPa)

            EXAMPLE 25. Noodles
            Noodles were prepared using purified pea vicilin (freeze-dried), and soy protein
   isolate (Supro EX38 by Solae, Solbar Q842 (CHS)) or soy protein concentrate (Hisolate,
   Harvest Innovations). To prepare the noodles, 67% soy protein concentrate or isolate,
15 and 33% ground pea vicilin powder were thoroughly mixed and loaded into the loading
   tube of the extruder's batch feeder. The dry mixture was fed into the extruder at the rate
   in the range of 1-2 g/min. Water was fed by the pump into the second zone of the
   extruder's barrel at the rate 3.6-5.3 ml/min such as to maintain the final moisture content
   in the extrudate at 72.5%. A temperature gradient was maintained along the extruder
?0 barrel as follows: feed zone - 25 0C, zone 1 - 30 0C, zone 2 - 60 0C, zone 3 - 100 0 C,
   zone 4 - 100 0C. Zone 1 temperature can be varied in the range of 25 - 45 0C. Zone 2
   temperature can be varied in the range of 45 - 65'C. Zone 3 and 4 temperatures can be
   varied in the range of 95 - 100 C. The die plate was neither actively heated, nor cooled.
   The die nozzle was passively cooled by ambient air ensuring extrudate temperature below
25 100 0 C.
            Noodles obtained by this process were light yellow colored material shaped into
   1.5 mm thick filaments that had low tensile strength (< 0.1 MPa) and a moderately sticky
   texture.
30          Example 26. Sticky Tissue Replica Preparation
                                                123

            Sticky tissue replica was prepared using purified pea vicilin (freeze-dried) and
   purified pea legumin (freeze-dried). To prepare the sticky tissue replica, 50% ground pea
   vicilin powder and 50% ground pea legumin powder were thoroughly mixed and loaded
   into the loading tube of the extruder's batch feeder. The dry mixture was fed into the
 5 extruder at the rate in the range 0.4 - 0.8 g/min. Water was fed by the pump into the
   second zone of the extruder's barrel at the rate in the range 1.6 - 3.2 ml/min, such that the
   final moisture content of the extrudate was maintained at 80%. As the total throughput
   increased from 2 g/min to 4 g/min, the screw speed was increased from 100 to 200 RPM.
   Larger die diameters (4 mm and above) are also helpful for preventing backflow at higher
10 throughputs. A temperature gradient was maintained along the extruder barrel as follows:
   feed zone - 25 0C, zone 1- 30 0C, zone 2 - 60 0C,zone 3 - 90 0C, zone 4 - 90 0C. The
   die plate was neither actively heated, nor cooled. The die nozzle was passively cooled by
   ambient air. The die nozzle is kept free of obstructions by solidifying gel material.
            Sticky tissue replica obtained by this process was semi-transparent water-white
15 colored material shaped into irregular 1-5 cm sized bulbs that had sticky paste-like
   texture.
            Example 27. Preparation of the flavor precursor mix
            A flavor precursor mix was prepared by mixing concentrated stock solutions of
?0 each additive to make a 17X solution. Table 5 contains the chemical composition of the
   mix and the mM concentration of each component in the final burger. The concentrated
   flavor precursor mix was sterile filtered and adjusted to pH 5.5 - 6.0 using NaOH, and
   used at a IX concentration in burgers.

          Example 28 - Freeze-alignment to produce texturized protein for use as
  muscle replicas
          This example describes a non-extrusion based method to produce texturized
5 protein materials that can be used in meat replicas.
          A muscle tissue-replica was prepared by first preparing a gel of lentil proteins by
  mixing a 4.5% (w/v) solution of lentil proteins in 20mM potassium phosphate buffer pH
  7.4 + 100mM sodium chloride with 20% (v/v) canola oil (from Jedwards International).
  The mixture was gelled by heating at 95'C for 15 minutes and slow cooled to room
                                              125

   temperature (at the rate of 1 C/minute). The gel was then poured into a vessel and frozen
   at -40'C by placing above a liquid nitrogen bath until completely frozen. The frozen
   material was then dried in a freeze-dryer. When the material was completely dried, the
   material was stabilized by autoclaving (12 PC, 15 minutes). The resulting material is a
 5 texturized muscle tissue replica formed with plant proteins.
           The aligned muscle replica then was presoaked in water for 5 minutes, cut into
   pieces of length 3-4mm and then combined with 1Og adipose-replica, 1Og connective
   tissue replica and 5g cold-set gels to form 50g beef patty replicas. An in-house sensory
   panel attributed inclusion of freeze-aligned tissue to impart improved fibrous texture to
10 the patty.
           A muscle-tissue replica also was prepared by first forming freeze-aligned material
   as described above. After the tissue replica was steam cooked at 121 C for 10 minutes,
   the material was allowed to soak in a solution of heat-denatured pea vicilins (at 6% w/v
   in 20mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 + 10mM sodium chloride, heat denatured
15 by heating at 95'C for 30 minutes), 1% equine myoglobin (w/v) (Sigma), and 40% (v/v)
   canola oil (from Jedwards International). Gelation of the medium was induced by
   addition of calcium chloride at 20 mM. The sample was allowed to sit for 5 minutes at
   room temperature to allow for gel formation. The resulting muscle-replica contained
   aligned material in a cold-set gel reminiscent of beef muscle in steak.
20
           EXAMPLE 29 - Cold gelation of proteins for meat applications
           In one example, a cold-set gel comprising myoglobin was prepared by first heat
   denaturing a 6% (w/v) solution of pea-vicilins in 20mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH
   7.4 with lOOmM sodium chloride at 100 C for 30 minutes. The solution was allowed to
25 cool back to room temperature. Canola oil (from Jedwards International) and equine
   myoglobin (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) and 1% (w/v),
   respectively. Gel formation was induced by adding calcium chloride at 20mM. A 50g
   beef patty replica was formed by combining 5g of the cold gel with 1Og of adipose tissue
   replica, 1Og of connective tissue-replica, and 25g of muscle tissue-replica. Five mls of a
                                                126

   7% (w/w) solution of crude lentil protein was added to the mixture and patties were
   formed.
           Example 30 - Binding materials in meat replicas
 5         In one example, a beef replica was made by first preparing a coacervate from a
   30% (w/v) solution of pea vicilins and legumins (vicilin:legumin ratio of 3:1) in 20 mM
   potassium phosphate pH 7.4 + 100 mM sodium chloride. Melted palm oil (from Jedwards
   International) was added to the solution to a final concentration of 5% and mixed by
   vortexing. The emulsion then was acidified by adding hydrochloric acid while stirring to
10 a pH of 5. The slurry was then centrifuged at 5000 x g for 10 minutes and the liquid top
   layer was decanted from the coacervate.
           A 5Og beef patty replica was formed by combining the coacervate at 10% with
   adipose tissue-replica (20%), connective tissue-replica (20%) and muscle tissue-replica
   (50%). Five mls of a 7% solution of crude lentil protein was added to the mixture and
15 patties were formed. Patties that included coacervate as binding material were observed
   to be more cohesive than patties that did not.

           Adipose tissue replica from Example 6 was chilled following the final heat-cool
   step into a solid block. Optionally 0.2% by weight of heme protein can be added as a 20
   mg/ml liquid solution and manually worked into the adipose. The adipose was then
 5 crumbled manually into small bits 3 - 7 mm in diameter while cold.
           Soft connective tissue replica from Example 23 was produced by an extrusion
   process as long string-like pieces. The soft connective was chopped with a mini chopper
   (Mini-Prep@ Plus Processor model DLC-2L Cuisinart, Stamford, CT) in a single step
   process. Approximate 200g of soft connective was placed in the mini chopper and
10 processed on the chop setting for 60 seconds to yield pieces of 1 - 3 mm in length with
   ragged edges.
           Sticky tissue replica and noodles tissue replica (see Examples 25 and 26) were
   produced by an extrusion process as long noodle-like pieces or amorphous pieces,
   respectively. Raw tissue replica of Example 21 was provided from the enzymatic
15 crosslinking process as a solid block. All three of these tissue replicas were manually
   broken down into pieces 1 - 3 cm in diameter.
           Hard connective tissue replica from Example 22 was produced from an extrusion
   process as long string-like pieces. The hard connective tissue replica was chopped to
   three levels, named coarse, intermediate, and fine, in a mini chopper (Mini-Prep@ Plus
20 Processor model DLC-2L Cuisinart, Stamford, CT). 160 -200 g of hard connective
   tissue replica was placed in the mini chopper and processed on the chop setting for 90
   seconds. One third of the material was removed as the coarse chopped fraction. The
   material remaining in the chopper was then processed for an additional 60 seconds and
   one third of the original weight was removed as the intermediate chopped fraction. The
25 material remaining in the chopper was then processed for an additional 30 seconds to
   produce the fine fraction.
                                                128

           Leghemoglobin was freeze-dried and then reconstituted in a 17x flavor precursor
   mix (see Example 27) adjusted to pH 6.0 with 10 N NaOH to make the flavor and heme
   protein solution.
           Following pre-processing described above, the soft connective, sticky, raw,
 5 noodles, hard connective, and 2/3 of the adipose were mixed by hand in a bowl. A
   typical batch size was 100 g to 2000 g. The flavor and heme solution was then dribbled
   onto the mixed tissue replicas and mixed gently by hand, then k-carrageenan powder was
   tsprinkled over the mixture and mixed in by hand. During the assembly, grinding, and
   forming all materials were kept cold (4 - 15'C). The mixture was ground using a stand
10 mixer fitted with a food grinder attachment (KitchenAid@ Professional 600 Series 6
   Quart Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer model KP26M1XER and KitchenAid@ Food Grinder
   model FGA, St. Joseph, MI) on speed setting 1. The food grinder material was fed by a
   screw conveyor past a rotating knife installed in front of a fixed hole plate.
           The ground tissue replica mix was collected in a bowl and the remaining 1/3 of
15 the crumbled adipose was then added to the ground tissue replica mix and mixed in by
   hand. Approximately 30 g or 90 g portions of ground tissue replica were then formed by
   hand into round patty shapes. Typical dimensions for 30 g patties were 50 mm x 12 mm.
   Typical dimensions for 90 g patties were 70 mm x 18 mm. Patties were refrigerated until
   cooked. Cooked patties had appearance, texture, and flavor similar to ground beef as
?0 judged by a trained sensory panel. In addition to cooking in patty format, the ground
   tissue replica can also be used in a variety of dishes such as taco filling, casseroles,
   sauces, toppings, soups, stews, or loaves.

            Adipose, soft connective, and hard connective were preprocessed as described in
   Example 31. During all pre-processing steps, the temperature of the materials was
   maintained cold (4 - 15'C).
 5          Raw muscle with heme protein and flavor was then prepared as follows. Freeze
   dried pea vicilin and pea legumin were dissolved in water and 16x flavor stock. The
   freeze-dried heme protein was dissolved in this mixture and the pH was adjusted with
   citric acid to 5.8. A dry transglutaminase preparation (ACTIVA@ TI Ajinomoto Fort
   Lee, NJ) was then added and mixed for about 5 min to fully dissolve. The mixture was
10 then allowed to stir for an additional 10 minutes until some increase in viscosity was
   observed. The soft connective and hard connective were then added and the mixture was
   allowed to sit for 1 hour at room temperature to cure and form a solid mass.
            Wheat gluten powder (vital wheat gluten, Great Northern, item 131100, Giusto's
   Vita-Grain, South San Francisco, CA) then was added to the gelled raw muscle and
15 mixed to distribute. This mixture was then immediately ground using a stand mixer fitted
   with a food grinder attachment as described in the previous example. Ground tissue
   replica was then chilled for 5 min at -20'C. Finally, the chopped adipose, pre-chilled to
   4'C, was added to the chilled ground tissue replica.
            Ground tissue replica mix with adipose tissue replica added was then formed by
20 hand into two 90 g round patties. 90 g patties are typically 70 mm x 18 mm. A typical
   batch size was 180 - 200 g and produced two patties. The patties were then allowed to
   rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. After resting the patties can be cooked or
   refrigerated until ready to cook.

            EXAMPLE 33: Generation of beef flavor in replica burgers by the addition
   of Heme and flavor precursors.
            Characteristic flavor and fragrance components in meat are mostly produced
   during the cooking process by chemical reactions molecules (precursors) including amino
 5 acids, fats and sugars that are found in plants as well as meat. Flavor precursors along
   with 1% Leghemoglobin were added to the muscle component of the burger replicas as
   indicated in Table 8. Three replicas, one with no precursors, and two different mixtures
   of precursors, along with 80:20 beef were cooked then served to a trained sensory panel
   to describe the flavor attributes shown in Table 9. The addition of precursors increased
10 the beefy flavor, the bloody notes, overall flavor quanity, and decreased the off notes in
   the replica. The replicas and beef sample also were analyzed by GCMS by adding 3
   grams of uncooked replica or beef into a GCMS vial. All samples were cooked at 150'C
   for 3 mins, cooled to 50'C to extract for 12 minutes using GCMS (SPME fiber sampling
   of headspace). A search algorithm analyzed the retention time and mass fingerprint
15 information to assign chemical names to peaks. In the replica burger with 1% Leg
   hemeoglobin, and precursor mixture 2, 136 beef compounds were created. In Table 10,
   all the compounds created in the replica burger that were also identified by GCMS in the
   beef samples are indicated.

         EXAMPLE 34 - Removal of off-flavors from plant protein solutions
    i)       Synthesis of ligand modified LOX removal resin
         A 1 mL settled volume of CM Sepharose resin (Sigma Aldrich Catalog #
CCF100) was loaded into a BioRad minicolumn. 3 mL of 50 mM MES (2
morpholinoethanesulfonic acid) buffer preset to a pH range of 5.5 to 6 was allowed to
pass through the resin bed. Separately, to 1 mL of the same buffer was added in
succession, 0.044 mL of 4,7,10- trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine, 0.030 mL of 12 N HCl, 23
mg of NHS (N-hydroxy-succinimide), and 38 mg of EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride) with dissolution after each addition.
The resulting solution was added to the top of the column bed and allowed to gravity
flow through and the effluent was collected. The resulting effluent was returned to the
top of the column bed. The cycle of addition of solution, elution and return was done
four times. When the last elution was finished, 3 mL of 50 mM MES buffer preset to a
pH of 5.5 to 6 was allowed to gravity flow through the column. Linoleic acid (0.03 mL)
was dissolved in 0.5 mL DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide), followed in sequence by 12
mg NHS, 19 mg EDC, and 0.5 mL of 50 mM MES buffer preset to a pH of 5.5 to 6. The
NHS/EDC mixture was shaken to mix, resulting in a two-phase liquid which was applied
to the top of the column and eluted through the resin bed, allowed to gravity flow through
the column and effluent collected. The effluent was returned to the top of the column
bed. The cycle of addition of solution, elution and return was done four times. Once the
last collection was finished a solution of 70% ethanol in water (5 mL) was added to the
                                             134

   top of the column, followed by 3 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. This was followed by
   0.1 M buffer of potassium phosphate preadjusted to pH 7 to 8.
   ii)     Removal of off-flavors from pea proteins using the ligand modified LOX
 5 removal resin.
           A solution of pea proteins (30 mls at 20 mg/ml protein concentration in 20 mM
   potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100mM sodium chloride) was passed through a 100
   ml resin bed described above. All unbound material was collected and the resin further
   washed with 200 mls of buffer. Both fractions were combined and resin was stripped of
10 bound protein by washing with 2 bed volumes of 20 mM potassium phosphate, IM
   sodium chloride. Resin bed was regenerated by washing with 2 bed volumes of 0. 1M
   NaOH followed by 3 bed volumes of water and re-equilibration with buffer.
           Depletion of LOX activity in the pooled unbound fraction was confirmed by
   assaying for enzyme activity. Sodium linoleate was used as substrate for LOX and
15 formation of hydroperoxide intermediates was monitored by absorbance at 234nm.
   Assays were performed at pH9 in 50mM sodium borate buffer. Assays confirmed
   depletion of LOX activity in the pooled unbound fraction. LOX was removed from resin
   in washes with 0.5M and IM sodium chloride.
           Improvement in flavor in the LOX depleted protein solutions (both as-is and
?0 incubated with canola oil at 10%) was confirmed by a panel of 4 tasters. Samples of pea
   proteins at same concentration, but not depleted of LOX was used at control. Tasters
   described LOX -depleted samples as mild tasting and control samples as having beany,
   planty taste. In addition, GC-MS analysis of samples showed 5X reduction in overall
   volatiles in the LOX-depleted samples.
25
   Reduction of off-flavors using dialysis and activated carbon
           A solution of pea albumins (30 mls at 40 mg/ml in 20mM potassium phosphate
   buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM sodium chloride) was dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer
   overnight at 4'C. The solution was then poured over a bed of activated carbon (100
30 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) prewetted with buffer. The slurry was centrifuged at 5000 x g for
                                               135

   10 minutes and the supernatant containing protein was decanted off. This solution was
   tested for improvement in flavor by both taste and GC-MS. Improved flavor (less bitter,
   less soapy flavor) was noted by tasters and GC-MS confirmed a >2X reduction in volatile
   compounds; in particular, samples treated with activated carbon showed a decrease in
 5 C6- and C7 compounds (e.g., 1-heptanal, 2-heptenal, or 2-heptanone) that are associated
   with green/grassy/planty flavors.
   Reduction of off-flavors using antioxidants and/or LOX inhibitors
           A 7% solution of pea-vicilins was heated with coconut oil (20%) to 95'C for 15
10 min in the presence of antioxidants or LOX inhibitors and compared for off-flavors
   sample against a control without any antioxidants or LOX inhibitors. In a similar
   experiment, soymilk was heated in the presence of antioxidants or LOX inhibitors and
   tasted in-house for off-flavors. Table 11 summarizes off-flavors noted by tasters. Both
   epigallocetechin gallate and propyl gallate were effective at minimizing off-flavors in pea
15 samples. However, in case of soymilk, epigallocatechin gallate did not appear to reduce
   beaniness; propyl gallate and a-tocopherol were found to slightly improve flavor in
   soymilk.

           EXAMPLE 35 - ADIPOSE REPLICA WITH LECITHIN GRADIENT
           Lecithin (SOLECTm F Deoiled Soy Lecithin., The Solae Company, St. Louis, MO)
   was prepared at a concentration of 50 rng/mL in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100 nM
   NaCI, pH 8.0 buffer and sonicated (Sonifier Analog Cell Disruptor model I02C,
                                                136

    BRANSON Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, Connecticut) for 30 seconds. Moong
    protein was supplied as a liquid in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, p-I 8.0
    buffer. Coconut oil was melted by heating to 50 - 70 C and held warm until needed. The
    coconut oil, buffered protein solution, additional buffer, and lecithin slurry were mixed at
  5 70'C, and an emulsion was formed using a hand held homogenizer. The emulsion was
    then heat set by placing the tube into a 95'C waterbath for a total of 5 mins. The tube
    was then removed from the waterbath and stored at 4 C for twelve hours or longer prior
    to analysis.
            To observe the effect of lecithin on the adipose tissue replica replica, a
 10 formulation was prepared that contained 1% w/v moong protein and 75% v/v coconut oil,
    with the lecithin amount increasing from 0%, 0.05%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0           /Vv.
            Properties of the adipose replica were measured by weighing small portions of the
    material and forming uniform round balls, which were then cooked on a non-stick pan
    with temperature slowly ramping up to 150'C. The temperature of the pan at which fat
 15 visibly released from the balls was measured as the fat release temperature. After cooking
    to completion, the point at which fat no longer released, the total fat released was
    measured.
            An increase in the amount of lecithin in the adipose replica correlated with an
    increase in the percent fat released, and with a decrease in the fat release temperature (see
 ?0 FIGs. 2A and 2B). With 0% lecithin, there was an average of 40% fat released, and when
    lecithin was increased to 0.05%, there was an average of 82% fat released, which further
    increased to 88% with 0.25% lecithin, then leveled off to an average of 60% with further
    increases in lecithin. With 0% lecithin, a high temperature of 217 0 C was required to
    begin the fat release. The fat release temperature decreased to 122'C with 0.25%
25  lecithin, then leveled off to an average of 62'C with further increases of lecithin.
            Firmness of the adipose replica was measured by texture analyzer (TA XT plus).
    A probe penetrated a flat surface of the adipose replica, and the force at 2 mm penetration
    was recorded. A small amount of lecithin (0.05%) increased the firmness, and at 0.25%
    and above, the firmness of the adipose replica decreased. See FIG. 2C.

             EXAMPLE 36 - ADIPOSE REPLICA WITH VARYING VEGETABLE OIL
   TYPE
             To observe the effect of vegetable oil type on the adipose replica, a formulation
   was prepared that contained a 1.5% w/v moong protein and 0.05% w/v lecithin, and 75%
 5 v/v of different vegetable oils (canola oil, cocoa butter, coconut oil, and olive oil) using
   the same methodology as Example 35. Properties of the adipose replica were measured
   by weighing small portions of the material and forming uniform round balls, which were
   then cooked on a non-stick pan with temperature slowly ramping up to 250'C. The
   temperature of the pan at which fat visibly released from the balls was measured as the
10 fat release temperature. After cooking to completion, the point at which fat no longer
   released, the total fat released was measured.
             Varying the vegetable oil type had a large effect on the adipose replica. Oils with
   a higher amount of unsaturated fats, including canola and rice bran oils, released very
   little fat (1 and 2% fat released, see FIG. 3), while oils with a higher amount of saturated
15 fats, including cocoa butter and coconut oil released significantly more fat (30% and 50%
   fat released, see FIG. 4). The adipose replicas with canola and rice bran oils required a
   temperature greater than 250'C to melt (not measured), while the adipose replicas with
   cocoa butter and coconut oil released fat at a lower temperature (82'C and 137'C).
?0           EXAMPLE 37 - ADIPOSE REPLICA MADE WITH COACERVATE
             Lecithin (SOLECTM F Deoiled Soy Lecithin, The Solae Company, St. Louis,
   MO) was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100
   mM NaCl, pH 8.0 buffer and sonicated (Sonifier Analog Cell Disruptor model 102C,
   BRANSON Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, Connecticut) for 30 seconds. Pea
25 legumin and pea vicilin proteins in 20 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0
   buffer, were mixed to a 1:1 ratio. Cocoa butter was melted by heating to 70'C and held
   warm until needed. The cocoa butter was added to 2% and 10% w/v to the protein
   mixtures, and was added at 60'C to maintain cocoa butter in the liquid state. While the
   solutions were still warm, the mixtures were sonicated 1-3 minutes, until cocoa butter
30 particles were visibly emulsified. The pH of the samples was adjusted to 5.5 with HCl,
                                                  138

   and the mixtures turned into a milky white color, then centrifuged at 5,000xg for ten
   minutes. After centrifugation, a pellet was collected, comprising a coacervate of protein
   and cocoa butter. The 2% fat coacervates were sticky and stretchy, while the 10% fat
   coacervates were fatty and pliable. The coacervates were sealed in plastic and subjected
 5 to high pressure processing (HPP). The sample was sealed in a heat-sealable food-saver
   plastic bag and then subject to high pressure processing (85k psi for 5 minutes in an
   Avure 2L Isostatic Food Press). After HPP, the 2% coacervate samples formed a semi
   firm, cohesive material. The 10% coacervate samples were crumbly, soft, and oily.
           Properties of the processed coacervate samples were measured by breaking off
10 small portions of the material and cooking on a non-stick pan with temperature slowly
   ramping up to 250'C. The coacervate samples did not release any fat upon cooking to
   this temperature.
