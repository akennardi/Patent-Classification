             RECEIVED FROM MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS
Abstract
Systems  and methods are disclosed for displaying
notifications received from multiple applications.   In some
embodiments, an electronic device can monitor
notifications that are received from the multiple
applications. Responsive to receiving the notifications,
the electronic device can control the manner in which the
notifications are displayed while the device is   operating
in a locked or an unlocked state. In some embodiments, the
electronic device can allow users to customize how
notifications are to be displayed while the device is in
the locked and/or unlocked states.

 5 Related application
   Incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is
   PCT/US2012/040962   (published as WO 2012/170446), filed on
   5 June 2012.
10 Field of the Invention
   [0001]      The disclosed embodiments relate generally to
   electronic devices, and more particularly, to electronic
   devices displaying notifications received from multiple
   applications.
15
   Background of the Disclosure
   [0002]      Today's portable electronic devices are able to
   integrate multiple functionalities. These devices are
   capable of running multiple applications. In particular,
20 some of these applications may generate trigger events
   that can result in the display of a notification.
   [0003]      Because electronic devices can contain many
   applications, the potential for application-based
   notifications can become numerous and unwieldy,
25 particularly if a user is required to access each
   application individually in order to view application
   specific notifications. Accordingly, what is needed is a
   more efficient and intuitive approach for organizing
   notifications and providing users with instant access to
30 these notifications.

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   2
          Summary of  the Disclosure
          [00041     Systems and methods are disclosed for
          displaying notifications received from multiple
          applications.   An electronic device can have a touch
    5     sensitive input/output   ("I/O") device (e.g., a touch
          screen) with a graphical user interface   ("GUI"),   one or
          more processors, memory, and one or more modules,
          programs, or sets of  instructions stored in the memory
          for performing multiple functions.
  10      [00051     In particular, the electronic device can
          include a notification module that can interface with
          one or more Application Programming Interfaces     ("APIs")
          to generate various types of notifications while the
          device is in either a locked state or an unlocked
  15      state.  Furthermore, the notification module can
          provide options for customizing notification settings.
          [00061     In some embodiments, the notification module
          can monitor notifications that are received from
          multiple applications.    Responsive to receiving the
  20      notifications, the notification module can control the
          manner in which the notifications are displayed while
          the electronic device is operating in a locked or an
          unlocked state.   In some embodiments, the electronic
          device can allow a user to customize how notifications
  25      are displayed while the device is in the locked and/or
          the unlocked state.
          [00071     In some embodiments, while the device is
          operating in a locked state, the notification module
          can display a pull-down option, which can allow a user
  30      to view previously received notifications.     In some
          embodiments, the notification module can aggregate the
          notifications that are received, and can provide the
          aggregated notifications as multiple panes in a

WO 2012/170446                                        PCT/US2012/040962
                                   3
          notification center.   Thus, each pane of the
          notification center can be associated with a different
          application.   In addition, the notification module can
          display banners that correspond to one or more
    5     notifications that are received from different
          applications.
          [0008]     The one or more APIs that interface with the
          notification module can be in an environment with
          calling program code interacting with another program
  10      code being called through the one or more interfaces.
         Various function calls, messages or other types of
          invocations, which further may include various kinds of
          parameters, can be transferred via the APIs between the
          calling program and the code being called.    In
  15      addition, an API may provide the calling program code
          the ability to use data types or classes defined in the
         API and implemented in the called program code.
          [00091     At least certain embodiments include an
          environment with a calling software component
  20      interacting with a called software component through an
         API.    A method for operating through an API in this
          environment includes transferring one or more function
          calls, messages, and/or other types of invocations or
          parameters via the API.

  10      Detailed Description of the Disclosure
          [00241    Systems and methods for displaying
          notifications received from multiple applications are
          provided.
          [00251    FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of
  15      electronic device 100 that includes touch I/o
          device 102 that can receive touch input for interacting
          with computing system 104 via wired or wireless
          communication channel 106.   Touch I/O device 102 may be
          used to provide user input to computing system 104 in
  20      lieu of or in combination with other input devices such
          as a keyboard, mouse, etc.   One or more touch I/O
          devices 102 may be used for providing user input to
          computing system 104. Touch I/O device 102 may be an
          integral part of computing system 104   (e.g., touch
  25      screen on a laptop) or may be separate from computing
          system 104.
          [00261    Touch I/O device 102 may include a touch
          sensitive panel which is wholly or partially
          transparent, semitransparent,  non-transparent, opaque
  30      or any combination thereof.   Touch I/O device 102 may
          be embodied as a touch screen, touch pad, a touch
          screen functioning as a touch pad   (e.g., a touch screen

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                  6
          replacing the touchpad of a laptop),  a touch screen or
          touchpad combined or incorporated with any other input
          device (e.g., a touch screen or touchpad disposed on a
          keyboard) or any multi-dimensional object having a
    5     touch sensitive surface for receiving touch input.
          [00271    In one example, touch I/O device 102 embodied
          as a touch screen may include a transparent and/or
          semitransparent touch sensitive panel partially or
          wholly positioned over at least a portion of a display.
  10     According to this embodiment, touch I/O device 102
          functions to display graphical data transmitted from
          computing system 104  (and/or another source) and also
          functions to receive user input.   In other embodiments,
          touch I/O device 102 may be embodied as an integrated
  15      touch screen where touch sensitive components/devices
          are integral with display components/devices.    In still
          other embodiments, a touch screen may be used as a
          supplemental or additional display screen for
          displaying supplemental or the same graphical data as a
  20      primary display and to receive touch input.
          [0028]    Touch I/O device 102 may be configured to
          detect the location of one or more touches or near
          touches on device 102 based on capacitive, resistive,
          optical, acoustic, inductive, mechanical, chemical
  25      measurements, or any phenomena that can be measured
          with respect to the occurrences of  the one or more
          touches or near touches in proximity to device 102.
          Software, hardware, firmware or any combination thereof
          may be used to process  the measurements of the detected
  30      touches to identify and track one or more gestures.      A
          gesture may correspond to stationary or non-stationary,
          single or multiple, touches or near touches on touch
          I/O device 102. A gesture may be performed by moving

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                   7
          one or more fingers or other objects in a particular
          manner on touch I/O device 102 such as tapping,
          pressing, rocking, scrubbing, twisting, changing
          orientation, pressing with varying pressure and the
    5     like at essentially the same time, contiguously, or
          consecutively. A gesture may be characterized by, but
          is not limited to a pinching, sliding, swiping,
          rotating, flexing, dragging, or tapping motion between
          or with any other finger or fingers. A single gesture
  10      may be performed with one or more hands, by one or more
          users, or any combination thereof.
          [00291     Computing system 104 may drive a display with
          graphical data to display a graphical user interface
          (GUI).   The GUI may be configured to receive touch
  15      input via touch I/O device 102.   Embodied as  a touch
          screen, touch I/O device 102 may display the GUI.
         Alternatively, the GUI may be displayed on a display
          separate from touch I/O device 102.   The GUI may
          include graphical elements displayed at particular
  20      locations within the interface. Graphical elements may
          include but are not limited to a variety of displayed
          virtual input devices including virtual scroll wheels,
          a virtual keyboard, virtual knobs, virtual buttons, any
          virtual UI,  and the like.  A user may perform gestures
  25      at one or more particular locations on touch I/O
          device 102 that may be associated with the graphical
          elements of the GUI.   In other embodiments, the user
          may perform gestures at one or more  locations that are
          independent  of the locations of graphical elements of
  30      the GUI.   Gestures performed on touch I/O device 102
          may directly or indirectly manipulate, control, modify,
          move, actuate, initiate or generally affect graphical
          elements such as cursors, icons, media files, lists,

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962

          text, all or portions of images, or the like within the
          GUI.   For instance, in the case of a touch screen, a
          user may directly interact with a graphical element by
          performing a gesture over the graphical element on the
    5     touch screen.   Alternatively, a touch pad generally
          provides indirect interaction.    Gestures may also
          affect non-displayed GUI elements    (e.g., causing user
          interfaces to appear) or may affect other actions
          within computing system 104   (e.g., affect a state or
  10      mode of a GUI, application, or operating system).
          Gestures may or may not be performed on touch I/O
          device 102 in conjunction with a displayed cursor.       For
          instance, in the case in which gestures are performed
          on a touchpad, a cursor (or pointer) may be displayed
  15      on a display screen or touch screen and the cursor may
          be controlled via touch input on the touchpad to
          interact with graphical objects on the display screen.
          In other embodiments in which gestures are performed
          directly on a touch screen, a user may interact
  20      directly with objects on the touch screen, with or
          without a cursor or pointer being displayed on the
          touch screen.
          [00301     Feedback may be provided to the user via
          communication channel 106  in response to or based on
  25      the touch or near touches on touch I/O device 102.
          Feedback may be transmitted optically, mechanically,
          electrically, olfactory, acoustically, or the like or
          any combination thereof and in a variable or non
          variable manner.
  30      [0031]     Attention is now directed towards embodiments
          of a system architecture that may be embodied within
          any portable or non-portable device including but not
          limited to a communication device    (e.g. mobile phone,

          In-One desktop, a peripheral device, or any other
    5     system or device adaptable to the inclusion of system
          architecture 2000,   including combinations of   two or
          more of these types of devices.    FIG. 2 is a block
          diagram of one embodiment of system 200 that can
          include one or more computer-readable mediums 201,
  10      processing system 204,   input/Output  (I/O)
          subsystem 206,   radio frequency (RF) circuitry 208,    and

          by one or more communication buses or signal lines 203.
          System 200 can be the same as or similar to electronic
  15      device 100   (FIG. 1).
          [00321     It should be apparent that the architecture
          shown in FIG. 2 is only one example architecture of
          system 200, and that system 200 could have more or
          fewer components than shown, or a different
  20      configuration of components.    The various components
          shown in FIG. 2 can be implemented in hardware,
          software, firmware or any combination thereof,
          including one or more signal processing and/or
          application specific integrated circuits.
  25      [00331     RF circuitry 208  is used to send and receive
          information over a wireless link or network to one or
          more other devices and includes well-known circuitry
          for performing this function.    RF circuitry 208 and
          audio circuitry 210 can be coupled to processing
  30      system 204 via peripherals interface 216.

          processing voice signals received from interface 216 to
          enable a user to communicate in real-time with other
    5     users.  In some embodiments, audio circuitry 210
          includes a headphone jack     (not shown).
          [0034]     Peripherals interface 216 can couple the
          input and output peripherals of the system to
          processor 218 and computer-readable medium 201.       One or
  10      more processors 218   can communicate with one or more
          computer-readable mediums 201 via controller 220.
          Computer-readable medium 201 can be any device or
          medium that can store code and/or data for use by one
          or more processors 218.     Medium 201 can include a
  15      memory hierarchy, including but not limited to cache,
          main memory and secondary memory. The memory hierarchy

          SRAM, DRAM, DDRAM),   ROM, FLASH, magnetic and/or optical
          storage devices, such as disk drives, magnetic tape,
  20      CDs  (compact disks) and DVDs    (digital video discs).
          Medium 201 may also include a transmission medium for
          carrying information-bearing signals indicative of
          computer instructions or data     (with or without a
          carrier wave upon which the signals are modulated).
  25      For example, the transmission medium may include a
          communications network, including but not limited to
          the Internet   (also referred to as the World Wide Web),
          intranet(s),  Local Area Networks    (LANs), Wide Local
         Area Networks    (WLANs), Storage Area Networks    (SANs),

          [0035]     One or more processors 218    can run various
          software components stored in medium 201 to perform
          various functions for system 200.      In some embodiments,

    5     more applications   (or set of instructions) 230,    and
          notification module 238.      Each of these modules and
          above noted applications correspond to a set of
          instructions for performing one or more functions
          described above and the methods described in this
  10      application  (e.g.,  the computer-implemented methods and
          other information processing methods described herein).
          These modules  (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be
          implemented as separate software programs, procedures
          or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules
  15      may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various
          embodiments. In some embodiments, medium 201 may store
          a subset of the modules and data structures identified
          above. Furthermore, medium 201 may store additional
          modules and data structures not described above.
  20       [00361   Operating system 222 can include various
          procedures, sets of instructions, software components
          and/or drivers for controlling and managing general
          system tasks  (e.g., memory management, storage device
          control, power management, etc.)     and facilitates
  25      communication between various hardware and software
          components.
          [00371    Communication module 224     facilitates
          communication with other devices over one or more
          external ports 236 or via RF circuitry 208 and includes
  30      various software components for handling data received
          from RF circuitry 208 and/or external port 236.

          displaying graphical objects on a display surface.      In
          embodiments in which touch I/O device 212 is a touch
          sensitive display (e.g., touch screen),   graphics module
          2028 includes components for rendering, displaying, and
    5     animating objects on the touch sensitive display.
          [00391     One or more applications  230 can include any
          applications installed on system 200,   including without
          limitation, a browser, address book, contact list,
          email, instant messaging, word processing, keyboard
  10      emulation, widgets, JAVA-enabled applications,
          encryption, digital rights management, voice
          recognition, voice replication, location determination
          capability (such as that provided by the global
          positioning system   (GPS)), a music player, etc.
  15      [00401     Touch processing module 226  includes various
          software components for performing various tasks
          associated with touch I/O device 212   including but not
          limited to receiving and processing touch input
          received from I/O device 212 via touch I/O device
  20      controller 232.   For example, touch processing
          module 226 can also include software components for
          performing tasks associated with other I/O devices 214.
          That is, touch processing module 226 can receive and
          process inputs received from I/O device 214 via other
  25      I/O controller 234.
          [00411     System 200 may further include notification
          module 238 for performing the method/functions as
          described herein in connection with FIGS. 5-14.
          Notification module 238 may at least function to
  30      monitor notifications that are received from multiple
          applications  (e.g., multiple applications on system 200
          or data providers that are transmitting data to
          system 200).   For example, notification module 238 can

WO 2012/170446                                        PCT/US2012/040962
                                  13
          receive notifications from both non-third party
          applications and third party applications.    In addition,
          notification module 238 can receive push-based
          notifications, trigger-based notifications, and/or
    5     other types of personal notifications.
          [00421    Responsive to receiving the notifications,
          notification module 238 can control the manner in which
          the notifications are displayed while system 200 is
          operating in a locked state or an unlocked state.    For
  10      example, while system 200  is operating in a locked
          state, notification module 238 can display
          notifications in a banner, and control the manner in
          which these notifications are displayed.   As another
          example, notification module 238 can aggregate
  15      notifications that are received, and can provide the
          aggregated notifications as multiple panes in a
          notification center.   Thus, each pane can be associated
          with a different application.   In some embodiments,
          notification module 238 can allow a user to customize
  20      how notifications are displayed on system 200.
          [0043]    In a locked state, system 200 may limit user
          access to certain features.   For example, in a locked
          state, the user may not be able to activate various
          device features, such as placing a telephone call, or
  25      entering en email.   In other words, the locked state is
          meant to prevent inadvertent access to system 200.
          When system 200 is an unlocked state,  the user has full
          access to all features of the  system.
          [00441    Moreover, notification module 238 can provide
  30      a specific type of data formatting to data providers,
          which can then allow the data providers to direct
          particular notifications to various users.   Persons
          skilled in the art will appreciate that any suitable

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   14
          type of formatting may also be used.     For example, in
          order to display a notification on system 200,
          notification module 238 can require a data provider to
          specify the title   (e.g., name of user),  the subtitle
    5     (e.g., the subtitle of an incoming message or alert),
          and the body (e.g., body of the message).
          [0045]    Notification module 238 may also interface
          with touch processing module 226    in order to receive
          user inputs.   In addition, notification module 238 can
  10      interface with graphics module 228 in order to display
          various graphical objects on a display.     Notification
          module 238 may be embodied as hardware, software,
          firmware, or any combination thereof.      Although
          notification module 238 is shown to reside within
  15      medium 201, all or portions of module 238 may be
          embodied within other components within system 200 or
          may be wholly embodied as a separate component within
          system 200.
          [0046]    I/O subsystem 206    is coupled to touch I/O
  20      device 212 and one or more other I/O devices 214 for
          controlling or performing various functions.      Touch I/O
          device 212 communicates with processing system 204 via
          touch I/o device controller 232, which includes various
          components for processing user touch input     (e.g.,
  25      scanning hardware).    One or more other input
          controllers 234  receives/sends electrical signals
          from/to other I/O devices 214.     Other I/O devices  214
          may include physical buttons, dials, slider switches,
          sticks, keyboards, touch pads, additional display
  30      screens, or any combination thereof.
          [0047]    If embodied as    a touch screen, touch I/O
          device 212 displays visual output to the user in a GUI.
          The visual output may include text, graphics, video,

                                  15
          and any combination thereof.     Some or all of the visual
          output may correspond to user-interface objects. Touch
          I/O device 212  forms a touch-sensitive surface that
          accepts touch input from the user.      Touch I/O
    5     device 212 and touch screen controller 232      (along with
          any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
          medium 201)  detects and tracks touches or near touches
          (and any movement or release of the touch) on touch I/O
          device 212 and converts the detected touch input into
  10      interaction with graphical objects, such as one or more
          user-interface objects.    In the case in which
          device 212  is embodied as a touch screen, the user can
          directly interact with graphical objects that are
          displayed on the touch screen.     Alternatively, in the
  15      case in which device 212 is embodied as a touch device
          other than a touch screen    (e.g., a touch pad),   the user
          may indirectly interact with graphical objects that are
          displayed on a separate display screen embodied as I/O
          device 214.
  20       [00481    Touch I/O device 212 may be analogous to the
          multi-touch sensitive surface described in the
          following U.S. Patents:  6,323,846    (Westerman et al.),

          state or states of what is being displayed and/or of
          the computing system.  Feedback may be transmitted
    5     optically (e.g., light signal or displayed image),
          mechanically (e.g., haptic feedback, touch feedback,
          force feedback, or the like), electrically  (e.g.,

          beep or the like), or the like or any combination
  10      thereof and in a variable or non-variable manner.
          [00511    System 200 can also include power system 244
          for powering the various hardware components and may
          include a power management system, one or more power
          sources, a recharging system, a power failure detection
  15      circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status
          indicator and any other components typically associated
          with the generation, management and distribution of
          power in portable devices.
          [00521    In some embodiments, peripherals
  20      interface 216, one or more processors 218, and memory
          controller 220 may be implemented on a single chip,
          such as processing system 204. In some other
          embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
          [00531    Notification module 238 can interface with
  25      one or more Application Programming Interfaces   ("APIs")
          to provide a notification center that can generate
          various types of notifications when system 200 is in
          either a locked state or an unlocked state.
          Furthermore, notification module 238 can provide
  30      multiple settings for customizing the notification
          center.
          [00541    An API is an interface implemented by a
          program code component or hardware component

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                  17
          (hereinafter "API-implementing     component") that allows
          a different program code component or hardware
          component  (hereinafter "API-calling    component")   to
          access and use one or more functions, methods,
    5     procedures, data structures, classes, and/or other
          services provided by the API-implementing component.
         An API can define one or more parameters that are
          passed between the API-calling component and the API
          implementing component.
  10      [0055]     An API allows a developer of an API-calling
          component  (which may be a third party developer) to
          leverage  specified features provided by an API
          implementing component.    There may be one API-calling
          component or there may be more than one such component.
  15     An API can be a source code     interface that a computer
          system or program library provides in order to support
          requests  for services from an application.     An
          operating system (OS) can have multiple APIs to allow
          applications running on the OS to call one or more of
  20      those APIs, and a service    (such as a program library)
          can have multiple APIs to allow an application that
          uses the service to call one or more of those APIs.        An
         API can be specified in terms of a programming language
          that can be interpreted or compiled when an application
  25      is built.
          [0056]     In some embodiments the API-implementing
          component may provide more than one API, each providing
          a different view of or with different aspects that
          access different aspects of    the functionality
  30      implemented by the API-implementing component.       For
          example, one API  of an API-implementing component can
          provide a first set of functions and can be exposed to
          third party developers, and another API of the API-

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                  18
          implementing component can be hidden (not exposed) and
          provide a subset of the first set of functions and also
          provide another set of  functions, such as testing or
          debugging functions which are not in the first set of
    5     functions.   In other embodiments, the API-implementing
          component may itself call one or more other components
          via an underlying API and thus be both an API-calling
          component and an API-implementing component.
          [0057]     An API defines the language and parameters
  10      that API-calling components use when accessing and
          using specified features of the API-implementing
          component.   For example,  an API-calling component
          accesses the specified features of the API-implementing
          component through one or more API calls or invocations
  15      (embodied for example by function or method calls)
          exposed by the API and passes data and control
          information using parameters via the API calls or
          invocations.   The API-implementing component may return
          a value through the API in response to an API call from
  20      an API-calling component.    While the API defines the
          syntax and result of an API call    (e.g., how to invoke
          the API call and what the API call does),    the API may
          not reveal how the API call accomplishes the function
          specified by the API call.    Various API  calls are
  25      transferred via the one or more application programming
          interfaces between the calling    (API-calling component)
          and an API-implementing component.     Transferring the
         API calls may include issuing, initiating, invoking,
          calling, receiving, returning, or responding to the
  30      function calls or messages;   in other words,
          transferring can describe actions by either of the API
          calling component or the API-implementing component.
          The function calls or other   invocations of the API may

          send or receive one or more parameters through a
          parameter list or other structure.   A parameter can be
          a constant, key, data structure, object, object class,
          variable, data type, pointer, array, list or a pointer
    5     to a function or method or another way to reference a
          data or other item to be passed via the API.
          [0058]     Furthermore, data types or classes may be
          provided by the API and implemented by the API
          implementing component. Thus, the API-calling component
  10      may declare variables, use pointers  to, use or
          instantiate constant values of such types or classes by
          using definitions provided in the API.
          [00591     Generally, an API can be used to access a
          service or data provided by the API-implementing
  15      component or to initiate performance of an operation or
          computation provided by the API-implementing component.
          By way of example, the API-implementing component and
          the API-calling component may each be any one of an
          operating system, a library, a device driver, an API,
  20      an application program, or other module   (it should be
          understood that the API-implementing component and the
         API-calling component may be the same or different type
          of module from each other).   API-implementing
          components may in some cases be embodied at least    in
  25      part in firmware, microcode, or other hardware logic.
          In some embodiments, an API may allow a client program
          to use the services provided by a Software Development
          Kit  (SDK) library.  In other embodiments, an
          application or other client program may use an API
  30      provided by an Application Framework.   In these
          embodiments, the application or client program may
          incorporate calls to functions or methods provided by
          the SDK and provided by the API or use data types or

WO 2012/170446                                        PCT/US2012/040962
                                  20
          objects defined in the SDK and provided by the API.     An
         Application Framework may in these embodiments provide
          a main event loop for a program that responds to
          various events defined by the  Framework.  The API
    5     allows the application to specify the events and the
          responses to the events using the Application
          Framework.   In some implementations, an API call can
          report to an application the capabilities or state of a
          hardware device, including those related to aspects
  10      such as input capabilities and state, output
          capabilities and state, processing capability, power
          state, storage capacity and state, communications
          capability, etc.,  and the API may be implemented in
          part by firmware, microcode, or other low level   logic
  15      that executes  in part on the hardware component.
          [00601     The API-calling component may be a local
          component  (e.g., on the same data processing system as
          the API-implementing component) or a remote component
          (e.g., on a different data processing system from the
  20     API-implementing component) that communicates with the
         API-implementing component through the API over a
          network.   It should be understood that an API
          implementing component may also act as an API-calling
          component  (e.g., it may make API calls to an API
  25      exposed by a different API-implementing component),    and
          an API-calling component may also act as an API
          implementing component by implementing an API that is
          exposed to a different API-calling component.
          [00611     The API may allow multiple API-calling
  30      components written in different programming languages
          to communicate with the API-implementing component
          (thus the API may include features for translating
          calls and returns between the API-implementing

          component and the API-calling component); however the
         API may be implemented in terms of a specific
          programming language.   An API-calling  component can, in
          one embedment, call APIs from different providers such
    5     as a set of APIs from an OS provider and another set of
         APIs from a plug-in provider and another set of APIs
          from another provider  (e.g. the provider of a software
          library) or creator of the another set of APIs.
          [0062]    FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an
  10      exemplary API architecture 300, which may be used in
          some embodiments of the invention.    As shown in FIG. 3,
          the API architecture 300   includes the API-implementing
          component 302  (e.g., an operating system, a library, a
          device driver, an API, an application program, software
  15      or other module) that implements the API 304.    API 304
          specifies one or more functions, methods, classes,
          objects, protocols, data structures, formats and/or
          other features of API-implementing component 302 that
          may be used by API-calling component 306.    API 304 can
  20      specify at least one calling convention that specifies
          how a function in API-implementing component 302
          receives parameters from API-calling component 306 and
          how the function returns a result to API-calling
          component 306.   API-calling component 306  (e.g.,  an
  25      operating system, a library, a device driver, an API,
          an application program, software or other module),
          makes API calls through API   304 to access and use the
          features of the API-implementing component   302 that are
          specified by API 304.   API-implementing component 302
  30      may return a value through API 304   to API-calling
          component 306  in response to an API call.
          [00631    It will be appreciated that API-implementing
          component 302 may include additional functions,

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962

          methods, classes, data structures, and/or other
          features that are not specified through API 304 and are
          not available to API-calling component 306.      It  should
          be understood that API-calling component 306 may be on
    5     the same system as API-implementing component     302 or
          may be located remotely and accesses API-implementing
          component 302 using API 304 over a network.      While
          FIG. 3 illustrates a single API-calling component 306
          interacting with API 304, it should be understood that
  10      other API-calling components, which may be written in
          different languages   (or the same language) than API
          calling component 306, may use API   304.
          [00641     API-implementing component 302, API 304,     and
         API-calling component 306 may be stored in a machine
  15      readable medium, which includes any mechanism for
          storing information in a form readable by a machine
          (e.g.,  a computer or other data processing    system).
          For example, a machine-readable medium includes
          magnetic disks, optical disks, random access memory;
  20      read only memory, flash memory devices, etc.
          [0065]     In FIG. 4  ("Software Stack"),   an exemplary
          embodiment, applications can make calls to Services A
          or B using several Service APIs and to Operating System
          (OS) using several OS APIs.    Services A and B can make
  25      calls to OS using several OS APIs.
          [00661     Note that the Service 2 has two APIs, one of
          which (Service 2 API 1) receives calls from and returns
          values to Application 1 and the other     (Service 2 API 2)
          receives calls from and returns values to Application
  30      2.   Service 1  (which can be, for example, a software
          library) makes calls to and receives returned values
          from OS API 1, and Service 2   (which can be, for
          example, a software library) makes calls to and

WO 2012/170446                                             PCT/US2012/040962
                                     23
          receives returned values from both OS API 1 and OS API
          2.   Application 2 makes calls to and receives returned
          values from OS API 2.
          [00671      As discussed above, a notification module of
    5     an electronic device     (e.g., notification module 238 of
          FIG. 2)  can control the manner in which notifications
          are received from applications and then provided to a
          user.   For example, the notification module can
          aggregate notifications that are received from
  10      different applications, and can provide the aggregated
          notifications as a series of panes       (or listings) in a
          notification center.      Accordingly, by accessing the
          notification center, the user can view a listing of
          recently received notifications.       In some cases, the
  15      notification center may only be accessible while the
          electronic device is operating in an unlocked state.
          [0068]      Any suitable approach may be used to invoke
          the notification center.       For example, a user may
          invoke the notification center by pressing a button on
  20      an electronic device.      As another example, when an
          electronic device    (e.g.,   electronic device 100 of
          FIG. 1 or system 200 of FIG. 2)      is a device where
          operation of a predefined set of functions on the
          device is performed through a touch screen and/or a
  25      touchpad   (e.g., touch I/O device 212),     a user can
          invoke the notification center by making a contact or
          by touching graphics on a touch screen.
          [0069]      For instance, referring now to FIG. 5,
          display screen 500 is shown of a home screen of an
  30      electronic device.     Display screen 500 can be the same
          as or can interface with touch I/O device 212 of
          FIG. 2.   Display screen 500 can include multiple
          selectable icons 502.

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                   24
          [00701     The notification module may be configured to
          accept multiple gestures for invoking the notification
          center.  For example, a user can perform a gross swipe
          gesture by quickly flicking one or more fingers in a
    5     downward motion from the top of screen 500.    As another
          example, the user can slowly drag one or more fingers
          downwards from the top of screen 500.
          [00711     The notification module can detect  the swipe
          or drag by the user in a particular region of
  10      screen 500   (e.g., a twenty-pixel region at the top of
          screen 500).    In particular, once the notification
          module detects that there is movement in multiple
          pixels in the twenty-pixel region, the notification
          module can begin to display the notification center.
  15      [00721     In some embodiments, the notification module
          can display the notification center in the same manner
          regardless of the way in which the user invokes the
          notification center.    In other embodiments, the
          notification module can respond differently depending
  20      on the gestures made by user.    For example, if the user
          performed a gross   swipe gesture, the notification
          module can immediately pull down the notification
          center to the bottom of screen 500.    If the user
          instead slowly drags one or more fingers downwards, the
  25      notification module may pull down the notification
          center on screen 500   in real-time.
          [00731     In some cases, a visual indication may be
          displayed on the top of display screen 500 to indicate
          the presence of a notification center.    In other
  30      embodiments   (and as shown in display screen 500),  there
          may be no visual indication of the presence of a
          notification center.    As such, the user can avoid being

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                  25
          distracted while using the electronic device and
          valuable space on the screen can be conserved.
          [0074]     Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
          that instead of the top of display screen 500, the
    5     notification center can be accessed from any suitable
          portion of display screen 500   (e.g., right, left, or
          bottom of display screen 500).    In addition, the
          notification module may allow a user to specify which
          portion of display screen 500 to use for invoking the
  10      notification center.
          [00751     Persons skilled in the art will also
          appreciate that although FIG. 5 shows a home screen,
          the notification center can be invoked at any suitable
          time.   In particular, the notification center may also
  15      be invoked while the device is displaying a particular
          application.
          [0076]     Turning now to FIGS. 6A-6E, display screens
          are shown of a notification center on an electronic
          device.   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
  20      that although notification center is displayed in
          FIGS.  6A-6E while the electronic device is operating in
          a portrait mode, the notification center can also be
          displayed while the electronic device is operating in a
          landscape mode.
  25      [00771     Turning first to FIG. 6A, responsive to a
          user dragging one or more fingers downwards from the
          top of display screen 600, a notification module can
          pull down notification center 602 towards the bottom of
          display screen 600.   Notification center 602  can
  30      include tab 604 at a bottom portion of notification
          center 602.
          [00781     In some cases, in order to remove
          notification center 602 from display screen 600,    the

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   26
          user may need to drag notification center 602 up and
          off of display screen 600.    Persons skilled in the art
          will appreciate that any other suitable approach may be
          used to remove notification center 602 from display
    5     screen 600   (e.g., by pressing a home or an on/off
          button).
          [00791     Turning next to FIG. 6B, display screen 606
          shows notification center 602 being pulled all the way
          to the bottom of screen 606.    Notification center 602
  10      can include one or more panes, where each pane can
          include a widget representing a different application
          on the electronic device.    For example, notification
          center 602 can include weather pane    608, stock
          pane 610,  social network pane 612,  and mail pane 614.
  15      [00801     Notification center 602 can be scrollable,
          such that a user can contact and drag notification
          center 602 up and down in order to view fewer or
          additional notifications.    In some embodiments, only
          certain portions of notification center 602 can be made
  20      scrollable.    As a result, one or more panes may remain
          fixed  (e.g., weather pane 608  and stock pane 612),
          whereas other panes may be scrollable.
          [00811     Weather pane 608 can display the weather for
          the current location of the electronic device.
  25     Alternatively, weather pane 608 can display the weather
          for any default location that a user has specified.
          The user may touch weather pane 608    to open the weather
          application on the device.    In addition, the user may
          swipe weather pane 608   left or right in order to view
  30      weather for other cities.
          [00821     Stock pane 610 can include a scrollable stock
          ticker that scrolls, for example, from right to left
          independent   of any user interaction.   The user may be

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                  27
          able to drag stock pane 610 left or right in order to
          view other hidden or partially-displayed stocks.     In
          some cases, the user may select any one of   the
          individual stock tickers by touching the ticker    (e.g.,
    5     one of stock tickers 617-619).    Responsive to the
          user's selection, the notification module can open a
          stock widget.   The stock widget can be contextually
          based on the selected stock ticker (e.g., the stock
          widget can display detailed stock information
  10      corresponding to the selected corporation).
          [00831    A user may select   (e.g., touch) any pane in
          notification center 602 to access the application
          associated with the pane.    For example, responsive to
          the user selecting social network pane 612,   the
  15      notification module can provide the social network
          application to the user.
          [0084]    Each of panes 608-614 can be associated with
          an option for allowing a user to manually clear out
          notifications from the pane.    For example, button 616
  20      can allow a user to clear notifications out of
          notification center 602 for pane 612.    In particular,
          responsive to a user selecting button 616, the
          notification module can display a "CLEAR" button (e.g.,
          button 616 can roll over, expand, and/or transition
  25      into a "CLEAR" button).    If the user then selects the
          "CLEAR" button, the user can manually remove one or
          more notifications from notification center 602.
          [0085]    In some cases, button 616 can allow a user to
          clear out all of the notifications in a particular pane
  30      (or application).   As a result, the corresponding pane
          can be removed from notification center 602.     However,
          once a new notification is received for that
          application, a pane corresponding to the application

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   28
          can again be displayed in notification center 602.
          Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
          although notifications have been cleared from
          notifications center 602, these notifications may still
    5     be accessible from the applications that generated the
          notifications.   Thus, if the user desires to view
          notifications that have been cleared from notifications
          center 602, he may view those notifications by
          accessing the corresponding applications.
  10      [0086]     Some panes, such as panes 612 and 614 can
          have an associated listing of one or more
          notifications.   For example, social network pane 612
          has listing 613 showing one notification, and email
          pane 614  shows listing 615 showing two email
  15      notifications.   Any suitable number of notifications
          can listed as part of the associated listing.     Each
          displayed notification can be   selected, and upon
          selection, that notification is opened up in the
          application corresponding to its associated pane.      For
  20      example, if the user selects the first email
          notification in listing 615,   that email is opened for
          viewing in the mail application.
          [0087]     Panes that have an associated listing may be
          vertically scrollable   (e.g., a user can scroll from one
  25      pane to the next to view the listings associated with
          each).   Such panes are in contrast with panes 608    and
          610, which are horizontally scrollable.    A user can
          scroll from listing associated pane to listing
          associated pane while panes   such as panes 608 and 610
  30      remain in place.   Thus, at any given moment, the user
          can scroll horizontally in panes 608   and 610,  or scroll
          vertically through listing associated panes.

                                  29
          [00881     Referring now to FIG. 6C, display screen 620
          shows notification center 602, which can include
          calendar pane 622.   Calendar pane 622  can display a
          listing of notifications   (e.g., upcoming events) in a
    5     user's calendar for a pre-determined time period     (e.g.,
          for the upcoming 24 hours).    In some cases, calendar
          pane 622 can organize the upcoming events in
          chronological order.   For example, the most recently
          upcoming event can be displayed at the top of the
  10      listing of notifications,   followed by the next upcoming
          event, and so forth.   Alternatively, the most recently
          upcoming event can be displayed at the bottom of the
          listing of notifications.
          [0089]     Calendar pane 622 can be adjusted in real
  15      time while an event is in progress.    For example, as
          shown in FIG. 6C, notification 621   can include
          text 623, which indicates that the event   "Yoga" started
          40 minutes ago.   The notification module can
          continuously update text 623 while the event is
  20      ongoing.
          [0090]     In some embodiments, a user can specify a
          pre-determined number of notifications to be displayed
          for each application.   Consequently, if the number of
          notifications that can be displayed exceeds the pre
  25      determined number of notifications, the notification
          module can automatically clear out notifications from
          calendar pane 622.   Notification settings  for
          specifying a pre-determined number of notifications
          will be described in more detail in connection with
  30      FIGS.  9E and 9F.
          [0091]     As shown in FIG. 6C, the pre-determined
          number of notifications may be set to five.     Thus, upon
          receipt of a new notification, the notification module

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   30
          can automatically remove a notification that is
          currently being displayed in calendar pane 622.      For
          example, turning now to FIG. 6D, upon receipt of new
          notification 626 from a calendar application, the
    5     notification module can add new notification 626 to the
          top of calendar pane 622.    However, because the number
          of notifications that can be displayed exceeds the pre
          determined number of notifications, the notification
          module can remove notification 628 from calendar
  10      pane 622.   In some cases, notification 628 can be
          associated with an event that has the latest start time
          in comparison to the other events displayed in calendar
          pane 622.   Eventually, once another notification has
          been cleared out of calendar pane 622    (e.g.,
  15      notification 626 has completed or has been dismissed),
          notification 628 can be added back to calendar
          pane 622.
          [00921     Once a calendar event has lapsed, one or more
          notifications corresponding to the event can be
  20      automatically removed from calendar pane 622.      For
          example,  if the event  "Yoga" lasts for an hour,
          notification 621   (FIG. 6C) corresponding to   "Yoga" can
          be cleared out of calendar pane 622 once the event has
          completed.   For instance, as shown in FIG. 6E, the
  25      notification module can automatically remove
          notification 621 from notification center 602 once the
          "Yoga" event has lapsed.    In addition to removing
          notification 621,   the notification module can add new
          notification 632 to calendar pane 622.
  30      [0093]     Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
          that the panes included in FIGS. 6A-6E are merely
          illustrative.   Thus, any suitable panes that are
          associated with one or more applications on the device

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                  31
          may be included in notification center 602.     In some
          cases, notification center 602 may include those
          notifications that are displayed while a device is
          operating in a locked state.    These types of
    5     notifications will be described in more detail in
          connection with FIGS.  8A-8F.
          [0094]    Referring now to FIGS. 6F-6H, several
          illustrative display screens showing display of a
          notification center while a user is actively
  10      participating in a third party application, such as a
          game.  In FIG. 6F, display screen 640 shows an actively
          running third party application such as a game.      While
          participating in the active third party application,
          the user may access a notifications center in
  15      accordance with an embodiment of the invention.      The
          user may access the notifications center by first,
          swiping a finger down from the top of   the screen to
          cause tab 654 to be displayed in screen 650 of FIG. 6G.
          When tab 654 is displayed, the user may then place a
  20      finger on tab 654  and drag it down to reveal
          notification center 662,   as partially shown in screen
          660 of FIG. 6H.   If the user drags tab 654 all the way
          down to the bottom of screen 660, notification center
          662 will be fully shown.
  25      [00951    In some embodiments, while an electronic
          device is operating in an unlocked state, the
          notification module can display one or more banners
          that can correspond to notifications received from
          different applications.    The notification module can
  30      display a banner by, for example, rotating the banner
          on to a display screen.
          [00961    If the user has not selected the banner after
          a pre-determined period of time has lapsed (e.g., 5 or

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                  32
          6 seconds),  the notification module can remove the
          banner from the display screen.    For instance, the
          banner can be rotated out of the display screen.
         Alternatively, the user can push the banner away by
    5     swiping the banner or pushing the banner back.
          [00971     In some embodiments, if two or more banners
          are received by the notification module at
          approximately the same time, the banners can be rotated
          into the display screen around the same time.    That is,
  10      there may be multiple banners  concurrently rotating
          into the display screen.   Alternatively, to minimize
          the distractions to a user, the notification module can
          stagger the displaying of the banners such that only
          one banner is provided at any given time.
  15      [00981     Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
          that any suitable visual approaches can be used for
          displaying banners.   For example, banners can scroll
          across, flip up or drop down, or flutter into a display
          screen.   Moreover, banners can be removed from the
  20      display screen in a similar function.    The notification
          module may allow the user to specify the manner in
          which a banner can be displayed and/or removed.
          [00991     In some cases, if a user ignores or removes a
          banner without accessing the banner, the notification
  25      module can add the notification associated with the
          banner to a notification center   (e.g., notification
          center 602 of FIGS.  6A-6E).  As a result, when the user
          later selects to view the notification center, the
          notification center can provide the user with an
  30      accumulation of all of the notifications that have not
          yet been accessed by the user.
          [01001     Turning now to FIGS. 7A-7E, display screens
          are shown of different types of banners that can be

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                  33
          displayed on an electronic device.    Persons skilled in
          the art will appreciate that banners can be displayed
          at any suitable time while the device is operating in
          an unlocked state  (e.g., while the device is displaying
    5     the home screen or displaying a particular
          application).  For example, banners can be displayed
          while a user is playing a video game, accessing a
          website, modifying system settings, watching a movie,
          and the like.  Persons skilled in the art will
  10      appreciate that although banners are displayed in
          FIGS. 7A-7E while the electronic device is operating in
          a portrait mode, banners   can also be displayed while
          the electronic device is operating in a landscape mode.
          Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that
  15      banners can be displayed in any suitable portion of a
          display screen (e.g., right, left, top, or bottom).       In
          addition, the notification module may allow a user to
          specify which portion of a display screen a banner may
          appear.
  20       [01011   Referring first to FIG.   7A, display
          screen 700 is shown that can include banner 702.
          Banner 702 can represent a notification that was
          recently received  (e.g., a text message that was
          received from a user's contact).    As shown in FIG. 7A,
  25      banner 702 can be displayed while a user is playing a
          video game.
          [01021    Banner 702 can include icon 704,   text 706,
          and media 708.  Icon 704 can indicate   the type of
          application that generated the notification.    Text 706
  30      can include contact information and/or one or more
          portions of the text message that was received.     In
          some cases, text 706 may be a truncated version of the
          full text of the notification   (e.g., text 706 may

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                  34
          include a portion of the body of a text or email).
          Media 708 can be an embedded media that is associated
          with the text message  (e.g., a photo of the contact or
          a media file that was attached to the text message).
    5     [01031    In some embodiments, the notification module
          can detect when a user has selected banner 702    (e.g.,
          by touching banner 702).    Responsive to the user's
          selection, the notification module can present the
          associated notification in the application that
  10      generated the notification.    For example, in response
          to the user selecting banner 702, the notification
          module can display the particular text message
          corresponding to banner 702   in the text message
          application.
  15      [01041    In some embodiments, a user may drag
          banner 702 down to view other notifications that are
          also associated with the application.    Alternatively,
          in response to the user dragging down banner 702, the
          notification module can display the notification
  20      center.  For example, the notification module can
          display the portion of the notification center that
          includes the application panel associated with
          banner 702.  As another example, the notification
          module can display the portion of the notification
  25      center centered about the text message itself.
          [01051    Turning now to FIG. 7B, display screen 710      is
          shown that can include banner 710.    Banner 710 can
          include media 712, which can be a video that was
          attached to the notification.    Persons skilled in the
  30      art will appreciate that media 712 can display any
          suitable media such as,   for example, an image, a video,
          a sound file, a map, an electronic business card, etc.

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   35
          [01061     In addition, banner 710 can include text 713,
          which can indicate that the notification is associated
          with multiple images and videos but not with any text.
          In particular, text 713 can indicate that there are two
    5     more attachments in addition to media 712.     Thus,
          text 713 may change based on the number of attachments
          that are not displayed in banner 710.
          [01071     FIG. 7C shows display screen 716, which can
          include banner 718.   Banner 718 can include map 720,
  10      which can be generated based on a notification that is
          associated with a map URL.     For example, map 720 can be
          a localized map of the immediate vicinity of the
          location associated with the map URL.     In addition,
          map 720 can include a pin that is mounted at a
  15      particular location associated with the map URL     (e.g.,
          the location of a restaurant or a movie theater).
          [0108]     Turning now to FIG. 7D, display screen 722 is
          shown that  includes banner 724.    Banner 724 can be a
          coalesced banner.   That is,   banner 724 can include
  20      information regarding multiple notifications that have
          been queued for a particular application.     For example,
          as shown in FIG. 7D, banner 724 indicates that there
          are 7 new mail notifications for the mail application.
          [0109]     The notification module can also generate
  25      coalesced banners using any other approach.     For
          example, the notification module can detect if two or
          more notifications are associated with at least one
          common parameter  (e.g.,   a particular subject matter).
          In response to detecting that the two or more
  30      notifications are associated with the at least one
          common parameter, the notification module can append
          the two or more notifications into a single message in
          a coalesced banner.   As another example, the

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                   36
          notification module can condense     (e.g., summarize) the
          two or more notifications into a single message in a
          coalesced banner.
          [01101     In some cases, the notification module can
    5     simultaneously display multiple coalesced banners       (e.g.,
          a grouping of banners), where each banner may display a
          single message.    The banners can indicate that there
          are new notifications queued for multiple applications.
          [0111]     A notification module can also provide
  10      banners based on the occurrence of one or more trigger
          events  (e.g., one or more time-based or location-based
          trigger events).    For example, when the notification
          module receives a notification that is associated with
          a time-based trigger event    (e.g., a reminder to perform
  15      a task at a particular time),    the notification module
          can display a banner associated with the event at the
          start of the event or at    a pre-defined time before the
          start of the event.
          [01121     As another example, responsive to receiving a
  20      notification that is associated with a location-based
          trigger event   (e.g., a reminder to buy milk at the
          grocery store),   the notification module can display a
          banner associated with the event when the electronic
          device is detected in the location of a grocery store.
  25      In some embodiments, these alarm banners can include a
          "SNOOZE" button, which can allow the user to stop the
          alarm for a pre-determined period of time.
          [01131     Banners that are displayed on an electronic
          device can be unobtrusive.     That is, banners may not
  30      interfere with a user's access to overlapping controls
          on a display screen.    For example,   referring now to
          FIG. 7E, display screen 726 is shown that can include
          banner 728.   Banner 728 may be overlaid over

          "NOTIFICATIONS" button 730.    Because banner 728   is an
          unobtrusive banner, a user can still press
          "NOTIFICATIONS" button 730 while banner is positioned
          on top of button 730.    In some embodiments, one or more
    5     visual indicators can also be displayed, which can
          indicate to the user that   "NOTIFICATIONS" button 730
          continues to be selectable despite the overlay of
          banner 728.
          [0114]     In some embodiments, the notification module
  10      can control the manner in which notifications are
          displayed while an electronic device is operating in a
          locked state  (e.g., when the electronic device is not
          being used).   In particular, when the device is
          operating in a locked state, one or more notifications
  15      can be received from different applications.     In
          particular, the electronic device may receive one or
          more push events   (e.g., phone calls, voicemails, e
          mails, or a third-party push event) or device alerts
          (e.g., reminders or alarms).
  20       [01151    Responsive to receiving a notification, the
          electronic device can wake up    (e.g., a processor can
          wake up the graphics module),   and the notification
          module can display the received notification on the
          display screen.   In some cases, the notification can be
  25      displayed as a large-format notification.     Turning now
          to FIGS.  8A-8F, display screens are shown of different
          types of notifications that can be displayed while an
          electronic device is operating in a locked state.
          [01161     Turning first to FIG. 8A, display screen 800
  30      is shown that can include notification 802.
          Notification 802 may be displayed after the electronic
          device receives a notification from a third-party
          application while operating in the locked state.      In

WO 2012/170446                                        PCT/US2012/040962
                                 38
          particular, notification 802 can include icon 804,
          which can indicate the application that generated
          notification 802.  In addition, notification 802 can
          include text 806, which can provide associated text or
    5     portions of text received from the application.
          [01171    In response to viewing notification 802, a
          user may select to go directly to the message
          associated with notification 802.   For example, the
          user can access notification 802 by tapping and holding
  10      notification 802.  Responsive to the user's actions,
          the notification module can display  (e.g., by animating
          notification 802) a slider on the display screen (e.g.,
          by flipping notification 802 to a backside view).    For
          example, referring now to FIG. 8B, display screen 808
  15      can include slider 810, which can be embedded as a
          component on a back side of notification 802.    A user
          may activate slider 810 by dragging slider button 812
          in a particular direction  (e.g., to the right).
          [01181    Once the notification module detects that
  20      slider 810 has been activated, the notification module
          can directly unlock the electronic device.   After
          unlocking the device, the notification module can
          present to the user the particular notification in the
          application that generated the notification.   In some
  25      cases, even if the electronic device has received
          multiple notifications from a particular application,
          the notification module can bypass other notifications,
          and present the particular notification that the user
          has specifically requested.
  30      [0119]    Referring now to FIG. 8C, display screen 814
          is shown, which can include notification 816.
          Notification 816 may be displayed in response to an
          image text message that is received by the electronic

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   39
          device.  In particular, notification 816 can include
          embedded image 818.    In addition, notification 816 can
          include text 819, which can provide the identity of the
          person who sent the text message.    Furthermore,
    5     notification 816 can include text   820, which can be
          text accompanying the image.    As shown in FIG. 8C,
          image 818 can be prominently displayed in
          notification 816   (e.g., image 818 can be enlarged
          relative to texts 819 and 820).
  10      [0120]     Similar to FIGS.  8A and 8B,  if the user
          selects to access notification 816    (e.g., by tapping
          and holding notification 816),   the notification module
          can display a slider.    If the user then activates the
          slider by dragging the slider, the notification module
  15      can unlock the device and provide image 818 directly to
          the user  (e.g., display image 818 in an image view of a
          chat application).
          [01211     Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
          that the notification module can display any suitable
  20      type(s) of media in a notification.     For example, a
          notification can include one or more sound(s),
          electronic business card(s), video(s),    and map URL(s)
          (e.g., the notification module can display a map of the
          location of the URL).    In addition, similar to
  25      coalesced banners, the notification module can display
          information associated with multiple notifications that
          have been queued for a particular application in a
          single notification.
          [01221     Moreover, notifications can be displayed in
  30      response to one or more trigger events (e.g., time
          based or location-based trigger events).     For example,
          responsive to receiving a notification that is
          associated with a location-based trigger event, the

WO 2012/170446                                            PCT/US2012/040962
                                   40
          notification module can display a notification
          associated with the event once the electronic device is
          detected at the location of the trigger event.
          [01231     As another example, when the notification
    5     module receives a notification that is associated with
          a time-based trigger event, the notification module can
          display a notification associated with the event at the
          start of the event or at a pre-defined time before the
          start of the event.    For example, turning now to
  10      FIG. 8D, display screen 822    is shown with
          notification 824.    Notification 824 can include
          text 826, which can indicate that notification 824 is
          displayed in response to a time-based trigger event
          (e.g.,  an alarm).   In addition, text 826 can provide a
  15      description of the alarm.
          [01241     Notification 824 can further include      "SNOOZE"
          button 828.    In response  to the user selecting "SNOOZE"
          button 828, the notification module can stop the alarm
          for a pre-determined period of time.      As a result of
  20      this function, the user is able to control an alarm
          without having to unlock the electronic device.
          [01251     Display screens 800    (FIG. 8A), 808  (FIG. 8B),
          814  (FIG. 8C),  and 822  (FIG. 8D) can include pull-down
          option 830, which can be positioned above a
  25      notification that is displayed.      Persons skilled in the
          art will appreciate that although pull-down option 830
          is shown in FIGS.   8A-8D as being above a notification,
          pull-down option 830 can be positioned in any suitable
          location in a display screen (e.g.,     left, right, or
  30      bottom of the display screen).      In addition, if the
          electronic device is in a sleep mode, a user may be
          able to view pull-down option 830 by pressing a button

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                  41
          (e.g., an on/off and/or home button) on the electronic
          device.
          [0126]    Pull-down option 830 can allow a user to view
          previously received notifications    (e.g., all of the
    5     notifications received while the electronic device was
          operating in the locked state).    A user can select
          pull-down option 830 by dragging option 830 in a
          downward motion on the display screen.
          [0127]    Referring now to FIG. BE, display screen 832
  10      shows list of notifications 834, which can be a list of
          previously received notifications.     In particular, when
          each notification of  list of notifications 834 was
          first received, the notification may have been
          displayed as a large-format notification     (e.g., as
  15      shown in FIGS. 8A-8D).   However, because the user did
          not respond to the notification, the notification was
          then added to list of notifications 834 as an
          individual element.   In some embodiments, the first
          displayed instance of a notification in locked mode can
  20      be larger than when the same notification is shown in
          list of notifications 834.    For instance,
          notifications 802  (FIG. 8B),  816  (FIG. 8C),  and 824
          (FIG. 8D) can be larger than elements 835,     837,
          and 838, respectively.   That is,  elements 835,    837,
  25      and 838 can be displayed in a small format.
          [0128]    The individual elements of list of
          notifications 834 can be stacked on top of each other.
          For example, the notification module can display
          multiple text messages received by the electronic
  30      device as individual elements in list of
          notifications 834.
          [01291    In some embodiments, list of
          notifications 834 can be arranged based on a time that

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                  42
          each notification was received (e.g., based on a
          chronological order).   That is, the most recently
          received notification can be appended to the top of
          list of notifications 834.    Alternatively, the most
    5     recently received notification can be appended to the
          bottom of list of notifications 834.    As shown in
          FIG. 8E, for example, list of notifications 834 is
          arranged in a chronological order, with the most recent
          notification at the top of list 834.
  10      [0130]    In other embodiments, list of
          notifications 834 can be arranged based on a user
          selected parameter.   For example, a user can specify
          which application's notifications should appear first,
          second, third, and so forth.    Based on the user
  15      selected parameter, the notification module can sort
          the received notifications.    For example, notifications
          corresponding to each application can be first grouped
          together, and the applications can then be arranged in
          a pre-determined order.    For instance, notifications
  20      corresponding to voicemails can be listed first,
          notifications corresponding to e-mails can be listed
          second, and notifications corresponding to text
          messages can be listed third, etc.    A user's selection
          of the manner in which list of notifications 834 is
  25      arranged will be described in more detail in connection
          with FIG. 9B.
          [01311    List of notifications 834 can be scrollable.
          In particular, region 836 of display screen 832 can be
          made scrollable, such that list of notifications 834
  30      can move up or down when the user either swipes or
          drags a portion of region 830.    As a result, list of
          notifications 834 can be capable of displaying a large
          number of notifications (e.g., all of the notifications

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   43
          that have been received while a device is operating in
          a locked state).    In some embodiments, list of
          notifications can be automatically displayed regardless
          of whether pull-down option 830 was displayed and
    5     manipulated by a user.
          [01321     In addition, each notification in list of
          notifications 834 can be individually accessible.      For
          example, each notification can be associated with its
          own slider.   Similar to the discussion above, a user
  10      may select to access a notification in list of
          notifications 834 by tapping and holding the
          notification.   For example, the user can tap and hold
          notification 838, and responsive to the user's actions,
          the notification can display a slider in list of
  15      notification 834   (e.g., by flipping notification 838 to
          a backside view).
          [01331     Turning now to FIG. 8F,   display screen 840
          shows listing of notifications 834 with a backside view
          of notification 838.    In particular, notification 838
  20      can include slider 842.     Similar to slider 810
          (FIG. 8B),  slider 842 can be an embedded component in
          notification 838.    A user can activate slider 842 by
          dragging slider button 844 in one direction (e.g., to
          the right of display screen 840).
  25      [01341     Once the user actives slider 842,   the
          notification module can detect that slider 844 has been
          activated, and the module can unlock the electronic
          device.   After unlocking the device, the notification
          module can present the particular notification in the
  30      application that generated the notification.
          [0135]     In some embodiments, the user may select to
          unlock the device.    For example, the user may select to
          unlock the device by pressing a button (e.g., an on/off

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   44
          and/or a home button) or sliding "UNLOCK" slider 846.
          Responsive to the user's actions, the notification
          module can display a notification center on the display
          screen (e.g., similar to notification center 602 of
    5     FIGS.  6A-6E).   In other embodiments, in response to the
          user unlocking the device, the notification module may
          not display the notification center until    the user
          specifically invokes the notification center.     In some
          embodiments,   "UNLOCK" slider 846  (or other user input
  10      unlocking region) can include context sensitive text
          that changes based on when a notification is received.
          For example, if an email is received and displayed in
          the list of notifications 834, the text state "slide to
          read."   As another example, if a reminder notification
  15      is received, the text may state "slide to view."
          [01361     In some cases, the notification module may
          allow a user to specify a privacy setting.     Thus, if
          the user selects to turn on the privacy setting, one or
          more notifications or types of notifications    (e.g.,
  20      notifications associated with text messages) received
          when the electronic device is in a locked state are not
          displayed while the device remains in that state.
          Then, once the user selects to unlock the device, the
          notification module can display the received
  25      notifications in one or more banners    (e.g., similar to
          banners of   FIGS. 7A-7E).
          [01371     As discussed previously, because users may
          have different preferences for how they would like
          notifications to be displayed, the electronic device
  30      can allow users to customize notification settings.        In
          particular, a user may be able to customize
          notification settings for the locked (e.g.,

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                   45
          notifications) and unlocked states     (e.g., the
          notification center and banners).
          [0138]    Referring back to FIG. 5, display screen 500
          can include "SETTINGS" option 504.      In particular, the
    5     user may select "SETTINGS" option 504 to change one or
          more settings of the electronic device.      Thus,
          responsive to the user selecting "SETTINGS" option 504,
          the electronic device can provide display screens
          allowing the user to change system settings.       For
  10      example, turning now to FIGS.    9A-9F, display screens
          associated with customizing notification settings are
          shown.
          [01391    Referring first to FIG.    9A, display
          screen 900 is shown to include list of settings      902,
  15      which can be displayed after the user selects
          "SETTINGS" option 504   (FIG. 5).   List of settings   902
          can include "NOTIFICATIONS" option 904.      A user may
          select "NOTIFICATIONS" option 904 to access and modify
          one or more notification settings     (e.g., by tapping on
  20      "NOTIFICATIONS" option 904).
          [0140]    in response to detecting that the user has
          selected "NOTIFICATIONS" option 904,     the electronic
          device can provide one or more notification settings on
          a display screen.  These notification settings can
  25      allow a user to change one or more banner options or
          notification center options   (e.g., when an electronic
          device is in an unlocked state) or one or more
          notification options   (e.g., when an electronic device
          is in a locked state).    For example, referring next to
  30      FIG. 9B, display screen 906 is shown, which can include
          multiple notification settings.
          [01411    For example, display screen 906 can include
          manual sorting option 908 and automatic sorting

                                   46
          option 910.   Sorting options 908 and 910 are user
          selected parameters that can specify the order in which
          notifications are displayed in one or more contexts
          such as, for example, in a list of notifications (e.g.,
    5     list  of notifications 834 of FIGS. 8E and 8F).
          [01421     If a user selects sorting option 908, a
          notification module   (e.g., notification module 238 of
          FIG. 2)  can allow the user   (e.g., provide options  to
          the user) to manually specify the order in which
  10      notifications are displayed in a list of notifications.
          That is,  the user can specify which application's
          notifications should appear first, second, and so
          forth.   Based on the user's selection of sorting
          option 906, the notification module can sort the
  15      received notifications based on the user-specified
          order.
          [0143]     In some embodiments, the order in which the
          applications are sorted can correspond to the order in
          which applications are listed in the "In Notification
  20      Center" group 911.   In other embodiments, the
          electronic device can display a different display
          screen (not shown) that can allow the user to specify
          the order in which the applications are to be sorted.
          [0144]     Once the notification module has sorted
  25      notifications in groups based on corresponding
          applications, the notification can assign a pre
          determined order for each group.     For example, for each
          group, the notification module can arrange the
          associated notifications based on the time of receipt
  30      of each notification   (e.g., based on a chronological
          order).   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
          that any other pre-determined order can be used
          instead.

                                   47
          [01451     In contrast,  if a user selects sorting
          option 910, the notification module can assign a pre
          determined order for displaying notifications in the
          list of notifications.     In particular, the notification
    5     module can arrange the received notifications based on
          the time of receipt of each notification     (e.g., based
          on a chronological order).     That is, the most recently
          received notification can be appended to the top (or
          bottom) of a list of notifications.     If a newer
  10      notification is received, the top notification can be
          pushed down in the list of notifications.
          [01461     Display screen 906 can also include
          options 912, which can allow a user to specify which
          applications to display in a notification center (e.g.,
  15      notification center 602 of FIGS. 6A-6E).      As shown in
          display screen 906, options 912 can include multiple
          interactive lists   (e.g.,  "In Notification Center"
          group 911 and "Not in Notification Center" group 913).
          Notifications for applications that are included in the
  20      "In Notification Center" group 911 are displayed in the
          notification center.    By contrast, notifications for
          applications that are included in the "Not in
          Notification Center" group 913 are excluded from the
          notification center.
  25      [01471     A user may specify which applications to
          include in the notification center using any suitable
          approach.   For example, the user can manually adjust
          options 912 by selecting "EDIT" option 914.      In
          response  to the user selecting   "EDIT" option 914,   the
  30      electronic device can provide a display screen that
          allows the user to manually move applications in and
          out of groups  911 and 913.

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                    48
          [01481     Turning now to FIG. 9C, display screen 920
          can be shown in response to the user's selection of
          "EDIT" option 914    (FIG. 9B).   As shown in display
          screen 920, the user can move each of the options 912
    5     in or out of   "In Notification Center" group 911 and
          "Not in Notification Center" group 913.      For example,
          the user can tap and drag option 922 from the "Not in
          Notification Center" group 913 to the     "In Notification
          Center" group 911.
  10      [0149]     FIG. 9D shows display screen 924, which can
          be displayed after option 922 has been moved to the
          bottom of the "In Notification Center" group 911.       In
          some cases, the order in which the applications are
          arranged in the    "In Notification Center" group 911 can
  15      dictate the order in which application panes will be
          displayed in the notification center.      For instance,
          based on "In Notification Center" group 911 of FIG. 9D,
          the notification center can include a weather panel on
          top, followed by a mail panel, and so forth.
  20     Accordingly, the user may adjust the order in which
          application panes are displayed in the notification
          center by moving each of options     922, 926, 928, or 930
          up or down   (e.g., by tapping and dragging each option).
          [0150]     Once the user has    finished editing the
  25      applications to be displayed in a notification center,
          the user may select    "DONE" option 932.   After the
          user's selection, the electronic device can return to a
          display screen similar to display screen 906 of
          FIG. 9B.
  30      [0151]     As another example, the user may specify
          which applications are to be displayed in a
          notification center by tapping on an option in
          options 912.    For example, referring to FIG. 9B,    the

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                  49
          user can select "MAIL" option 916.    In response to the
          user's selection, the electronic device can provide a
          detailed view of display options for the "MAIL"
          application.
    5     [01521     Turning now to FIG. 9E,  display screen 940
          can provide a detailed view of display options for the
          "MAIL" application.   Display screen 940 can include
          switch 941, which can allow a user to specify whether
          to include notifications received from the "MAIL"
  10      application in the notification center.     In particular,
          if the user sets switch 941 to "ON", notifications
          received from the "MAIL" application will be displayed
          in the notification center.    If the user instead sets
          switch 941 to  "OFF", notifications received from the
  15      "MAIL" application will not be displayed in the
          notification center.
          [01531     If notifications from an application have
          been selected to be included in the notification
          center, the user may specify a pre-determined number of
  20      notifications to be displayed for that application by
          selecting  "SHOW" option 942.
          [01541     Referring now to FIG. 9F, the electronic
          device can provide display screen 950, which can be
          displayed in response to the user selecting "SHOW"
  25      option 942.   Display screen 950 can include list of
          options 952, in which each option of the list can allow
          a user to specify a different number of notifications
          to be displayed for an application in the notification
          center  (e.g., one, five, or  ten notifications).    For
  30      example, in response to the user selecting option 954,
          the application pane corresponding to the mail
          application (e.g., application pane 614 of FIG. 6B) can
          display a maximum of ten notifications.     In some cases,

WO 2012/170446                                             PCT/US2012/040962
                                    50
          based on the frequency of updates, the pre-determined
          number of notifications may be set to a higher number
          for some applications    (e.g., an e-mail or social
          network application),    and may be set to a lower number
    5     for other applications     (e.g., a weather application).
          [01551     Persons skilled in the art will      appreciate
          that options provided in list of options       952 are merely
          illustrative.    In particular, the electronic device can
          alternatively provide one or more options that allow
  10      the user to specify any pre-determined number of
          notifications   (e.g., one, five,    ten, twenty or more
          items,  and so on).
          [01561     Based on the pre-determined number of
          notifications, a notification module can automatically
  15      clear out notifications from an application pane when
          the number of notifications that can be displayed
          exceeds the pre-determined number       (e.g., as shown in
          FIGS. 6C and 6D).    Because the notification module can
          automatically remove one or more notifications that
  20      exceed the pre-determined number of notifications, the
          notification module is able to provide a concise
          presentation of notifications in the notification
          center.   Moreover, this approach is convenient for
          users because users do not have to clear notifications
  25      out of the notification center (by, for example,
          selecting button 616 of FIG. 6B).
          [01571     Referring back to FIG. 9E, display screen 940
          can further include option 943,      which can allow a user
          to select whether to display notifications associated
  30      with the application while an electronic device is
          operating in the locked state      (e.g., in the display
          screens of FIGS.   8A-8F).    In some embodiments, user can
          opt-in to option 943.     That is, option 943 can have a

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                   51
          default state of "OFF", such that notifications that
          are received while the device is in the locked state
          are not displayed until the device is switched to the
          unlocked state.
    5     [01581     This setting can be advantageous because it
          allows a user to customize the display of notifications
          based on privacy concerns.    For example, the user may
          not want new e-mail messages to appear on the display
          screen while the device is operating in the locked
  10      state.   Once the user unlocks  the device, however, the
          user may want to be able to see the received e-mail
          messages by invoking the notification center or through
          one or more banners.    If, however, the user selects to
          set option 943 to   "ON", the notification module can
  15      immediately display new notifications received while
          the device is in the locked state.
          [01591     Options 944 can allow a user to specify how
          notifications are to be displayed while an electronic
          device is operating in an unlocked state.     For example,
  20      options 944 can include "NONE" option 945,    "BANNERS"
          option 946, and   "ALERTS" option 947.
          [01601     In response  to the user selecting  "NONE"
          option 945, the notification module can suppress visual
          notifications for a particular application.     However,
  25      the notifications can still be displayed in a
          notification center.    Alternatively, in response to the
          user selecting   "BANNERS" option 946,  the notification
          module can display received notifications as one or
          more banners on the display screen    (e.g., banners  shown
  30      in FIGS.  7A-7E).   The user may, for example,  select
          "BANNERS" option 946   if a particular application
          transmits important but frequently generated
          notifications.

WO 2012/170446                                            PCT/US2012/040962
                                    52
          [01611     In response   to the user selecting   "ALERTS"
          option 947, the notification module can display
          received notifications as messages that require a
          user's response    (e.g., the user is required to select a
    5     "DISMISS" option or a "VIEW" option depending on the
          type of application).
          [0162]     Display screen 940 can also include "BADGE
         APP ICON" option 948, which can indicate whether to
          display a picture of the application in a banner
  10      corresponding to a notification that is received.        For
          example,  if  "BADGE APP ICON" option 948 is set to "ON",
          the notification module can display an icon
          representing the application that generated the
          notification   (e.g.,  icon 704 of FIG. 7A).   If "BADGE
  15     APP ICON" option 948     is instead set to  "OFF", the
          notification module will not display icons in the
          banners corresponding to the application.      Persons
          skilled in the art will appreciate that in addition to
          or instead of a picture of the application, "BADGE APP
  20      ICON" can enable the notification module to add any
          other visual embellishments to a banner.
          [01631     "SOUNDS" option 949 can indicate whether to
          enable sounds upon receipt of a notification for the
          application.    If "SOUNDS" option 949 is set to     "OFF",
  25      no sounds will be played when a notification is
          received for the application.     If "SOUNDS" option 949
          is instead set to "ON", the notification can play audio
          alerts when a new notification of the application is
          received.    As a result, even if  "NONE" option 945 is
  30      selected for a particular application     (e.g., there are
          no visual notifications),    the user may still hear audio
          alerts when new notifications are received for that
          application.    As a result of hearing the audio alerts,

WO 2012/170446                                          PCT/US2012/040962
                                  53
          a user may later choose to invoke the notification
          center in order to access the notifications.     Persons
          skilled in the art will appreciate that the
          notification settings discussed in FIGS. 9A-9F are
    5     merely illustrative, and that any other suitable
          notification settings can be made customizable.
          [01641    As discussed previously, a notification
          module can be implemented on any suitable electronic
          device.  For example, the notification module can be
  10      implemented on an electronic device with a large
          display and/or touch screen   (e.g., touch I/O device 212
          of FIG. 2).   In such embodiments, the notification
          center may not fill the entire screen as it does on a
          smaller device.
  15      [01651     For instance, turning now to FIGS.   10A-10C,
          display screens are shown for an electronic device with
          a large display.   Referring first to FIG. 10A, display
          screen 1000 shows that notification center 1002 does
          not fill the entirety of display screen 1000.
  20       [01661    Furthermore, for a device with a large
          display, the notification module may display a visual
          indication when the notification center does not
          include any new notifications.    For example, as shown
          in display screen 1004 of FIG. 10B,   the notification
  25      module can indicate that notification center 1002
          currently contains no new notifications.    Persons
          skilled in the art will appreciate that such an
          indication can also be provided on an electronic device
          with a smaller display.
  30      [0167]     Referring now to FIG. 10C,  display
          screen 1006 shows the type of notifications that may be
          displayed when an electronic device with a large screen
          is in both a locked state and a landscape mode.      Thus,

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                   54
          in contrast to FIGS. 8A-8F, new notifications that are
          received are not first displayed as large individual
          notifications on the display screen.      Rather, the new
          notifications are displayed in scrollable list of
    5     notifications 1008.    Consequently, there may be no need
          for the notification module to display a pull-down
          option such as pull-down option 830 of FIGS.     8A-8D.
          Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that list of
          notifications 1008 can be displayed in a similar manner
  10      when the device is in a portrait mode.
          [01681     Persons skilled in the art will also
          appreciate that each of the notifications in list of
          notifications 1008 can exhibit similar characteristics
          as the notifications in list of notifications 834
  15      (FIGS. 8E and 8F).    In addition, persons skilled in the
          art will appreciate that the display screens shown in
          FIGS.  10A-10C are merely one embodiment of    the
          notification center.    Thus, a notification module
          implemented on an electronic device with a large
  20      display can display notifications in any suitable
          manner  (e.g., similar to the manner in which
          notifications are provided in FIGS. 6A-6E, FIGS.      7A-7E,
          FIGS.  8A-8F, and FIGS.  9A-9F).
          [0169]     Turning now to FIGS. 11-14,    flowcharts of
  25      illustrative processes are shown in accordance with
          various embodiments of   the invention.    These processes
          may be executed by one or more components of     an
          electronic device   (e.g., device 100 of FIG. 1 or
          system 200 of FIG. 2).     For example, at least some of
  30      the steps in the processes of FIGS. 11-14 may be
          performed by a notification module     (e.g., notification
          module 238 of FIG. 2).     In addition, persons skilled in
          the art will appreciate that some of the steps may be

WO 2012/170446                                            PCT/US2012/040962
                                   55
          performed in conjunction with a touch processing module
          (e.g., touch processing module 226 of FIG. 2) and/or a
          graphics module   (e.g., graphics module 228 of FIG. 2).
          [01701     Turning first to FIG. 11,    process 1100 is
    5     shown for displaying a pull-down option in response to
          receiving multiple notifications.      Process 1100 may
          begin at  step 1102, and, at step 1104, the notification
          module can receive a plurality of notifications from at
          least one application.
  10      [0171]     Then, at step 1106,   the notification module
          can detect that the electronic device is operating in a
          locked state.   Continuing to step 1108,    the
          notification module can provide a pull-down option
          (e.g., pull-down option 830 of FIGS. 8A-8D) associated
  15      with the plurality of notifications.      In addition, the
          notification module can also provide a notification on
          a display screen   (e.g., notification 802 of FIGS. 8A
          and 8B, notification 816 of FIG. 8C, or
          notification 824 of FIG. 8D),    where the displayed
  20      notification can be the one that was most recently
          received.
          [01721     After providing the pull-down option,
          process 1100 may move to step 1110.      At step 1110, the
          notification module can determine that a user has
  25      selected the pull-down option.     Then, at step 1112, the
          notification module can provide a list of the plurality
          of notifications to the user    (e.g.,  list of
          notifications 834 of FIGS.   BE and 8F).    Process 1100
          may then end at  step 1114.
  30      [0173]     Turning now to FIG. 12,   process  1200 is shown
          for displaying a notification center.      Process 1200 may
          begin at  step 1202, and, at step 1204, the notification
          module can receive a plurality of notifications, where

WO 2012/170446                                         PCT/US2012/040962
                                   56
          the plurality of notifications can include at least one
          of a push-based notification (e.g., a notification from
          a non-third party or third party application) and a
          trigger-based notification (e.g., an alarm or a
    5     reminder).
          [01741     Then, at step 1206,  the notification module
          can detect that an electronic device is in an unlocked
          state.   After detecting that the device is in the
          unlocked state, process 1200 may move to step 1208.
  10      [0175]     At step 1208, the notification module can
          detect that a user has selected to access a
          notification center.    For example, the notification
          module can detect that the user has performed a gross
          swipe gesture   (e.g., by quickly flicking one or more
  15      fingers in a downward motion from the top of a display
          screen).   As another example, the notification module
          can detect that the user has slowly dragged one or more
          fingers downwards from the top of display screen.
          [01761     Continuing to step 1210,  the notification
  20      module can display the notification center, where the
          notification center can include a plurality of panes
          associated with the plurality of notifications (e.g.,
          panes 608-614 of FIG. 6B).    Process 1200 may then end
          at step 1212.
  25      [01771     Referring now to FIG. 13,  a flowchart of
          illustrative process   1300 is shown for providing a
          banner.   Process 1300 may begin at step 1302, and, at
          step 1304,  the notification module can receive a
          notification from at least one application.    At
  30      step 1306, the notification module can detect that an
          electronic device is in an unlocked state.
          [01781     Continuing to step 1308,  the notification
          module can provide a banner associated with the

WO 2012/170446                                           PCT/US2012/040962
                                   57
          notification, where the banner allows a user to access
          at least one control overlapping with the banner.       For
          example, as shown in FIG. 7E,   the notification module
          can provide banner 728 that overlaps with
    5     "NOTIFICATIONS" button 730.    However, the notification
          module can nonetheless allow a user to access
          "NOTIFICATIONS" button 730.    After providing the banner,
          process 1300 may end at step 1310.
          [0179]     Referring now to FIG. 14,   a flowchart of
  10      illustrative process   1400 is shown for providing
          notification settings.    Process 1400 may begin at
          step 1402,  and, at step 1404,  the notification module
          can provide an option to modify settings for device
          notifications   (e.g., "NOTIFICATIONS" option 904 of
  15      FIG. 9A),   Then, at step 1406, the notification module
          can detect that a user has selected the option.
          [0180]     Continuing to step 1408,   the notification
          module can provide a plurality of notification
          settings, where   the plurality of notification settings
  20      can include options associated with one or more of an
          order of notifications option    (e.g., options 912 of
          FIG. 9B),  a number of notifications option    (e.g., list
          of options 952 of FIG. 9F),   and alert style options
          (e.g.,  alert style options 944 of FIG.   9E).
  25      Process 1400 may then end at step 1410.
          [0181]      It should be understood that processes 1100,
          1200,  1300, and 1400 of FIGS. 11-14 are merely
          illustrative.    Any of the steps may be removed,
          modified, or combined, and any additional steps may be
  30      added, without departing from the scope of the
          invention.
