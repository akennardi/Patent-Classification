   Background of the Invention
   Gaming is implemented by many types of gaming systems,
   providing many different types of games.                            These include
   traditional type casino games, such as roulette, Keno,
25 bingo and many others, all of which may nowadays be
   implemented in electronic form                           (in many cases utilising
   video display screens).                           These also include gaming systems
   which comprise a game controller arranged to control the
   random display of several symbols                           from a pre-determined
30 set of symbols and to determine a game outcome such as a
   game win, based on the displayed symbols.                            Such gaming
   systems may commonly be implemented as a stepper machine
   provided with reels, with each reel carrying several
   symbols of the set, or a video machine wherein selected
35 symbols are displayed on virtual reels in a graphical
   display device.                           Win outcomes can occur based on  symbols
   appearing on one or more horizontal lines, diagonal lines,

                                                      - 2
   or in any other pre-determined way.
                Known gaming systems and gaming machines                  (such as
   Electronic Gaming Machines, "EGMs"),                          use various lighting
   and sound effects to attract,                          stimulate and entertain
 5 players, and also to provide information on progression of
   a game, which may be an individual game played on the
   machine or a linked game played by several players.
   Separate displays may be provided for displaying different
   information on different games, advertising or other
10 information.                          The provision of separate displays or
   displays which provide different gaming and advertising
   information from the "main" game played on the machine,
   may require construction of expensive apparatus,
   particularly where the displays are implemented in an EGM.
15              In some gaming apparatus, such as EGMs,                  a "main"
   display may be provided for displaying aspects of a main
   game,           for example symbol selection games such as discussed
   above, and a secondary display, usually mounted above the
   main display in a "top box", may be provided to display
20 other information.                          The other information may include
   information on other games, such as games played on the
   EGM, progressive                         jackpot levels,  and/or various
   illuminated or video artwork associated with the EGM.
                These secondary displays are part of the EGM and
25 therefore add to the expense of the EGM.                           They are
   designed specifically to operate within and as part of the
   EGM.
                It        is known to provide "toppers" which are            separate
   displays units that may be mounted to an EGM.                            Commonly,
30 toppers merely display artwork                          (which may be illuminated)
   associated with the EGM or are driven by another device,
   such as a jackpot controller, for example, to show the
   progression of a linked jackpot.                           These toppers are
   usually machine specific.                          That is, they are designed for
35 particular EGM, or a particular linked game.                           Typically
   these toppers are in the form of backlit printed glass
   bearing the name of the game.                           Inasmuch as the printed
   7155724_1 (GHMatters) P76506.AU.2 ROBYNH

                                                  - 3
   glass is a fixed medium, the toppers have been designed to
   identify the game to players from a distance                     so the
   players can find the game among other games on the casino
   floor.

                The server may be a server of a gaming establishment
   arranged to control the display unit to display
10 information desired by the gaming establishment                         (e.g.
   Casino).                     It may be a     jackpot controller  (JPC) arranged to
   control the display to display information about a
   jackpot,                  such as a linked jackpot.        It may be any other
   server.                   In an embodiment, the display circuitry is
15 selectively arranged to communicate with the server and
   the game controller to display information under control
   of either or both the server and game controller.                          Where
   the display circuitry includes a display controller, the
   controller may be arranged to communicate with or be
20 controlled by the game controller and/or server.
                In an embodiment, the display circuitry is arranged
   to enable communication with any one of a plurality of
   different game controllers, so that it may display
   information under the control of any of the plurality of
25 game controllers.                         The display unit may be mountable to
   one of several different electronic gaming machines(EGMs)
   which are arranged to play different games, and display
   information relating to that particular game,                         for example.
   The display unit may be generic, and able to be used with
30 different EGMs.
                In an embodiment, the display apparatus is arranged
   to be used with a configurable EGM.                         A configurable EGM is
   one which can be configured to play different games.                          For
   example, different                        software may be downloaded to the
35 configurable EGM to enable it to play different games.
   The         software may be downloaded from a remote server over a
   network.                    The display circuitry is responsive to the
   7155724_1 (GHMatters) P76506.AU.2 ROBYNH

                                                   -  5
   configurable EGM to display information associated with
   the particular software that has been downloaded, for
   example, the particular game that has been downloaded.
                In an embodiment, the display apparatus comprises a
 5 housing mounting the display unit and display circuitry.
   The housing is arranged to be mounted to an EGM.                         In an
   embodiment, the housing forms a "topper" arranged to be
   mounted to the top of an EGM to provide a further display.
   In an embodiment, the housing may be selectively mounted
10 to different types of EGMs,                       for example EGMs playing
   different games.
                In an embodiment, the display circuitry is arranged
   to communicate wirelessly with an EGM and/or server.
                It        is an advantage of at least an embodiment of the
15 invention to provide a versatile display device positioned
   on the EGM as a topper which can be selectively mounted to
   different types of EGMs and which can be controlled by the
   EGM and/or servers,                      such as,  for example, casinos servers,
   to display gaming related information.                        The information
20 may include information on a game being played on the EGM,
   advertising information, other promotional information
   provided on behalf of the casino, or generally any

   EGMs.              The display apparatus, in an embodiment, is
   effectively a generic displayer which can be attached to
   different types of EGMs.                       This  can therefore take the
   place of displays which would otherwise have to be
30 particularly designed for an EGM.
                In some embodiments the memory further stores
   software configurable to enable the display circuitry to
   selectively configure to communicate with external devices
   of different types.                       The controller of the display
35 apparatus configures to selectively communicate with the
   external device based on external device type.
                It        is an advantage of at least an embodiment of the

   Detailed Description of Embodiments
                Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming
   system, which in this embodiment includes an Electronic
   Gaming Machine                           (reference numeral 10,   Figure 2)   and a
15 display apparatus                           (reference numeral 40,    Figure 2 and also
   other forms which will be described later on with
   reference to other drawings) in accordance with an
   embodiment of the present invention.
                In this embodiment, the display apparatus 40                       is
20 arranged to be mounted to the EGM and comprises display
   circuitry arranged to control a display, the display
   circuitry being arranged to communicate with the EGM
   controller to display information under the control of the
   EGM controller.                            The display apparatus   40 may be
25 selectively connected to different EGMs and, in this
   embodiment, is generic, so that it can be controlled by
   different EGMs which may, for example, provide different
   games.
                Together with the EGM of Figure 2, the display
30 apparatus                    40 provides a gaming system.            The gaming system
   can take a number of different                            forms.   In a first form, a
   stand alone EGM as illustrated in Figure 2 is provided,
   together with the display apparatus                            40,   wherein all or
   most components                           required for implementing a game are
35 present in a player operable gaming machine                               (EGM).
                In a second form, a distributed architecture is
   provided wherein some of the components required for
   7155724_1 (GHMatters) P76506.AU.2 ROBYNH

                                                      - 12
   implementing the game are present in a player operable
   gaming machine and some of the components required for
   implementing the game are located remotely relative to the
   gaming machine.                          For example, a "thick client"
 5 architecture may be used wherein part of the game is
   executed on a player operable gaming machine and part of
   the game is executed remotely, such as by a gaming server;
   or a "thin client" architecture may be used wherein most
   of the game is executed remotely such as by a gaming
10 server and a player operable gaming machine is used only
   to display audible and/or visible gaming information to
   the player and receive gaming inputs from the player.                           A
   display apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the
   present invention may also be utilised with this form of
15 architecture.
                However, it will be understood that other
   arrangements are envisaged.                           For example, an architecture
   may be provided wherein a gaming machine is networked to a
   gaming server and the respective functions of the gaming
20 machine and the gaming server are                          selectively modifiable.
   For example, the gaming system may operate in stand alone
   gaming machine mode, "thick client" mode or                          "thin client"
   mode depending on the game being played, operating
   conditions,                       and so on. Other variations will be apparent
25 to persons skilled in the art.
                Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several components. At the broadest level, the components
   are a player interface 50 and a game controller 60 as
   illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is arranged
30 to enable manual interaction between a player and the
   gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
                Components of the player interface may vary from
35 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54,                          a game play

   instructions                        (e.g. to place bets and make selections),   and
   one or more speakers 58.
                The game controller 60 is in data communication with
 5 the player interface 50 and typically includes a
   processor 62 that processes the game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and outputs game play
   outcomes to the display. Typically, the game play
   instructions are stored as program code in a memory 64 but
10 can also be hardwired. Herein the term "processor" is used
   to refer generically to any device that can process game
   play instructions in accordance with game play rules and
   may include:                        a microprocessor, microcontroller,
   programmable logic device or other computational device, a
15 general purpose computer                         (e.g. a PC) or a server.
                In this embodiment, the game controller 60 may also
   include a wireless receiver/transmitter 66 which is
   arranged to communicate with a display apparatus                          40 in

   Internet, for example through a firewall 211.
10              Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques,                        functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.                         For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one                        server or a
15 separate server may be provided.                         For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.                        Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
20 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
                As discussed above, Figure 2 shows a representation
   of a display apparatus 40                       in accordance with an embodiment
25 of the present invention, which is arranged to be mounted
   to an EGM.                        The display apparatus  40 provides a display 41
   which can be used in addition to the main display 16                         (and
   also any secondary display in the top box 26) of the
   EGM 10.                  The display apparatus        40 may be controlled, in
30 this example, by the EGM 10.                         It also may be controlled by
   an external device, such as a Casino server or                        jackpot
   controller                      (e.g. implemented by the jackpot   server 207
   shown in Figure 5).                        Information relating to the EGM may
   be displayed by the apparatus                        40 under the control of the
35 EGM, or information required to be displayed on the
   apparatus                    40 by the server or jackpot controller may be
   displayed.

                A display apparatus 40 is in this case is in the form
   of a housing separate to the EGM 10 which mounts a display
   unit and display circuitry.                     The housing is arranged to be
   mounted to the EGM 12 by mounting apparatus,                    such as
 5 interfering mechanical arrangements, screws, nuts and
   bolts, or any other convenient                    fashion.  In some
   embodiments, electrical or wireless connections may be
   made between EGMs circuitry and the display circuitry
   and/or between a network to an external device and the
10 display circuitry of the display apparatus.
                The display apparatus can take different outward
   forms.                 For example, Figure    6, Figure 7, Figures  9 and 10
   show different types of EGMs, which may play different
   games.                 Although not described in detail here, they will
15 have similar architectures to the EGM described with
   reference to Figure 2.                   They may be programmed to play
   different games, may have different types of displays,
   etc.,           but generally their purpose is to play games for
   entertainment.
20              Each of the EGMs in Figure            6, 7, 9 and 10 have a
   display apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the
   present invention mounted thereto.                     Referring to Figure 6,
   for example, the slant top EGM 300 is in this case
   provided with a primary video display 301 for playing a
25 game where a plurality of symbol bearing reels are
   emulated by the video display 301.                     The player interface
   and components of the EGM 300 are                    similar to those
   described with reference to Figure 2,                    although the
   external                  shape of the EGM 300 is different and it may be
30 arranged to play a different game.                     Mounted to the top
   box 302 of the EGM 300 is a separate display apparatus                    303
   including a display screen 304 which in this case has been
   retro-fitted to the EGM. The display apparatus 303
   comprises a display controller 402 which has been
35 programmed to interface with a display controller of the
   EGM         (e.g. using the same protocols, drivers, or any other
   necessary software/hardware).                    In this embodiment, the

   display apparatus 303 is oval in shape.
                Referring to Figure 7, an EGM 310 of the form having
   actual reels 311 driven by stepper motors is illustrated.
   Attached to a top box 312 of the EGM 310 is a display
 5 apparatus                    313 in accordance with an embodiment of the
   invention.                        This has a display 314 and is also generally
   oval in shape.
                Figure 8 shows a display apparatus 330 in accordance
   with the present invention shown separate from the EGM.
10 The housing 331 mounts display circuitry and a
   display 332.                          In this embodiment, the display apparatus
   330 is shown displaying particular artwork for a
   particular game played on the type of EGM illustrated in
   Figure              9 as EGM 340.             The display 332 is a video display,
15 and can therefore display any artwork in either static or
   dynamic forms under the control of the EGM 340                           (in this
   embodiment).                          It will be understood by persons skilled in
   the art that the display apparatus                          330 could
   advantageously be mounted to a different type of machine,
20 playing a different game, and, under control of the
   controller of the EGM, display different artwork                            (and,
   indeed, any information that it is required to display).
                Referring to Figure 10,                  a further type of EGM 350,
   again having stepper reels 351,                          is illustrated.   A display
25 apparatus                    352 in accordance with an embodiment of the
   present invention, is mounted to the top box 353 of the
   EGM 350.                    The display apparatus 352        is of a different and
   "fancy" shape to that of the other illustrated
   embodiments.                          It includes a video display 353 and also
30 artwork 354.
                The display apparatus of embodiments of the present
   invention may be formed by any conveniently shaped
   housing.                    The housing may or may not include artwork, but
   will include a display, which may be a video display,
35 which can be controlled by the EGM or another external
   device to display information as desired by the EGM or
   other external device.

                Referring to Figure 11,                    a display apparatus   401 in
   accordance with the present invention, comprises a
   display 400, which in this example is a LCD                              (liquid
   crystal display).                           It may be any other type of display in
 5 other embodiments, however, such as vacuum fluorescent
   display                 (VFD), an LED display, plasma display or any other
   display of any shape or                          size.
                The display apparatus 401 also comprises display
   circuitry, in this embodiment being in the form of a
10 display controller 402 which includes a processor and
   associated memory for intelligently controlling the

   circuitry, such as contacts from an EGM or other external
   device.                  This embodiment therefore has the option of a
   hardwired connection or a wireless connection.                               The
   invention is not limited to this.                              Other embodiments may
20 have hardwired or wireless connections, but not both.                                As
   previously mentioned, the controller 402 may be programmed
   with the necessary software and hardware to communicate
   with          (and more particularly receive display instructions
   from) a device coupled to the apparatus by way of the
25 input/output interface 403.
                In this embodiment, speakers 406 for providing audio
   outputs are provided.
                This embodiment is therefore an intelligent
   device 401 which can be selectively controlled by an EGM
30 or other external devices to display information on a
   display 400 required by the EGM and/or other external
   devices.
                Figure 12                  illustrates just one way in which a display
   apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the present
35 invention may be utilized.                            A plurality of different
   EGMs 501,                    501 and 503,       are each provided with a generic
   topper unit display apparatus                             504, in accordance with an
   7155724_1 (GHMatters) P76506.AU.2 ROBYNH

   embodiment of the present invention.                             The display
   apparatus                    504 includes a display and the other components
   described with reference to Figure 11.                             In this
   embodiment, the topper display apparatus                            504 may be
 5 controlled by the Casino server 500 which is hardwired
    (via contacts                        405, for example) to communicate with the
   display controller 402 to control displayed information on
   the display apparatus 504,                           as desired by the Casino
   server 500.                         The topper display apparatus 504     is
10 selectively connectable to the EGM 501,                            502, 503
   controller to display information under control of the EGM
   controller.                         It will be appreciated that many other ways
   of utilising the display arrangement are available.                              For
   example, referring to Figure                            5, display apparatus 250 in
15 accordance with embodiments of the present invention may
   be used with a "downloadable" EGM, which is configured
   with software from a server to play different games,
   depending upon the software downloaded to it.                              Similarly,
   the display apparatus 250 may be driven to show different
20 information depending upon the software downloaded to the
   configurable EGM 203.
                As discussed above, the display apparatus can be
   driven/controlled by the EGM itself or any other external
   device.                  The display controller 402            communicates with the
25 EGM's controller.                          In some embodiments it is also possible
   that the display may be controlled directly by the EGMs
   controller and/or external device.                             Connectivity is wired,
   wireless, or a combination of both, as discussed above.
                Audio may be generated through the EGMs controller,
30 or external device, or the topper unit 401 may have its
   own audio programmed in.
                Advantages of using this type of intelligent display
   apparatus are many and it can have many applications.                              It
   may be used in an attract mode, for example, to attract
35 players to the slot machine or EGM, to display Casino
   promotions, information on Casinos, games and other
   matters.                     It does all this without compromising any space

   within the EGM it is mounted to.
                A topper unit may be utilised on a bank of several
   EGMs to display live synchronised video streams
   animations, graphics, synchronised with sound.                          It  can
 5 also be used as a stand alone unit on a single EGM                          (as
   discussed above) and linked to the game as part of a game
   feature, or may be controlled independently of game theme.
                Additionally, the topper unit may be used for
   community gaming, group gaming or peer to peer gaming to
10 display video, animation and/or sound based on different
   game themes.                          It can also be controlled by a jackpot
   controller, for example, to display jackpot/progressive
   information as needed and/or to display bonusing features
   depending upon game themes.
15              As discussed above, the topper unit also can be used
   with configurable or downloadable EGMs.                          When the
   downloadable EGM is updated with a different gaming and/or
   theme the topper unit may be updated at the same time or
   controlled by the EGM to be updated, so that the topper
20 can remain consistent with the EGM game/theme.
                The display controller of the gaming apparatus may
   include software                         (stored in memory) configurable to enable
   it to communicate with EGMs of different types and/or
   external devices of different types.
25              In the above embodiment, the display apparatus
   includes a processor arranged to control the display
   apparatus.                        The invention is not limited to this.     Other
   embodiments may include display circuitry enabling the
   display to be directly controlled by the EGM and/or
30 external device.
                Note that the term "electronic gaming machine" is not
   limited to machines which play reel-type games.                           Other
   games, such as roulette, Keno, bingo and many others may
   be played on EGMs and display apparatus of the present
35 invention may be used with EGMs playing these types of
   games.
                In the above embodiment, the display apparatus are
   7155724_1 (GHMatters) P76506.AU.2 ROBYNH

   removable and selectively mountable on different types of
   EGMs.              In an alternative embodiment, the display apparatus
   may be non-removable and permanently attached to an EGM.
                It will be appreciated that programme code may be
 5 necessary to some embodiments for, for example, enabling
   the display apparatus controller to communicate with the
   EGM and/or external device.                       Any programme code may be
   supplied in a number of ways.                       For example, on a computer
   readable medium, such as a disc or a memory, or as a data
10 signal              (for example, by downloading it from a server).
                In the claims which follow and in the preceding
   description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
15 "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
   not to preclude the presence or addition of                      further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.
