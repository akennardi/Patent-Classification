                                         ABSTRACT
A cooling system including a ventilator that exchanges atmosphere between parts of a
building that are at differing heights. The ventilator includes an outer conduit that
extends from an upper end thereof downward to a lower end thereof. An inner conduit
extends substantially the entire length of the outer conduit. Both the outer and inner
conduits are open at their respective upper ends and lower ends. Temperatures of
atmosphere both surrounding and within the outer conduit and the inner conduit induce
an exchange of atmosphere between the ventilator and surrounding atmosphere.

                                           Background
Technical Field
[0002]         The present disclosure relates generally to a cooling system for building
ventilation and, more particularly, to a ventilation system that exploits a temperature
difference between a building's interior and the surrounding atmosphere.
Background Art
[0003A]        Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like
in this specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the
present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any of these matters formed
part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the
present invention as it existed in Australia or elsewhere before the priority date of each
claim of this application.
[0003]          Using gravity for moving heating, circulating and ventilating air is a simple
technique that has been a well understood and practiced for more than 100 years. Hot
air is less dense than cold air and will therefore tend to rise while cooler air tends to
settle. However, the force produced in this way is very slight, and is easily overcome by
friction in ducts and by wind pressure around a building. A gravity ventilation system is
simpler than a forced air system, requires no skilled attention, and is less expensive to
install. Widespread use of gravity heating air and water systems ended mainly because
such systems:
         1.    were difficult to install requiring large ducts and many penetrations through
floor slabs etc.; and

                                                2
        2.     their installation required experienced engineers who could assess a
building's suitability for a gravity heating systems.
[0004]         Historically, the advantages of gravity heating and circulation made it
particularly advantageous for houses, small school buildings, churches, halls, etc.,
where a heat source may be placed near the bases of a warm air duct and where air
flow resistance is low. However, unseparated air ducts in a gravity ventilation system
often become inefficient due to stagnation if the duct's wall becomes exposed to cooler
surrounding or adjacent air that induces downdrafts within the duct which collide with
rising warmer air. Gravity air ducts that allow air to circulate simultaneously in opposite
directions require very large cross-sections like an air well in multistory buildings. Also,
it has been thought that using gravity for ventilation is more expensive than a fan
because the amount of thermal energy required to produce a significant draft or air
velocity through a duct greatly exceeds the electrical energy required to power a fan.
Gravity air circulation may exhibit difficulty in moving hot air into certain rooms in a
building during windy weather.

                                         Brief Summary
[0006]         The present disclosure provides an improved cooling system and, by way
of example, an improved ventilation duct.
[0007]         Another potential advantage of the present disclosure is that in one
alternative embodiment it allows drawing via a drain tap collected rainwater as a backup
for supplementary or emergency domestic water supply.
[0008]         Another potential advantage of the present disclosure is that where in one
alternative embodiment where the water pan is filled from the Municipal Water Mains
thru a Float Valve (not illustrated in any of the FIGs.), the present disclosure essentially
combines the functions of a domestic water reservoir tank and a building cooler into one
compact cost efficient device.
[0009]         In one aspect, the invention resides in a cooling system including a
ventilator adapted for inclusion in a building for exchanging atmosphere between parts
of the building at differing heights thereof, the ventilator comprising:

                                                3
        a.     an outer conduit adapted for being juxtaposed with at least a portion of the
building, the portion being selected from a group consisting of:
               i.     a roof;
               ii.    a floor; and
               iii.   a wall, and
        the outer conduit having a length that extends from an upper end thereof
downward to a lower end thereof;
        b.     an inner conduit extending substantially along the entire length of the outer
conduit; and
        c.     one or more cooling tubes extending along the inner conduit,
       wherein the one or more cooling tubes are connected to a pan and have a fluid
therein.
[0010]         While the improved gravity ventilation duct is disclosed in the context of
being installed in a building, the ventilator is also useful for ventilating tunnels,
underground shelters, mineshafts, and the like.
[0011]         These and other features, objects and advantages will be understood or
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description of the
preferred embodiment as illustrated in the various drawing figures.

                                     Detailed Description
[0047]         FIGs. 1 and 2 depict a cooling system in the form of a coaxial ventilator,
identified by the general reference number 20, included in the structure of a building 22.

                                                 7
The coaxial ventilator 20 includes an uninsulated outer conduit 24 made of a thermally
conductive material that is juxtaposed with and, in the illustrations of FIGs. 1 and 2,
passes through:
        1.      a roof 32;
        2.      a ceiling 34 of a warm upper story room 36; and
        3.      a floor 38 of the room 36.
[0048]          The roof 32, the ceiling 34 and the floor 38 are all respective portions of
the building 22. As depicted in FIGs. 1 and 2, the outer conduit 24 of the coaxial
ventilator 20 has a length that extends from a flared upper end 42 located above the
roof 32 downward to a lower end 44 that is located at a lower room 46 of the building 22
beneath the room 36. In the illustrations of FIGs. 1 and 2 the building 22 also includes:
        1.      an upper interior wall 52a;
        2.      a lower interior wall 52b;
        3.      a floor 54 for the room 46 for which the floor 38 of the upper room 36 also
        provides a ceiling;
        4.      an upper exterior wall 56a; and
        5.      a lower exterior wall 56b.
[0049]          The coaxial ventilator 20 also includes an inner conduit 62 made of a
thermally insulative material which may be flexible and/or corrugated that is:
        1.      surrounded by the outer conduit 24;
        2.      extends substantially along the entire length of the outer conduit 24; and
        3.      is pierced by a plurality of holes 63 at locations 64a, 64b and 64c where
        transitions occur in temperature about the outer conduit 24.
[0050]          An upper end 66 of the inner conduit 62 is preferably located slightly below
the top of the flared upper end 42 of the outer conduit 24. Preferably, a lower end 68 of
the inner conduit 62 is similarly recessed slightly above the lower end 44 of the outer
conduit 24. Consequently, the inner conduit 62 has a slightly shorter length than that of
the outer conduit 24.
[0051]          As depicted most clearly in FIG. 3, the presence of the inner conduit 62
centered within the outer conduit 24 establishes an annularly shaped space 72
therebetween that extends along the length of the inner conduit 62. Cross-sectional

                                                 8
areas of the inner conduit 62 and the annularly shaped space 72 should be
approximately equal with the cross-sectional area of the annularly shaped space 72
being slightly larger to compensate for air friction with both the outer conduit 24 and the
inner conduit 62.
[0052]         While FIG. 3 depicts the inner conduit 62 as being centered within the
outer conduit 24, that is not an essential requirement for the coaxial ventilator 20. The
coaxial ventilator 20 works well if the inner conduit 62 were to be displaced to one side
within the outer conduit 24. The inner conduit 62 may not be centered within the outer
conduit 24 if, for example, the inner conduit 62 were loosely fixed or not secured at the
very center of the outer conduit 24 perhaps to facilitate fabricating the coaxial ventilator
20 or adjustment of inner conduit 62 etc., or if at some locations within the building 22
the coaxial ventilator 20 is inclined, i.e. not vertical.
[0053]         If the inner conduit 62 is insecurely positioned within the outer conduit 24
and the coaxial ventilator 20 is inclined, the inner conduit 62 may sag or hang against a
lower wall of the outer conduit 24. Under such a circumstance, inner conduit 62 may
contact the outer conduit 24 but because the inner conduit 62 is thermally insulated, i.e.
does not conduct heat well, and contact area is small, little heat will be transferred from
the outer conduit 24 to the inner conduit 62 thereby preserving a temperature difference
between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62. Accordingly, the coaxial ventilator 20
works regardless of whether the inner conduit 62 is at the exact center of the outer
conduit 24 or displaced to one side thereof.
[0054]         In fact, displacing the inner conduit 62 greatly to one side of the outer
conduit 24 lowers airflow resistance between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62.
Displacing the inner conduit 62 to one side of the outer conduit 24 forces most of the
airflow between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62 into a more cohesive "fat" crescent
cross-sectional shape, with the major portion of the air flow occurring in the "fat" center
of the crescent. If most of the air flow occurs in the "fat" center of the crescent, the air
flow more nearly approximates that of an ideal circular cross sectional shape.
Approaching more nearly to an ideal circular cross sectional air flow minimizes friction
with the outer and inner conduits 24, 62 in comparison with the thinner, strictly perfectly
annular shape of airflow along the annularly shaped space 72 having the same cross
sectional area. To reduce friction due to stagnant "dead" space at the sharp "horned"
ends of a crescent cross-sectional shape near where the inner conduit 62 contacts the

                                              9
outer conduit 24, the cross-sectional area between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62
can be increased to be slightly larger than the cross-sectional area of the inner conduit
62.
[0055]         As depicted in FIG. 1, the coaxial ventilator 20 may also include a cover
82 disposed above the flared upper end 42 of the outer conduit 24. Among other
functions described in greater detail below, the cover 82 occludes upper ends 42, 66
both of the outer conduit 24 and of the inner conduit 62 thereby preventing precipitation
from entering thereinto.
[0056]         The outer conduit 24 of the coaxial ventilator 20 is highly heat absorbent
and heat radiative such as being fabricated with a matt black absorptive and radiative
surface. The inner conduit 62 is preferably made of heat insulating material. A length
of the coaxial ventilator 20 passing through a warmer area of the building 22, such as
the room 36 in FIG. 1, is warmed thereby heating air within a segment of the annularly
shaped space 72 that spans the room 36. As depicted in FIG. 1 by small upwardly
directed arrows in the annularly shaped space 72 below the location 64b, warmer air
within the annularly shaped space 72 spanning the room 36 rises while cooler air within
a segment of the inner conduit 62 spanning the room 36 descends. Above a zone in
which a transition in temperature about the outer conduit 24 occurs, such as that during
nighttime surrounding the location 64a in FIG. 1, lower temperature atmosphere about
the outer conduit 24 cools air within the annularly shaped space 72 above the roof 32.
In a length of the coaxial ventilator 20 being cooled by the surrounded atmosphere, as
depicted in FIG. 1 by small downwardly directed arrows within the annularly shaped
space 72 above the location 64b, cooler air descends while warmer air in the inner
conduit 62 above the location 64a rises.
[0057]         At a location along the length of the coaxial ventilator 20 where rising
warmer air within the annularly shaped space 72 meets descending cooler air within the
annularly shaped space 72 such as at the location 64b, an exchange of air occurs
between the annularly shaped space 72 and the inner conduit 62 with:
        1.     cooler descending air flowing through the holes 63 piercing the inner
conduit 62 at the location 64b into the inner conduit 62; and
        2.     warmer rising air flowing through the holes 63 piercing the inner conduit 62
at the location 64b into the inner conduit 62.

[0058]          After flowing from the annularly shaped space 72 into the inner conduit 62,
the descending cooler air continues descending within the inner conduit 62 below the
location 64b while the rising warmer air continues rising within the inner conduit 62
above the location 64b. As depicted in FIG. 1, in this way warmer air first rises from the
room 46 in the building 22 initially via the annularly shaped space 72 and subsequently
via the inner conduit 62 to exit the coaxial ventilator 20 at the top thereof. Conversely,
cooler air initially enters the annularly shaped space 72 at the flared upper end 42 of the
outer conduit 24 to flow downward before entering the room 46 via the inner conduit 62.
[0059]          The locations 64a, 64b and 64c where holes 63 pierce the inner conduit
62 promote formation of transition zones inside the coaxial ventilator 20 where air
flowing in the annularly shaped space 72 may enter into the inner conduit 62 and
conversely. There exists a tendency for exchanges of air to occur between the
annularly shaped space 72 and the inner conduit 62 where the coaxial ventilator 20
passes through the exterior of the building 22 such as at the roof 32. A tendency exists
for flow exchanges of air wherever a change in temperature occurs along the length of
the coaxial ventilator 20, i.e. where the coaxial ventilator 20 passes from one thermal
environment to another thermal environment.
[0060]          The cover 82 of the coaxial ventilator 20 may be advantageously
configured for evaporatively cooling air entering the flared upper end 42 of the outer
conduit 24 by including at the bottom thereof, spaced a distance above the flared upper
end 42 of the outer conduit 24, a water filled pan 84. The cover 82 preferably also
includes a mesh 86 that spans between peripheries of the pan 84 and a dish-shaped
top lid 88. Preferably the lid 88 is opaque and reflective to reduce solar heating. The
mesh 86 prevents insects from entering the space between the pan 84 and the lid 88
while permitting atmosphere about the flared upper end 42 of the outer conduit 24 to
circulate therethrough. A depression 89 in the lid 88, preferably at the center thereof,
with a drip hole 90 formed therethrough, best illustrated in FIGs. 13, 15, 17 and 20,
permits collecting rain water used for filling the pan 84.
[0061]          In the illustration of FIG. 2, the building 22 and the cooling system in the
form of coaxial ventilator 20 are identical to those depicted in FIG. 1. The difference
between FIGs. 2 and 1 are that the small arrows within the annularly shaped space 72
and the inner conduit 62 differ from those in FIG. 1 since the small arrows in FIG. 2
depict the path of air as it flows during daytime. The principal difference between

                                                11
nighttime and daytime airflows is that during daytime there is no exchange of air
between the annularly shaped space 72 and the inner conduit 62. Rather, during
daytime warmer air rises along the entire length of the annularly shaped space 72 while
cooler air descends along the entire length of the inner conduit 62.
[0062]          FIGs. 4 and 5 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the present
disclosure in which a cooling system having a pair of coaxial ventilators 20a, 20b, in
accordance herewith, ventilate two (2) different rooms 46a, 46b during nighttime
operation. Those elements depicted in FIGs. 4 and 5 that are common to the coaxial
ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 1-3 carry the same reference numeral distinguished by a
prime (" ' ") designation. Lower segments of each of the coaxial ventilators 20a, 20b are
juxtaposed with opposite sides of the interior wall 52a'. As illustrated in FIGs. 4 and 5,
above the roof 32' the pair of coaxial ventilators 20a, 20b preferably share a single
cover 82'.
[0063]          FIG. 6 illustrates yet another alternative embodiment of the present
disclosure located in a multi-story building 22". Those elements depicted in FIGs. 6 that
are common to the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 1-3 carry the same reference
numeral distinguished by a double prime (" " ") designation. The building 22" includes a
basement 92 having a heat source 94, i.e. a boiler or other warm appliance, located
therein. Radiation and thermal convection within the basement 92 warms the room 46"
through the floor 54". As depicted in FIG. 6, a cooling system in the form of coaxial
ventilator 20" extends from the basement 92 upward to a cooler upper room 36".
Convection of warmer air via the coaxial ventilator 20" between the basement 92 and
the room 36" warms the room 36" while cooler air descends from the room 36" to the
basement 92.
[0064]          FIG. 7 depicts a preferred bell shaped flaring 98 of the lower end 44 of the
outer conduit 24. Preferably, as stated previously the lower end 68 of the inner conduit
62 is recessed slightly above the lower end 44 of the outer conduit 24. As depicted in
FIG. 7, the bell shaped flaring 98, essentially forming a funnel, begins slightly above the
lower end 68 of the inner conduit 62 and above the floor 38 of the room 36. The bell
shaped flaring 98 may be advantageously shaped to exploit the Coanda effect both for
separating the upward flow of warmer air from the downward flow of cooler air, and for
drawing the rising upward flow from a larger horizontal area around the lower end 44 of
the outer conduit 24. The funnel formed by the preferred bell shaped flaring 98 at the

                                              12
lower end 44 reduces drag and turbulence. Formed in this way the bell shaped flaring
98 establishes a transition zone having a wider space for stabilizing the upward flow of
warmer air and downward flow of cooler air and interference between them.
Industrial Applicability
[0065]         FIGs. 8 through 10 illustrate the coaxial ventilator 20 being used
advantageously for power production such as generating electricity. In the illustration of
FIG. 8, two (2) turbines 102 are located within the coaxial ventilator 20 respectively near
the top and bottom thereof. The turbines 102 are located in sections of the coaxial
ventilator 20 in which the inner conduit 62 lacks holes 63 and where there is maximum
flow and pressure differential to drive the turbines 102. While FIG. 8 depicts only two
(2) turbines 102, it is readily apparent that depending upon construction details a single
coaxial ventilator 20 may include more or fewer than two (2) turbines 102.
[0066]         As depicted in FIGs. 9 and 10, inner turbine blades 104 upon which cooler
air descending through the inner conduit 62 impinges preferably slant in a direction
opposite than outer turbine blades 106 upon which hotter air rising through the annularly
shaped space 72 impinges. Configured in this way, both the descending cooler air and
the rising hotter air urge the turbine 102 to rotate in the same direction. Preferably, to
advantageously exploit the Coriolis effect the slant direction of the inner turbine blades
104 and the outer turbine blades 106 differs depending upon whether the turbine 102 is
located in the Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere. Advantageously, the
slant of the inner turbine blades 104 and the outer turbine blades 106 may change
automatically thereby adapting them for differing air flow pressure and velocities
occurring throughout the day.
[0067]         Referring back to FIG. 8, during daylight hours solar heating of air within
the room 46 and the outer conduit 24 provides energy for driving the turbines 102 by
heating and expanding air therein. The air pressure increase associated with solar
heating and expansion enhances the updraft in annularly shaped space 72 between the
outer conduit 24 and the inner conduit 62 before the air escapes from the upper end 42.
Note that solar radiation impinging upon the outer conduit 24 heats air within the
annularly shaped space 72. Accordingly, for this particular application it is
advantageous to increase the height of the coaxial ventilator 20 that extends above the
roof 32. If during night time the air flows within the coaxial ventilator 20 reverse the

                                                 13
turbines 102 correspondingly reverse rotation which still provides power for generating
electricity.
[0068]        Rotation of the turbine 102 by hotter air impinging upon the outer turbine
blades 106 rotates the inner turbine blades 104 thereby drawing cooler air into the inner
conduit 62 to thereby increase the natural descent of cooler air within the inner conduit
62 and compress air within the room 46. After air flow within the coaxial ventilator 20
becomes stable for instance during daytime, the increased flow rates produced by solar
heating will be sufficient to overcome any slight back pressure due to increased air
pressure within the room 46.
[0069]        Daytime power production efficiency may be increased by including a non
return valve, not illustrated in FIGs. 8 10, at the lower end 68 of the inner conduit 62.
Such a non return valve increases daytime efficiencies by preventing reverse flow
through the inner conduit 62. However, including such a non return valve also prevents
the flow directions within the coaxial ventilator 20 from reversing for producing power
during the night.
[0070]        While less preferred and not illustrated in FIGs. 8-10, the turbines 102 may
instead include two (2) independent sets of contra-rotating blades 104, 106 both of
which sets slant in the same direction. Because such inner turbine blades 104 and
outer turbine blades 106 rotate in opposite directions, generating electricity with a single
generator requires coupling the blades 104, 106 together with a mechanical
transmission. Alternatively, electricity might be generated using two separate
generators respectively coupled independently to the inner turbine blades 104 and to
the outer turbine blades 106.
[0071]        Alternatively, if electricity is supplied to the turbines 102 rather than being
drawn therefrom, then the turbines 102 can be used advantageously for boosting air
flow through the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0072]        Another aspect of coaxial ventilator 20 is illustrated in FIG. 8A and further
includes a weatherproof exhaust or circulation fan 300, positioned above the water pan
84, for increasing the evaporative heat loss rate from the water pan 84, and thereby
increasing the cooling capacity of the coaxial ventilator 20, by creating a wind current
across the water surface. This embodiment is particularly advantageous for increasing
evaporative heat loss on windless days and could lower the temperature of the water in

                                                14
the water pan 84 by as much as, for example, an additional 80 F (40 C). The
weatherproof exhaust fan 300 could be powered by solar photovoltaic cells (not shown)
mounted on the lid 88. Other methods for increasing the evaporative rate from the
water pan 84 include, but are not limited to, spraying the water from the water pan 84
upwards into the air or sprayed upwards onto wetted fabric mats, or by natural water
capillary wicking action upwards from the water pan 84 onto fabric or mesh mats
suspended above, and partially submerged into, the water pan 84, thereby increasing
the evaporative surface area (see for example, FIG. 13B, discussed hereinbelow).
Small water pumps used for spraying the water out of the water pan 84 could be
powered by solar photovoltaic cells (not shown) mounted on the lid 88. The sprayed
water, having been cooled by evaporative cooling, would then drip back down into the
water pan 84, thereby reducing the temperature of water in the water pan 84.
[0073]          An alternative embodiment of a cooling system in the form of coaxial
ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13, 13A, 13B, 13C and 14 further includes a
liquid-filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124 that depends beneath a pan 84 into an inner
conduit 62 of the coaxial ventilator 20. In the illustrations of FIGs. 11, 12, 13, 13A, 13B,
13C and 14, the cooling tube 124 descends along a central axis of the coaxial ventilator
20 to be thereby surrounded by the inner conduit 62. Disposed as depicted in FIGs. 11,
12, 13, 13A, 13B, 13C and 14, the cooling tube 124 advantageously increases contact
area for heat exchange cooling significantly between:
         1.     water evaporating from a pan 84 located at the top of the coaxial ventilator
20; and
        2.      air within the coaxial ventilator 20 about the liquid-filled thermosyphon
cooling tube 124.
[0074]          In the embodiment depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13, 13A, 13B, 13C and 14,
the cooling tube 124 is filled with water 126 drawn from the pan 84. A drain tap 128
located at the bottom of the cooling tube 124 permits drawing collected rainwater as a
backup for supplementary or emergency domestic water supply. The cooling tube 124
is prefera-bly made of copper or similarly high thermal conductivity material, and maybe
be finned or corrugated with heat conducting surfaces to increase the surface area for
heat exchange, or alternatively be of semi-permeable surfaces to increase the surface
area for water evaporation cooling.

                                              15
[0075]         Adding a liquid-filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124 that includes a
perforated inner return tube, such as that described in United States Patent no.
6,014,968 and hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth here, to the
coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 1-3 effectively elongates the heat exchange area
of the evaporative cooling water-filled pan 84. Effectively elongating the heat exchange
area of the evaporative cooling water-filled pan 84 in this way increases cooling
capacity of a coaxial ventilator 20 without significantly increasing the overall size of the
coaxial ventilator 20. Extending the heat exchange area of the coaxial ventilator 20 by
including the thermosyphon cooling tube 124 therein increases heat exchange
efficiency between air within the coaxial ventilator 20 and evaporative cooling water
filled pan 84.
[0076]         FIG. 13B illustrates the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIG. 13 having an
alternative embodiment water filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124. The cooling tube
124 depicted in FIG. 13B differs from the cooling tube 124 depicted in FIG. 13 by:
        1.     extending further downward beneath a lower end of the inner conduit 62;
and
        2.     having an enlarged lower end that forms a bulb tank 182.
[0077]         As depicted in FIG. 13B, the bottom of the bulb tank 182 may include
projecting heat exchanging fins 184 for cooling surrounding atmosphere. The bulb tank
182 advantageously enlarges the cooling surface area and storage capacity of the
cooling tube 124, as well as facilitating direct radiative, conductive and convective
cooling into atmosphere surrounding the bulb tank 182 such as to the room 46 depicted
in FIG. 13A similar to a radiative cooling ceiling panel. This increases the storage
capacity of the cooling tube 124, and betters the coaxial ventilator 20 when used for
water storage for the building 22 perhaps thereby avoiding additional expense of a
separate water storage tank. When used for water storage, the lower end of the bulb
tank 182 includes a drain tap 186, either alone or in addition to the drain tap 128. The
bulb tank 182 as depicted in FIG. 13B and described above can be adapted for use in
other configurations of the coaxial ventilator 20 disclosed herein which include the
cooling tube 124.
[0078]         As also illustrated in the embodiment of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted
in FIG. 13B, the pan 84 atop the coaxial ventilator 20 may also advantageously include

                                               16
an inlet float valve 192 connected to a water main supply not separately depicted in the
FIG. Attaching the inlet float valve 192 to the pan 84 ensures that the pan 84 at all
times remains full of water, and cooler water flowing thereinto advantageously reduces
the temperature of water in the pan 84. The embodiment of the coaxial ventilator 20
depicted in FIG. 13B also includes an outlet pipe 196 that advantageously permits
drawing warm water from the pan 84.
[0079]          In hot climates during daytime, drawing water from the outlet pipe 196 at
the top of the pan 84 enables supplying preheated warm water:
                1.     for household use; or
                2.     to a household's water heater.
[0080]          Moreover, cooler refill water entering the pan 84 through the inlet float
valve 192 lowers the temperature of water in the pan 84 thereby maintaining cooling
efficiency of the water pan 84. Otherwise, on hot afternoons excess heat collected in
the water pan 84 may not be dissipated quickly enough thru evaporation. The presence
of a warm water layer in the water pan 84 may reduce evaporative cooling of the water
due to mixing of water cooled by evaporation sinking below the water's surface.
[0081]          As depicted in FIG. 13B the embodiment of the coaxial ventilator 20
shown there may also advantageously include, respectively, a heat exchanger coil 202
located in the pan 84, and a heat exchanger coil 206 located in the bulb tank 182. At
various times of the day as appropriate, the heat exchanger coils 202 and 206 are
useful for warming or cooling pressurized fluid flowing respectively through the heat
exchanger coils 202 and 206. For example, during very hot afternoons preheated warm
water can be drawn from the pan 84 via the outlet pipe 196 or thru the heat exchanger
coil 202 in the pan 84 before being heated further in a water heater not depicted in any
of the FIGs.
[0082]          Similarly, when excess cool water is present in the bulb tank 182 the heat
exchanger coil 206 may be used for precooling a household air conditioner's refrigerant
before it enters the conditioner's compressor or condenser not depicted in any of the
FIGs. Within the coaxial ventilator 20, water heated in this way rises through the
cooling tube 124 to the pan 84 where it may heat fluid flowing through the heat
exchanger coil 202. Heat transferred in this way from the bulb tank 182 to the pan 84
reduces energy consumed by a household's air conditioner and water heater.

                                               17
[0083]          FIG. 13C shows another aspect of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in
FIG. 13A further including a vertical axis exhaust wind turbine 400, a weatherproof
exhaust fan 402, and evaporative cooling wetted fabric mats or mesh 404. While both
the wind turbine 400 and the exhaust fan 402 accelerate evaporative airflows across the
water pan 84 surface to increase evaporative heat loss, the coaxial ventilator 20 could
also include evaporative cooling wetted fabric mats or mesh 404 that are suspended
above and partially submersed in the water pan 84. The fabric mesh 404 is wetted by
way of capillary wicking action, or spraying by water pumps (not shown), thereby
increasing the evaporative cooling surface area and thus, increasing the evaporative
cooling rate. The wind turbine 400, the exhaust fan 402, and the water pumps could be
powered by photovoltaic cells and/or batteries (not shown) that can be mounted to
either the lid 88 of the coaxial ventilator 20, to a top surface of the wind turbine 400, or
positioned at another suitable location. The exhaust fan 402 and the exhaust wind
turbine 400 both function to accelerate the evaporative air flows across the water
surface, exhausting the humid air up and out of the water pan 84 area and drawing in
fresh dry air, thereby increasing the evaporative cooling rate. The blades of the exhaust
wind turbine 400 are positioned at an angle facing outwards, such that the blades catch
the wind, causing the exhaust wind turbine to rotate by the force of the wind. The
blades may be aerodynamically formed such that the movement of the blades pushes
air outwards horizontally, creating a low pressure area behind the blades on the inside
of the exhaust wind turbine, drawing humid air out from above the water pan 84. The
exhaust fan 402 and exhaust wind turbine 400 can include propeller and impeller
blades, respectively, that are freely movable when they are not powered, so that they
will spin freely, relative to one another, and not impede operation of each other when
one is working and the other is not. Alternatively, the propeller blades of the exhaust
fan 402 and the impeller blades of the exhaust wind turbine 400 could be coupled
together so that they both turn in unison, when appropriately geared. Accordingly, when
the impeller of the wind turbine 400 and propeller of the exhaust fan 402 are coupled
together, the solar photovoltaic cells and/or batteries could be used to drive both the
exhaust fan 402 as well as the exhaust wind turbine 400 while only providing power to
one of the wind turbine 400 or exhaust fan 402. Similarly, wind could drive both the
exhaust wind turbine 400 as well as the exhaust fan 402. It should be noted that the
coaxial ventilator of the present embodiment need not include both the wind turbine 400

                                                18
and the exhaust fan 402, and if there is no wind turbine 400, the exhaust fan 402 could
be operated in either an exhaust or intake mode.
[0084]         The coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13, 13A, 13B, 13C and
14 passively, cost effectively, and space efficiently uses evaporating rain water to
capture and store nighttime "coolness" for use during mornings and afternoons when it
is most needed. During dry weather, any rain water collected in the pan 84 can be
augmented by connecting a float valve controlled piped water supply to the upper
evaporative cooling water-filled pan 84 (not illustrated in any of the FIGs.). While
evaporative cooling occurs continuously throughout an entire day, however
temperatures are coolest at night, i.e. over 10 hours of nighttime evaporative cooling on
average. Consequently, there exists ample time during that 10 hour interval to cool
water in the pan 84 down to nighttime temperatures.
[0085]         However, holding a sufficient quantity of water both for daytime cooling
needs, particularly to store nighttime cooling capacity, and for providing sufficient
evaporative heat exchange surface area, requires a quite large, heavy and unwieldy
water-filled pan 84 that is located above a building's roof. Frequently, without a large
pan 84 there is insufficient thermal storage capacity to extend nighttime "coolness" well
into the afternoons, and insufficient heat exchange area to transfer heat into air
descending down into the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0086]         If a coaxial ventilator 20 is being used for supplying water to the building
22, the drain tap 128 may connect to the cooling tube 124 at any height along the length
of the cooling tube 124. As those skilled in the art will recognize, connecting the drain
tap 128 to the cooling tube 124 higher along the cooling tube 124 nearer to the pan 84
reduces the water pressure at the drain tap 128 in comparison with water pressure at a
drain tap 128 connected to the cooling tube 124 lower along the cooling tube 124 nearer
to the bulb tank 182. The location of the drain tap 128 along the length of the cooling
tube 124 also affects the temperature of water drawn from the drain tap 128. During
daytime, water drawn from a drain tap 128 connected to the cooling tube 124 higher
along the cooling tube 124 nearer to the pan 84 will, in general, be warmer than water
drawn from a drain tap 128 connected to the cooling tube 124 lower along the cooling
tube 124 nearer to the bulb tank 182. During daytime, the warmest water may be drawn
from a drain tap 128 located nearest to the pan 84. In a hot climate, to preserve cold
water stored overnight undisturbed at the bottom of the bulb tank 182 for cooling the

                                               19
building 22, it is advantageous to avoid drawing water from the drain tap 186 but rather
to draw water from a drain tap 128 located at an intermediate height along the cooling
tube 124.
[0087]         FIGs. 15 and 16 depict an alternative embodiment of the coaxial ventilator
20 depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13, 13A, 13B, 13C and 14. In the embodiment depicted in
FIGs. 15 and 16 the water-filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124 below the pan 84 is
surrounded by a tube 132 illustrated by a dashed line in those FIGs. The tube 132:
       1.      preferably has a circular cross-section;
       2.      preferably is made of copper or similarly high thermal conductivity material
       to enhance heat exchange between liquids filling the tube 132 and the cooling
       tube 124; and
       3.      may be flexible, finned or corrugated.
[0088]         The tube 132 establishes an annularly shaped space 134 around the
cooling tube 124 that is preferably filled with oil 138 or other liquid having a specific heat
greater than that of water. In this way liquid filling the annularly shaped space 134
being in close thermal heat exchange contact with the cooling tube 124 increases
thermal storage capacity of the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0089]         FIG. 13A shows the bottom end of the cooling tube enlarged into a bulb
tank which may have radiative heat exchanger fins or other heat exchange surfaces at
the bottom at ceiling level to additionally directly radiatively and conductively cool the
room below. That is in addition to the cooled air convection taking place. It enlarges
the cooling surface area and water or oil storage capacity of the cooling tube 124, 126
and the annularly shaped space 134, as well as allowing direct radiative cooling to take
place into the room below, thus increasing the cooling efficiency. The bulb tank can be
adapted to all other Coaxial Ventilator configurations shown variously with cooling tube
124, 126, and annularly shaped space 134, etc. Enlarging the water storage
capacity helps when the Coaxial Ventilator is also used as a water storage tank (water
storage tank function not applicable to Fig 17 where oil is the storage medium) for the
building or house, thus saving on the cost of a normal household or building water
storage tank. In this case when the bulb tank forms part of the water storage tank
capacity (in addition to the cooling tube 124, 126, and the evaporative water pan 84
above) an additional water draw off pipe or drain tap 128 would be drawn off the bulb

                                              20
tank at the lowest level of the bulb tank at ceiling level to be used in the rooms below
(additional ceiling level water draw off pipe not shown in Fig 13A).
[0090]         As illustrated by dashed lines in FIGs. 15 and 16, the performance of the
thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial ventilator 20 illustrated in those FIGs. can be further
enhanced by extending the annularly shaped space 134 along the length of the
thermosyphon cooling tube 124 upward and outward beneath the pan 84. This
extension of the tube 132 upward and outward permits the liquid having a specific heat
greater than that of water to contact the bottom of the pan 84.
[0091]          In this way the thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in
FIGs. 15 and 16 having the double layer pan 84 and cooling tube 124 filled on the inside
with water 126 that is surrounded by and separated from the liquid that fills the tube 132
and that has a specific heat greater than that of water:
        1.      permits using a smaller diameter water-filled pan 84; and
        2.     further increases the cooling storage capacity of the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0092]          Furthermore, the thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial ventilator 20 depicted
in FIGs. 15 and 16 simplifies suspending the coaxial thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial
ventilator 20 in comparison with supporting an alternative coaxial ventilator 20 having a
larger roof top water-filled pan 84.
[0093]         While the cooling tube preferably is a thermosyphon cooling tube 124, the
inner return tube included in a thermosyphon cooling tube 124 may be omitted although
this reduces cooling tube efficiency. If the return tube of the cooling tube 124 is omitted,
then its outer tube must:
        1.      have a larger diameter than that of the cooling tube 124 if the cooling tube
is to achieve the same amount of heat transfer; or
        2.      if of the same outer diameter as the cooling tube 124, have a shorter
length than that of the thermosyphon cooling tube 124 and can provide only a lesser
amount of heat transfer due to stagnation inefficiencies and inversion layer formation
that results from the tube's smaller diameter.
[0094]          In yet another alternative embodiment of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted
in FIG. 17 the lower portion of the covered pan 84 and the cooling tube 124 are filled
with oil 138 rather than water. The cooling tube 124 and the pan 84 are first filled with

                                               21
oil 138 up to approximately half the depth of the pan 84. The pan 84 above the oil is
then filled with:
         1.     rain water collected through the lid 88; or
        2.     water from a piped supply controlled by a float valve (not illustrated in any
        of the FIGs.).
[0095]          In the configuration depicted in FIG. 17, the drain tap 128 is not used for
drawing collected rainwater. Rather, the drain tap 128 at the bottom of the cooling tube
124 is now opened only when the oil has to be drained off for servicing the cooling tube
124, or for changing of the oil, probably once every three or four years.
[0096]         The oil chosen for use in the alternative embodiment depicted in FIG. 17:
         1.     must be immiscible in water;
        2.      must be heavier than water;
        3.     should not evaporate at room temperatures;
        4.     should remain liquid and free flowing at room and ambient temperatures;
        and
        5.      have a much higher specific heat capacity than water.
[0097]          For such an oil, water in the pan 84 floating on the oil and cooled by
evaporation sinks and contacts the oil to thereby cool the oil below.
[0098]          Layering water for evaporation above oil, with oil extending down into the
thermosyphon cooling tube 124 including the inner return tube, increases the cooling
capacity of the cooling tube 124 by:
         1.     using oil to store the "coolness;" while
        2.     still permitting the water to evaporate and cool the oil below.
[0099]         And this is done without incurring additional structural cost of a double
walled pan 84 and/or a double walled cooling tube as was shown in FIGs. 15 and 16
etc., or otherwise having to enlarge the cooling tube and coaxial ventilator 20. For the
embodiments of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 15 through 17, material
forming the cooling tube 124 and the surrounding tube 132 must be impervious so the
liquid therein cannot evaporate or leak out.
[00100]        The illustrations of FIGs. 18 and 19 depict yet another alternative
embodiment of a cooling system in the form of coaxial ventilator 20 which includes

                                               22
multiple liquid-filled cooling tubes 124. Similar to the cooling tube 124 depicted in FIGs.
11 and 12, each of the cooling tubes 124 respectively descends downward from the
covered pan 84. However rather than descending along the central axis surrounded by
the inner conduit 62, the multiple cooling tubes 124 depicted in FIGs. 18 and 19
descend into an annularly shaped space 72 located between the inner conduit 62 and
an outer conduit 24 of the coaxial ventilator 20. In the embodiment of the coaxial
ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 18 and 19, the cooling tubes 124 may have the same
configuration as any of the various different types of cooling tubes that are described in
greater detail above and depicted in FIGs. 11 through FIG. 17.
[00101]        Referring now to FIGs. 20 and 21, the outer conduit 24 of the coaxial
ventilator 20 depicted in those FIGs. is encircled by a pair of optional, hollow collar
flanges 142 respectively located:
         1.    above the roof 32 of the building 22; and
        2.     at a ceiling 34 within the building 22 through which the coaxial ventilator
20 passes.
[00102]        Encircling the outer conduit 24 with the collar flanges 142 establishes an
open, annularly shaped space 144 between the outer conduit 24 and the roof 32 and
ceiling 34 respectively about the coaxial ventilator 20. The annularly shaped spaces
144 facilitate ventilating spaces within the building 22 both below and above each of the
collar flanges 142.
[00103]        At the roof 32, attached to a hole through the roof 32, the collar flange 142
includes a collar flashing 152 that extends upward a distance above the roof 32
sufficient to impede rainwater from splashing from the roof 32 into the annularly shaped
space 144. Because the upper end of the collar flashing 152 is smaller in diameter than
the pan 84, the upper opening of the collar flashing 152 about the outer conduit 24 is
inherently somewhat shielded from the entry of rainwater. Where the coaxial ventilator
20 penetrates the ceiling 34, the collar flange 142 includes an open annular collar 156
that passes through the ceiling 34 and extends a short distance above and below the
ceiling 34.
[00104]        The upper end of the collar flange 142 extending above the roof 32
preferably includes flap shutters 162 that may be closed both to block airflow through
the collar flange 142 and the entry of rainwater thereinto. Correspondingly, the collar

                                               23
flange 142 extending through the ceiling 34 preferably includes dampeners 166 that
may be rotated to a closed position to block airflow through the collar flange 142.
[00105]         Both collar flanges 142 respectively located at the roof 32 and at the
ceiling 34 when open provide additional ventilation that reduces any build up or
stagnation of warm air about the coaxial ventilator 20 at the roof 32 and the ceiling 34.
Including the collar flanges 142 about the coaxial ventilator 20 advantageously keeps
the immediate vicinity of the coaxial ventilator 20 cooler thereby improving its efficiency
in transferring cool air from the pan 84 to the room 36 below without the air becoming
unduly heated.
[00106]        As illustrated in FIG. 20, the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in any of the
various FIGs. may also include as set of dampeners 172 located at the lower end of the
coaxial ventilator 20. In climates which experience both heat in summer and cold in
winter, both the shutters 162 and the dampeners 166 as well as the dampeners 172 are
left open during summer so hot air can escape from the building 22, and closed in
winter to conserve heat within the building 22.
[00107]         FIG. 20A shows another aspect of the coaxial ventilator of FIG. 20, further
including a thermoelectric cooling module 500. Fig 20A shows another method of filling
the water pan 84 with water that can be used in locations where is it difficult to bring a
piped water supply to fill the water pan 84. As shown in FIG. 20A, a thermoelectric
Peltier cooling module or other cooling module 500 is located at the bottom of the lid 88
to condense atmospheric water vapor into water droplets which then drip into and fill
water pan 84. Solar photovoltaic cells could be used to provide power the cooling
module 500 and could be mounted on the top surface of lid 88, or positioned at another
suitable location. The photovoltaic cells could also be used to charge batteries (not
shown), thereby extending the power supply of the cooling module 500 into the night,
when solar power is no longer available. Additionally, a lower end of the cooling module
500 could extend into and below the surface of the water in the pan 84 to provide
additional cooling capacity by directly cooling the water pool itself.
[00108]         FIG. 22 illustrates the outer conduit 24 using a space in the form of the
roof cavity (i.e. the area between the roof 32 and ceiling 34) to channel airflow to and/or
from the ends of the outer conduit 24. The roof cavity therefore acts, in part, as the
outer conduit 24, with the collar flanges 142 establishing an annular space 144 at the
roof 32 and ceiling 34 levels. This arrangement saves costs, due to a reduction in the

                                                24
amount of materials, but some flow inefficiencies are introduce due to some air flow
mixing in the roof cavity. However, air flow is still able to readily pass by the lower end
of the inner conduit 62 into / from the roof cavity. That is, at least part of the air may flow
in a substantially linear direction from near the lower end of the inner conduit to the
upper end of the outer conduit 24, or vice versa.
[00109]         FIG. 23 illustrates a coaxial ventilator with an outer conduit 24' having
perforations (i.e. holes) in its outer wall. This allows air to flow from the roof cavity into
the inner portion of the outer conduit 24' and vice versa. The roof cavity therefore acts
as an expanded outer conduit 24'.
[00110]         FIG. 24 illustrates a further cooling system in the form of coaxial ventilator
with, in a similar manner to FIG 22., the outer conduit 24 using a space in the form of
the roof cavity to channel airflow. It will be appreciated that in other alternative forms
perforations may be included in the outer conduit 24, in a similar manner to FIG. 23.
Cooling tubes 124, 126 extend from the water pan 84 in FIG. 24 and are located within
the inner conduit 62. The cooling tubes 124, 126 extend beyond the lower end of the
inner conduit 62 and this may allow, for example, the discharge valve 128 to be easily
accessible.
[00111]         The cooling tubes 124, 126 bias the flow in the inner conduit 62 in a
downwards manner when the cooling tubes 124, 126 are sufficiently cooler than the
outer conduit 24. On this basis, if the water in the cooling tubes 124, 126 is not of
sufficiently lower temperature to influence or bias the air flow in the conduits, the
influence of the cooling tubes 124, 126 is less effective. Accordingly, the air flows are
reversible based upon temperature differential horizontally across the coaxial ventilator.
[00112]         Fig. 25 illustrates another cooling system, in accordance with the present
disclosure, in the form of ventilator 21. The ventilator 21 is similar in construction to the
coaxial ventilators 20 and, as such, like numbering has been used. However, the
following key features are noted.
[00113]         In a similar manner to the ventilator 20 in FIGs. 22 and 24, the ventilator
21 includes an outer conduit 24 that uses at least part of the roof cavity to channel
airflow. In this regard, a portion of the outer conduit 24 is connected to the roof 32 and
provides a passage for directing airflow to and/or from the roof cavity. An inner conduit
62 extends from near an upper end of the outer conduit 24 to a position that is offset

                                               25
from the ceiling 34. That is, a lower end of the inner conduit 62 terminates at a position
that is unaligned with part of the building 22 that is adjacent thereto. In other words, the
lower end of the inner conduit 62 is not coterminous with the outer conduit 24 and/or
with the ceiling 34 thereabove.
[00114]         The cooling tubes 124, 126 of the embodiment shown in FIG. 25 are
connected to pan 84 and extend from a position above the inner conduit 62 to a position
that is offset from ceiling 34. Separately, the cooling tubes 124, 126 extend below the
end of the outer conduit 24 and below the lower end of the inner conduit 62. In this
regard, the discharge valve 128 is located below the end of the inner conduit 62. The
cooling tubes 124, 126 are regulated in FIG. 25 in such a manner that they are
sufficiently cooled to ensure that air moves down the inner conduit 62 to the room 36.
The modified outer conduit 24 (using the roof cavity) and the shortened inner conduit (in
relation to the extended cooling tubes 124, 126) save material costs and reduce roof
structural loading (avoiding the costs for further reinforcement). The protruding lower
end of the cooling tubes 124, 126 provides extra cooling surface for radiative,
convective and conductive cooling to the room 36.
[00115]         With the above in mind, an advantage of offsetting the inner conduit 62
and cooling tubes 124, 126 from the ceiling 34 is that the cool downward flowing air can
be focused in areas where it is most needed. By way of example, cool air entering high
ceiling rooms may result in cool air dissipating before it reaches a suitable area to cool
patrons of a building. On this basis, by offsetting the inner conduit 62 and cooling tubes
124, 126 from the ceiling 34 and extending them into to a suitable area in the room (e.g.
2.5 metres above the floor), the cooling effect in the room 36 may be more effective.
[00116]         Furthermore, the embodiment shown in FIG. 25 also provides cost
savings, and roof structural load savings in a similar manner to FIGs 22 and 24, by
reducing the amount of materials associated with the outer conduit 34. As outlined
above, savings may also be employed with regard to the material associated with the
inner conduit 62. This is particularly advantageous in warehouses, shopping malls,
factories and so forth which have large roof spans and/or high ceilings and, as such,
targeting of cooling to patrons and personnel is preferably required.
[00117]         FIG. 26 illustrates another ventilator 21' in accordance with the present
disclosure. The ventilator 21' is substantially similar to the ventilator 21, shown in FIG.
25, but a lower portion of the ventilator 21' does not engage with the ceiling 26. That is,

                                               26
as the roof 32 forms the ceiling 34, the lower portion of the inner conduit 62 does not
engage with the ceiling 34. In a similar manner to the ventilator 21, the cooling tubes
124, 126 of the ventilator 21' extend below the lower end of the inner conduit 62. The
arrangement of the ventilator 21' assists in focusing the cooler downward stream air at a
suitable level below the high ceiling 34 and allows savings on material costs and the
structural loading on the roof 32.
[00118]        FIG. 27 illustrates a cooling system 21" that is based upon the ventilator
21', shown in FIG. 26, but the inner conduit 62 has been removed. In a similar manner
to FIGs. 22 to 26, the collar flanges 142, 152 form an annular opening 144 in the roof
32. The annular opening 144 is sized wide enough so that the upwards (exhaust) warm
air can flow around its perimeter whilst the downwards fresh air, cooled by the water
pan 84 and cooling tubes 124, 126, can flow down around the central portion of the
annular opening 144 without the warm and cool flows substantially mixing. It will be
appreciated that the annular opening 144, with a single outer conduit, will have to be
wider than the previous embodiments to achieve similar flow rates but, in buildings
where large openings or air wells can be allowed, this is a simple, low cost and low
structural weight solution. With the above in mind, the water pan cover 82 will also have
to be sized wide enough to prevent rain from falling into the annular opening 144 or
alternatively, the cooling system of water pan 84 and cooling tube 124, 126 can be
placed in an air well in a building. FIG. 28 illustrates a cross sectional view of the
embodiment shown in FIG. 27.
[00119]        The cooling system 21"' shown in FIG. 29 includes the cooling tubes 124,
126 in combination with the pan 84. The pan 84 includes an opening exposing it to
atmospheric conditions. The cooling tubes 124, 126 are configured to engage with the
roof 32 and support the pan 84 thereabove. The cooling system 21"' in FIG. 29 is
suitable for applications where, for instance, the air above roof 32 may be close to an
exhaust (e.g. a fume chimney). Similarly, for sound insulation purposes, or where the
room below is air conditioned and the humidity is controlled etc., it may be more suitable
to use the cooling system 21 "'shown in FIG. 29. Moreover, where there are already
many other openings in the roof 32 and/or walls nearby for ventilation, an opening
around the cooling tube 124,126 may not be required. To further appreciate the cooling
system 21"'shown in FIG. 29, FIG. 30 illustrates a cross sectional view of the cooling
system in FIG.29.
