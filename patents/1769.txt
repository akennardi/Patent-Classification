 The present invention provides methods to determine whether a patient with a
lysosomal storage disorder will benefit from treatment with a specific
pharmacological chaperone. The present invention exemplifies an in vitro
method for determining a-galactosidase A responsiveness to a pharmacological
chaperone such as 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin in a cell line expressing a mutant
from of a-galactosidase A. The invention also provides a method for diagnosing
Fabry disease in patients suspected of having Fabry disease.

                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                The present invention provides methods to determine whether a patient with a
      lysosomal      storage   disorder will      benefit  from   treatment  with   a specific
      pharmacological chaperone. The present invention also provides an in vitro method
 15   for     determining     enzyme      (e.g.,    a-galactosidase    A,   a-glucosidase   or
      glucocerebrosidase)     responsiveness to a pharmacological         chaperone (e.g.,  1
      deoxygalactonojirimycin,       1-deoxynojirimycin     or isofagomine)   in a cell line
      expressing a mutant form of the enzyme. The invention also provides a method for
      diagnosing a lysosomal storage disorder (e.g., Fabry disease, Pompe disease or
20    Gaucher disease) in patients suspected of having a lysosomal storage disorder, and
      implementing the proper treatment based on the diagnosis (e.g., choosing a particular
      therapeutic agent to administer to the patient).
                                         BACKGROUND
25             In the human body, proteins are involved in almost every aspect of cellular
     function. Proteins are linear strings of amino acids that fold and twist into specific
     three-dimensional shapes in order to function properly. Certain human diseases result
     from mutations that cause changes in the amino acid sequence of a protein which
     reduce its stability and may prevent it from folding properly. The majority of genetic
30   mutations that lead to the production of less stable or misfolded proteins are called
     missense mutations. These mutations result in the substitution of a single amino acid
     for another in the protein. Because of this error, missense mutations often result in
     proteins that have a reduced level of biological activity. In addition to missense
                                                 1

       mutations, there are also other types of mutations that can result in proteins with
       reduced biological activity.
               Proteins generally fold in a specific region of the cell known as the
       endoplasmic reticulum, or ER. The cell has quality control mechanisms that ensure
   5   that proteins are folded into their correct three-dimensional shape before they can
       move from the ER to the appropriate destination in the cell, a process generally
       referred to as protein trafficking. Misfolded proteins are often eliminated by the
       quality control mechanisms after initially being retained in the ER. In certain
       instances, misfolded proteins can accumulate in the ER before being eliminated.
 10            The retention of misfolded proteins in the ER interrupts their proper
      trafficking, and the resulting reduced biological activity can lead to impaired cellular
      function and ultimately to disease. In addition, the accumulation of misfolded proteins
      in the ER may lead to various types of stress on cells, which may also contribute to
      cellular dysfunction and disease.
 15            Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are characterized by deficiencies of
      lysosomal enzymes due to mutations in the genes encoding the lysosomal enzymes.
      This results in the pathologic accumulation of substrates of those enzymes, which
      include lipids, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. There are about fifty known LSDs
      to date, which include Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, Tay Sachs
20   disease and the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS).            Most LSDs are inherited as an
     autosomal recessive trait, although males with Fabry disease and MPS II are
     hemizygotes because the disease genes are encoded on the X chromosome. For most
     LSDs, there is no available treatment beyond symptomatic management, For several
     LSDs, including Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe, and MPS I and VI, enzyme replacement
25   therapy (ERT) using recombinant enzymes is available.             For Gaucher disease,
     substrate reduction therapy (SRT) also is available in limited situations.         SRT
     employs a small molecule inhibitor of an enzyme required for the synthesis of
     glucosylceramide (the GD substrate). The goal of SRT is to reduce production of the
     substrate and reduce pathologic accumulation.
30            Although there are many different mutant genotypes associated with each
     LSD, some of the mutations, including some of the most prevalent mutations, are
     missense mutations which can lead to the production of a less stable enzyme. These
     less stable enzymes are sometimes prematurely degraded by the ER-associated
                                                       2

     degradation pathway. This results in the enzyme deficiency in the lysosome, and the
     pathologic accumulation of substrate.      Such mutant enzymes are sometimes referred
     to in the pertinent art as "folding mutants" or "conformational mutants."
  5                                  Diagnosis of Fabry Disease
             Because Fabry disease is rare, involves multiple organs, has a wide age range
     of onset, and is heterogeneous, proper diagnosis is a challenge. Awareness is low
     among health care professionals and misdiagnoses are frequent. Some examples of
    diagnoses seriously considered in patients who were eventually diagnosed with
10  Fabry's disease include: mitral valve prolapse, glomerulonephritis, idiopathic
    proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, Whipple's disease, acute abdomen,
    ulcerative colitis, acute intermittent porphyrias, and occult malignancies. Thus, even
    for classically affected males, diagnosis typically takes from about 5-7 years or even
    longer. This is a concern because the longer a person has Fabry disease, the more
15  damage is likely to occur in the affected organs and tissues and the more serious the
    person's condition may become. Diagnosis of Fabry disease is most often confirmed
    on the basis of decreased a-Gal A activity in plasma or peripheral leukocytes (WBCs)
    once a patient is symptomatic, coupled with mutational analysis. In females,
    diagnosis is even more challenging since the enzymatic identification of carrier
20  females is less reliable due to random X-chromosomal inactivation in some cells of
    carriers. For example, some obligate carriers (daughters of classically affected males)
    have a-Gal A enzyme activities ranging from normal to very low activities. Since
    carriers can have normal a-Gal A enzyme activity in leukocytes, only the
    identification of an a-Gal A mutation by genetic testing provides precise carrier
25  identification and/or diagnosis.
                                    Treatment of Fabry Disease
             One approved therapy for treating Fabry disease diseases is enzyme
    replacement therapy, which typically involves intravenous, infusion of a purified form
30  of the corresponding wild-type protein (Fabrazyme*, Genzyme Corp.). One of the
    main complications with protein replacement therapy is attainment and maintenance
    of therapeutically effective amounts of protein in vivo due to rapid degradation of the
                                                       3

   infused protein.    The current approach to overcome this problem is to perform
   numerous costly high dose infusions.
           Protein replacement therapy has several additional caveats, such as difficulties
   with large-scale generation, purification, and storage of properly folded protein;
 5 obtaining glycosylated native protein; generation of an anti-protein immune response;
   and inability of protein to cross the blood-brain barrier to mitigate central nervous
   system pathologies (i.e., low bioavailability). In addition, replacement enzyme cannot
   penetrate the heart or kidney in sufficient amounts to reduce substrate accumulation in
   the renal podocytes or cardiac myocytes, which figure prominently in Fabry
10 pathology.
            Gene therapy using recombinant vectors containing nucleic acid sequences
   that encode a functional protein, or using genetically modified human cells that
   express a functional protein, is also being developed to treat protein deficiencies and
   other disorders that benefit from protein replacement.
15          A third, relatively recent approach to treating some enzyme deficiencies
    involves the use of small molecule inhibitors to reduce production of the natural
    substrate of deficient enzyme proteins, thereby ameliorating the pathology. This
    "substrate reduction" approach has been specifically described for a class of about 40
   related    enzyme    disorders   called    lysosomal  storage   disorders  that include
20  glycosphingolipid storage disorders. The small molecule inhibitors proposed for use
    as therapy are specific for inhibiting the enzymes involved in synthesis of glycolipids,
    reducing the amount of cellular glycolipid that needs to be broken down by the
    deficient enzyme.
            It has previously been shown that the binding of small molecule inhibitors of
25  enzymes associated with LSDs can increase the stability of both mutant enzyme and
    the corresponding wild-type enzyme (see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,274,597; 6,583,158;
    6,589,964; 6,599,919; 6,916,829, and 7,141,582 all incorporated herein by reference).
    In particular, it was discovered that administration of small molecule derivatives of
    glucose and galactose, which are specific, selective competitive inhibitors for several
30  target lysosomal enzymes, effectively increasedthe stability of the enzymes in cells
    in vitro and, thus, increased trafficking of the enzymes to the lysosome. Thus, by
    increasing the amount of enzyme in the lysosome, hydrolysis of the enzyme substrates
    is expected to increase. The original theory behind this strategy was as follows: since
                                                      4

   the mutant enzyme protein is unstable in the ER (Ishii et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.
   Comm. 1996; 220: 812-815), the enzyme protein is retarded in the normal transport
   pathway (ER -+ Golgi apparatus          -*  endosomes -+ lysosome) and prematurely
   degraded.     Therefore, a compound which binds to and increases the stability of a
 5 mutant enzyme, may serve as a "chaperone" for the enzyme and increase the amount
   that can exit the ER and move to the lysosomes. In addition, because the folding and
   trafficking of some wild-type proteins is incomplete, with up to 70% of some wild
   type proteins being degraded in some instances prior to reaching their final cellular
   location, the chaperones can be used to stabilize wild-type enzymes and increase the
10 amount of enzyme which can exit the ER and be trafficked to lysosomes. This
   strategy has been shown to increase several lysosomal enzymes in vitro and in vivo,
   including p-glucocerebrosidase and a-glucosidase, deficiencies of which are
   associated with Gaucher and Pompe disease, respectively.
            However, as indicated above, successful candidates for SPC therapy should
15 have a mutation which results in the production of an enzyme that has the potential to
   be stabilized and folded into a conformation that permits trafficking out of the ER.
   Mutations which severely truncate the enzyme, such as nonsense mutations, or
   mutations in the catalytic domain which prevent binding of the chaperone, will not be
   as likely to be "rescuable" or "enhanceable" using SPC therapy, i.e., to respond to
20 SPC therapy. While missense mutations outside the catalytic site are more likely to
   be rescuable using SPCs, there is no guarantee, necessitating screening for responsive
   mutations. This means that, even when Fabry disease is diagnosed by detecting
   deficient a-Gal A activity in WBCs, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to predict
   whether a particular Fabry patient will respond to treatment with an SPC without
25 benefit of the present invention. Moreover, since WBCs only survive for a short
   period of time in culture (in vitro), screening for SPC enhancement of a-Gal A is
   difficult and not optimal for the patient..
            In order to apply SPC therapy effectively, a broadly applicable, fast and
   efficient method for screening patients for responsiveness to SPC therapy needs to be
30 adopted prior to initiation of treatment. Treatment can then be implemented based on
   the results of the screening Thus, there remains in the art a need for relatively non
   invasive methods to rapidly assess enzyme enhancement with potential therapies prior
   to making treatment decisions, for both cost and emotional benefits to the patient.

           One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for determining
 5 whether a patient will be a candidate for SPC therapy. Specifically, the present
   invention provides an in vitro assay to evaluate protein activity in the presence or
   absence of an SPC, wherein an SPC that increases the activity of the protein in the in
   vitro assay is an SPC that can be used for SPC therapy. In one embodiment, the in
   vitro assay comprises expressing a mutant protein in a host cell, contacting the mutant
10 protein with a candidate SPC, and determining if the mutant protein contacted with
   the SPC exhibits an increased level of activity (preferably a statistically significant
   increase) when compared to a mutant protein expressed in a host cell that is not
   contacted with the candidate SPC. When a candidate SPC increases the activity of a
   mutant protein according to the assay of the invention, such a candidate SPC can be
15  used for SPC therapy to treat a patient expressing the same mutant protein tested in
   the in vitro assay.
            In one embodiment, the protein is an enzyme. In another embodiment, the
    protein is a lysosomal enzyme. In yet another embodiment, the protein is a
    galactosidase A (a-GAL; a-GAL A). In other embodiments, the protein is alpha
20  glucosidase (Acid a-glucosidase ; a-glucosidase; GAA). In other embodiments, the
    protein is glucocerebrosidase (p-glucosidase; Gba; GCase).
            The present invention also includes the basis for evaluation of SPC as a
    treatment option for any number of other protein abnormalities and/or enzyme
    deficiencies and/or a protein folding disorders.
25          The present invention further provides a written record (e.g., a "treatment
    reference table") listing protein mutations and the responsiveness of each of the
    mutations to SPC therapy. Such a list can be used in determining treatment options
    for a patient, whereby the patient, or the patient's physician or doctor, can select the
    proper therapeutic approach, for example, an SPC for treatment by identifying the
30  patient's protein mutation, and cross-referencing the mutation with the list to identify
    whether an SPC will increase the activity of the patients particular mutant enzyme.
            In another embodiment, the "treatment reference table" lists mutations for a
     lysosomal enzyme, and the treatment reference table is employed to determine the
                                                     6

   best therapeutic approach to treat a lysosomal storage disorder. In a further
   embodiment of the invention, the protein is a-Gal A, and the disease is Fabry disease.
   In other embodiments of the invention, the protein is GAA, and the disease is Pompe
   disease. In other embodiments of the invention, the protein is Gba, and the disease is
 5 Gaucher disease.
            In one embodiment, the treatment reference table describes mutant forms of
   enzyme, such as a lysomal enzyme (e.g., a-Gal A, Gcase, and GAA) and treatment
   options are ascertained for lysosomal storage disorders (e.g., Fabry, Gacher and
   Pompe Disease).
10          In one embodiment, the invention also provides for methods of creating a
   treatment reference table, wherein the treatment reference table can be for any protein
   folding disorder or disorder treatable with an SPC. This class of disease includes the
   other lysosomal storage disorders, Cystic Fibrosis (CFTR) (respiratory or sweat gland
   epithelial cells), familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL receptor; LPL-adipocytes or
15 vascular endothelial cells), cancer (p5 3 ; PTEN-tumor cells), and amyloidoses
   (transthyretin) among others.
           In another embodiment, the present invention provides for methods of treating
   a patient diagnosed as expressing certain mutant proteins (e.g., lysosomal enzymes
   such as a-GAL A), wherein activity of the mutant protein (e.g., a-Gal A), when
20 expressed in a host cell, can be increased upon administration of an SPC for that
   protein (for example, 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin, DGJ, as an SPC for mutant a-GAL
   A).
           The present invention also provides for diagnostic kits containing the
   components required to perform the assay.

           Figure 1A-C. Shows a listing of Fabry mutations generated by site-directed
   mutagenesis. The text indicates whether HEK-293 cells expressing each of the listed
30 mutations responds to DGJ treatment in the transient transfection assay: italics=not
   yet tested; bold and underscored=no response to DGJ; plain text (not italicized, bold,
   or underscored)= response to DGJ.

             Figure 2A-C Shows the responsiveness of different a-Gal A mutations to DGJ
   treatment. The magnitude of increase in a-Gal A activity levels after DGJ treatment
   and EC50 values are listed for every tested mutation in Figure 1A-D that responded to
   DGJ treatment. The increase in enzyme activity is shown as a percentage of wild type
 5 a-Gal A activity.
             Figure 3 Shows representative examples of wild type and mutant a-Gal A
   responses to DGJ treatment. a-Gal A activity (expressed as nmol/mg protein/hr of 4
   MU released) was measured in lysates prepared from transfected HEK 293 cells
    incubated with increasing concentrations of DGJ. A typical concentration-dependent
10 response is shown for L300P and a typical negative response to DGJ is shown for
    R227Q. Wild type exhibits high baseline activity and thus does not respond to DGJ in
    this assay.
             Figure 4 Shows that the mutation response in HEK 293 cells are comparable
    to patient-derived T-cells, lymphoblasts or white blood cells in vivo . a-Gal A levels
15  measured in three different assays, reported as percentage of wild type, are compared
    for each mutation examined. a-Gal A levels were measured in T-Cells, lymphoblasts,
    white blood cells and HEK 293 cells expressing mutant a-Gal A before and after
    exposure to DGJ. Blank bars indicate basal level (without DGJ treatment) and filled
    bars indicate the elevated level after DGJ treatment.
20           Figure 5 Shows that DGJ-responsive a-Gal A mutations are widely
    distributed on the a-Gal A protein sequence. Tested Fabry mutations are illustrated
    on the a-Gal A secondary structure. No significant correlation between response and
    location on the protein sequence of a mutation was observed, suggesting that
    responsive as well as non-responsive mutations are distributed widely across the
25  entire protein. Text color indicates DGJ response: green=response; red=no response;
    brown indicates that of the multiple mutations on that same site some responded to
     DGJ treatment, while others did not.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           The present invention provides an in vitro assay to provide accurate
   determination of whether an SPC enhances activity of a mutant protein.
30         In one embodiment, the protein is a lysosomal enzyme, wherein the lysosomal
   enzyme, when mutated, causes a lysosomal storage disorder. The concepts of
   thepresent invention, however, can be globally applied to any disease or condition
   characterized by mutant proteins amenable to SPC-therapy, in which the proteins have
                                                    9

   one or more specific mutations that can be generated in vitro, for example, by site
   directed mutagenesis.
            In one specific embodiment, the invention provides methods for determining
   whether an SPC enhances enzyme activity of a mutant a-Gal A enzyme, and can
 5 therefore be utilized as an effective therapeutic treatment for a Fabry disease patient
   expressing the same a-Gal A mutation.
            In another specific embodiment, the invention provides methods for
   determining whether an SPC enhances enzyme activity of a mutant GAA enzyme, and
   can therefore be utilized as an effective therapeutic treatment for a Pompe disease
10 patient expressing the same GAA mutation.
             In another specific embodiment, the invention provides methods for
    determining whether an SPC enhances enzyme activity of a mutant Gba enzyme, and
    can therefore be utilized as an effective therapeutic treatment for a Gaucher disease
    patient expressing the same Gba mutation.
15           According to the methods of the present invention, assays are provided that
    allow for the determination of whether a patient expressing a mutant lysosomal
    enzyme will be a candidate for SPC therapy. The new in vitro assay is extremely
    sensitive and can be performed on a host cell transfected with a nucleic acid construct
    encoding a mutant lysosomal enzyme. Specific candidate SPCs can then be assayed
20  to determine if the candidate SPC is capable of increasing the activity of the mutant
    enzyme expressed by the host cell. Thus, unlike assays which utilize cells derived
    from a patient with a lysosomal storage disorder, the assay of the invention avoids
    time consuming steps such as collection of a sample from a patient, purification of
    cells from the sample, and culturing the cells from the sample in vitro.
25            The present invention also provides for a method of determining whether a
    patient expressing a mutant protein (e.g. a lysosomal enzyme) will be a candidate for
     SPC therapy, wherein a person, for example, a patient's physician or doctor, can look
     up the mutant protein (e.g. a lysosomal enzyme mutation) in a treatment reference
     table to determine if the patient's mutation will respond to SPC therapy. The
30   reference table is generated from the results of in vitro analysis of SPC response in a
     cell line that has been transformed with a nucleic acid vector which encodes the
     mutant protein.
                                                      10

            Furthermore, the invention also provides a "Treatment Reference Table" that
   provides information describing if a particular SPC will be a successful therapy for
   enhancing the activity of a specific lysosomal enzyme mutation. According to the
   present invention, the treatment reference table provides information indicating if a
 5 candidate SPC can increase the activity of a mutant lysosomal enzyme expressed by a
   host cell. Based on the response of different mutations to different SPC therapies, the
   present invention can provide SPC therapy tailored to the patient's specific mutation.
            In one non-limiting embodiment, the mutant protein is a mutant lysosomal
   enzyme, such as, for example, a mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba, and the cell line is
10 transfected with a nucleic acid vector which encodes the mutant lysosomal enzyme.
            In another non-limiting embodiment, the present invention provides a method
   of treating a Fabry patient that includes the step of administering to the Fabry patient
   a therapeuticaly effective dose of 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ), wherein the
   patient expresses a mutant a-Gal A, the activity of which, when expressed in a host
15 cell, can be increased when contacted with an SPC (e.g DGJ). Such a-Gal A
   mutations treatable according to this method include, but are not limited to A121T,
   A156V, A20P, A288D, A288P, A292P A348P, A73V, C52R, C94Y, D234E, D244H,

   L300F, L31OF, L32P, L45R, M2671, M284T, M2961, M296V, M72V, M76R, N224S,

25 R49S, S201Y, S276N, S297C, S345P, T1941, V269M, V316E, W340R, W47L, and
   W95S mutations.
           In one embodiment, the following a-Gal A mutations are excluded from the
   methods of treating a Fabry patient with a therapeutically effective dose of DGJ:
   D244N, E358K, E59K, E66Q, G183D, G325D, 1289F, 191T, L45R, M296V, N263S,
30 N320Y, P205R, P40S, Q279E, R342Q, R363C, R49L, V316E.
           One advantage of the assay described by the present invention is its
   applicability to female patients with an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, such as
   Fabry disease. Because of X-chromosome inactivation, a sample taken from a female
                                                    11

    patient will comprise both normal healthy cells and enzyme deficient mutant cells.
    An assay for an SPC's effect on such a sample will show an enhancement in enzyme
    activity due to the normal wild type enzyme expression of the healthy cells even
    though the diseased cells with the mutant enzyme may not be responsive to the SPC.
 5  The present invention overcomes this obstacle because a cell line transfected with a
    vector encoding a mutant protein will only express the mutant form of the protein, and
    thus, there will be no wild type protein expressed by the cell line to cause such pseudo
    enhancement observed in assays with patient derived cells.
              In another non-limiting embodiment, the present invention provides a method
10  of treating a Pompe patient that includes the step of administering to the Pompe
    patient a therapeuticaly effective dose of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), wherein the
    patient expresses a mutant GAA, the activity of which, when expressed in a host cell,
     can be increased when contacted with an SPC (e.g. DNJ). Such GAA mutations
     treatable according to this method include, but are not limited to, E262K, P266S,
15   P285R, P285S, L291F, L291H, L291P, M318K, G377R, A445P, Y455C, Y455F,
     P457L, G483R, G483V, M519V, S529V, P545L, G549R, L552P, Y575S, E579K,
     A61OV, H612Q, A644P, and AN470 mutations.
              In another non-limiting embodiment, the present invention provides a method
     of treating a Gaucher patient with a therapeuticaly effective dose of isofagomine
20   (IFG), wherein the patient expresses a mutant Gba, the activity of which, when
     expressed in a host cell, can be increased when contacted with an SPC (e.g. IFG).
                                             Definitions
25             The terms used in this specification generally have their ordinary meanings in
      the art, within the context of this invention and in the specific context where each
      term is used. Certain terms are discussed below, or elsewhere in the specification, to
      provide additional guidance to the practitioner in describing the compositions and
      methods of the invention and how to make and use them.
 30            The term "Fabry disease" refers to an X-linked inborn error of
      glycosphingolipid catabolism due to deficient lysosomal a-galactosidase A activity.
      This defect causes accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (ceramide trihexoside) and
                                                        12

     related glycosphingolipids in vascular endothelial lysosomes of the heart, kidneys,
     skin, and other tissues.
              The term "atypical Fabry disease" refers to patients with primarily cardiac
     manifestations of the a-Gal A deficiency, namely progressive globotriaosylceramide
  5  (GL-3) accumulation in myocardial cells that leads to significant enlargement of the
     heart, particularly the left ventricle.
             A "carrier" is a female who has one X chromosome with a defective a-Gal A
     gene and one X chromosome with the normal gene and in whom X chromosome
     inactivation of the normal allele is present in one or more cell types. A carrier is often
10   diagnosed with Fabry disease.
             "Pompe disease" refers to an autosomal recessive LSD characterized by
     deficient acid alpha glucosidase (GAA) activity which impairs lysosomal glycogen
     metabolism. The enzyme deficiency leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation and
     results in progressive skeletal muscle weakness, reduced cardiac function, respiratory
15   insufficiency, and/or CNS impairment at late stages of disease. Genetic mutations in
     the GAA gene result in either lower expression or produce mutant forms of the
     enzyme with altered stability, and/or biological activity ultimately leading to disease.
     (see generally Hirschhorn R, 1995, Glycogen Storage Disease Type II: Acid a
     Glucosidase (Acid Maltase) Deficiency, The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of
20  Inherited Disease, Scriver et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 7th ed., pages 2443
    2464). The three recognized clinical forms of Pompe disease (infantile, juvenile and
    adult) are correlated with the level of residual a-glucosidase activity (Reuser A J et
    al., 1995, Glycogenosis Type II (Acid Maltase Deficiency), Muscle & Nerve
     Supplement 3, S61-S69). ASSC (also referred to elsewhere as "pharmacological
25  chaperones") represent a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of
    genetic diseases, such as lysosomal storage disorders (e.g. Pompe Disease).
             Infantile Pompe disease (type I or A) is most common and most severe,
    characterized by failure to thrive, generalized hypotonia, cardiac hypertrophy, and
    cardiorespiratory failure within the second year of life. Juvenile Pompe disease (type
30  II or B) is intermediate in severity and is characterized by a predominance of
    muscular symptoms without cardiomegaly. Juvenile Pompe individuals usually die
    before reaching 20 years of age due to respiratory failure. Adult Pompe disease (type
    III or C) often presents as a slowly progressive myopathy in the teenage years or as
                                                       13

   late as the sixth decade (Felice K J et al., 1995, Clinical Variability in Adult-Onset
   Acid Maltase Deficiency: Report of Affected Sibs and Review of the Literature,
   Medicine 74, 131-135).
            In Pompe, it has been shown that a-glucosidase is extensively modified post
 5 translationally by glycosylation, phosphorylation,         and proteolytic   processing.
   Conversion of the 110 kilodalton (kDa) precursor to 76 and 70 kDa mature forms by
   proteolysis in the lysosome is required for optimum glycogen catalysis.
            As used herein, the term "Pompe Disease" refers to all types of Pompe
   Disease. The formulations and dosing regimens disclosed in this application may be
10 used to treat, for example, Type I, Type II or Type III Pompe Disease.
            The term "Gaucher disease" refers to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme p
   glucocerebrosidase (Gba) that breaks down fatty glucocerebrosides. The fat then
   accumulates, mostly in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Gaucher disease can result
   in pain, fatigue, jaundice, bone damage, anemia and even death. There are three
15  clinical phenotypes of Gaucher disease. Patients with, Type 1 manifest either early in
    life or in young adulthood, bruise easily and experience fatigue due to anemia, low
   blood platelets, enlargement of the liver and spleen, weakening of the skeleton, and in
    some instances have lung and kidney impairment. There are no signs of brain
    involvement. In Type II, early-onset, liver and spleen enlargement occurs by 3 months
20  of age and there is extensive brain involvement. There is a high mortality rate by age
    2. Type III is characterized by liver and spleen enlargement and brain seizures. The p
    glucocerebrosidase gene is located on the human 1q21 chromosome. Its protein
    precursor contains 536 amino acids and its mature protein is 497 amino acids long.
             A "patient" refers to a subject who has been diagnosed with or is suspected of
25  having a particular disease. The patient may be human or animal.
             A "Fabry disease patient" refers to an individual who has been diagnosed with
    or suspected of having Fabry disease and has a mutated a-Gal A as defined further
    below. Characteristic markers of Fabry disease can occur in male hemizygotes and
    female carriers with the same prevalence, although females typically are less severely
30  affected.
             A "Pompe disease patient" refers to an individual who has been diagnosed
    with or suspected of having Pompe disease and has a mutated GAA as defined further
    below.

              A "Gaucher disease patient" refers to an individual who has been diagnosed
     with or suspected of having Gaucher disease and has a mutated Gba as defined further
     below.
             Human a-galactosidase A (a-Gal A) refers to an enzyme encoded by the
  5  human GLA gene. The human a-Gal A enzyme consists of 429 amino acids and is in
     GenBank Accession No. U78027.
             In one non-limiting embodiment, human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (Acid a
     glucosidase ; GAA) is a lysosomal enzyme which hydrolyzes alpha-1,4- and alpha
     1,6-linked-D-glucose polymers present in glycogen, maltose, and isomaltose.
 10  Alternative names are as follows: glucoamylase; 1,4-a-D-glucan glucohydrolase;
     amyloglucosidase; gamma-amylase; and exo-1,4-a-glucosidase. The human GAA
     gene has been mapped to chromosome 17q25.2-25.3 and has nucleotide and amino
     acid sequences depicted in GenBank Accession No. Y00839.
             The term "human Gba gene" refers to the gene encoding acid p-glucosidase,
 15  also referred to as glucocerebrosidase or Gba. The Gba gene is on chromosome 1q21
     and involves 11 exons (GenBank Accession No. J03059). There is also a homologous
     pseudogene for Gba located about 16 kb downstream of the Gba gene (GenBank
     Accession No. M16328).
             The "human Gba" protein refers to the wild-type human Gba protein. The
20   Gba protein consists of 536 amino acids and is in GenBank Accession No. J03059.
             The term "mutant protein" includes a protein which has a mutation in the gene
    encoding the protein which results in the inability of the protein to achieve a stable
    conformation under the conditions normally present in the ER. The failure to achieve
    a stable conformation results in a substantial amount of the enzyme being degraded,
25  rather than being transported to the lysosome. Such a mutation is sometimes called a
    "conformational mutant." Such mutations include, but are not limited to, missense
    mutations, and in-frame small deletions and insertions.
             As used herein in one embodiment, the term "mutant a-Gal A" includes an a
    Gal A which has a mutation in the gene encoding a-Gal A which results in the
30  inability of the enzyme to achieve a stable conformation under the conditions
    normally present in the ER. The failure to achieve a stable conformation results in a
    substantial amount of the enzyme being degraded, rather than being transported to the
    lysosome.

            As used herein in one embodiment, the term "mutant GAA" includes a GAA
   which has a mutation in the gene encoding GAA which results in the inability of the
10 enzyme to achieve a stable conformation under the conditions normally present in the
   ER. The failure to achieve a stable conformation results in a substantial amount of the
   enzyme being degraded, rather than being transported to the lysosome.
            As used herein in one embodiment, the term "mutant Gba" includes a Gba
   which has a mutation in the gene encoding Gba which results in the inability of the
15 enzyme to achieve a stable conformation under the conditions normally present in the
   ER. The failure to achieve a stable conformation results in a substantial amount of the
   enzyme being degraded, rather than being transported to the lysosome.
            As used herein, the term "specific pharmacological chaperone" ("SPC") or
   "pharmacological chaperone" refers to any molecule including a small molecule,
20 protein, peptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, etc. that specifically binds to a protein
   and has one or more of the following effects: (i) enhances the formation of a stable
   molecular conformation of the protein; (ii) induces trafficking of the protein from the
   ER to another cellular location, preferably a native cellular location, i.e., prevents ER
   associated degradation of the protein; (iii) prevents aggregation of misfolded proteins;
25 and/or (iv) restores or enhances at least partial wild-type function and/or activity to
   the protein. A compound that specifically binds to e.g., a-Gal A, GAA or Gba, means
   that it binds to and exerts a chaperone effect on the enzyme and not a generic group of
   related or unrelated enzymes. More specifically, this term does not refer to
   endogenous chaperones, such as BiP, or to non-specific agents which have
30  demonstrated non-specific chaperone activity against various proteins, such as
    glycerol, DMSO or deuterated water, i.e., chemical chaperones (see Welch et al., Cell
    Stress and Chaperones 1996; 1(2):109-115; Welch et al., Journal of Bioenergetics
    and Biomembranes 1997; 29(5):491-502; U.S. Patent No. 5,900,360; U.S. Patent No.

       6,270,954; and U.S. Patent No. 6,541,195). In the present invention, the SPC may be
       a reversible competitive inhibitor.
                A "competitive inhibitor" of an enzyme can refer to a compound which
       structurally resembles the chemical structure and molecular geometry of the enzyme
   5   substrate to bind the enzyme in approximately the same location as the substrate.
      Thus, the inhibitor competes for the same active site as the substrate molecule, thus
      increasing the Km. Competitive inhibition is usually reversible if sufficient substrate
      molecules are available to displace the inhibitor, i.e., competitive inhibitors can bind
      reversibly. Therefore, the amount of enzyme inhibition depends upon the inhibitor
 10   concentration, substrate concentration, and the relative affinities of the inhibitor and
      substrate for the active site.
               Following is a description of some specific pharmacological chaperones
      (SPCs) contemplated by this invention:
               In    one    particular    non-limiting   embodiment,     the    SPC     is   1
 15   deoxygalactonorjirimycin       which refers to a compound having the following
      structures:

   for example, IFG tartrate (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication
   20070281975.) IFG has a molecular formula of C6H13N03 and a molecular weight of

   al., and 5,863,903, to Lundgren et al.
             Still other SPCs for Gba are described in U.S. Patent 6,916,829 to Fan et al.,
    and   include      C-benzyl    isofagomine    and    derivatives,  N-alkyl    (C9-12)-DNJ,

     carboxypentyl DNJ, a-homonojirimycin, and castanospermine.
             As used herein, the term "specifically binds" refers to the interaction of a
 10  pharmacological chaperone with a protein such as a-Gal A, Gba or GAA, specifically,
     an interaction with amino acid residues of the protein that directly participate in
     contacting the pharmacological chaperone. A pharmacological chaperone specifically
     binds a target protein, e.g., a-Gal A, Gba or GAA, to exert a chaperone effect on the
     protein and not a generic group of related or unrelated proteins.       The amino acid
 15  residues of a protein that interact with any given pharmacological chaperone may or
     may not be within the protein's "active site."       Specific binding can be evaluated
     through routine binding assays or through structural studies, e.g., co-crystallization,
    NMR, and the like. The active site for a-Gal A, Gba or GAA is the substrate binding
     site.
20           "Deficient a-Gal A activity" refers to a-Gal A activity in cells from a patient
    which is below the normal range as compared (using the same methods) to the activity
    in normal individuals not having or suspected of having Fabry or any other disease
    (especially a blood disease).
             "Deficient Gba activity" refers to Gba activity in cells from a patient which is
25  below the normal range as compared (using the same methods) to the activity in
    normal individuals not having or suspected of having Gaucher or any other disease.
             "Deficient GAA activity" refers to GAA activity in cells from a patient which
    is below the normal range as compared (using the same methods) to the activity in
    normal individuals not having or suspected of having Pompe or any other disease.
30           As used herein, the terms "enhance a-Gal A activity," "enhance Gba activity,"
    and "enhance GAA activity" or "increase a-Gal A activity," "increase Gba activity,"
    and "increase GAA activity" refer to increasing the amount of a-Gal A, Gba or GAA,
    respectively, that adopts a stable conformation in a cell contacted with a
                                                      19

    pharmacological chaperone specific for the a-Gal A, Gba or GAA, relative to the
    amount in a cell (preferably of the same cell-type or the same cell, e.g., at an earlier
    time) not contacted with the pharmacological chaperone specific for the a-Gal A, Gba
    or GAA. This term also refers to increasing the trafficking of a-Gal A, Gba or GAA
 5  to the lysosome in a cell contacted with a pharmacological chaperone specific for the
    a-Gal A, Gba or GAA, relative to the trafficking of a-Gal A, Gba or GAA not
    contacted with the pharmacological chaperone specific for the protein. These terms
    refer to both wild-type and mutant a-Gal A, Gba or GAA. In one embodiment, the
    increase in the amount of a-Gal A, Gba or GAA in the cell is measured by measuring
10  the hydrolysis of an artificial substrate in lysates from cells that have been treated
    with the SPC. An increase in hydrolysis is indicative of increased a-Gal A, Gba or
     GAA activity.
              The term "a-Gal A activity" refers to the normal physiological function of a
     wild-type a-Gal A in a cell. For example, a-Gal A activity includes hydrolysis of GL
15   3.
              The term "Gba activity" refers to the normal physiological function of a wild
     type aGba in a cell. For example, Gba activity includes metabolism of fatty
     glucocerebrosides.
              The term "GAA activity" refers to the normal physiological function of a
20   wild-type Gaa in a cell. For example, GAA activity includes lysosomal glycogen
     metabolism.
              A "responder" is an individual diagnosed with or suspected of having a
      lysosomal storage disorder, such, for example, but not limited to, Fabry disease,
     Pompe disease or Gaucher disease, whose cells exhibit sufficiently increased a-Gal A,
25    GAA or Gba activity, respectively, and/or amelioration of symptoms or improvement
      in surrogate markers, in response to contact with an SPC. Non-limiting examples of
      improvements in surrogate markers for Fabry and Pompe disease are disclosed in U.S.
      Serial Nos. 60/909,185 and 61/035,869, respectively.
              Non-limiting examples of improvements in surrogate markers for Fabry
 30   disease disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 60/909,185 include increases in a-Gal A levels or
      activity in cells (e.g., fibroblasts) and tissue; reductions in of GL-3 accumulation;
      decreased plasma concentrations of homocysteine and vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 (VCAM-1); decreased GL-3 accumulation within myocardial cells and
                                                        20

     valvular fibrocytes; reduction in cardiac hypertrophy (especially of the left ventricle),
     amelioration of valvular insufficiency, and arrhythmias; amelioration of proteinuria;
     decreased urinary concentrations of lipids such as CTH, lactosylceramide, ceramide,
     and increased urinary concentrations of glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin (Fuller
  5  et al., Clinical Chemistry. 2005; 51: 688-694); the absence of laminated inclusion
     bodies (Zebra bodies) in glomerular epithelial cells; improvements in renal function;
     mitigation of hypohidrosis; the absence of angiokeratomas; and improvements
     hearing abnormalities such as high frequency sensorineural hearing loss progressive
     hearing loss, sudden deafness, or tinnitus. Improvements in neurological symptoms
 10  include prevention of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke; and amelioration of
     neuropathic pain manifesting itself as acroparaesthesia (burning or tingling in
     extremities).
             The dose that achieves one or more of the aforementioned responses is a
     "therapeutically effective dose."
15           The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and
    compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce untoward
    reactions when administered to a human.            Preferably, as used herein, the term
    "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal
    or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally
20  recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The
    term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the
    compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such
    as water and oils. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose
    and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable
25  solutions.     Suitable pharmaceutical      carriers   are described   in "Remington's
    Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin, 18th Edition, or other editions.
             As used herein, the term "isolated" means that the referenced material is
    removed from the environment in which it is normally found.           Thus, an isolated
    biological material can be free of cellular components, i.e., components of the cells in
30  which the material is found or produced. In the case of nucleic acid molecules, an
    isolated nucleic acid includes a PCR product, an mRNA band on a gel, a cDNA, or a
    restriction fragment. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid is preferably
    excised from the chromosome in which it may be found, and more preferably is no
                                                      21

   longer joined to non-regulatory, non-coding regions, or to other genes, located
   upstream or downstream of the gene contained by the isolated nucleic acid molecule
   when found in the chromosome. In yet another embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid
   lacks one or more introns. Isolated nucleic acids include sequences inserted into
 5 plasmids, cosmids, artificial chromosomes, and the like. Thus, in a specific
   embodiment, a recombinant nucleic acid is an isolated nucleic acid. An isolated
   protein may be associated with other proteins or nucleic acids, or both, with which it
   associates in the cell, or with cellular membranes if it is a membrane-associated
   protein. An isolated organelle, cell, or tissue is removed from the anatomical site in
10 which it is found in an organism. An isolated material may be, but need not be,
    purified.
            The terms "about" and "approximately" shall generally mean an acceptable
    degree of error for the quantity measured given the nature or precision of the
    measurements. Typical, exemplary degrees of error are within 20 percent (%),
15  preferably within 10%, and more preferably within 5% of a given value or range of
    values. Alternatively, and particularly in biological systems, the terms "about" and
    "approximately" may mean values that are within an order of magnitude, preferably
    within 10- or 5-fold, and more preferably within 2-fold of a given value. Numerical
    quantities given herein are approximate unless stated otherwise, meaning that the term
20  "about" or "approximately" can be inferred when not expressly stated.
                         Method of Determining Treatment Options
            To easily determine whether SPC therapy will be a viable treatment for
    patients, for example, Fabry, Pompe or Gaucher patients, and including female
25  carriers of X-linked lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry disease, a simple, non
    invasive SPC rescue assay of protein activity in a cell line expressing a mutant form
    of the protein was developed.
                                            In vitro assay
30           In one embodiment, the diagnostic method of the present invention involves
    transforming a cell line with a nucleic acid vector which encodes a mutant lysosomal
     enzyme, for example, a-Gal A, GAA or Gba. The cell line is then treated with or
     without an SPC, e.g., DGJ, DNJ or IFG, for a sufficient time period to demonstrate
                                                     22

   enhancement (i.e., increase) of a-Gal A, GAA or Gba activity. The transformed cells
   are then lysed, and the lysate is used in an assay to determine enzyme activity. A
   sufficient increase in a-Gal A, GAA or Gba activity in the lysates from cells treated
   with the SPC over the activity in the lysates from untreated cells indicates that a
 5 patient who expresses a-Gal A, GAA or Gba with the same mutation as the cell line
   will likely respond to SPC therapy (i.e., the patient will be a "responder").
        Transient Transfection of a Cell Line and Expression of a Mutant Lysosmal
                                            Enzyme
10          In one embodiment, to identify SPC-responsive mutations, all known
   lysosomal enzyme (e.g., a-Gal A, GAA or Gba) mutations, for example, missense
   mutations and in-frame small deletions and insertions, can be generated according to
   techniques known in the art, for example, by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant
   enzyme constructs can then be transiently expressed in a cell line, for example,
15 mammalian COS-7, HEK-293 or GripTite 293 MSR (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA,
   U.S.A.) cells. Transformed cells can then be incubated with increasing concentrations
   of SPC and enzymatic activity can be measured in cell lysates.
            Mutagenesis: Nucleic acid vectors encoding a mutant protein (e.g. mutant a
20 Gal A, GAA or Gba) can be generated by conventional molecular biology,
   microbiology, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such
   techniques are explained fully in the literature. (See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch &
   Maniatis, 2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Third Edition, Cold
   Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; Glover, ed., 1985,
25 DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes I and II, Second Edition; Gait, M.J.,
   ed., 1984, Oligonucleotide Synthesis: A practical approach; Hames, B.D. & Higgins,
   S.J. eds., 1985, Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Hames, B.D. & Higgins, S.J., eds., 1984,

   Manual of Basic Technique; Woodward, J., 1986, Immobilized Cells And Enzymes:
30 A practical approach, IRL Press; Perbal, B.E., 1984, A Practical Guide To Molecular
   Cloning). For example, a single a-Gal A, GAA or Gba mutation can be introduced
   into a nucleic acid encoding a wild type a-Gal A, GAA or Gba gene through site
   directed mutagenesis of a nucleic acid encoding the wild type enzyme.
                                                     23

            Transient transfection and expression: The coding sequences of the gene to
   be delivered, for example, a mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba, are operably linked to
   expression control sequences, e.g., a promoter that directs expression of the gene. As
 5 used herein, the phrase "operatively linked" refers to the functional relationship of a
   polynucleotide/gene with regulatory and effector sequences of nucleotides, such as
   promoters, enhancers, transcriptional and translational stop sites, and other signal
   sequences. For example, operative linkage of a nucleic acid to a promoter refers to the
   physical and functional relationship between the polynucleotide and the promoter
10 such that transcription of DNA is initiated from the promoter by an RNA polymerase
   that specifically recognizes and binds to the promoter. The promoter directs the
   transcription of RNA from the polynucleotide. Expression of a mutant protein (e.g.
   mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba) may be controlled by any promoter/enhancer element
    known in the art, but these regulatory elements must be functional in the host selected
15  for expression.
             In one specific embodiment, a vector is used in which the coding sequences
    and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous
    recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for expression of the
    construct from a nucleic acid molecule that has integrated into the genome (See Koller
20  and Smithies, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:8932-8935; Zijlstra et al., 1989,
    Nature 342:435-438; U.S. Patent No. 6,244,113 to Zarling et al.; and U.S. Patent No.
    6,200,812 to Pati et al.).
             The term "host cell" means any cell of any organism that is selected, modified,
    transformed, grown, or used or manipulated in any way, for the production of a
25   substance by the cell, for example the expression by the cell of a gene, a DNA or
    RNA sequence, a protein or an enzyme. In one embodiment, a host cells that is
    transfected with a vector encoding a mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba can be used for
     screening a candidate SPC, for example, DGJ, DNJ or IFG, to determine if the
     candidate SPC is an effective compound for increasing the activity of the mutant a
30   Gal A, GAA or Gba expressed by the host cell.
              The term "expression system" means a host cell and compatible vector under
     suitable conditions, e.g., for the expression of a protein coded for by foreign DNA
     carried by the vector and introduced to the host cell. Expression systems include
                                                     24

   mammalian host cells and vectors. Suitable cells include PC12 cells, CHO cells, HeLa
   cells, GripTite 293 MSR cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.), HEK-293
   (also known as 293 cells) and 293T cells (derived from human embryonic kidney
   cells), COS cells (e.g. COS-7 cells), mouse primary myoblasts, NIH 3T3 cells.
 5          Suitable vectors include viruses, such as adenoviruses, adeno-associated virus
   (AAV), vaccinia, herpesviruses, baculoviruses and retroviruses, parvovirus, lentivirus,
   bacteriophages, cosmids, plasmids, fungal vectors, naked DNA, DNA lipid
   complexes, and other recombination vehicles typically used in the art which have
   been described for expression in a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts, and
10 may be used for gene therapy as well as for simple protein expression.
           In one non-limiting example, transient transfection can be carried out in
   GripTite 293 MSR cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) using the reagent
   Fugene HD (Roche). The cells can be seeded in a suitable assay container, such as a
   96-well plate (Costar) at a density of, for example, 7.5-10k cells/well, and incubated
15 under suitable conditions, such as, for example, 37*C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours before
   transfection. After transfection with expression constructs containing a specific a-Gal
   A mutant, cells can be incubated again in, for example, 37*C, 5% CO2 for one hour
   before adding DGJ at 50 nM to 1 mM. Cells can then be incubated for 4-5 days before
   lysis and assay.
20
           Enzyme Activity/Enhancement Assay:             Typically, following incubation
   with an SPC (e.g. DGJ, DNJ or IFG), host cells are lysed by the addition of lysis
   buffer (or deionized water) and physical disruption (pipetting, vortexing and/or
   agitation, and/or sonication) at room temperature or on ice, followed by pooling of the
25 lysates on ice, then splitting the pooled lysate into small aliquots and freezing.
           The lysates can be thawed immediately prior to the assay and should be
   suspended by use of a vortex mixer and sonicated prior to addition to appropriate
   wells e.g., in a microplate. In the context of Fabry disease, N-acetylgalactosamine
   (GalNAc) is then added to each well (to inhibit a-galactosidase B), followed by a
30 short incubation. 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-D-galactopyranoside (4-MU Gal), or other
   appropriate labeled DGJ substrate, is then added and the plate is gently mixed for a
   brief period of time, covered, and incubated at 37*C for a sufficient time for substrate
                                                      25

   hydrolysis, usually about 1 hour. To stop the reaction, NaOH-glycine buffer, pH 10.7,
   is added to each well and the plate is read on a fluorescent plate reader (e.g. Wallac
   1420 Victor3 TM or similar instrument). Excitation and emission wavelengths were
   customarily set at 355 nm and 460 nm, respectively. One unit of enzyme activity is
 5 defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 nmole of 4
   methylumbelliferone per hour. For each patient sample at least three normal samples
   may be tested concurrently.
            Various modifications of this assay will be readily ascertainable to one of
   ordinary skill in the art. Examples of artificial substrates that can be used to detect CL
10 Gal A activity include but are not limited to p-nitrophenyl-a-D-galactopyranoside and
   4-MU GAL. Obviously, only substrates that can be cleaved by human a-Gal A are
   suitable for use. It is noted that while use of a fluorogenic substrate is preferred, other
   methods of determining enzymatic activity are contemplated for use in the method,
    including using chromogenic substrates or immunoquantification techniques.
15          In one specific example, following incubation with an SPC, for example, DGJ,
    the host cells can be washed two times with PBS then incubated in 200d fresh media
    at 37*C, 5% CO2 for two hours followed by 2 additional PBS washes. After, cells can
    be lysed in 60 pL Lysis Buffer (27 mM sodium citrate / 46 mM sodium phosphate
    dibasic, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 4.6). Ten pL lysate can then be added to 50 pL assay
20  buffer (Lysis Buffer without Triton X-100, but containing 6 mM 4-MU-oC-D
    galactopyranoside (4-MUG) and 117 mM N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNac)), and
    incubated at 37*C for 1 hr. Seventy tL Stop Solution (0.4 M glycine, pH 10.8) can
    then be added and fluorescence read on a Victor plate reader (Perkin Elmer) at 355
    nim excitation and 460 nm emission. Raw fluorescence counts can be background
25   subtracted as defined by counts from substrate solution only. A MicroBCA Protein
    Assay Kit (Pierce) was used according to manufacturer's instructions to determine
     protein concentration from 40 L of cell lysate. A 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU)
     standard curve ranging from 30 IM to 1.3 nM was run in parallel for calculation of
     absolute a-Gal A activity expressed as nmoles / mg protein / hr or further normalized
30   to %of untreated wild type enzyme activity.
                                                       26

                                  Treatment Reference Table
             In another embodiment, the methods described supra can be used to generate a
     "treatment reference table" or "treatment therapy table," wherein the treatment
     reference table comprises a list of protein mutations, and further wherein the table
  5  indicates the responsiveness of each mutation to an SPC, such as DGJ, DNJ or IFG.
    The treatment reference table can then be used to determine if a particular SPC, for
    example, DGJ, DNJ or IFG, would be an effective SPC for treating a patient with a
    particular a-Gal A, GAA or Gba mutation, respectively.
             As used herein "treatment therapy table" or "treatment reference table" refers
10  to any written record that conveys whether a particular mutation is responsive to SPC
    therapy, and is not necessarily limited to written records presented in tabular form.
             In one embodiment, the treatment reference table can be used by a treating
    physician or clinical professional to select an SPC for treating a patient, for example,
    a Fabry, Pompe or Gaucher patient who expresses a specific mutant a-Gal A, GAA or
15  Gba, respectively, wherein the SPC is selected because the treatment reference table
    identifies the SPC as a compound that can increase the activity of the patient's mutant
    a-Gal A, GAA or Gba when the mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba is expressed in a host
    cell.
20                                    Treatable Disorders
             While the present application has been discussed largely in the context of
    Fabry, Pompe and Gaucher diseases, and the SPCs DGJ, DNJ and IFG, respectively,
    it should be understood that it is applicable to any SPC and disease.         In one non
    limiting embodiment, a treatment reference table can be generated for any candidate
25  SPC and any lysosomal storage disorder, or any disorder involving protein
    misfolding.   These diseases include other lysosomal storage disorders, for example,
    Cystic Fibrosis (CFTR) (respiratory or sweat gland epithelial cells), familial
    hypercholesterolemia (LDL receptor; LPL-adipocytes or vascular endothelial cells),
    cancer (p53; PTEN-tumor cells), Alzheimer's disease (a-secretase), Parkinson's
30  disease (glucocerebrosidase),     obesity (MC4R), and amyloidoses          (transthyretin)
    among others.
                                                     27

                                Eligibility Determination Criteria
             The criteria for determining eligibility for SPC therapy depends on the type of
    mutant GLA, GAA or Gba a patient expresses. In one embodiment, patients with
    Fabry, Pompe, or Gaucher disease could be categorized as eligible for SPC therapy if
 5  a-Gal A, GAA or Gba activity, respectively, in a host cell expressing the same
    mutation as the patient, in the presence of an SPC such as DGJ, DNJ or IFG, is at
    least about 1.5- to 20-fold (2% to 100%) activity of a host cell expressing a wild type
    a-Gal A, GAA or Gba.
             This discovery provides a method for improving the diagnosis of and
10  facilitating clinical treatment decisions for Fabry, Pompe and Gaucher diseases in
    particular, and lysosomal storage disease in general. Moreover, this method can be
     extended to a wide range of genetically defined diseases in appropriate cell types.
     This class of disease includes the other lysosomal storage disorders, Cystic Fibrosis
     (CFTR) (respiratory or sweat gland epithelial cells), familial hypercholesterolemia
15   (LDL receptor; LPL-adipocytes or vascular endothelial cells), cancer (p53; PTEN
     tumor cells),         Alzheimer's      disease (a-secretase),      Parkinson's disease
     (glucocerebrosidase), obesity (MC4R), and amyloidoses (transthyretin) among others.
                                                   Kits
20            The present invention also provides for a commercial diagnostic test kit in
     order to make therapeutic treatment decisions. The kit provides all materials
      discussed above and more particularly in the Examples below, for preparing and
     running each assay in one convenient package, optionally including instructions and
      an analytic guide.
25            As one non-limiting example, a kit for evaluating a-Gal A activity may
      contain, at a minimum:
                  a. a panel of host cells, each expressign a mutant a-Gal A, or
                      alternatively, a host cell, a vector encoding a mutant a-Gal A, and a
                      means of transfecting the host cell such that the host cell expresses the
 30                   mutant a-Gal A;
                  b. a specific phannacological chaperone;
                  c. a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate for the enzyme assay
                      (including an appropriate standard); and
                                                          28

               d. GalNAc.
   The kit may also contain instructions for optimally performing the protein
   enhancement assay. In another embodiment, the kit will contain the appropriate
   tubes, buffers (e.g., lysis buffer), and microplates.
 5         In one embodiment, the SPC is supplied in dry form, and will be re-constituted
   prior to addition.
           Patients who express a mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba that previously tested
   positive for enzyme enhancement with a candidate SPC in assays of the present
   inention can then be treated with that candidate SPC agent, whereas patients who
10 express a mutant a-Gal A, GAA or Gba that does not display enzyme enhancement
   with a candidate SPC can avoid treatment which will save money and prevent the
   emotional toll of not responding to a treatment modality.

   Introduction
            Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene
   that encodes a-galactosidase A (a-GAL A). Over 600 Fabry mutations have been
 5 reported, and about 60% are missense. The iminosugar DGJ is currently being studied
   in Phase 2 clinical trials as a pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of Fabry
   disease. Previously, it has been shown that DGJ mediates selective and dose
   dependent increases in a-Gal A levels in many Fabry patient-derived lymphoid cell
   lines. To identify additional DGJ-responsive mutations, GripTite 293 MSR,
10 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) cells were transiently transfected with
   expression vectors containing all known a-Gal A missense mutations and several in
   fram small deletions and insertions generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant a
    Gal A constructs were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cells were incubated
   with increasing concentrations of DGJ and a-Gal A activity was measured in cell
15  lysates. Assay validation has been carried out on more than 35 missense mutations
    and the results obtained in HEK-293 cells were similar to those obtained from both
    Fabry patient-derived lymphoid cells and primary T-cell cultures (see U.S. Serial No.:
    11/749,512), as well as to the x-Gal A enzyme responses observed in the white blood
    cells of Fabry patients after oral administration of DGJ in Phase 2 clinical trials.
20
    Methods and Materials
    Mutagenesis: All mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis following
    standard molecular biology protocols. To generate point mutations, site-directed
25  mutagenesis was used on the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing
    human a-GAL A cDNA in-frame. Specific primer pairs were designed containing the
     desired mutation (Figure 6). The mutagenesis was performed through the polymerase
     chain reaction using PfuUltra high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a
     thermocycler.   Each reaction mixture contained a total volume of 50ul with the
30   following: 41.6 ul dH20, 5.0 ul 1OX PfuUltra HF reaction buffer, 0.5 uL Forward-5'
     primer (50uM), 0.5 ul Reverse-3'-primer, 1.0 ul dNTP mix (containing 25mM each
     dA, dT, dC, dG), 0.9 ul human GLA in pcDNA3 (2ng/ul DNA), 0.5ul PfuUltra HD
     DNA polymerase. Thermocycler parameter used was the following: i) 94*C for 30
                                                      30

    seconds, ii) 94*C for 30 seconds, 55-60*C for 30 seconds, 68*C for 6 minutes, iii)
   Repeat (ii) 16 times. Afterwards, 0.5 ul Dpn I (New England Biolabs) was added to
   each reaction and incubated at 37*C for 2 hours. A volume of 7.5ul for each
   mutagenesis reaction was used to transform D115a( cells (New England Biolabs). Cells
 5 were then plated on LB-agar plates with 75ug/ml ampicillin, and incubated at 37"C
   overnight.    Bacterial colonies were picked, grown in liquid LB with ampicillin
   overnight, shaking, at 37*C, and plasmid DNA extracted using QuickLyse Miniprep
   Kit (Qiagen). Mutants were confirmed by sequencing the full-length human GLA
   gene.    For some of the mutants, human GLA cDNA was contained in the vector
10 plasmid pCXN. Mutagenesis was performed in this vector with the NEB Fusion
   DNA polymerase. After confirming the mutation through sequencing, the plasmid
   was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1. Correct
   orientation was confirmed by digestion with Xho I.
15 Transient transfection and expression: Transient transfection was carried out in
   GripTite 293 MSR cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) using the reagent
   Fugene HD (Roche). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Costar) at a density
   of 7.5-10k cells/well and incubated at 37*C, 5% CO 2 for 24 hours before transfection.
   Cells were transfected with 0.1 ptg DNA and 0.35 piL of Fugene HD reagent per well
20 (DNA: Reagent ratio of 2:7). After transfection with expression constructs containing
   the specific oa-Gal A mutants, cells were incubated again in 374C, 5% CO2 for one
   hour before adding DGJ at 20 nM to 1 mM. Cells were then incubated for 4-5 days
   before lysis and assay.
25 a-GAL A activity measurement: Cells were washed two times with PBS then
   incubated in 200p1 fresh media at 37*C, 5% CO2 for two hours followed by 2
   additional PBS washes. After, cells were lysed in 60 piL Lysis Buffer (27 mM sodium
   citrate / 46 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 4.6). Ten pL
   lysate were added to 50 p.L assay buffer (Lysis Buffer without Triton X-100, but
30 containing 6 mM 4-MU-ax-D-galactopyranoside (4-MUG) and 117 mM N-acetyl-D
   galactosamine (GalNac)), and incubated at 37*C for 1 hr. Seventy tL Stop Solution
   (0.4 M glycine, pH 10.8) were then added and fluorescence read on a Victor plate
                                                  31

    reader (Perkin Elmer) at 355 nm excitation and 460 rn emission. Raw fluorescence
    counts were background subtracted as defined by counts from substrate solution only.
    A MicroBCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) was used according to manufacturer's
    instructions to determine protein concentration from 40 ptL of cell lysate. A 4
 5  methylumbelliferone (4-MU) standard curve ranging from 30 ptM to 1.3 nM was run
    in parallel for calculation of absolute a-Gal A activity expressed as nmoles / mg
    protein / hr or further normalized to %of untreated wild type enzyme activity.
             Transient tansfection and a-Gal A activity measurements were performed in
     quadruplicates and repeated at least 3 times for each mutation to calculate the average
10   a-Gal A activity at each DGJ concentration. Significant response to DGJ was
     determined by a two-tailed, paired Student's T-test (p<0.05).
     Results
15           All listed Fabry mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis
     (Figure 1). Mutations identified in italicized text were not tested, while those
     identified in plain text were a-Gal A mutants that were responsive to DGJ treatment
     in the transient transfection assay, and those identified in bold and underscored text
     were not responsive to DGJ treatment in the transient transfection assay. The
20   magnitude of increase in a-Gal A levels after DGJ treatment and EC50 values are
     listed for every tested mutation that responded to DGJ treatment (Figure 2).
              a-Gal A activity (expressed as nmol/mg protein/hr of 4-MU released) was
      measured in lysates prepared from transfected GripTite 293 cells incubated with
      increasing concentrations of DGJ. A typical concentration-dependent response is
25    shown for L300P and a typical negative response to DGJ is shown for R227Q. Wild
      type exhibits high baseline activity and does not respond to DGJ in this assay (Figure
      3).
              a-Gal A levels were measured in three different assays, reported as percentage
      of wild type, are compared for each mutation by plotting side by side. The three
 30   different assays examined a-Gal A levels in T-cells and lymphoblasts isolated from
       Fabry patients (for example, see U.S. Serial No. 11/749,512), as well as in white
      blood cell (WBC) from DGJ Phase 2 studies
                                                       32

            Blank bars indicate basal level (without DGJ treatment) and filled bars
   indicate the elevated level after DGJ treatment (Figure 4).
            Tested Fabry mutations were illustrated on the a-Gal A secondary structure
   (Figure 5). No significant correlation between response and location on the protein
 5 sequence of a mutation was observed, suggesting that responsive as well as non
   responsive mutations are distributed widely across the entire protein. Text color
   indicates DGJ response: green=response; red=no response; brown indicates that of the
   multiple mutations on that same site some responded to DGJ treatment, while others
   did not.
10
   Conclusion
            These described results are comparable to those obtained from Fabry patient
   derived lymphoid or T cells, as well as to the ot-Gal A enzyme responses observed in
   the white blood cells of Fabry patients after oral administration of DGJ in Phase 2
15 clinical trials.
            Thus, the GripTite 293 MSR transient transfection assay is a reliable method
   for identifying DGJ-responsive mutations and characterizing the magnitude and
   potency of this response.
            Among the responsive mutations identified, the increases in a-Gal A levels by
20 DGJ treatment ranged from 1.3- to 40-fold (2% to 100% wild type), with EC50 values
   between 200 nM and >100 mM.
            DGJ-responsive and non-responsive mutant forms did not appear to be located
   to particular regions or domains on the a-Gal A protein structure.
25 EXAMPLE 2:              Ex vivo Method for Evaluating Effects of an SPC on
                           Glucocerebrosidase Activity -- Prophetic Example
            Gaucher    disease   (GD)   is   caused   by   a   deficiency  of lysosomal
   glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Deficient GCase activity leads to an accumulation of
30 glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and the development of symptoms such as anemia,
   thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone necrosis, infarcts and osteoporosis, and
   in some cases, neuropathic disease. The specific pharmacological chaperone
                                                    33

    isofagomine tartrate (IFG) selectively binds and stabilizes mutant (N370S/N370S)
    GCase in the ER and increases its trafficking to the lysosome.
             To evaluate the effects of IFG on different GCase variants, an ex vivo
    diagnostic assay will be prepared using Cos7 cells in order to ascertain IFG
 5  responsive mutations.
              Using the techniques described in Examples 1 and 4, COS-7 cell lines will be
    prepared that express missense mutations and several in-frame small deletions and
     insertions by site-directed mutagenesis. Assays will be prepared for all of the
     mutations listed in the x-axis of Figure 8. IFG-activity response will be ascertained
10   for each assay according to methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
     6,916,829, which is hereby incorporated by reference).
              To determine the correlation of the IFG-response measured in the COS-7 cells
     to patient-derived cells, IFG-activity response was also measured in Patient-Derived
     Macrophages and Lymphoblasts. Macrophages were successfully derived from 46 of
15   63 patients and incubation with IFG (3, 10, 30 or 100 pM) for 5 days increased GCase
     levels in macrophages from 42 of 46 patients (mean = 2.3-fold; range: 1.1- to 6.5
     fold). Residual activity levels and response to IFG was more consistent for the same
      genotypes when measured in lymphoblasts compared to macrophages, potentially due
     to the variability in macrophage viability between different patients. The results are
20    shown in Figure. 8.
              The response to IFG for the patient-derived cells will be compared to the
      results obtained in the Cos7 cell line.
      EXAMPLE 3:              In vivo Effect of an SPC on a-GAL A Activity in Skin,
25                            Heart, Kidney and Plasma
              To determine if increased mutant a-Gal A levels translate to increased a-Gal
      A activity in situ, the effect of DGJ administration on tissue GL-3 levels was
      investigated in vivo in hR301Q a-Gal A Tg/KO mice.
 30            Eight-week old male hR301Q a-Gal A Tg/KO mice were treated for 4 weeks
       with 300 mg/kg DGJ in drinking water either daily or less frequently (4 days ON/3
       days OFF). After dosing, lysates were prepared from skin, heart, kidney, and plasma
                                                       34

    by homogenizing -50 mg tissue in Lysis Buffer (see above). 20 pL lysate were
    mixed with 50 [L of substrate (as detailed above). Reaction mixtures were incubated
    at 37*C for 1 hr. After, 70 pL Stop Solution were added and fluorescence was read on
    a Victor plate reader as described above. Enzyme activity in the lysates was
 5 background subtracted, and normalized for protein concentration. A 4-MU standard
   curve was run for conversion of fluorescence data to absolute a-Gal A activity
   expressed as nmol / mg protein / hr.
            Tissue samples were washed free of blood, weighed and homogenized with a
   solvent system in a FastPrep@ system. Homogenate was then extracted using Solid
10 Phase Extraction on a C18 cartridge. The eluent was evaporated and reconstituted
   prior to injection onto a LC-MS/MS system. Twelve GL-3 isoforms were measured
   using positive ESI-MS/MS. LC separation was achieved on 00839a Zorbax C18
   column.
            Significant decreases in GL-3 levels were seen with daily and less frequent
15 DGJ dosing in skin, heart, kidney, and plasma (Figure 9).          A trend of greater
   reduction in GL-3 levels was seen in multiple tissues and plasma with less frequent
   DGJ dosing. Collectively, these results indicate that DGJ merits further evaluation for
   the treatment of patients with Fabry disease.
20 EXAMPLE 4:              Identification of Pompe Disease-Causing Mutations That
                           Are Responsive to the Pharmacological Chaperone DNJ
           Pompe disease is caused by deficient acid alpha glucosidase (GAA) activity
   which impairs lysosomal glycogen metabolism. The enzyme deficiency leads to
25 lysosomal glycogen accumulation and results in progressive skeletal muscle
   weakness, reduced cardiac function, respiratory insufficiency, and CNS impairment at
   late stages of disease. Genetic mutations in the GAA gene result in either lower
   expression or produce mutant forms of the enzyme with altered stability, and/or
   biological activity ultimately leading to disease. Pharmacological chaperones
30 represent a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of genetic diseases.
                                                   35

             To evaluate the effects of DNJ on different GAA variants, an in vitro
                                                                                    ascertain
    diagnostic assay was prepared using COS-7 and HEK-293 cells in order to
    DNJ-responsive mutations (Figures 10, 12 and 14)
             A site-directed mutagenesis approach was employed to introduce specific
 5  mutations into the complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding wild-type human acid U.
    glucosidase (GAA). The initial wild-type GAA DNA construct was generated by
    subcloning the GAA coding region from cDNA clone 5739991 (Invitrogen) into the
                                                                                        DNA
    pcDNA6/V5-HisA mammalian expression vector (Initrogen). The resultant
    construct (designated as wild-type GAA cDNA) was used as the DNA template for
10   subsequent mutagenesis. These missense, small insertion or deletion mutations are
     cited in the Erasmus database and known to be associated with type 2 glycogen
     storage disorder (GSD 1I), also known as Pompe disease. Briefly, wild-type GAA
     cDNA was PCR-amplified using mutagenic primers to obtain plasmid DNA with the
     desired mutation     These mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to
15   protein expression in cells.
              COS-7 cells (derived from green monkey embryonic kidney cells) were
                                                                                   X 105 cells
     aseptically seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates at a cell density of -1.4
     per well in 3 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) containing 10%
     (v/v) fetal bovine serum and grown overnight at 37*C in a humidified 5% CO2
20    atmosphere. On the following day, the cells (typically 60-80% confluent) were
     transfected with 0.75 pg of the individual DNA construct via a lipid transfection
      reagent such as FUGENE HD (Roche) according the manufacturer's instructions.
      Two wells were transfected with each DNA construct such that one well was
      incubated with DNJ (typically 0 pM, 20 pM, 50 p.M or 100 p.M) while an equivalent
 25   volume of PBS was added to the other well. Two additional wells were transfected
      with the empty vector (no GAA cDNA) and incubated with or without DNJ to serve
      as the background control for endogenous monkey GAA expression. Similarly, 2
       additional wells were transfected with the wild-type human GAA cDNA and
       incubated with or without DNJ to serve as the positive control. All samples were
 30    incubated for -48 hrs at 37*C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
               After the 48-hour incubation period, the spent media was removed and the
       cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with fresh 1-2 ml DMEM medium for
                                                       36

     3 hours at 37*C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was subsequently
     removed and cells were immediately washed with PBS and lysed with 200 RI of Lysis
     Buffer (25 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100) containing
     a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The cell culture plate were then gently swirled on a
  5  rotating orbital shaker apparatus for 10 min at room temperature for complete cell
     lysis. The resultant cell lysates were transferred to clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes
     and spun at 20,000 x g for 10 min to pellet cellular debris. Approximately 175 p1 of
     each supernatant sample was then transferred to a 1.5 ml fresh microcentrifuge tube.
     This cell lysate was used for all subsequent assays including GAA enzyme activity,
 10  total protein concentration determination, and Western blotting.
              Residual GAA enzyme activity was determined for each transiently-expressed
     GAA using a fluorogenic 4-methylumbeliferyl-a-glucopyranoside (4-MU-a-glucose)
    substrate (Sigma). Briefly, 10 d of each cell lysate was assayed (in triplicate) in a
     100 ptl reaction in 96-well clear bottom black plates using 3 mM 4-MU-a-glucose and
 15 50 mM KOAc (pH 4.0). The transiently-expressed wild-type GAA sample was
    diluted 20-fold with Lysis Buffer to ensure that the enzymatic reaction is maintained
    within the linear range of the instrument. The enzyme reactions were performed at
    37*C for 1 hour and terminated by the addition of 50 p of 500 mM Na2 CO3 (pH
    10.5). The assay was then read in a fluorescence plate reader (using 355 nm
20  excitation/460 nm emission) to quantitate the amount of GAA-dependent 4-MU
    fluorescence liberated. The GAA enzyme activity was then extrapolated from a free
    4-MU standard curve after subtracting the background fluorescence (i.e., empty
    vector control).
             Twenty five microliters of each cell lysate was used in a parallel assay to
25  determine the total cellular protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
    protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total cellular
    protein concentration was extrapolated from a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard
    curve.
             The GAA enzyme activity for each sample was normalized to the total cellular
30  protein concentration and expressed as the nmoles of 4-MU released/mg total
    protein/hr to define the GAA specific activity. The resultant GAA specific activity
                                                      37

    after DNJ treatment was compared to GAA enzyme activity of the corresponding
    untreated sample to determine whether a specific GAA mutant responds to DNJ.
             For a single HEK-293 cell line transfected with the GAA mutation, P545L, the
    DNJ EC50 was also determined (Figure 14).
 5           To determine the correlation of the DNJ-response measured in the COS-7 cells
                                                                                   in Patient
    to patient-derived cells, DNJ-activity response was also measured ex vivo
    Derived Macrophages and Lymphoblasts.
             Fibroblast and lymphocyte cell lines derived from Pompe patients were also
                                                                                           cell
    generated as previously described (see U.S. Serial No.: 11/749,512). Fibroblast
10  lines were derived from patients homozygous for the P545L or R854X GAA
    mutations (Figure 13).          Lymphocyte cell lines were derived from patients
     heterozygous for the (IVS1AS, T>G, -13) GAA splicing defect and GAA frameshift
     mutation (Figure 15).
              GAA activity was measured in the lymphocyte cell lines following incubation
15   in 0 pM, 30pM, 100 ptM, or 300 pM DNJ (Figure 15). GAA activity was also
     measured in the fibroblast cell lines following DNJ incubation (Figure 13).
              In this study, the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxynojirimycin-HCl (DNJ)
     is shown to bind mutant GAA and increase its activity. In Pompe patient-derived
     fibroblasts (Figure 13) and lymphocytes (Figure 15), as well as in transiently
20   transfected COS-7 (Figures 10 and 12) or HEK-293 (Figure 14) cells expressing
     certain GAA missense mutations, DNJ significantly increases GAA levels.
              DNJ increased GAA activity for 26 mutations (Figure 10) out of 131 mutants
      tested (data not shown). In addition to increasing the activity of these mutant GAA's,
      DNJ also promoted processing of GAA to the 95 / 76 / 70 kDa forms.
 25            Furthermore, dose-dependent increases in GAA activity was observed in
      patient-derived lymphocytes containing the common IVS1AS, T>G, -13 splicing
      defect in one allele and a frameshift mutation in the second allele (Figure 15).
