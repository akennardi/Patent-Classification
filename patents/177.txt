FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to a drawer, in particular, that is provided
as a flat pack furniture item.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Assembly flat pack furniture can be difficult and require a significant
physical effort for some customers and time-consuming. Sometimes assembly
requires the use of tools such as an Allen key or Phillips head screwdriver. For
complex furniture items, at least two people may be required to perform assembly
of such furniture items.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      The inventive concept arises from a recognition that reducing the time
to assemble flat pack furniture items, for example, a drawer, is beneficial for
users. The packaging of flat pack furniture items should remain as compact as
possible to facilitate easy and convenient transport of items from a retail store to
the user's premises. Avoiding the use of tools for fastening fasteners to connect
components of the furniture item together also saves time and prevents
frustration if users do not possess such tools or when such tools are not provided
with the packaging of the flat pack furniture item.
[0004]      The present invention, in one aspect, comprises a drawer comprising a
rear panel having a longitudinal groove extending along an inner surface. The
rear panel has a series of first engagement members at opposite, lateral ends of
the rear panel. The drawer also comprises a front panel having a longitudinal
groove extending along an inner surface. The drawer also comprises a pair of
side panels. Each side panel has a longitudinal groove extending along an inner

                                          2
surface. A front end of the side panel is hinged to the front panel and a rear end
has a series of second engagement members at opposite, lateral ends of the side
panel configured to engage with the first engagement members to form-lock the
rear panel with the side panels. The drawer also comprises base board having
lateral edges dimensioned for slidable reception within the longitudinal grooves of
the side panels. The base board also has a leading edge engageable within the
longitudinal groove of the front panel. The base board also has a trailing edge
engageable within the longitudinal groove of the rear panel. The hinged
connection of the side panels to the front panel is on enabling the side panels to
assume a folded position parallel with the front panel and pivoting of the side
panels into upright deployed position substantially perpendicular to the front
panel.
[0005]     The hinged connection between each said side panel and the front
panel may comprise two spaced apart mechanical hinge mechanisms.
[0006]     Each mechanical hinge mechanism may be a hinged angle clip
comprising a pair of pivotably connected wing portions. Each wing portion has a
pair of mounting pins received in corresponding mounting holes at the front and
side panels in a transition or press fit.
[0007]     The first and second engagement members may be comprised of a
tongue and groove arrangement, in particular, spaced apart semi-cylindrical
protrusions and correspondingly spaced part semi-cylindrical recesses.
[0008]     A length of the side panels may be less than half a length of the front
panel such that the side panels can rest flat against the inner surface of the front
panel in the folded position.
[0009]     The drawer may further comprise a drawer slide mounted to the outer
surface of each of the side panels.

                                            3
[0010]      Each hinged angle clip may be additionally secured to the side and
front panels by way of at least one fastening screw and the drawer in pre
assembled form may comprise the side panels connected to the front panel by
the hinged angle clips.
[0011]      The drawer may further comprise a plurality of removable transition fit
dowels securing the side panels to the rear panel.
[0012]      Other advantages and features according to the invention will be
apparent to those of ordinary skill upon reading this application.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0025]      A preferred drawer according to the present invention is illustrated in
Fig. 11 and shown generally at reference numeral 10.
[0026]      Referring to Figs. 1 and 3, the drawer 10 comprises a front panel 30
having a longitudinal groove 32 extending along an inner surface. The drawer 10
also comprises a pair of side panels 20. Each side 20 panel has a longitudinal
groove 22 extending along an inner surface. One end of the side panel 20 is
pivotally connected to the front panel 30. At an opposite end of the side panel 20,
there is a series of second engagement members 21 configured to engage with
the first engagement members 71 of a rear panel 70 to resist relative lateral
movement between the rear panel 70 and side panels 20. The first engagement

                                             5
members 71 are spaced apart semi-cylindrical protrusions. The second
engagement members 21 are corresponding spaced part semi-cylindrical
recesses. Other tongue and groove type or mechanical interlock joining is
envisaged.
[0027]       The side panels 20 are pivotally movable relative to the front panel 30
from a folded position to an upright position substantially perpendicular to the
front panel 30.
[0028]       Referring to Figs. 1, 3 and 4, each side panel 20 is pivotally connected
to the front panel 30 by two spaced apart mechanical hinge mechanisms 40.
Each mechanical hinge mechanism 40 comprises a pair of pivotably connected
wing portions. Each wing portion has a pair of pins that are insertable into pre
drilled holes 22, 31 in the side panel 20 and front panel 30, respectively.
[0029]       In a preferred embodiment, the length of side panels 20 is less than
half the length of the front panel 30 such that the side panels 20 rest flat against
the front panel 30 in the folded position. Therefore when the side panels are in
the rested position, they do not overlap each other.
[0030]       In a preferred embodiment, the position of the hinges 40 are not
directly at the lateral edges of the front panel 30 but approximately at distance
equal to the thickness of the side panel 20. When the side panels 20 are raised to
their upright position, there is clean right angle formed by the side panel 20 and
the front panel 30.
[0031]       Referring to Fig. 5, a base board 60 slides into the grooves 22 of the
side panel 20. The base board 60 has lateral edges which slide within the
longitudinal grooves 22 of the side panels 20. A leading edge of the base board
60 engages within the longitudinal groove 32 of the front panel 30. A trailing edge
of the base board 60 engages within the longitudinal groove of the rear panel 70.
The engagement of all edges of the base board 60 prevents movement of the

                                            6
base board 60 relative to the side panels 20, front panel 30 and rear panel 70. It
also enables the drawer 10 to hold items of a predetermined weight without the
base board 60 falling out from below.
[0032]      Referring to Figs. 6 and 7, the drawer 10 comprises a rear panel 70
having a longitudinal groove extending along an inner surface. The rear panel 70
has a series of first engagement members 71 at opposite ends of the rear panel
70. The first engagement members 71 of the rear panel 70 form-lock with the
second engagement members 21 of the side panels 20. The engagement
members 21, 71 align and orient the rear panel 70 into a correct position with the
side panels 20 and avoids misalignment prior to permanently securing the rear
panel 70 and side panels 20 together.
[0033]      The drawer 10 further comprises a plurality of removable transition fit
dowels 60 securing the side panels 20 to the rear panel 70. In a preferred
embodiment, to secure the rear panel 70 to the side panels 20, a pair of push pin
fasteners 60 are pushed in by the user through pre-drilled holes 22 from the outer
surface of each side panel 20 and partially into the rear panel 70.
[0034]      Referring to Figs. 8 to 10, the drawer 10 also comprises at least one
handle 80 mounted to the outer surface of the front panel 30. The handle 80 has
an integral fastening mechanism comprising three pins. A central pin 82 is longer
than the two adjacent pins 81 of equal length. The two adjacent pins 81 are
mounting pins to be received in pre-drilled holes 31 to assist with alignment and
orientation. The central pin 82 passes through the front panel 30 and a portion of
it is exposed on the inner surface of the front panel 30. A locking piece 91 with a
centrally located slot 91 extending to the centre of the locking piece 91 is slid over
the exposed portion of the central pin 82. The locking piece is a type of collar.
The locking piece 91 prevents detachment caused by pulling the handle 80 away
from the front panel 30.

                                           7
[0035]      The drawer 10 further comprises a drawer slide 50 mounted to the
outer surface of each side panel 20. This allows a sliding movement between the
drawer 10 and a drawer chest it is placed in.
[0036]      In a preferred embodiment, the drawer 10 is packaged and provided to
a user in a pre-assembled form as depicted in Fig. 2. The side panels 20 have the
drawer slides 50 mounted and the side panels 20 are pivotally connected to the
front panel 30 using the hinged angle clips 40. The user performs the subsequent
assembly steps generally depicted in Figs. 3 to 9. These steps include unfolding
the side panels 20 to their upright deployed position (Figs. 3 and 4). Sliding the
base board 60 between the side panels 20 via the grooves 22 (Fig 5). Aligning
and attaching the rear panel 70 with respect to the side panels 20 and trailing
edge of the base board 60 (Fig. 6). Securing the attached rear panel 70 to the
side panels 20 using removable transition fit dowels 60 that can be pressed in by
hand by the user (Fig. 7). Aligning and attaching the handles 80 to the front panel
30 (Fig. 8). Securing the handles 80 to the front panel 30 using locking pieces 90
(Fig. 9).
[0037]      The assembly of the drawer 10 by a single person is expected to take
significantly less time compared to a traditional flat pack drawer. Also, the drawer
 10 does not require the use of tools and therefore requires less physical effort
compared to assembly of a traditional flat pack drawer.
