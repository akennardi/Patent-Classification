                    COMPOUNDS THAT ACTIVATE AUTOPHAGY
                             FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5 The present invention relates to compounds that activate autophagy. In
   particular, the invention relates to autophagy of cancer cells induced by the
   compounds.
                                    BACKGROUND
10
   Autophagy is a unique recycling mechanism characterized by the formation of
   double membrane vesicles, which engulf and degrade cytoplasmic materials
   or damaged organelles via lysosome degradation and thereby maintain
   normal homeostasis of cells. Owing to the crucial role of autophagy in cellular
15 differentiation, development, homeostasis, starvation, and stressful conditions,
   defect in autophagy induction would contribute to the various diseases
   including     neurodegenerative   diseases,   infectious  diseases,   metabolic
   diseases, and cancers. For cancers therapies, autophagy can act as a tumor
   suppressor by the removal of unfolded proteins and damaged organelles.
20 Emerging evidence have demonstrated that polyphenolic natural compounds
   quercetin, genistein, rottlerin, resveratrol and guttiferone K are capable of
   treating cancers via the autophagic cell death mechanism.
   In view of the demand          for treating cancers,    more compounds and
25 compositions that can effectively treat cancers are desired.

                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Example embodiments relate to a compound of Formula I, a pharmaceutical
   composition that includes the compound of Formula I, and a method of
 5 treating cancer by administering the compound of Formula I to a patient.
   Dauricine is a bioactive bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the root of
   Menispermum dauricum D.C. ("Bei-Dou-Gen" in Chinese) commonly used for
   the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and inflammatory diseases in clinic.
10 Diverse pharmacological activities of dauricine also include protection of
   cerebral injury, induction of cell apoptosis, suppression of cancer cell growth
   and    angiogenesis.   Previous findings have      identified dauricine as an
   autophagy activator which stimulates autophagic cell death in a panel of
   apoptosis-resistant cells via AMPK (adenosine monophosphate               kinase)
15 activation. N-desmethyldauricine as a derivative of dauricine can activate
   autophagic cell death in Bax-Bak deficient apoptosis-defective colon cancer
   cells via Ca2 mobilization.
   Conventional methods are to use dauricine and N-desmethyldauricine as
20 autophagy activators. Example embodiments solve technical problems by
   providing more compounds that act as autophagy activators. Example
   embodiments also solve technical problems by providing compounds that are
   more effective than dauricine and N-desmethyldauricine in terms of activating
   autophagic cell death.

   An example embodiment provides a method of treating cancer, and the
   method includes administering the compound of Formula I to a patient.
   In an example embodiment, compounds of Formula I can act as autophagy
10 activators.   Compounds       of  Formula     I activate autophagy and     induce
   autophagic cell death. Autophagy induction contributes to autophagic cell
   death in cancers including apoptosis-resistant cancers through the inhibition
   of anti-autophagic proteins. Compounds of Formula I induce the conversion of
   cytosolic LC3-1 to membrane-bound LC3-II, an essential step for the induction
15 of autophagy. Compounds of Formula I can be used to treat cancer including
   but not limited to liver cancer, lung cancer and cervical cancer.
   In an example embodiment, compounds 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a are more effective
   than dauricine or N-desmethyldauricine in terms of activating autophagic cell
20 death. Compounds 2a, 2b, 3a, and 4a can be used to treat cancer more
   effectively   than    dauricine    or  N-desmethyldauricine.       In an example
   embodiment, the cancer is liver cancer, lung cancer and cervical cancer.
   An example embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition that contains
25 the compound of Formula 1.
                                              12

   In an example embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition includes a
   pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. The pharmaceutically

 5 An equivalent of appropriate dauricine (20 mg, 0.032 mmol) was dissolved in
   anhydrous dichloromethane (2 mL), triethylamine (1.5 of equivalents) and
   appropriate carbamoyl chloride (1.2 of equivalents) were subsequently added,
   followed by the addition of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP; 0.1 of equivalents)
   as a catalyst, and then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for
10 overnight.     The     reaction   was      monitored       using    TLC     (Thin  Layer
   Chromatography) detection. Finally, the reaction mixture was quenched with
   water and extracted with dichloromethane. Then, the dichloromethane extract
   was washed with brine, and further dried over MgSO4. The dichloromethane
   solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified by chromatography on
15 silica gel to give light yellowish solid of compounds (2a-2g).

     Scheme 2. Syntheses of compounds 3a and 3b and compounds 4a and 4b.
   An equivalent of appropriate dauricine (20 mg, 0.032 mmol) was dissolved in
 5 dry dichloromethane (2 mL), and triethylamine (1.5 of equivalents) was added
   in one portion. Either carbonyl chloride or sulfonyl chloride (1.5 of equivalents)
   was subsequently added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for
   overnight. The reaction was monitored using TLC detection. The reaction
   mixture was quenched with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The
10 dichloromethane extract was washed with brine, and then dried over MgSO4.
   Finally, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified by column
   chromatography on silica gel to give light yellowish solid of compounds (3a,

   Reagents, chemicals, antibodies and plasmids for biological assay:
   All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise
20 stated. The following regents were used: 3-methyladenine (Calbiochem,
   189490), dauricine and N-desmethyldauricine (China Chengdu MUST). RIPA
   (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) lysis buffer (CST, 9806), antibodies against
   LC3B (CST, 2775) and anti-p-actin (Santa Cruz, sc-47778) were used.
25 Cell Culture:
   All cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville,
   MD, USA) unless otherwise specified. GFP-LC3 HeLa stable cells were kindly
   provided by Professor Li Min (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun-Yat
   Sen University, Guangzhou, China). The flattened shape and discrete cellular
30 compartments of HeLa cells provide morphological advantages for observing
   autophagosome formation. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal
   bovine serum and the antibiotics penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin
   (50pg/ml; Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, UK). All cell cultures were incubated
   at 37 0 C in a 5% humidified C02 incubator.
                                          20

   Autophagy LC3 Puncta Detection:
   The detection of LC3 autophagic puncta was conducted using GFP-LC3
   stable HeLa cancer cells as described below. In brief, compounds-treated
 5 GFP-LC3-HeLa cells on cover slips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
   (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS
   (phosphate-buffered     saline). The  coverslips were    then    mounted  with
   FLUORSAVE T M mounting media (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for
   fluorescence imaging and the localization of LC3 autophagosomes were
10 captured under the API Delta Vision Live-cell Imaging System (Applied
   Precision Inc., GE Healthcare Company, Washington, USA). To quantify
   autophagy, guidelines were followed to monitor autophagy, the percentage of
   cells with punctuate LC3 immunofluorescence staining was calculated by
   counting the number of the cells showing the increased punctuate pattern of
15 LC3 fluorescence ( 10 dots/cell) in immunofluorescence-positive cells over
   the total number of cells in the same field. A minimum of 1000 cells from
   randomly selected fields were scored.
   Cytotoxicity Assays:
20 All test compounds were dissolved in DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) at final
   concentrations of 50mmol/L and stored at -20oC before use. Cytotoxicity was
   assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
   bromide (MTT) (5.0mg/ml) assay. Briefly, 4x103 cells were seeded per well in
   96-well plates before drug treatment. After overnight culture, the cells were
25 then exposed to different concentrations of test compounds (0.039-100
   pmol/L) for 72 hours. Cells without drug treatment were used as control.
   Subsequently, MTT (1OpL) was added to each well and incubated at 37 C for
   4 hours followed by the addition of 1OOpL solubilization buffer (10% SDS
   (Sodium dodecyl sulfate) in 0.01 mol/L HCI) and overnight incubation. A570
30 nm was determined from each well on the next day. The percentage of cell
   viability was calculated using the following formula: Cell viability (%) =
   Atreated/Acontroix100. Data   were  obtained   from triplication   independent
   experiments.
                                         21

   Annexin V Detection by Flow Cytometry Analysis:
   Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V staining kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
   CA, USA). In brief, cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of
   celastrol for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested and analyzed by flow
 5 cytometry using FITC-Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining according to
   the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were quantitatively counted by
   a flow cytometer (BD FACSAria III, San Jose, CA, USA). Data acquisition and
   analysis were performed with CellQuest (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
   from triple independent experiments.
10
   Protein Extraction and Western Blotting:
   After drug treatment, adherent and floating cells were lysed with RIPA lysis
   buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein
   assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The cell lysates of
15 samples were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS polyacrylamide gels and
   transferred    to   Hybond    enhanced     chemiluminescence       nitrocellulose
   membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), which were then
   blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk protein for 1 hour. Membranes were then
   incubated with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 40C. The binding
20 of the antibody was visualized by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody
   using the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western Blotting Detection
   Reagents (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, UK). Band intensities were quantified
   by using the software ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
25 Statistical Analysis:
   The results were expressed as means ± S.D. as indicated. The difference was
   considered statistically significant when the p-value was less than 0.05.
   Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA analysis was used for comparison among
   different groups.

   Example 2 Synthesis of compounds
   Compounds 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, and 2g were synthesized as presented in
   Scheme 1. Briefly, dauricine reacted with commercially available carbamoyl
                                         22

   chlorides at 00C in CH2C12 in the presence of Et3N to give seven carbamate
   compounds (2a-2g). Phenyl and alkyl chains such as methyl, ethyl, methoxyl
   or morpholinyl groups were introduced into dauricine to evaluate the role of
   different substituents on the N-termini of carbamates. The presence of barrier
 5 to rotation of the C-N bond in carbamate could give rise to two possible anti
   and syn stereoisomers. Doubling signals of syn and anti rotamers of
   compound 2d were observed in the       13C NMR spectrum due to the hindered
   rotation of C-N bond in the carbamate which results in two conformational
   stereoisomers.
10
   Similarly, ester and sulfonate compounds 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b were prepared
   as illustrated in Scheme 2 in order to compare the effects of different linking
   groups on autophagy activity. Dauricine was treated with Et3N at 00C in
   CH2Cl2, either carbonyl chloride or sulfonyl chloride was added dropwise at
15 00C. The solution was then allowed to room temperature for overnight to
   afford aromatic carboxylic esters (compounds 3a and 3b), aromatic sulfonic
   ester (compound 4a) and methyl sulfonic ester (compound 4b).
   Example 3 Effect of compounds in the cytotoxicity and autophagy in cancer
20 cells
   Figure 1 is a graph 100 showing cell viability of HeLa cells treated with
   dauricine, N-desmethyldauricine, and compounds 2a-4b. HeLa cancer cells in
   96 well-plates were treated with 0 to 20pM           of dauricine (Dau),     N
25 desmethyldauricine (NDau) and dauricine derivatives (2a-4b) for 72 hours.
   Cell cytotoxicity was then assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
   5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (5.0mg/ml) assay. The IC50 values
   shown in Figure 1 are mean values of three independent experiments.
30 Dauricine as a direct AMPK activator, activates autophagy and autophagic
   cell death in HeLa cancer cells via AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways. The
   derivative of dauricine, N-desmethyldauricine, was identified as autophagy
   inducer. N-desmethyldauricine targets sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase
   (SERCA) for calcium mobilization and thereby induces autophagic cell death
                                          23

   in apoptosis-defective cancer. The anti-cancer effect of compounds 2a-2g,
   and 3a-4b via autophagy induction was investigated. The cytotoxicity of
   dauricine, N-desmethyldauricine and compounds 2a-4b in HeLa cancer cells
   are compared. As shown in Figure 1, dauricine and N-desmethyldauricine
 5 exhibited    potent anti-cancer effect with    IC5o   at 15.53   and 15.80pM
   respectively. Compounds 2a, 2b, 3a, and 4a exhibited stronger cytotoxic
   effect in cancer cells with mean IC5o at 5.44pM, 6.72pM, 6.44pM, 6.10pM,
   respectively. Compounds 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g, 3b, and 4b exhibited cytotoxic
   effect in cancer cells with IC5o more than 20pM.
10
   Figure 2A-3H show identification of compounds 2a-4b with autophagic
   activities. GFP-LC3 puncta in compound-treated GFP-LC3-HeLa cells were
   detected. GFP-LC3 stable HeLa cells were treated with DMSO (-ve Ctrl) or
   the indicated concentrations of dauricine (Dau), N-desmethyldauricine (NDau)
15 and dauricine derivatives (2a-4b) for 24 hours. Representative fluorescence
   images from the highest tested concentration of compound captured at 60X
   magnification were shown; scale bar, 15pm. Bar charts represent the
   quantitation of autophagic cells. The percentages of autophagic cells were
   calculated as the number of cells with GFP-LC3 puncta ( 10 puncta/cell)
20 divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells in the same field.

   The conversion of cytosolic LC3-1 to membrane-bound LC3-II, an essential
   step for the induction of autophagy, was monitored in GFP-LC3 stable
                                           24

   expressing HeLa cancer cells. As shown in Figures 2A-2B and 2D, untreated
   control cells indicated no green fluorescence puncta formation, whereas
   dauricine and N-desmethyldauricine had increased formation of GFP-LC3
   puncta    in  HeLa   cells.  Dauricine    and N-desmethyldauricine    induced
 5 autophagic puncta in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2C

20 20, 2Q, 2S, 3B, 3D, 3F, 3H. It shows that compounds 2a-4b can activate
   autophagy in the cancer cells.
   The presence of the autophagy marker protein, LC3-II was determined in
   HeLa cells by western blot analysis. HeLa cancer cells were treated with
25 dauricine (Dau) or compounds 2a-4b with three indicated concentrations for
   24 hours. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot for LC3 conversion
   (LC3-1, 18 kDa; LC3-II, 16 kDa) and p-actin. The western blot was shown in
   Figures 4A, 4C, 4E, 4G, 41, 4K, and 4M. LC3-II band intensities were
   quantified using densitometric analysis and normalised to P-actin. The results
30 were shown in Figures 4B, 4D, 4F, 4H, 4J, 4L and 4N. Data are expressed as
   a fold change relative to the DMSO-treated negative control. Bars are

30 Example 4 Effect of compounds 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a in inducing autophagic cell
   death in cancer cells
   To investigate whether the autophagy induced by compounds 2a, 2b, 3a, and
   4a contributes to cell death, Annexin V cell death analysis was conducted.
                                        27

   HeLa cells treated with these compounds (5pM) in the presence or absence
   of 1pM of wortmannin for 24 hours were assayed by flow cytometry after
   annexin V staining. The flow cytometry analysis was shown in Figures 5A, 5B
   and 5D. Bar charts of Figures 5C and 5E represent the quantitation of cell
 5 death (%).
   Figure 5A and Figure 5B show the flow cytometry analysis 500 and 502 for
   HeLa cells treated with DMSO (Ctrl), Wortmannin alone (WM, autophagy
   inhibitor), compounds 2a and 2b together with Wortmannin or without
10 Wortmannin. Figure 5C shows graphs 504 and 506 illustrating the quantitative
   analysis for the flow cytometry analysis.
   As shown in Figure 5A, DMSO treatment control and wortmannin (WM)
   exhibited no cytotoxic effect in HeLa cancer cells. As shown in Figures 5B and
15 5C, compounds 2a and 2b markedly increased the percentage of cell death,
   and blocking of autophagy by wortmannin significantly inhibited these
   compounds-mediated cell death. These results indicated that compounds 2a
   and 2b-induced autophagy led to autophagy-dependent cell death, showing
   that the compounds can be used as therapeutic agents to treat cancer.
20
   Figure 5D shows the flow cytometry analysis 508 for HeLa cells treated with
   compounds 3a and 4a together with Wortmannin or without Wortmannin.
   Figure 5E shows graphs 510 and 512 illustrating the quantitative analysis for
   the flow cytometry analysis.
25
   As shown in Figures 5D and 5E, compounds 3a and 4a markedly increased
   the percentage of cell death, and blocking of autophagy by wortmannin
   significantly inhibited these compounds-mediated cell death. These results
   indicated that compounds 3a and 4a-induced autophagy led to autophagy
30 dependent cell death, showing that the compounds can be used as
   therapeutic agents to treat cancer.
   Dauricine is capable of triggering significant cytotoxicity in vitro towards
   cancers of liver, cervix, and lung via the induction of autophagic cell death. N
                                           28

   Desmethyldauricine,        a derivative   of   dauricine can   increase   calcium
   mobilization, and eventually lead to autophagic cell death in apoptosis
   resistant cancer. Compounds 2a-4b were toxic to cancer cells with the
   cytotoxic effects associated with autophagy activation, similar as dauricine
 5 and N-Desmethyldauricine. Compounds 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a demonstrated
   more potent cytotoxic effect on HeLa cancer cells compared with dauricine
   and N-Desmethyldauricine. These four compounds showed close IC50 values
   around 6pM, which were at least 2.3-folds increment of activity compared to
   that of dauricine (15.53 pM). A calculated log P (cLog P) is routinely used as
10 an assessment of lipophilicity, which reflects the key event of molecular
   desolvation in transfer from aqueous phases to cell membranes and to protein
   binding sites. Table 1 showed that cLog P values of these compounds follow
   the trend of 2a (9.63) > 3a (8.58) ~ 4a (8.54) > 2b (8.15) >> daurince (6.50).

       NDau              6.12          2e           7.081       3b           7.752
          2a            9.626          2f           7.164       4a           8.545
         2b             8.152          2g           6.162       4b           6.207
          2c            6.243
   These four compounds 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a displayed an inverse linear
20 correlation between log ICso and cLog P values (r2 = 0.8824), showing that
   lipophilicity contributes to their cytotoxicity on HeLa cancer cells as shown in
   the graph 600 of Figure 6. On the other hand, these four compounds 2a, 2b,
   3a, and 4a are having at least one benzene group (phenyl or tolyl) regardless
   of the nature of the linkage moieties (carbamate, carboxylic ester or sulfonic
25 ester) in their structures. The resonance movement of electrons within these
   aromatic rings provides extra stability and may explain the more profound
   cytotoxic effects of these four compounds towards the cancer cells.
