Title of Invention:  GIS-TYPE ZEOLITE
Technical Field
[0001]
     The present invention relates to a GIS-type zeolite.
Background Art
[0002]
     Zeolite can be used for adsorbents, desiccants,
separating agents, catalysts, catalyst carriers,
detergent aids, ion exchangers, waste water treatment
agents, fertilizers,  food additives, cosmetic additives
and the like, and, in particular, is useful in gas
separation applications.
[0003]
     A GIS-type zeolite is disclosed in each of Patent
Literatures 1 to 2 and Non-Patent Literatures 1 to 3.
Such a GIS-type zeolite here has a GIS structure in codes
for directing zeolite structures specified by the
International Zeolite Association   (IZA).
[0004]
     A GIS-type zeolite is a zeolite having a pore
constituted by an oxygen 8-membered ring.   Patent
Literature 1 describes  synthesis of a GIS-type  zeolite
for effective use of  slag of coal burnt ash, and Patent

                               - 2
Literature 2 describes an enhancement in thermal
conductivity by formation of a zeolite film         (GIS-type
zeolite)      on the surface of an aluminum plate.    Non-Patent
Literatures 1 and 2 each disclose a GIS-type zeolite of
silica/alumina, and adsorption of carbon dioxide is not
almost found in all of such disclosures.         Non-Patent
Literature 3 discloses a GIS-type zeolite of
silicoaluminophosphate      containing phosphoric acid, and
reported that not only adsorption of carbon dioxide, but
also adsorption of oxygen, nitrogen and methane were
observed.

Summary of  Invention
Technical Problem
[0007]
     Focusing on the carbon dioxide adsorption ability of
a GIS-type  zeolite, for example, the GIS-type    zeolite is
remarkable in industrial usability if it can selectively
remove carbon dioxide from natural gas.
     Meanwhile, Patent Literatures 1 to 2 have not
mentioned any adsorption of carbon dioxide by zeolite,
and it is hardly said according to the structure analysis
results shown in such Literatures that a crystal
structure necessary for selective adsorption of carbon
dioxide is clearly formed.    That is,  it is considered
that the zeolite described in Patent Literatures 1 to 2
is not  sufficient in adsorption ability of carbon dioxide

and is also low in selectivity of adsorption of carbon
dioxide relative to adsorption of methane.
     In addition, the zeolite shown in Non-Patent
Literatures 1 to 2 does not provide adsorption of carbon
dioxide, and cannot separate carbon dioxide and molecules
larger in the size than carbon dioxide, such as oxygen,
nitrogen and methane, by adsorption and/or gas
penetration.    The reason for this is considered because a
cation  (Na) is present in such a zeolite and the cation
prevents penetration of carbon dioxide into a pore.           In
Non-Patent Literature 3, adsorption of carbon dioxide has
been observed, but adsorption of oxygen, nitrogen and
methane cannot be said to be sufficiently low, and thus
the selection rate in terms of         separation of carbon
dioxide is lower.    The reason for this is considered
because an   8-membered ring pore of such a zeolite is
expanded.
[0008]
     The present invention has been made in view of the
above circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide
a GIS-type   zeolite which has few crystal lattice
distortions and defects, which has a crystal structure
clearly formed, which can       sufficiently adsorb carbon
dioxide  (C02)  and which is      also high in  selectivity of
adsorption of carbon dioxide relative to the amount of
adsorption of methane    (CH 4 ),   as compared with a
conventional GIS-type    zeolite.

Solution to Problem
[0009]
     The present inventors have made intensive studies in
order to solve the above problems, and as a result, have
found that the above problems can be solved by a GIS-type
zeolite where the aluminum atom and phosphorus atom
contents are within predetermined ranges and the amount
of adsorption of carbon dioxide is within a predetermined
range, leading to completion of the present invention.

of 1% by mass or more and a phosphorus atom content of 4%
by mass or less, wherein

carbon dioxide into the GIS-type zeolite, measured when
the GIS-type zeolite and carbon dioxide are placed in a
system at 25'C and 760 mmHg, is 5 cm 3 /g or more at 250C
and 760 mmHg.

heights of peaks around 20 = 12.4 and 21.60    in a peak
obtained by X-ray diffraction are defined as A and B,

                           - 6
     The GIS-type zeolite according to  [1] or [2],
wherein, when heights of peaks around 20 = 12.4 and 26.0'
in a peak obtained by X-ray diffraction are defined as A
and C, respectively, 0.35 > C/A is satisfied.

wherein the GIS-type zeolite is silica/alumina.
[5]
     An adsorbent comprising the GIS-type zeolite
according to any one of  [1] to [4].
Advantageous Effect of Invention
[0011]
     The present invention can provide a GIS-type zeolite
which has few crystal lattice distortions and defects,
which has a crystal structure clearly formed, which can
sufficiently adsorb carbon dioxide and which is also high
in selectivity of adsorption of carbon dioxide relative
to the amount of adsorption of methane.

Description of Embodiments
 [0013]
      Hereinafter, an embodiment for carrying out the
present invention     (hereinafter, referred to as "the
present embodiment".)     will be described in detail.        The
present invention is not limited to the following
description, and can be variously modified and carried
out within the gist thereof.
 [0014]
      A GIS-type zeolite of the present embodiment has an
aluminum atom content of 1% by mass or more and a
phosphorus atom content of 4% by mass or less, and
furthermore a, being the amount of saturation adsorption
of carbon dioxide into the GIS-type         zeolite, measured
when the GIS-type zeolite and carbon dioxide are placed
in  a  system at 250C and 760 mmHg,   is     5 cm 3 /g or more at
25'C and 760 mmHg.     The GIS-type zeolite      of the present
embodiment can sufficiently adsorb carbon dioxide and is
also high in selectivity of adsorption of carbon dioxide
relative to the amount of adsorption of methane.
      In the present embodiment, the GIS-type zeolite is
preferably silica/alumina from the viewpoint of allowing
the selective adsorption ability of carbon dioxide to be
more enhanced.
      The   "silica/alumina" here refers to a GIS-type
zeolite including silica and alumina as main components

                                       - 8
of the GIS-type            zeolite  (80% by mass or more),           in which
the content of aluminum is 1% by mass or more, more
preferably 3% by mass or more,                 further preferably 5% by
mass or more, the content of phosphorus is 4% by mass or
less, and the contents of              Zr and Ti are 8% by mass or
less.
        From the same viewpoint as described above, the
phosphorus atom content in the GIS-type zeolite of the
present embodiment is more preferably 1.5% by mass or
less, particularly preferably 0% by mass.
         The aluminum and phosphorus atom contents can be
measured by a method described in Examples below.                        In
addition, the aluminum and phosphorus atom contents can
be adjusted by, for example, adjusting the compositional
ratio of a mixed-gel            for use in synthesis of the GIS-type
zeolite within a preferable range described below.
 [0015]
          (X-Ray diffraction peak)
         In the GIS-type        zeolite of the present embodiment,
when the heights            of peaks   around 20 = 12.4 and 21.60 in           a
peak obtained by X-ray diffraction are defined as A and B,
respectively,          1.37   < A/B is   satisfied.        A peak around 20
= 12.4'       is typically      observed in       the range      from 12.15' to
12.75',       and a peak around 20        =   21.6'   is  typically
observed in        the range of 20       =   20.1'   to  24.1'.
         In   an X-ray diffraction         peak at 250C of the GIS-type
zeolite of the present embodiment, peaks at 20 = 12.4'

                                    - 9
and 21.60   correspond to diffraction         peaks   of  (1   0 1)   and
(2 1 1),   respectively.         A diffraction peak of      (1 0 1)
corresponds to diffraction reflecting a periodic
structure of an oxygen 8-membered ring of the GIS-type
zeolite, and a diffraction peak of            (2 1 1)  corresponds to
diffraction reflecting a finer structure thereof.                   It is
indicated that, when the heights of diffraction peaks of
(1 0 1) and      (2 1 1) are defined as A and B,         respectively,
and A/B is here high, a larger periodic structure, namely,
a structure including an 8-membered ring structure is
clear.   It is known that a cation included in zeolite can
be moved, and it is considered that there are no
deficiencies in a large periodic structure including an
8-membered ring structure and such a structure is clearly
formed to thereby result in an increase in the mobility
of a cation and to allow the cation to move without
interfering in penetration of carbon dioxide into a pore,
thereby allowing the adsorption ability of carbon dioxide
to be exhibited.          From this   viewpoint,  A/B is   preferably
more than 1.37, more preferably more than 1.40, further
preferably 1.50 or more.
     Furthermore, in the GIS-type zeolite of the present
embodiment, when the heights of peaks around 20 = 12.4
and 26.00   in    a peak obtained by X-ray diffraction            are
defined as A and C,          respectively, 0.35 > C/A is
preferably     satisfied.       A peak around at 26.00 is       a peak
derived from an ANA-type zeolite.            A peak around 20 =

                                      -  10
26.00   is  typically     observed in          the     range of 20 = 25.8'       to
26.20.     The ANA-type     zeolite        is   easily     produced      as an
impurity in       synthesis of the GIS-type                zeolite.      The ANA
type zeolite        does not adsorb          C02,    and thus the amount
thereof present is preferably smaller.                       The amount of ANA
present can be determined by a peak of C in XRD.                           When
ANA incorporated in GIS is in an amount such that 0.35 >
C/A is satisfied, more adsorption of carbon dioxide can
be made.      More preferably         0.25     > C/A is       satisfied,     and
further preferably 0.1 > C/A is satisfied.
      Herein, the A/B and C/A values can be determined by
a method described in Examples below, and both can be
adjusted within the above ranges by methods for adjusting
the compositional ratio of a mixed-gel, as well as the
aging period, conditions in hydrothermal                         synthesis
(heating temperature and heating time),                        and the like of a
mixed-gel within preferable ranges described below.
[0016]
       The peak half-value width obtained by X-ray
diffraction represents           crystallinity of a crystal lattice
plane on which the diffraction occurs, and is preferably
narrow.     The ranges of the peak half-value                       widths around
20 = 12.4     and 21.60 are,        respectively,           preferably     0.44
deg or less and 0.80 deg or less, more preferably 0.40
deg or less and 0.70 deg or less, further preferably 0.35
deg or less and 0.60 deg or less.                      The present inventors
have thus presumed that the structure of the GIS-type

                               -   11
zeolite indicated by such peak half-value widths enables
CH 4 not to penetrate into the crystal lattice and thus to
be adsorbed in a decreased amount, and also enables
deficiencies     at an adsorption site    of C02 not to occur,
to thereby maximize the amount of adsorption of C02,
thereby maximizing the ratio of the         amounts of adsorption,
C02/CH 4.
        The range of the peak half-value width around 20      =
26.10 is preferably 0.65 deg or less, more preferably
0.60 deg or less,      further preferably 0.50 deg or less.
The present inventors have thus presumed that, when the
structure of the ANA-type zeolite indicated by such a
peak half-value width is generated, impurities hardly
detected as peaks in XRD,        such as an amorphous  form, can
be less present, to thereby maximize the amount of
adsorption of C02.
        Herein, the peak half-value width can be each
adjusted within the above range by methods for adjusting
the compositional ratio of a mixed-gel, as well as
conditions in hydrothermal        synthesis  (heating temperature
and heating time),      and the like of a mixed-gel within
preferable ranges described below.
[0017]
         (Synthesis method)
        A method for producing a GIS-type zeolite according
to the present embodiment can include, for example, a
step of preparing of a mixed gel containing a silica

                            - 12
source including silicon, an aluminum source including
aluminum, an alkali metal source including at least one
selected from an alkali metal    (Ml) and an alkali earth
metal   (M2), a phosphorus source including phosphorus, and
water.   Hereinafter, the mixed gel and each component
included therein will be described.
[0018]
      [Mixed gel]
     The mixed gel in the present embodiment is a mixture
including a silica source, an aluminum source, an alkali
metal source and water as components and, if necessary,
including a phosphorus source and an organic structure
directing agent.
     The silica source refers to a component in the mixed
gel, serving as a starting material of silicon included
in a zeolite produced from the mixed gel, the aluminum
source refers to a component in the mixed gel,    serving as
a starting material of aluminum included in a zeolite
produced from the mixed gel, the alkali metal source
refers to a component in the mixed gel, serving as
starting material(s) of an alkali metal and/or an alkali
earth metal included in a zeolite produced from the mixed
gel, and the phosphorus source refers to a component in
the mixed gel, serving as a starting material of
phosphorus included in a zeolite produced from the mixed
gel.
[0019]

                              - 13
        [Silica source]
       The silica source is not particularly limited as
long as it is one commonly used, and specific examples
thereof include sodium silicate, amorphous         silica,
colloidal silica, wet method silica, dry method silica,
silica gel, amorphous aluminosilicate gel,
tetraethoxysilane     (TEOS) and trimethylethoxysilane.
These compounds may be used singly or in combinations of
a plurality    thereof.   Here, amorphous aluminosilicate  gel
serves as the silica source and also serves as the
aluminum source.
       Among them, sodium silicate is preferable from the
viewpoint that a zeolite high in the degree of
crystallinity tends to be obtained.
[0020]
        [Aluminum source]
       The aluminum source is not particularly limited as
long as it is one commonly used, and specific examples
thereof include sodium aluminate, aluminum sulfate,
aluminum nitrate, aluminum acetate, aluminum hydroxide,
aluminum oxide, aluminum chloride, aluminum alkoxide,
metallic aluminum and amorphous aluminosilicate gel.
These compounds may be used singly or in combinations of
a plurality thereof.
       Among them, sodium aluminate, aluminum sulfate,
aluminum nitrate, aluminum acetate, aluminum hydroxide,
aluminum chloride or aluminum alkoxide is preferable from

                           -  14
the viewpoint that a zeolite high in the degree of
crystallinity tends to be obtained.    From the same
viewpoint,  sodium aluminate or aluminum hydroxide is more
preferable, and sodium aluminate is further preferable.
[0021]
     [Alkali metal source]
     The alkali type in the alkali metal source is not
particularly limited, and any alkali metal and/or any
alkali earth metal compound can be used.
     Examples of the alkali metal source include, but not
limited to the following, hydroxide, hydrogen carbonate,
carbonate, acetate, sulfate and nitrate of an alkali
metal or an alkali earth metal.    These compounds may be
used singly or in combinations of a plurality thereof.
     The alkali metal and the alkali earth metal for use
in the alkali metal source can be usually Li, Na, K, Rb,
Cs, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba or the like.    Na or K is preferable
and Na is more preferable,   from the viewpoint of more
facilitating crystal formation of the GIS-type backbone.
The alkali metal and the alkali earth metal for use in
the alkali metal source may be used singly or in
combinations of a plurality thereof.
    Specific examples of the alkali metal source include,
but not  limited to the following, sodium hydroxide,
sodium acetate,  sodium sulfate, sodium nitrate, sodium
carbonate,  sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydroxide,
potassium acetate, potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate,

                          - 15
potassium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate,
lithium hydroxide, lithium acetate, lithium sulfate,
lithium nitrate, lithium carbonate, lithium hydrogen
carbonate, rubidium hydroxide, rubidium acetate, rubidium
sulfate, rubidium nitrate, rubidium carbonate, rubidium

strontium hydroxide, strontium acetate, strontium sulfate,
strontium nitrate, strontium carbonate, strontium
hydrogen carbonate, barium hydroxide, barium acetate,
barium sulfate, barium nitrate, barium carbonate and
barium hydrogen carbonate.
     Among them, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,
lithium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide,
calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, strontium
hydroxide or barium hydroxide is preferable, sodium
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide,
rubidium hydroxide or cesium hydroxide is more preferable,
and sodium hydroxide is further preferable.
[0022]
     [Phosphorus source]

                           -  16
     The phosphorus source is not particularly limited as
long as it is one commonly used, and specific examples
thereof include an aqueous phosphoric acid solution,
sodium phosphate, aluminum phosphate, potassium phosphate,
lithium phosphate, calcium phosphate and barium phosphate.
These compounds may be used singly or in combinations of
a plurality thereof.
     Among them, an aqueous phosphoric acid solution,
sodium phosphate or aluminum phosphate is preferable.
From the same viewpoint, an aqueous phosphoric acid
solution or sodium phosphate is more preferable and an
aqueous phosphoric acid solution is further preferable
from the viewpoint that a zeolite high in the degree of
crystallinity tends to be obtained.
[0023]
      [Organic structure-directing agent]
     The organic structure-directing agent in the case of
zeolite production by hydrothermal synthesis of the mixed
gel is a compound acting as promoting crystallization to
a zeolite structure.   In zeolite crystallization, the
organic structure-directing agent can be, if necessary,
used.
     Any organic structure-directing agent may be adopted
as the organic structure-directing agent without any
limitation in terms of the type as long as it can form a
desired GIS-type  zeolite.   The organic structure-

                               - 17
directing agent may be used singly or in combinations of
a plurality thereof.
     Examples of the organic structure-directing agent
which may be used herein include, but not limited to the
following, amines, quaternary ammonium salts, alcohols,
ethers, amides, alkyl ureas, alkyl thioureas,
cyanoalkanes, and alicyclic heterocyclic compounds
including nitrogen as a hetero atom can be used, and
alkylamines are preferably used and isopropylamine is
more preferably used.
     Such salts may have an anion.          Representative
examples of such an anion include, but not            limited to the
following,    a halogen ion such as Cl-,        Br- and I-,     a
hydroxide ion, an acetate ion, a sulfate ion, a nitrate
ion, a carbonate ion, and a hydrogen carbonate ion.
Among them, a halogen ion or a hydroxide ion is
preferable and a halogen ion is more preferable, from the
viewpoint of more facilitating crystal formation of the
GIS-type backbone.
[0024]
      [Compositional ratio of mixed-gel]
     The ratio between the silica source and the aluminum
source in the mixed gel is represented as the molar ratio
of the oxides of the corresponding elements, namely,
SiO2/Al203.

metal source in the mixed gel is represented by the molar

or more, from the viewpoint of more            facilitating crystal
formation of the GIS-type backbone.

source and the organic structure-directing agent in the
mixed gel is represented by the molar ratio of the
organic    structure-directing               agent to A1203,     namely,
R/A1203   (wherein R represents                the organic   structure
directing agent).              The   ratio is preferably less than          10.0,
more preferably 8.0 or less, further preferably 6.0 or

the mixed gel is represented by the molar ratio of water

                                    -  20

       As described above, the method for producing a GIS
type zeolite according to the present embodiment includes
a step of preparing of a mixed gel containing:                   a silica
source including silicon;            an aluminum source including
aluminum;      an alkali metal source including at least one

      Although a seed crystal is not necessarily needed to
be present in the mixed gel, a GIS-type zeolite produced
in advance can also be added as a seed crystal to the
mixed gel, to provide the GIS-type zeolite of the present
embodiment.

       [Step of preparing mixed gel]

                             - 22
     The step of preparing a mixed gel is not
particularly limited, and examples thereof may include a
mixing step of mixing a silica source, an aluminum source,
an alkali metal source, water, and, if necessary, an
organic structure-directing agent at one time or at
multiple stages, and an aging step of the mixture
obtained in the mixing step.
     The mixing step can mix components including the
silica source, the aluminum source, the alkali metal
source, water, and, if necessary, the organic structure
directing agent at one time or at multiple stages.
     The order in mixing at multiple stages is not
limited, and may be appropriately selected depending on
conditions used.   The mixing at multiple stages may be
performed either with stirring or without stirring.
     In stirring, a stirring method commonly used is
adopted without any particular limitation, and specific
examples include methods using blade stirring, vibration
stirring, oscillation stirring, and centrifugation
stirring, and the like.
     The rotational speed in stirring is not particularly
limited as long as it is a stirring speed commonly used,
and is,  for example,   1 rpm or more and less than 2000 rpm.
     The temperature in the mixing step is not
particularly limited as long as it is a temperature
commonly used,  and is,   for example, -20'C or more and
less than 800C.

                            - 23
     The period for the mixing step is not particularly
limited and can be appropriately selected depending on
the temperature in the mixing step, and is,    for example,
more than 0 minutes and 1000 hours or less.
     The aging step may be performed with either standing
or stirring.
     In stirring in the aging step, a stirring method
commonly used is adopted without any particular
limitation, and specific examples thereof include methods
using blade stirring, vibration stirring, oscillation
stirring, and centrifugation stirring.
     The rotational speed in stirring is not particularly
limited as long as it is a stirring speed commonly used,
and is,  for example,  1 rpm or more and less than 2000 rpm.
The temperature in the aging step is not particularly
limited as long as it is a temperature commonly used, and
is, for example,  -20'C  or more and less  than 800C.
     The period for the aging step is not particularly
limited, can be appropriately selected depending on the
temperature in the aging step, and is,    for example, more
than 0 minutes and 1000 hours or less.
     It is considered in zeolite production that
dissolution of starting materials and production and re
dissolution of a zeolite precursor occur in the mixing
step and the aging step of starting materials.      In order
to form a large periodic structure including an 8
membered ring without the occurrence of defects and the

                             - 24
like, it is preferable not to allow formation of a
zeolite precursor to excessively progress.       When
formation of a zeolite precursor excessively progresses,
it is preferable not to excessively age such a precursor
because generation of an ANA-type zeolite having a more
stable structure tends to be increased.       On the other
hand, starting materials are preferably sufficiently
mixed to provide a uniform starting material gel.         From
these viewpoints, the total period for the mixing step
and the aging step combined is preferably 1 minute or
more and less than 24 hours, more preferably 1 minute or
more and less than 23 hours, further preferably 2 minutes
or more and 12 hours or less, still      further preferably 2
minutes or more and 10 hours or less,      furthermore
preferably 3 minutes or more and 2 hours or less, still
furthermore preferably 3 minutes or more and 1.5 hours or
less.
[0026]

according to the present embodiment preferably further
includes a hydrothermal synthesis step where the
hydrothermal    synthesis temperature is   800C to 1450C,   and
the hydrothermal    synthesis temperature is more preferably
800C to  1400C.   That is, the mixed gel obtained in    the
preparation step is preferably subjected to hydrothermal

                                   -  25
synthesis with being kept at a predetermined temperature

particularly limited as long as it is a temperature
commonly used,      and it    is  preferably     800C or more from the
viewpoint of decreasing the synthesis period to allow
economic efficiency in zeolite production to be excellent.
The temperature      is more preferably        900C or more,      further
preferably     1000C or more,      from the viewpoint that
formation of a zeolite having a backbone different                   from
the GIS-type backbone can be suppressed.
        The temperature    is    more preferably     1450C or less,
further     preferably  1400C or less,      further    preferably
1350C or less,     from the viewpoint that formation of a
zeolite having a backbone different              from the GIS-type
backbone can be suppressed.
        The temperature in the hydrothermal           synthesis may be
constant or may be changed stepwisely.
        The period for the hydrothermal           synthesis is not
particularly limited as long as it is a period commonly
used, and can be appropriately selected depending on the
temperature in the hydrothermal           synthesis.
        The period for the hydrothermal           synthesis is
preferably 3 hours or more, more preferably 10 hours or
more,     from the viewpoint that the GIS backbone is formed.
The period is further preferably 24 hours or more from

                            - 26
the viewpoint that a GIS-type zeolite high in
crystallinity is obtained.
      The period for the hydrothermal  synthesis is
preferably 30 days or less, more preferably 20 days or
less,  further preferably 10 days or less,  from the
viewpoint of allowing the economic efficiency in zeolite
production to be excellent.
      The container to which the mixed gel is loaded in
the hydrothermal   synthesis step is not particularly
limited as long as it is a container commonly used, and
when the pressure in the container is increased at a
predetermined temperature or is gas pressure not
inhibiting crystallization, the mixed gel is preferably
loaded in a pressure-resistant container and subjected to
the hydrothermal   synthesis.
      The pressure-resistant container is not particularly
limited, and a pressure-resistant container having any of
various shapes such as spherical, longitudinally
elongated, and horizontally elongated shapes can be used.
     When the mixed gel in the pressure-resistant
container is stirred, the pressure-resistant container is
rotated vertically and/or laterally, preferably rotated
vertically.
     When the pressure-resistant container is rotated
vertically, the rotational speed is not particularly
limited as long as it is within a range commonly used,

                            - 27
and it is preferably 1 to 50 rpm, more preferably 10 to
40  rpm.
      In the hydrothermal synthesis step, examples of
preferable   stirring of the mixed gel include a method
including using a pressure-resistant container having a
longitudinally elongated shape and vertically rotating it.
[0027]
      [Separation/drying step]
      After the hydrothermal synthesis step, the solid as
the product and the liquid including water are          separated,
and the separation method is not particularly limited as
long as it  is  a common method.   Filtration,       decantation,

atomization, ultrasonic atomization or the like),          a
drying method using a rotary evaporator, a vacuum drying
method, a freeze-drying method, a natural drying method,
or the like can be used, and separation can be usually
made by filtration or decantation.
      The resultant from separation may be used as it is,
or may be washed with water or a predetermined solvent.
The resultant from separation can be,          if necessary, dried.
      The temperature at which the resultant from
separation is dried is not particularly limited as long
as it is a common drying temperature, and it is usually
from room temperature   to 1500C or less.
      The atmosphere during drying is not particularly
limited as long as it is an atmosphere commonly used, and

                                 -  28
an air atmosphere, or an atmosphere to which an inert gas
such as nitrogen or argon, or oxygen is added is usually
used.
 [0028]
        [Calcining step]
       A GIS-type zeolite, if necessary, calcined can be
used.     The calcining temperature is not particularly
limited as long as it is a temperature commonly used, and
it  is   preferably    300'C or more,    more preferably   3500C or
more,    from the viewpoint that, when the organic
structure-directing agent is desired to be removed, the
proportion thereof remaining can be decreased.             The
temperature    is  further    preferably   400'C or more   from the
viewpoint that the calcining period is decreased to allow
the economic efficiency in zeolite production to be
excellent.

preferably    5300C or less,     further   preferably  5000C or
less because crystallinity of zeolite tends to be
retained.
       The calcining period is not particularly limited as
long as it is a period where the organic structure
directing agent is sufficiently removed, and it can be
appropriately selected depending on the calcining
temperature and is preferably 0.5 hours or more, more
preferably 1 hour or more,          further preferably 3 hours or
more because the proportion of the remaining organic

                            -  29
structure-directing agent tends to be able to be
decreased.
     The calcining period is preferably 20 days or less,
more preferably 10 days or less,      further preferably 7
days or less because crystallinity of zeolite tends to be
retained.
     The calcining atmosphere is not particularly limited
as long as it is an atmosphere commonly used, and an air
atmosphere, or an atmosphere to which an inert gas        such
as nitrogen or argon, or oxygen is added is usually used.
[0029]
      [Cation exchange]
     The GIS-type zeolite can be,      if necessary, subjected
to cation exchange to a desired cation type.        In such
cation exchange, without limitation to the following, for
example,  nitrate  such as NH 4 NO3, LiNO3,  NaNO3, KNO3, RbNO3,
CsNO3,  Be(N03)2, Ca(N03)2, Mg(N03)2,   Sr(N03)2 or Ba(N03)2,
or a salt where a nitrate ion included in the nitrate is
changed to a halide ion, a sulfate ion, a carbonate ion,
a hydrogen carbonate ion, an acetate ion, a phosphate ion
or a hydrogen phosphate ion, or an acid such as nitric
acid or hydrochloric acid can be used.
     The cation exchange temperature is not particularly
limited as long as it is a common cation exchange
temperature, and it is usually from room temperature to
1000C or less.

                           -  30
     In separation of zeolite after such cation exchange,
the separation method is not particularly limited as long
as it is a common method.    Filtration, decantation, a
spray-drying method  (rotary atomization, nozzle
atomization, ultrasonic atomization or the like),    a
drying method using a rotary evaporator, a vacuum drying
method, a freeze-drying method, a natural drying method,
or the like can be used, and separation can be usually
made by filtration or decantation.
     The resultant from separation may be used as it is,
or may be washed with water or a predetermined solvent.
The resultant from separation can be,    if necessary, dried.
     The temperature at which the resultant from
separation is dried is not particularly limited as long
as it is a common drying temperature, and it is usually
from room temperature  to 1500C or less.
     The atmosphere during drying is not particularly
limited as long as it is an atmosphere commonly used, and
an air atmosphere, or an atmosphere to which an inert gas
such as nitrogen or argon, or oxygen is added is usually
used.
     Furthermore, an ammonium-type zeolite can also be
calcined and thus converted to a proton-type zeolite.
[0030]
     The GIS-type zeolite of the present embodiment is
not particularly limited in the application thereof, and
can be used for, for example, separating agents or

                           - 31
separation membranes  for various gases and liquids,
electrolyte membranes for fuel cells and the like,
fillers of various resin molded articles, membrane
reactors, catalysts for hydrocracking, alkylation and the
like, catalyst carriers for carrying metals, metal oxides,
and the like, adsorbents, desiccants, detergent aids,    ion
exchangers, waste water treatment agents, fertilizers,
food additives, cosmetic additives, and the like.
[0031]
     Among the above, the GIS-type zeolite of the present
embodiment can be suitably used as an adsorbent.    That   is,
an adsorbent of the present embodiment includes the GIS
type zeolite  of the present embodiment.  The adsorbent   of
the present embodiment is thus configured, and thus can
sufficiently adsorb carbon dioxide and is also high in
selectivity of adsorption of carbon dioxide relative to
the amount of adsorption of methane.   Therefore, the
adsorbent can be particularly preferably used for the
purpose of,  for example, selective removal of carbon
dioxide from natural gas.
[0032]
     The adsorbent of the present embodiment is not
particularly limited in terms of the configuration
thereof as long as it includes the GIS-type zeolite of
the present embodiment, and examples of a typical
configuration include an example illustrated in Figure 2.
An adsorbent  1 of the present embodiment, illustrated in

                               -  32
Figure 2,  includes a filter 3 disposed at each of two
positions closer to the inlet and the outlet in a
container 2, and a plurality of zeolite particles 4            (the
GIS-type zeolite of the present embodiment) disposed
between  such two filters     3.   For example, a  filter    formed
from quartz can be used for the filter 3.         For example,
when the adsorbent 1 is used for removal of carbon
dioxide from natural gas, the natural gas can be
introduced through an upper line and impurities           can be
removed therefrom by the filter 3, thereafter carbon
dioxide is selectively adsorbed and removed by the
zeolite particles 4, and a methane-rich gas can be taken
out through a  lower line.       Herein, an object to be
subjected to the adsorbent is not limited to natural gas,
and the inner structure of the adsorbent is also not
limited to the example illustrated in Figure 2.

     Hereinafter, the present embodiment will be
described with reference to Examples and the like in more
detail, but such Examples are illustrative, and the
present embodiment is not intended to be limited to the
following Examples.       The following Examples can be
variously modified and carried out as the present
embodiment by those skilled in the art, and such
modifications are encompassed within the scope of the

                              -   33
present invention as long as these can satisfy
predetermined requirements of the present embodiment.

      [Crystal structure analysis]
     Crystal structure analysis was performed according
to the following procedure.
(1) A dried product obtained in each of Examples and
Comparative Examples was used as a sample, and pulverized
by an agate mortar.
(2) The sample in   (1) above was uniformly secured on a
non-reflective sample plate for powder, and crystal
structure analysis was performed in the following
conditions.
     X-ray diffraction apparatus       (XRD): powder X-ray
diffraction apparatus "RINT2500 Model" (trade name)
manufactured by Rigaku Corporation
     X-ray source: Cu tube       (40 kV, 200 mA)
     Measurement temperature: 25'C

(3) The resulting X-ray diffraction spectrum was
subjected to data analysis using an XRD data analysis
software "PDXL2"   (software name, manufactured by Rigaku
Corporation) with the value set in the analysis software,
"a-cut value", being 3.00, thereby determining the peak

                            - 34
20 value and the peak height.     When no peak was here
detected, the peak height was defined as        0.

     Gas adsorption isotherm measurement was performed
according to the following procedure.
(1) A calcined product obtained in each of Examples and
Comparative Examples was used as a sample, and 0.2 g
thereof was placed in a 12-mm cell       (manufactured by
Micromeritics Instrument Corporation).
(2) The sample placed in the cell of       (1) above was
mounted in a gas adsorption measuring apparatus          "3-Flex"
(trade name) manufactured by Micromeritics Instrument
Corporation, and subjected to a degassing treatment with
heating under vacuum at 250'C and 0.001 mmHg or less           for
12 hours.
(3) The sample placed in the cell after the treatment in
(2) above was placed in constant-temperature circulating
water at 25'C,  and, after  the  sample temperature       reached
25 ± 0.2'C,  measurement with liquefied      carbon dioxide
(produced by Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co.,         Ltd.,  purity:
99.9% by mass or more) or methane gas        (produced by
Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co.,    Ltd.,    purity:   99.9% by mass
or more) was conducted with the absolute pressure being
up to 0.25 to 760 mmHg.    Here, the pressure was measured
over time during the measurement,       and it was determined

                              -  35
that the amount of saturation adsorption was achieved
when the pressure variation reached 0.001%/10 sec or less.
[0036]
     [Adsorption selection rate]
     In gas adsorption isotherm measurement, when the
amount of saturation adsorption of carbon dioxide into
the GIS-type zeolite, measured when the GIS-type zeolite
and carbon dioxide were placed in a system at 25'C and
760 mmHg,    was  defined as a  (cm 3 /g) and the amount of
saturation adsorption of methane into the GIS-type
zeolite, measured when the GIS-type         zeolite and methane
were placed in     a system at 250C and 760 mmHg,     was defined
as b  (cm3 /g),  the value  (a/b) obtained by dividing a by b
was calculated as the adsorption selection rate.
[0037]
     [Measurement of aluminum and phosphorus
concentrations]
     The GIS-type zeolite was thermally dissolved in an
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or aqua regia, and
appropriately diluted to provide a liquid, and the liquid
was used to measure the aluminum and phosphorus
concentrations in the zeolite by ICP-emission
spectrochemical analysis      (SPS3520UV-DD: apparatus name,
manufactured by Seiko Instruments Inc.).

of sodium aluminate           (NaAlO2,    produced by Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd.)             and 248.3 g of liquid glass No.

and stirred for 15 minutes, thereby preparing a mixed gel.

hydrothermal synthesis at 1300C for 5 days without
stirring, a product was subjected to filtration and dried
at 1200C,       and thereafter a powdered zeolite was obtained.
       An XRD spectrum of the resulting zeolite is
illustrated in Figure 1.             It was confirmed from the
spectrum that the resulting zeolite was a GIS-type
zeolite.        Furthermore, there were not observed any peaks
derived from other zeolite, amorphous silica/alumina and
the like, and therefore the resulting zeolite was
evaluated to be a high-purity GIS-type zeolite.                       The peak
intensity ratios obtained from the XRD pattern were as
follows:       A/B = 1.72 and C/A = 0.0.

minutes, thereby providing a powdered zeolite.
         From an XRD pattern of the resulting GIS-type
zeolite, A/B = 1.41 and C/A = 0.0 were satisfied.
         The adsorption isotherms              of C02 and CH 4 of the
resulting GIS-type zeolite were measured, and thus the
respective        amounts     of adsorption at 250C and 760 mmHg
were      as follows:     C02:     28.3   cm 3 /g and CH 4 : 2.9    cm3 /g; and
the adsorption selection rate                   (a/b) was 9.8.        The
aluminum concentration was 0.7% by mass and no phosphorus
was detected.
