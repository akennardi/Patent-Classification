dual-axis solar panel movable mechanism and the Sun identification, object process and tracking
system. The mechanism is identical from other because of the cylindrical system, bearings and the
moving pattern. The Sun tracking system is identical because of the PIXY CMUCam 5 special camera is
used to detect the sun as an orange object to activate the linear actuators to direct the solar panel
perpendicular to the Sun. The prototype is built using rectangular bars due to the availability of the
sources, however, industrial applications will be built using cylindrical system as proposed.

sensor, NXP LPC4330 image processor (Pixy CmuCam5), wide-angle lens, solar panel, linear actuators,
X, Y axis movable mechanism, PWM motor controlling EasyDriver interface, 12V 9Ah deep cycle
battery bank and MPPT solar charge controlling system. However, the prototype can be readily
upgraded into an industrial system by using more powerful and up to dated versions of parts and even
with updated version of camera module and construction materials.

CAMERA BASED IMPROVED SOLAR TRACKING SYSTEM AND HYBRID
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM
[0001] The solar energy harvesting is an eco-friendly solution in the renewable energy sector.
Due to the continuous change of the sun's position, an innovative application of optimal
machine vision, PV oriented camera based dual-axis sun tracking system is compulsory to
obtain maximum power generation.
[0002] The main innovation of this system is, use the Pixy CMUCam5 (object detection
camera) to locate the sun as an orange object and the improved solar panel movable
mechanism which is identical from other current mechanisms. This prototype system
contains, Arduino UNO programmable microcontroller, an OV9715 image sensor, NXP
LPC4330 image processor (Pixy CmuCam5), wide-angle lens, solar panel, linear actuators,
X, Y axis movable mechanism, PWM motor controlling EasyDriver interface, 12V 9Ah deep
cycle battery bank and MPPT solar charge controlling system. However, the prototype can be
readily upgraded into an industrial system by using more powerful and up to dated versions of
parts and even with updated version of camera module and construction materials.
[0003] The solar panel is intended and designed to rotate along the X and Y axis as seen in
the figure. The operational flowchart of the solar tracking system is plotted as described
below in figure2. The X-Y coordinates are analysed and if the sun is cantered, the solar panel
would be kept in the same place for a dedicated period for this solar tracking application (15
minutes to reduce the power consumptions for tracking operations). Otherwise, it should
perform appropriate steps to bring the sun to the centre of the image as described in figure2.
[0004] The sun's image will be obtained through the image sensor and processed by the image
processor to find the sun as an orange object. Then the X, Y coordinates of the centre of the
object will be determined by the microcontroller to manipulate step signals on the stepper
motors of linear actuators.

                                                 3
[0005] Camera module is the primary unit of the sun tracking system and it acquires sky
images via the OV9715 image sensor, process it with the NXP LPC4330 image processing
microprocessor (Pixy CMUCam5) to detect the sun as an orange object, and then sends a
block of all the information including X, Y coordinates to the Arduino UNO for activating linear
actuators. The camera module is mounted inside the unbranded camera housing. The cover
is sealed, removable parts are waterproofed with waterproofing rubber applicants. The Pixy
provides open licence that anyone can use it for any application without modifying their object
tracking code as it has been used for this invention.
[0006] The camera module is mounted on the base of the housing by using nylon isolation
screw threaded standoffs. The black plastic dome cover is modified to fit the solar filter and
the vinyl dome camera housing cover is placed together to waterproof the system. The camera
is mounted exactly on the middle position of the solar panel when a big solar panel is used or
on the middle of the master solar panel when used with master-slave system. The solar panel
needs to be mounted on a mechanism that allows to movable along the X, Y axis.
[0007] As illustrated in the figure5&6, two cylindrical bearing are attached to the cylindrical
pole and the solar panel's base is connected to those two bearings to freely move around the
cylindrical pole. Then the cylindrical pole is connected to the vertical stand which is attached
to the base and it allows the whole set of the solar panel and the cylindrical pole to be movable
along the up-down side (Y mechanism). Two linear actuators are connected as shown about
to move the solar panel side-to-side (X mechanism) and up-down (Y mechanism).
[0008] The prototype's maximum, horizontal and minimum angles are plotted below in the
figure7. The lengths are subjected to be changed according to the size of the tracking system.
The bottom end of the linear actuators is attached to the base stand using the hinge shown
below in the figure8.

                                                 4
[0009] The solar tracking system and the MPPT battery charging hybrid system's proposed
circuit diagram is described as shown in the figure9 below. The microcontrollers, ports and
parts will subject to change, however the theory behind this diagram will remain same.
[0010] Solar tracking system's power management system is designed to reduce wasting
power as figured in the figure 0. Furthermore, the power for controlling circuits are cut down
during the night time.
[0011] The prototype is made using rectangular pole, however, the future real products will be
made with cylindrical pole. The solar panel is connected to the aluminium frame and the frame
is connected to the X-axis mechanism. The X-axis mechanism is internal to the Y-axis
mechanism and it is connected to the vertical aluminium aid using a bearing system. The X
and Y axis mechanisms are movable with bearing mechanisms respectively as shown in
figure 1. All the wires those are in danger of damage from moving mechanisms are spiralled
to protect them.
[0012] The camera module with the solar panel has been turned toward the direction of the
Sun to harvest maximum power from the sun. The X and Y axis mechanisms are operated
simultaneously to make the solar panel perpendicular to the sun's rays. If the system is
extended to use in industrial applications or solar generation farms, while the master sun
tracker's power consumption remains same, the slave solar panels use power only for the X,
Y mechanisms.
[0013] The solar charging control system is built using Maximum Power Point Tracking
(MPPT) system and it includes some facilities such as LCD display that shows the voltage and
current levels, battery overcharge protection, lighting and high-power protection, reverse
polarity protection, overload and short circuit protection. The unregulated power output which
comes from the solar panel (OV - 18V) can be controlled and regulated through the
synchronized buck converter and the deep cycle battery will be charged with maximum 13.8
volts.

                                                  5
[0014] The synchronized buck convert is an improved system of the standard buck converter
by replacing the diode with a MOSFET and placing a MOSFETs driver to control them. It is
used to regulate the input voltage from the solar panel to the battery's voltage level and can
deliver high currents while minimizing power loss.
[0015] The controller of the MOSFETs is determined as the IR2104 half-bridge driver IC with
it's appropriate technical characteristics such as logic compatibility, high-speed switching,
sustain to high voltage. The AUIRFZ44N is determined as the MOSFETs because of the
relevance to the switching speed and the voltage and current characteristics. The whole
system can be suspended during the night time to reduce the wastage of the power.

        actuator.
     *  Wi-Fi data logging, testing, and wireless controlling.
     *  Update the system with an inverter and transform the prototype into a more powerful
        system.
     *  Move the sun tracking system close to the camera and store in a waterproof housing.
     *  Build the MPPT charging system, inverter, smoother and electrical parts in a
        waterproof enclosure housing for industrial applications.
     *  Develop the system with one master camera module with 10+ solar panels those
        following the master camera tracker in commercial and industrial applications.
