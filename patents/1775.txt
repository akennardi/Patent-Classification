Systems and methods are disclosed herein that generally involve CED devices with various
features for reducing or preventing backflow. In some embodiments, CED devices include a
tissue-receiving space disposed proximal to a distal fluid outlet. Tissue can be compressed into
or pinched/pinned by the tissue-receiving space as the device is inserted into a target region of
a patient, thereby forming a seal that reduces or prevents proximal backflow of fluid ejected
from the outlet beyond the tissue-receiving space. In some embodiments, CED devices include
a bullet-shaped nose proximal to a distal fluid outlet. The bullet-shaped nose forms a good seal
with surrounding tissue and helps reduce or prevent backflow of infused fluid.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No.61/738,850 filed on
December 18, 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/835,912 filed on June 17, 2013,
which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
FIELD
[0002] The present invention relates to systems and methods for reducing or preventing
backflow in delivery systems, such as convection-enhanced delivery systems for delivering
therapeutic agents to a patient.
BACKGROUND
[0003] In convection-enhanced delivery (CED), drugs are infused locally into tissue through a
needle, cannula, or microcatheter inserted into the tissue. Transport of the infused material is
dominated by convection, which enhances drug penetration into the target tissue compared with
diffusion-mediated delivery or systemic delivery.
[0004] CED has emerged as a leading investigational delivery technique for the treatment of
several disorders. Clinical trials using existing devices show mixed results and suggest that the
outcome of the therapy depends strongly on the extent of penetration and distribution of the drug
into the target tissue, which is determined by infusion velocity, the relative rates of convection
and elimination during CED, and various properties of the target tissue.
[0005] As infusion velocity increases, there can be a tendency for the infused fluid to flow back
along the insertion pathway, between the exterior of the microcatheter and the surrounding
tissue. Flexible microcatheter designs have been constructed to reduce this backflow of the
drug-containing fluid. However, fluid backflow during CED treatment still remains a critical
problem in clinical practice. This is particularly true in the case of CED within the brain, as the
poroelastic nature of the brain tissue contributes to backflow or reflux. There is therefore a need

      WO 2014/100157                                                            PCT/US2013/076084
for improved CED devices, e.g., CED devices that reduce or eliminate backflow of the infused
fluid between the exterior of the device and the surrounding tissue.
SUMMARY
[0006] Systems and methods are disclosed herein that generally involve CED devices with
various features for reducing or preventing backflow. In some embodiments, CED devices
include a tissue-receiving space disposed proximal to a distal fluid outlet. Tissue can be
compressed into or pinched/pinned by the tissue-receiving space as the device is inserted into a
target region of a patient, thereby forming a seal that reduces or prevents proximal backflow of
fluid ejected from the outlet beyond the tissue-receiving space. In some embodiments, CED
devices include a bullet-shaped nose proximal to a distal fluid outlet. The bullet-shaped nose
forms a good seal with surrounding tissue and helps reduce or prevent backflow of infused fluid.
[0007] In some embodiments, a convection-enhanced-delivery (CED) device is provided that
includes a micro-tip having a proximal portion, a central portion, a distal portion, and at least one
fluid channel extending along said proximal, central, and distal portions, the at least one fluid
channel having an outlet port at a distal end thereof and an inlet port at a proximal end thereof.
The device also includes a first outer sheath disposed coaxially over the distal portion of the
micro-tip such that the distal portion of the micro-tip protrudes from a distal end of the first outer
sheath, a first tissue-receiving space defined between an exterior surface of the micro-tip and an
interior surface of the distal end of the first outer sheath, and a catheter body extending
proximally from the micro-tip such that the at least one fluid channel of the micro-tip is in fluid
communication with a respective inner lumen of the catheter body. The device also includes a
nose portion disposed over at least the central portion of the micro-tip and extending between the
first outer sheath and the catheter body such that the nose portion defines an exterior surface that
tapers from a reduced distal diameter corresponding to the outside diameter of the first outer
sheath to an enlarged proximal diameter corresponding to the outside diameter of the catheter
body.
[0008] The tissue-receiving space can be configured to compress tissue received therein as the
device is advanced through the tissue. Tissue compressed by the tissue-receiving space can form
a seal that reduces proximal backflow of fluid ejected from the outlet port of the at least one fluid
                                                    2

      WO 2014/100157                                                            PCT/US2013/076084
channel beyond the tissue-receiving space. The device can include a second outer sheath
disposed over the first outer sheath such that a second tissue-receiving space is defined between
an exterior surface of the first outer sheath and an interior surface of a distal end of the second
outer sheath. The interior surface of the distal end of the first outer sheath can be shaped to
compress tissue received therein as the device is advanced through the tissue. The interior
surface of the distal end of the first outer sheath can be conical, convex, and/or concave.
[0009] An inside diameter of the distal end of the first outer sheath can be about 1 pm to about
200 am greater than an outside diameter of the distal portion of the micro-tip. An inside
diameter of the distal end of the first outer sheath can be about 10 percent to about 100 percent
greater than an outside diameter of the distal portion of the micro-tip. The first outer sheath can
have a circular outside cross-section. The at least one fluid channel can be formed from at least
one of a parylene composition, a silastic composition, a polyurethane composition, and a PTFE
composition. The device can include a fluid reservoir in fluid communication with the inner
lumen of the catheter body and configured to supply a fluid thereto under positive pressure. The
micro-tip can be flexible. The micro-tip can include an embedded microsensor.
[0010] The embedded microsensor can include at least one of an interrogatable sensor, a
pressure sensor, a glutamate sensor, a pH sensor, a temperature sensor, an ion concentration
sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor, an oxygen sensor, and a lactate sensor. The distal end of the
micro-tip can have an atraumatic shape configured to penetrate tissue without causing trauma.
The micro-tip can contain a quantity of a drug, can be coated with a drug, and/or can be
impregnated with a drug. The drug can include at least one of an antibacterial agent, an anti
inflammatory agent, a corticosteroid, and dexamethasone. The micro-tip can include a substrate
having the at least one fluid channel formed thereon. The substrate can have a rectangular
transverse cross-section. The catheter body can be formed from a rigid material. Each inner
lumen of the catheter body can be defined by a sleeve formed from a flexible material. The
catheter body can be formed from at least one of ceramic, PEEK, and polyurethane. Each sleeve
can be formed from at least one of polyimide, pebax, PEEK, polyurethane, silicone, and fused
silica. The catheter body can be formed from a flexible material. The device can be assembled
by forming the nose portion by molding the nose portion over the first outer sheath, inserting the
micro-tip into a proximal end of the nose portion, coupling the proximal portion of the micro-tip

to the catheter body, and injecting a flowable material through an inlet port formed in the nose
portion to fill the interior of the nose portion and secure the micro-tip and catheter body to the
nose portion.
[0011] In some embodiments, a convection-enhanced-delivery (CED) device is provided that
includes a fluid conduit having proximal and distal ends, a first outer sheath disposed coaxially
over the fluid conduit such that the fluid conduit extends out of a distal end of the first outer
sheath, and a first tissue-receiving space defined between an exterior surface of the fluid conduit
and an interior surface of the distal end of the first outer sheath.
[0012] In some embodiments, a micro-molding device is provided that includes a mold cavity
sized and configured to receive a catheter body and a catheter micio-tip therein such that at least
one fluid channel of the micro-tip is at least partially disposed within a corresponding fluid line
of the catheter body. The device also includes one or more mold channels though which a mold
fluid can be injected to fill the mold cavity and secure the micro-tip to the catheter body such that
the at least one fluid channel of the micro-tip is in fluid communication with the at least one fluid
line of the catheter body. The device can be transparent to allow UV light to pass therethrough
to cure mold fluid disposed within the mold cavity. The mold cavity can be sized and configured
to form a bullet nose portion over the micro-tip and over at least a portion of an outer sheath
received in the mold cavity.
[0013] In some embodiments, a method of delivering a therapeutic agent to a patient is
provided. The method includes advancing a fluid conduit having a first outer sheath disposed
therearound into tissue to compress tissue into a first tissue-receiving space defined between an
exterior surface of the fluid conduit and an interior surface of the distal end of the first outer
sheath. The method also includes delivering fluid containing the therapeutic agent under positive
pressure through the fluid conduit and into a portion of the tissue adjacent to a distal end of the
fluid conduit.
[0014] The method can include delivering a sealing gel through the fluid conduit, before
delivering the fluid containing the therapeutic agent, to fill one or more voids that exist between
the fluid conduit and the tissue. Tissue compressed into the first tissue-receiving space can form
a seal that reduces proximal backflow of fluid ejected from the distal end of the fluid conduit

beyond the tissue-receiving space. The method can include advancing a second outer sheath
disposed over the first outer sheath into the tissue such that tissue is compressed into a second
tissue-receiving space defined between an exterior surface of the first outer sheath and an interior
surface of the distal end of the second outer sheath. The interior surface of the distal end of the
first outer sheath can be at least one of cylindrical, conical, convex, and concave. The method
can include controlling delivery of fluid through the fluid conduit based on an output of a
microsensor embedded in the fluid conduit. The method can be used to treat at least one
condition selected from central-nervous-system (CNS) neoplasm, intractable epilepsy,
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke, lysosomal storage disease, chronic brain
injury, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, balance disorders, hearing disorders,
and cavernous malformations. Advancing the fluid conduit can include urging a nose portion
into contact with tissue, the nose portion extending between the first outer sheath and a proximal
catheter body such that the nose portion tapers from a reduced distal diameter corresponding to
the outside diameter of the first outer sheath to an enlarged proximal diameter corresponding to
the outside diameter of the catheter body, The fluid conduit can be coupled to a distal end of a
flexible catheter and the method can include inserting the catheter through an incision,
positioning the fluid conduit in proximity to the portion of the tissue using stereotactic targeting,
removing a stylet inserted through the catheter, tunneling a proximal end of the catheter beneath
the scalp of the patient, and coupling one or more proximal fluid connectors of the catheter to a
fluid delivery system,

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0050] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the methods,
systems, and devices disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the
methods, systems, and devices specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying
drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is
defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one
exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such
modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present
invention.
[0051] Systems and methods are disclosed herein that generally involve CED devices with
various features for reducing or preventing backflow. In some embodiments, CED devices
include a tissue-receiving space disposed proximal to a distal fluid outlet. Tissue can be
compressed into or pinched/pinned by the tissue-receiving space as the device is inserted into a
target region of a patient, thereby forming a seal that reduces or prevents proximal backflow of
fluid ejected from the outlet beyond the tissue-receiving space. In some embodiments, CED
devices include a bullet-shaped nose proximal to a distal fluid outlet. The bullet-shaped nose
forms a good seal with surrounding tissue and helps reduce or prevent backflow of infused fluid.
[0052] FIG. I illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a CED device 10. The device 10
generally includes a fluid conduit 12 and an outer sheath 14. The outer sheath 14 can be
disposed coaxially over the fluid conduit 12 such that the fluid conduit 12 extends out of a distal
end 16 of the outer sheath 14. The fluid conduit 12 and the outer sheath 14 can be sized and
dimensioned such that a tissue-receiving space 18 is formed between an exterior surface of the
fluid conduit 12 and an interior surface of the distal end 16 of the outer sheath 14.
[0053] The fluid conduit 12 can define one or more fluid lumens that extend generally parallel
to the central longitudinal axis of the device 10. The fluid conduit 12 can include a fluid inlet
                                                  8

      WO 2014/100157                                                             PCT/US2013/076084
port (not shown in FIG. 1) and a fluid outlet port 20. While a single fluid outlet port 20 is shown
in the illustrated embodiment, it will be appreciated that the device can include a plurality of
fluid outlet ports, as well as a plurality of fluid inlet ports and a plurality of fluid lumens
extending therebetween. The fluid inlet port can be positioned at a proximal end of the device
10, and can allow the fluid conduit 12 to be placed in fluid communication with a fluid reservoir,
e.g., via one or more catheters, pumps, meters, valves, or other suitable control devices. Such
control devices can be used to regulate the pressure at which fluid is supplied to the device 10, or
the rate or volume of fluid that is supplied to the device 10.
[0054] Fluid supplied to the conduit 12 though the fluid inlet port can be directed through one or
mor inner lumens of the conduit 12 and released through the one or more fluid outlet ports 20.
The fluid outlet ports 20 can be sized, shaped, and/or positioned to control various release
parameters of the fluid. For example, the fluid outlet ports 20 can be configured to control the
direction in which fluid is released from the device 10, the distribution of the fluid within the
target tissue, and the velocity or pressure at which the fluid is released. In exemplary
embodiments, the size of the fluid outlet ports can progressively increase towards the distal end
of the device 10, which can advantageously compensate for pressure loss that occurs along the
length of the device such that fluid is released from each of the plurality of fluid outlet ports at
substantially the same pressure. The fluid outlet ports can also be positioned at various points
around the circumference of the fluid conduit 12 or can be shaped to control the release direction
of the fluid.
[0055] The fluid conduit 12 and/or the outer sheath 14 can have circular outside cross-sections,
which can advantageously allow the device 10 to rotate within the tissue without causing trauma
or forming large gaps between the exterior of the device and the surrounding tissue that might
increase backflow. The fluid conduit 12 can also be flexible to allow it to move with the tissue
in which it is inserted. While a generally-cylindrical fluid conduit 12 is shown, the fluid conduit
12 can also have a non-cylindrical or polygonal cross-section. For example, as described below
with respect to FIG. 7, the fluid conduit 12 can be a microfabricated tip that includes a substrate
having a square or rectangular cross-section with one or more fluid channels disposed thereon.
The interior of the outer sheath 14 can be shaped to substantially correspond to the cross-section
of the fluid conduit 12. Alternatively, the outer sheath 14 can have an interior cross-sectional
                                                     9

      WO 2014/100157                                                          PCT/US2013/076084
shape that differs from the exterior cross-sectional shape of the fluid conduit 12. For example,
the outer sheath 14 can have a substantially cylindrical interior cross-sectional shape at its distal
end, while the fluid conduit 12 can have a substantially square or rectangular exterior cross
sectional shape, thereby defining the tissue-receiving space 18 between the exterior of the fluid
conduit 12 and the interior of the outer sheath 14.
[0056] As noted above, the outer sheath 14 can be disposed coaxially over the fluid conduit 12
such that the fluid conduit 12 extends out of the distal end 16 of the outer sheath 14. A clearance
space between the exterior surface of the fluid conduit 12 and the interior surface of the sheath
14 can define the tissue-receiving space 18. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the fluid conduit
 12 can have an outside diameter D1 that is less than an inside diameter D2 of the outer sheath 14.
The degree to which the diameter D2 exceeds the diameter D1 can dictate the amount of tissue
that is compressed into or pinched by the tissue-receiving space 18.
[0057] In some embodiments, an adhesive or other filler can be disposed between the fluid
conduit 12 and the sheath 14 to hold the fluid conduit in a fixed longitudinal position relative to
the sheath and to maintain the fluid conduit in the center of the sheath (e.g., such that the tissue
receiving space 18 has a uniform width about the circumference of the fluid conduit). For
example, the tissue-receiving space 18 can extend proximally a first distance from the distal end
16 of the sheath 14, after which point the clearance space between the fluid conduit 12 and the
sheath 14 can be filled. In some embodiments, the sheath 14 can have a stepped, tapered, or
other similarly-shaped interior such that a clearance space exists along a distal portion of the
sheath 14 and no clearance space exists along a proximal portion of the sheath 14.
[0058] In exemplary embodiments, the inside diameter of the distal end 16 of the outer sheath
14 can be about I pm to about 1000 pm, about I pm to about 500 pm, about I mro         to about 200
Vm, or about I gm to about 20 pm greater than the outside diameter of the fluid conduit 12. In
exemplary embodiments, the inside diameter of the distal end 16 of the outer sheath 14 can be
about 5 percent to about 500 percent, about 5 percent to about 250 percent, about 10 percent to
about 100 percent, or about 10 percent to about 20 percent greater than the outside diameter of
the fluid conduit 12. In exemplary embodiments, the diameter DI can be about 50 pm to about
2000 pm, about 50 pm to about 1000 pm, or about 50 pm to about 200 Pim. In exemplary
embodiments, diameter D2 can be about 51 lim to about 5000 lim, about 55 pm to about 1000
                                                  10

      WO 2014/100157                                                            PCT/US2013/076084
pm, or about 55 pm to about 200 am. The tissue-jeceiving space IS can extend along the entire
length of the outer sheath 14, or along only a portion of the outer sheath (e.g., along about 1 mm
to about 100 mm, about 1 mm to about 50 mm, or about 1 mm to about 10 mm of the distal-most
portion of the outer sheath).
[0059] The fluid conduit 12 and the outer sheath 14 can be formed from any of a variety of
materials, including parylene compositions, silastic compositions, polyurethane compositions,
PTFE compositions, silicone compositions, and so forth,
[0060] In some embodiments, the device 10 can be mounted on a support scaffold (not shown)
to provide structural rigidity to the device and facilitate insertion into the target tissue.
Exemplary support scaffolds are illustrated and described in U.S. Publication No. 2013/0035560,
filed on August 1, 2012, entitled "MULTI-DIRECTIONAL MICROFLUIDIC DRUG
DELIVERY DEVICE," the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. To
assist with tissue penetration and navigation, the distal end of the fluid conduit 12 and/or the
distal end of the scaffold can be tapered, pointed, and/or sharpened. In some embodiments, the
fluid conduit 12 and/or the scaffold can be provided with a rounded atraumatic tip so as to
facilitate insertion through tissue without causing trauma to the tissue. The support scaffold can
be rigid or semi-rigid and can be formed from a degradable thermoplastic polymer, for example,
a degradable thermoplastic polyester or a degradable thermoplastic polycarbonate. In some
embodiments, the support scaffold can be formed from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and
can be configured to biodegrade within the target tissue. This can advantageously eliminate the
need to remove the support scaffold once the device 10 is positioned within target tissue, thereby
avoiding the potential to disrupt the positioning of the fluid conduit 12. Any of a variety of other
materials can also be used to form the support scaffold, including silicon or various ceramics,
metals, and plastics known in the mt. The scaffold can have a width of approximately 100 min      to
approximately 200 pn and can have a length that varies depending on the target tissue (e.g.,
depending on the depth at which the target tissue is situated). In one embodiment, the scaffold is
between 2 cm and 3 cm long. A variety of techniques can be used to couple the fluid conduit 12
and/or the outer sheath 14 to the support scaffold, such as surface tension from a water drop,
adhesives, and/or a biocompatible petroleum jelly.

      WO 2014/100157                                                          PCT/US2013/076084
[0061] Any of the fluid conduit 12, the outer sheath 14, and/or the support scaffold can contain
or can be impregnated with a quantity of a drug. Alternatively, or in addition, a surface of these
components can be coated with a drug. Exemplary drugs include anti-inflammatory components,
drug permeability-increasing components, delayed-jelease coatings, and the like. In some
embodiments, one or more components of the device 10 can be coated or impregnated with a
corticosteroid such as dexamethasone which can prevent swelling around the injection site and
disruptions to the fluid delivery pattern that can result from such swelling.
[0062] The device 10 can also include one or more sensors 22 mounted in or on the fluid
conduit 12, the sheath 14, or the scaffold. The sensors 22 can include temperature sensors, pH
sensors, pressure sensors, oxygen sensors, tension sensors, interrogatable sensors, glutamate
sensors, ion concentration sensors, carbon dioxide sensors, lactate sensors, neurotransmitter
sensors, or any of a variety of other sensor types, and can provide feedback to a control circuit
which can in turn regulate the delivery of fluid through the device 10 based on one or more
sensed parameters. One or more electrodes 24 can also be provided in or on the fluid conduit 12,
the sheath 14, or the scaffold, which can be used to deliver electrical energy to target tissue, e.g.,
to stimulate the target tissue or to ablate the target tissue. In one embodiment, electrical energy
is delivered through an electrode 24 while a drug is simultaneously delivered through the fluid
conduit 12.
[0063] FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of a drug delivery system 26 that includes the device
10. The system 26 includes a reservoir 28 of a drug-containing fluid that is coupled to a pump
30 via a control valve 32. When the control valve 32 is opened, fluid in the reservoir 28 is
supplied under pressure by the pump 30 to a pressure regulator 34, which can adjust a pressure at
which the fluid is supplied to the device 10. The control valve 32, pump 30, and regulator 34 can
be operatively coupled to a controller 36 which can include a microprocessor and a memory and
can be configured to execute a drug-delivery control program stored in a non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium. The controller 36 can be configured to open or close the
valve 32, to turn the pump 30 on or off, to change an output pressure of the pump 30, and/or to
adjust a pressure set point of the regulator 34. The controller 36 can also receive information
indicative of a sensed parameter via a feedback loop that includes one or more sensors 22
mounted in or on the device 10. Thus, in response to feedback from one or more sensors 22
                                                    12

      WO 2014/100157                                                          PCT/US2013/076084
implanted with the device 10, the controller 36 can start or stop the flow of fluid to the device 10,
increase or decrease the pressure at which fluid is supplied to the device 10, etc. In one
embodiment, the device 10 includes a pressure sensor 22 that measures a fluid pressure in the
vicinity of the device 10 and the controller 36 is configured to maintain the fluid supply pressure
at a substantially constant level based on feedback from the pressure sensor 22.
[0064] The device 10 can be used for CED of drugs to treat disorders of the brain, spine, ears,
neural tissue, or other parts of a human or animal body, When used in the brain, the device 10
can circumvent the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by infusing drugs under positive pressure directly
into tissue. The device 10 can provide a number of advantages, such as 1) a smaller cross
sectional area compared with conventional needles used in CED; 2) less disturbance to tissue
when inserted into the brain than conventional needles; 3) the reduction or elimination of
backflow or reflux along the outside of the inserted part, which in turn, permits higher rates of
drug delivery in the device 10 compared with conventional needles; 4) minimal or no occlusion
of the fluid delivery conduit 12 during insertion into the brain; 5) multiple lumens can be
provided through the fluid conduit 12, each conducting a distinct fluid (drug), which allows
simultaneous, sequential, or programmed delivery of multiple agents; 6) the device 10 has the
potential to serve simultaneously as a drug delivery system and as a sensor-equipped probe to
measure local tissue characteristics such as, but not limited to, pressure, pH, ion-specific
concentrations, location, and other parameters; and 7) the device 10 allows for directional control
of the drug release pattern.
[0065] In use, as described further below, the device 10 can be functionally attached to the distal
end of a long, thin insertion vehicle such as a cannula or a needle in or on which a fluid
attachment can be made to the fluid inlet port of the device's fluid conduit 12. This can be
especially advantageous in applications involving penetration of relatively thick tissue, e.g.,
insertion through a human skull.
[0066] In addition to delivering a drug-containing fluid, the device 10 can also be used to deliver
enzymes or other materials to modify tissue permeability and improve drug distribution in the
targeted tissue, For example, penetration of drug-containing nanoparticles into brain tissue can
be enhanced by enzymatic digestion of at least one brain extracellular matrix component and
intracranial infusion of the nanoparticle into the brain tissue. In another embodiment, at least
                                                  13

     WO 2014/100157                                                            PCT/US2013/076084
one enzyme can be immobilized to a surface of the nanoparticle during the step of enzymatic
digestion. The device 10 can provide the ability to deliver enzymatic and/or other materials that
can, e.g., modify the drug delivery site, and therapeutic materials, in virtually any order,
sequencing, and/or timing without the need to use different delivery devices and the potential
complications involved in doing so.
[0067] The device 10 can also be used to biopsy tissue, for example by passing a stylet or a
grasping tool through the fluid conduit 12 to a target site and then withdrawing the stylet or
grasping tool from the target site with a biopsy specimen therein. In some embodiments, the
fluid conduit 12 can have a larger-diameter lumen extending therethrough for biopsy purposes,
with smaller fluid lumens formed therearound.
[0068] The device 10 can be used to deliver a drug-containing fluid under positive pressure to a
target tissue region. FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary method for convection-enhanced delivery of
a drug to target tissue 40 in a patient's brain. After appropriate site preparation and cleaning, a
tissue opening can formed through the patient's scalp and skull to expose the brain tissue 40.
Before or after forming the tissue opening, a pedestal can optionally be mounted to the patient to
support the device 10 while it is inserted, which can be particularly useful in long-term
implantations.
[0069] The device 10 can optionally be coupled to a cannula (not shown) with a microfabricated
interface for mating with the device 10. Any of a variety of cannulas can be used, including
standard cannulas configured to mate to a stereotactic frame in guided surgery. In some
embodiments, the cannula can include a flexible catheter suitable for extended (e.g., 30 day)
implantation. The catheter can be about 15 cm long and about 2 cm in diameter. The cannula
can include a tubing portion that is approximately 6 feet in length with connectors for fluid and
biosensor interface at the proximal end.
[0070] The device 10 can be advanced through the tissue opening and into the brain tissue 40.
As shown, the tissue-receiving space 18 can be configured to compress or pinch tissue received
therein as the device 10 is advanced through the tissue 40. Tissue compressed by the tissue
receiving space 18 can form a seal that reduces proximal backflow of fluid ejected from the
outlet 20 of the fluid conduit 12 beyond the tissue-receiving space 18. In particular, as fluid
                                                  14

      WO 2014/100157                                                           PCT/US2013/076084
ejected from the outlet 20 of the fluid conduit 12 flows back proximally between the exterior
surface of the fluid conduit 12 and the surrounding tissue 40, it encounters a shoulder of tissue 38
that is compressed into the tissue-jeceiving space 18. Compression of the tissue 38 against the
walls of the tissue-receiving space 18 forms a seal that resists flow of the fluid further in the
proximal direction, thereby reducing or preventing undesirable backflow of injected fluid away
from the target region of the tissue.
[0071] As explained above, the device 10 can include a support scaffold to facilitate penetration
through the brain tissue towards the target region. One or more radiopaque markers can be
included in the device 10 to permit radiographic imaging (e.g., to confirm proper placement of
the device 10 within or in proximity to the target tissue). In embodiments in which a degradable
scaffold is used, the scaffold can degrade shortly after insertion to leave behind only the fluid
conduit 12 and outer sheath 14. In some embodiments, the fluid conduit 12 and/or the sheath 14
can be flexible to permit the device 10 to move with the brain tissue 40 if the brain tissue 40
shifts within the skull. This can advantageously prevent localized deformation of brain tissue
adjacent to the device 10 that might otherwise occur with a rigid device. Such deformation can
lead to backflow of the pressurized fluid along the surface of the device, undesirably preventing
the fluid from reaching the target tissue.
[0072] Once the device 10 is positioned within or adjacent to the target tissue, injected media
(e.g., a drug-containing fluid) can be supplied under positive pressure to the device 10 through its
fluid inlet port(s). The injected media then flows through the fluid conduit 12 and is expelled
under pressure from the outlet port(s) 20 in the target region of tissue. The delivery profile can
be adjusted by varying parameters such as outlet port size, outlet port shape, fluid conduit size,
fluid conduit shape, fluid supply pressure, fluid velocity, etc. In some embodiments, the device
10 can be configured to deliver fluid at a flow rate between about 5     1 per minute and about 20
pl per minute. In some embodiments, the device 10 can be configured to deliver 50-100 P1 per
minute per channel, and each channel can be configured to support greater than 100 psi of
pressure,
[0073] In some embodiments, prior to injecting the drug-containing fluid, a gel or other material
can be injected through the device 10 to augment the tissue seal. For example, a sealing gel can
be injected through the device 10 and allowed to flow back along the exterior of the device,
                                                  15

filling and sealing any voids that may exist between the device and the surrounding tissue,
particularly within the tissue-receiving recess 18. Exemplary sealing materials include
cyanoacrylate, protein glues, tissue sealants, coagulative glues (e.g., fibrin/thrombin/protein
based coagulative glues), and materials such as those disclosed in U.S. Publication No.

BIORESORBABLE ADHESIVE," the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by

[0074] It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the methods and devices disclosed herein
can provide convection-enhanced delivery of functional agents directly to target tissue within a
patient with little or no backflow. This convection-enhanced delivery can be used to treat a
broad spectrum of diseases, conditions, traumas, ailments, etc. The term "drug" as used herein
refers to any functional agent that can be delivered to a human or animal patient, including
hormones, stem cells, gene therapies, chemicals, compounds, small and large molecules, dyes,
antibodies, viruses, therapeutic agents, etc.
[0075] In some embodiments, central-nervous-system (CNS) neoplasm can be treated by
delivering an antibody (e.g., an anti-epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor monoclonal
antibody) or a nucleic acid construct (e.g., ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) agents, antisense
oligonucleotide, or an adenovirus, adeno-associated viral vector, or other viral vectors) to
affected tissue. Epilepsy can be treated by delivering an anti-convulsive agent to a target region
within the brain. Parkinson's disease can be treated by delivering a protein such as glial cell
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to the brain. Huntington's disease can be treated by
delivering a nucleic acid construct such as a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) agent or an
antisense oligonucleotide to the brain. Neumtrophin can be delivered to the brain under positive
pressure to treat stroke. A protein such as a lysosomal enzyme can be delivered to the brain to
treat lysosomal storage disease. Alzheimer's disease can be treated by delivering anti-amyloids
and/ornerve growth factor (NGF) under positive pressure to the brain. Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis can be treated by delivering a protein such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) under positive pressure to the brain, spinal canal, or
elsewhere in the central nervous system. Chronic brain injury can be treated by delivering a
                                                  16

     WO 2014/100157                                                            PCT/US2013/076084
protein such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and/or fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
under positive pressure to the bi-ain.
[0076] It will be appreciated that use of the devices disclosed herein and the various associated
treatment methods is not limited to the brain of a patient. Rather, these methods and devices can
be used to deliver a drug to any portion of a patient's body, including the spine. By way of
further example, balance or hearing disorders can be treated by injecting a drug-containing fluid
directly into a portion of a patient's ear. Any of a variety of drugs can be used to treat the ear,
including human atonal gene. The methods and devices disclosed herein can also be used to
deliver therapeutics (such as stem cells) to a fetus or to a patient in which the fetus is disposed.
The methods and devices disclosed herein can be used to treat a cavernous malformation, for
example by delivering one or more antiangiogenesis factors thereto.
[0077] Any of the various treatments described herein can further include delivering a cofactor
to the target tissue, such as a corticosteroid impregnated in the device, a corticosteroid coated
onto the device, and/or a propagation enhancing enzyme. In addition, any of the various
treatments described herein can further include long-term implantation of the device (e.g., for
several hours or days) to facilitate long-term treatments and therapies.
[0078] A number of variations on the device 10 are set forth below. Except as indicated, the
structure and operation of these variations is identical to that of the device 10, and thus a detailed
description is omitted here for the sake of brevity.
[0079] In some embodiments, the device 10 can include a plurality of tissue-receiving spaces
 18. FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment with a first tissue-receiving space 18A and a second tissue
receiving space 18B. As shown, a first outer sheath 14A is disposed over the fluid conduit 12 to
define the first tissue-receiving space 18A. A second outer sheath 14B is disposed over the first
outer sheath 14A to define the second tissue-receiving space 18B. Specifically, the second
tissue-receiving space 18B is formed between an exterior surface of the first outer sheath 14A
and an interior surface of the distal end 16B of the second outer sheath 14B. While two tissue
receiving spaces are shown, it will be appreciated that any number of tissue-receiving spaces can
be provided (e.g., three, four, five, or more) by adding additional sheath layers. A single sheath
layer can also be configured to provide multiple tissue-receiving spaces, for example by forming
                                                   17

      WO 2014/100157                                                            PCT/US2013/076084
the sheath layer with one or more stepped regions, each stepped region defining a tissue
receiving space therein. Multi-stage devices such as that shown in FIG. 5 can provide additional
sealing regions proximal to the distal-most, primary sealing region. The provision of these
secondary, tertiary, etc. sealing regions can augment the primary seal or act as a backup in case
the primary seal is compromised.
[0080] As shown in FIGS. 6A-6C, the internal wall of the distal end 16 of the outer sheath 14
can be shaped to alter the dimensions of the tissue-receiving space 18 and the type of seal
provided when tissue is compressed therein. FIG. 6A illustrates a device 100 in which the
interior surface of the distal end 116 of the sheath 114 has a concave curvature. FIG. 6B
illustrates a device 200 in which the interior surface of the distal end 216 of the sheath 214 is
conical. FIG. 6C illustrates a device 300 in which the interior surface of the distal end 316 of the
sheath 314 has a convex curvature. These configurations can provide for a sharper leading edge
at the periphery of the sheath as compared with the cylindrical tissue-receiving space 18 of the
device 10, and can increase the amount of tissue compressed into or pinched/pinned by the
tissue-receiving space, as well as the degree of compression. A more-robust seal can thus be
obtained in some instances using the configurations of FIGS. 6A-6C. It should be noted,
however, that even in the case of a cylindrical tissue-receiving space, the leading edge of the
sheath can be sharpened to deflect tissue into the tissue-receiving space and thereby form a
better seal. The size and shape of the tissue-receiving space can be selected based on a variety of
parameters, including the type of tissue in which the device is to be inserted. In embodiments
with a plurality of tissue-receiving spaces, each of the tissue receiving spaces can have the same
configuration (e.g., all cylindrical, all conical, all convex, or all concave). Alternatively, one or
more of the plurality of tissue-receiving spaces can have a different configuration. Thus, for
example, one or more tissue-receiving spaces can be cylindrical while one or more other tissue
receiving spaces am convex.
[0081] The tissue-receiving recesses of the devices disclosed herein can include various surface
features or treatments to enhance the seal formed between the device and the surrounding tissue
or gel. For example, the tissue-receiving recesses can be coated with a biocompatible adhesive
or can have a textured surface to form a tighter seal with the tissue or gel.

[0082] FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a CED device 400 that generally includes
a fluid conduit in the form of a micro-tip 412 and an outer sheath 414. The micro-tip 412
includes a substrate 442, which can be formed from a variety of materials, including silicon. The
substrate 442 can have any of a variety of cross-sectional shapes, including a square or
rectangular cross-section as shown. One or more fluid channels 444 can be formed on the
substrate 442. The fluid channels 444 can be formed from a variety of materials, including
parylene. Additional details on the structure, operation, and manufacture of microfabricated tips
such as that shown in FIG. 7 can be found in U.S. Publication No. 2013/0035560, filed on
August 1, 2012, entitled "MULTI-DIRECTIONAL MICROFLUIDIC DRUG DELIVERY
DEVICE," the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0083] The outer sheath 414 can be disposed coaxially over the micro-tip 412 so as to form a
tissue-receiving space 418 therebetween. In some embodiments, the micro-tip 412 can have a
substantially rectangular exterior cross-section and the outer sheath 414 can have a substantially
cylindrical interior cross-section. In other embodiments, the micro-tip 412 and the outer sheath
414 can have corresponding cross-sectional shapes with a clearance space defined therebetween.
The proximal end of the outer sheath 414 can be coupled to a catheter 446. The catheter 446 can
be rigid or flexible, or can include rigid portions and flexible portions. A nose portion 448
(sometimes referred to herein as a "bullet nose" or a "bullet nose portion") can be disposed
between the outer sheath 414 and the catheter 446, or can be disposed over a junction between
the outer sheath 414 and the catheter 446. As shown, the nose portion 448 can taper from a
reduced distal diameter corresponding to the outside diameter of the sheath 414 to an enlarged
proximal diameter corresponding to the outside diameter of the catheter 446, The tapered
transition provided by the nose portion 448 can advantageously provide stress-relief as it can act
as a smooth transition from the sheath 414 to the catheter body 446, avoiding any uneven
stresses on the surrounding tissue that may create paths for fluid backflow. The nose portion 448
can be conically tapered, as shown, or can taper along a convex or concave curve. Various
compound shapes can also be used that include conical portions, convex portions, and/or
concave portions. The nose portion 448 can also be replaced with a blunt shoulder that extends
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the device 400. Any of a variety of taper angles can be
used for the nose portion 448. For example the nose portion 448 can taper at an angle in a range
of about 10 degrees to about 90 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the device 400, in a
                                                   19

range of about 20 degrees to about 70 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the device,
and/or in a range of about 30 degrees to about 50 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the
device. For example, the nose portion 446 can taper at an angle of appi-oximately 33 degr-ees
relative to the longitudinal axis of the device 400. In some embodiments, additional sheaths can
be provided, e.g., as described above with respect to FIG. 5.
[0084] As shown in FIG. 8, the catheter 446 can include length markings or graduations 450 to
indicate the insertion depth of the device 400. In some embodiments, the catheter 446 can be a
straight rigid catheter sized and configured for acute stereotactic targeting. The catheter 446 can
be formed from any of a variety of materials, including flexible materials, rigid materials,
ceramics, plastics, polymeric materials, PEEK, polyurethane, etc. and combinations thereof. In
an exemplary embodiment, the catheter 446 has length of about 10 cm to about 40 cm, e.g.,
about 25 cm. The catheter 446 can include one or more fluid lines extending therethrough. The
fluid lines can be defined by the catheter body itself or can be defined by one or more inner
sleeves or linings disposed within the catheter body. Any of a variety of materials can be used to
form the inner sleeves or linings, such as flexible materials, rigid materials, polyimide, pebax,
PEEK, polyurethane, silicone, fused silica tubing, etc. and combinations thereof
[0085] As shown in FIG. 9, one or more standard Luer or other connectors 452 can be coupled
to the proximal end of the catheter 446 to facilitate connection with a fluid delivery system of the
type shown in FIG. 3. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 400 includes two connectors
452, one for each of the two fluid channels formed in the catheter 446 and the micro-tip 412. It
will be appreciated, however, that any number of fluid channels and coresponding proximal
catheter connectors can be provided. The system 400 can also include a collar 454 disposed over
the catheter 446 to act as a depth stop for setting the desired insertion depth and preventing over
insertion. The collar 454 can be longitudinally slidable with respect to the catheter 446 and can
include a thumb screw 456 for engaging the catheter to secure the collar in a fixed longitudinal
position with respect thereto. The system 400 can also include a tip protector 458 for preventing
damage to the micro-tip 412 during insertion into steremotactic frame fixtures. Exemplary tip
protectors are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/835,905, filed on June 17, 2013,

[0086] As shown in FIG. 10, the system 400 can include a length of extension tubing 460 to
provide a fluid pathway between the proximal connectors 452 of the catheter 446 and a fluid
delivery system of the type shown in FIG. 3. In the illustrated embodiment, dual-channel peel
away extension lines 460 are shown. In an exemplary method of using the system 400, an
incision can be formed in a patient and the catheter 446 can be inserted through the incision and
implanted in a target region of tissue (e.g., a region of the patient's brain or central nervous
system). The catheter 446 can be left in the target region for minutes, hours, days, weeks,
months, etc. In the case of a flexible catheter 446, the proximal end of the catheter can be
tunneled under the patient's scalp with the proximal connectors 452 extending out from the
incision. The catheter 446 can be inserted through a sheath to keep the catheter stiff and straight
for stereotactic targeting. Alternatively, or in addition, a stylet can be inserted through the
catheter to keep the catheter stiff and straight for stereotactic targeting. In some embodiments,
the stylet can be inserted through an auxiliary lumen formed in the catheter such that the primary
fluid delivery lumen(s) can be primed with fluid during catheter insertion. Thus, in the case of a
catheter with first and second fluid lumens, a third lumen can be included for receiving the stylet.
[0087] FIG. I1 is a close-up view of the exemplary micro-tip 412. As shown, the micro-tip 412
generally includes a central body portion 462 with first and second legs or tails 464 extending
proximally therefrom and a tip portion 466 extending distally therefrom. First and second
microfluidic channels 444 are formed in or on the mico-tip 412 such that they extend along the
proximal legs 464, across the central body portion 462, and down the distal tip portion 466. The
channels 444 can each include one or more fluid inlet ports (e.g., at the proximal end) and one or
more fluid outlet ports (e.g., at the distal end). As noted above, additional details on the
structure, operation, and manufacture of microfabricated tips such as that shown in FIG. 11 can
be found in U.S. Publication No. 2013/0035560, filed on August 1, 2012, entitled "MULTL
DIRECTIONAL MICROFLUIDIC DRUG DELIVERY DEVICE," the entire contents of which
are incorporated herein by reference.
[0088] Systems and methods for manufacturing and/or assembling the CED device 400 are
shown in FIGS. 12-15. Generally speaking. after the micro-tip 412 is fabricated, it can be
positioned in a molding or casting system to couple the one or more sheaths 414 to the micro-tip,
                                                   21

     WO 2014/100157                                                          PCT/US2013/076084
to form the nose portion 448, and/or to couple fluid lines in the catheter 446 to the fluid channels
444 of the micro-tip.
[0089] FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a molding system 500. The system 500
includes a base plate 502 with a ci-adle 504 in which a proximal portion of the catheter 446 is
supported. Upper and lower mold blocks 506, 508 are coupled to the base plate 502 by a
clamping block 510 with one or more screws 512. The screws 512 can be tightened to lock the
mold blocks 506, 508 in position during an injection process and can be removed to allow the
mold blocks to be opened for insertion or removal of the CED device components. The system
500 also includes an inlet port 514 through which flowable material can be injected, pumped, etc.
into the mold.
[0090] As shown in FIGS. 13-15, the lower mold block 508 includes a recess in which the lower
half of the catheter body 446 can be disposed and a recess in which the lower half of the sheath
414 can be disposed. A mold cavity 516 which is substantially a negative of the lower half of the
nose portion 448 is formed between the recesses. The recesses can be sized such that the
catheter body 446 and the sheath 414 form a seal with the mold block 508 to prevent flowable
material injected into the mold cavity 516 from escaping. One or more injection ports or
channels 514 are formed in the mold block 508 to allow flowable material to be injected into the
cavity 516. While not shown, it will be appreciated that the upper mold block 506 is configured
in a similar manner to the lower mold block 508, with recesses that can receive the upper halves
of the catheter body 446 and the sheath 414 and a mold cavity 516 which is substantially a
negative of the upper half of the nose portion 448.
[0091] In use, the micro-tip 412 is positioned such that the proximal legs 464 are disposed
within respective fluid lines formed in the catheter body 446 and such that the distal tip portion
466 of the micro-tip is positioned within the inner lumen of the sheath 414. As noted above, in
some embodiments, the catheter fluid lines can be formed by inner linings (e.g., fused silica
tubes) encased in an outer housing (e.g., a ceramic housing) that defines the catheter body 446.
The inner linings can prevent leaks and hold the catheter body 446 together in the event that the
outer housing is cracked or damaged. The micro-tip 412, catheter body 446, and sheath 414 are
sandwiched between the upper and lower mold blocks 506, 508 and a flowable material is
injected through the mold channels 514 to form the nose portion 448 within the mold cavity 516,

and to couple the fluid lines in the catheter 446 to the fluid channels 444 of the micro-tip.
Exemplary flowable materials include UV resins, polymers such as polyurethanes, acrylics,
PTFE, ePTFE, polyesters, and so forth.
[0092] The flowable material can be injected at low rates to fill the cavity 516. In embodiments
in which UV resin is used, the upper and lower mold blocks 506, 508 can be made of a clear
material to allow UV light to cure the UV resin. As the UV resin is injected into the micro-mold
cavity 516, it can start to wick/flow up over the micro-tip tails 464 and under the fluid lines that
sit over the tails. Once the resin flows into the fluid lines, it can be flashed with UV light to
"freeze" it in place and avoid wicking/flowing too much (and not completely encapsulating the
tails 464 and the inlet holes on the tips of the tails). After the material cures, the mold blocks
506, 508 can be separated and the CED device 400 can be removed from the molding system
500.
[0093] It will be appreciated that the above systems and methods can be varied in a number of
ways without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the molding
process can be used only for coupling the fluid lines, and the bullet nose portion can be formed
using a different process once the fluid connections are made. Also, while wicking is described
herein as the mechanism by which the fluid line bonds are formed, it will be appreciated that
these bonds can also be controlled by fill pressure, timing, and other molding variables. The
bullet nose can be over-molded directly onto the micro-tip. While an exemplary micro-tip and
an exemplary catheter body are shown, it will be appreciated that the micro-molding methods
and devices disclosed herein can be used with any of a variety of tips and/or catheters,
[0094] Alternative systems and methods for manufacturing and/or assembling the CED device
400 are shown in FIGS. 16-21. As shown in FIGS. 16-19, the bullet nose and the one or more
sheaths or over tubes can be assembled separately using an over-molding process as described
below to create a molded part 470. To assemble the system 400, the proximal legs 464 of the
micro-tip 412 are inserted into the distal end of the catheter body 446 (e.g., by inserting each leg
into a respective lining disposed within an outer catheter housing). A flowable material (e.g., an
adhesive such as a UV curable adhesive) can then be applied to the legs 464 to bond the fluid
channels on each leg to a corresponding fluid line of the catheter body 446. The molded part 470
can then be slid over the distal end of the micro-tip 412 such that the central body portion 462 of
                                                    23

     WO 2014/100157                                                           PCT/US2013/076084
the micro-tip is disposed in a hollow interior of the molded part and such that the tip portion 466
of the micro-tip extends through the molded part and protrudes from the distal end thereof.
[0095] The molded part 470 can include a shoulder that defines a proximal male portion 472
that mates into a female counterbore 474 formed in the distal tip of the catheter body 446.
Alternatively, the catheter body 446 can define a male portion and the molded part 470 can
include a female counterbore. It will also be appreciated that other ways of mating the catheter
body 446 to the molded part 470 can be used, such as a threaded interface, a snap-fit interface, a
key and slot interface, or any other interlocking interface that provides alignment and/or overlap
between the molded part and the catheter body. In some embodiments, the counterbore 474 can
be formed by machining a recess into the distal end of a ceramic catheter body 446. The inner
linings of the catheter can then be inserted into the cer-amic outer housing such that the terminal
ends of the inner linings are flush with the floor of the counterbore 474. The molded part 470
can be attached to the catheter body 446 using a flowable material (e.g., a UV adhesive), which
can be applied to the counterbore 474 and/or the male portion 472 prior to assembling the
components or which can be applied through one or more openings 476 formed in the sidewall of
the molded part after the components are assembled or dry fit. The flowable material is allowed
to cure to form a seal between the fluid lines and to secure the components of the CED device
400 to one another.
[0096] An exemplary over-molding system 600 for forming the bullet nose and coupling the
bullet nose to one or more over-tubes to form the molded part 470 is shown in FIG. 20. The
molding system 600 includes upper and lower plates 602, 604 that sandwich the one or more
over-tubes and together define a negative of the bullet nose. The plates 602, 604 also define a
plug for forming the bullet nose as a hollow structure which can later be filled as described
above during final assembly. A flowable material can be injected through injection ports 606
formed in the plates 602, 604 using a syringe or pump to form the hollow bullet nose over the
one or more over-tubes. In some embodiments, the flowable material is a hot resin injected
under pressure which forms a strong hold with the over-tube upon curing, The over-tube can be
formed from any of a variety of materials, including fused silica tubing.
[0097] A scale drawing of an exemplary molded part 470 is shown with representative
dimensions in FIG. 21. Any of the nose portions and/or sheaths described herein can be formed
                                                  24

     WO 2014/100157                                                          PCT/US2013/076084
to the same or similar external dimensions. Unless otherwise indicated, the dimensions shown in
FIG. 21 are specified in inches.
[0098] FIGS. 22-23 illustrate exemplary results of a gel study conducted by infusing dye
through a CED device of the type described herein having first and second fluid channels into a
gel designed to simulate tissue. As shown in FIG. 22, little or no backflow occurs at flowrates of
5, 10, and 12 pLI/min (total flowrate of both channels combined). As shown in FIG. 23, a
flowrate of 5 pL/min resulted in a uniform distribution of the dye over time with little or no
backflow.
[0099] FIGS. 24-29 illustrate exemplary results of an animal study conducted using an in-vivo
pig model in which multiple anatomies were infused using CED devices of the type described
herein. Little or no backflow along the catheter track was observed at flow rates which are much
higher than typical clinical flow rates for CED. The study demonstrated the capability to infuse
small, medium, and large molecules using CED devices of the type disclosed herein, and
confirmed the functionality of independent flow channels. No blockages or introduction of air
bubbles occurred during a multi-hour acute infusion. The device was found to be compatible
with magnetic resonance imaging and other stereotactic surgical procedures. No leaks, bond
breakages, or other catheter issues were observed.
[00100] As shown in FIG. 24, when inserted into a pig brain, the ceramic catheter body and the
bullet nose appear as a thick black line in a magnetic resonance (MR) image, Infused
gadolinium (Gd) appears as a bright cloud in the MR image. The micro-tip is not readily visible
in the MR image due to its small size.
[00101] FIG. 25 illustrates a series of MR images showing infusion of gadolinium into white
matter of a pig's brain at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 ptUmin. As shown, no backflow of
infusate occurs along the ceramic catheter shaft track. When the infusion cloud becomes too
large, the infusate overflows into surrounding anatomy, rather than flowing back along the
catheter track, highlighting the capability for the system to reduce or prevent backflow. While
flow rates of up to 20 [iUmin are shown, it is expected that similar results would be obtained for
flow rates of 30 lJmin or more. These higher flow rates could not be tested during the animal
study because the subject brain(s) became saturated with gadolinium.

      WO 2014/100157                                                         PCT/US2013/076084
[001021 FIG. 26 illustrates a series of MR images showing infusion of gadolinium into the
thalamus of a pig's brain at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 pUmin. As shown, no backflow of
infusate occurs along the ceramic catheter shaft track. While there is slight backflow across the
bullet nose at approximately 20 L/min, this is a flowi-ate that is significantly higher than typical
clinical CED flowrates (generally about 5 pUmin).
[001031 FIG. 27 illustrates a series of MR images showing infusion of gadolinium into the
putamen of a pig's brain at flow rates of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15   Umin. As shown, no backflow of
infusate occurs along the ceramic catheter shaft track as the infusate stays spherical throughout
the ramped infusion.
[00104] The above-described backflow study showed that there is minimal backflow along the
catheter shaft at high flow rates (up to 20pUmin for white matter, 5-20pUI1min for the thalamus,
and 5-15ItUmin for the putamen). These flow jates are much higher than typical clinical CED
flow rates (e.g., about 5 pUmin). The determination as to whether backflow occurred was made
using a 3D analysis of the infusion, not solely based on the MR images included herein. In a
total of eleven infusions conducted in various anatomies, zero incidences of backflow were
observed.
[00105] FIG. 28 illustrates a series of MR images showing infusion of gadolinium into the white
matter of a pig's brain at a flow rate of 5 gUmin after infusion periods of 1, 9, 16, 24, and 50
minutes, The lower set of images includes a distribution overlay, As shown, a uniform
distribution with no backflow is observed even for long-duration infusions and when a large
volume of infusate is delivered. Similar results were observed in infusions into the thalamus and
putamen of the pig's brain.
[001061 FIG. 29 illustrates an MR image and an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) image of the
thalamus of a pig's brain when a CED device of the type described herein is used to
simultaneously infuse galbumin (gadolinium-labeled albumin laced with europium) through a
first fluid channel and IVIS dye through a second fluid channel. As shown, the two different
infusates were successfully infused from the two independent channels. A uniform distribution
of the two infusates indicates mixing at the tip outlet as desired. No evidence of subarachnoid
leakage was observed. This demonstrates that the system can be used to deliver Gd tracer and a
                                                   26

     WO 2014/100157                                                           PCT/US2013/076084
drug or other molecule while monitoring the Gd tracer under MR to monitor the distribution of
the drug or other molecule.
[00107] FIGS. 30-31 illustrate comparisons between measurements taken with CED devices of
the type described herein and simulated measurements for a traditional 0.3 mm catheter. As
shown in FIG. 30, CED devices of the type described herein achieve a more uniform
concentration of infused colloidal Gd in white matter than traditional 0.3 mm catheters. As
shown in FIG. 31, when using CED devices of the type described herein, extracellular expansion
of white matter tissue is confined to the tip area by the bullet nose and tube-step, which prevents
backflow along the catheter track. With traditional 0.3 mm catheters, on the other hand,
increased extracellular expansion occurs along the catheter track due to the infusion pressure and
backflow results.
[00108] The above-described infusion studies showed that 150 pLof infusate could be delivered
into white matter and thalamus with no backflow along the catheter track. It also showed that
the concentration profile of infusate distribution in tissue was within typical ranges for
intraparenchymal drug delivery. Successful colloidal Gd (large molecule 30-50 nm) infusion
was also demonstrated.
[00109] The devices disclosed herein can be manufactured using any of a variety of techniques.
For example, the devices can be manufactured by assembling lengths of tubing over one another,
by micro-machining lengths of tubing, by molding steps or nose features containing tissue
receiving spaces onto a fluid conduit, or by constructing one or more portions of the device on a
substrate using a lithographic microfabrication process.
