                                        ABSTRACT
   A method for interleaving bits of a codeword generated based on a quasi-cyclic
   low-density parity check coding scheme that includes a repeat-accumulate quasi-cyclic
 5 low-density parity check coding scheme, the method comprising: applying a cyclic
   block permutation process to a codeword made up of N cyclic blocks each of Q bits, to
   reorder the cyclic blocks in accordance with a cyclic block permutation rule defining a
   reordering of the cyclic blocks; applying a bit permutation process to the codeword
   after the cyclic block permutation process, to reorder the bits of the codeword in
10 accordance with a bit permutation rule defining a reordering of the bits; and dividing
   the codeword after the bit permutation process into a plurality of constellation words,
   each of the constellation words being made up of M bits.      N is not a multiple of M,
   and the bit permutation rule is a rule of applying a column-row permutation process
   equivalent to writing the bits of N' cyclic blocks into a matrix in a row direction and
15 reading from the matrix in a column direction, where the  Q bits in one cyclic block are
   written into a same row, the matrix has M rows, N'=N-X, and X is a remainder of N
   divided by M.

                 (Background Information)
                 Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the configuration of a transmitter 100 that
   includes a typical bit-interleaved coding and modulation (hereinafter, BICM) encoder.
 5 As shown, the transmitter 100 includes an input processor 110, a BICM encoder (in
   turn including a low-density parity check (hereinafter, LDPC) encoder 120, a bit
   interleaver 130, and a constellation mapper 140), and a modulator 150.
   [0014]
                 The input processor 110 converts an input bitstream into blocks of a
10 predetermined length.             The LDPC encoder 120 encodes the blocks into codewords
   using LDPC codes, and then transmits the codewords to the bit interleaver 130.              The
   bit interleaver 130 applies an interleaving process to each LDPC codeword, then
   divides each interleaved codeword into a sequence of cell words (i.e., constellation
   words).         The constellation mapper 140 maps each cell word (i.e., constellation word)
15 to a sequence of constellations (e.g., using QAM).         The generic modulator 150 at the
   output includes all processing blocks from the output of the BICM encoder to a radio
   frequency (hereinafter, RF) power amplifier.
   [0015]
                 An LDPC code is a linear error correcting code that is fully defined by a
20 parity-check matrix (hereinafter, PCM).           A PCM is a binary sparse matrix that
   represents the connection of codeword bits (hereinafter also termed variable nodes) to
   the parity checks (hereinafter also termed check nodes).        The columns and the rows of
   the PCM respectively correspond to the variable nodes and the check nodes.               In the
   PCM, a connection between a variable node and a check node is represented by a
25 one-element.
   [0016]
                 Quasi-cyclic low-density parity check (hereinafter, QC LDPC) codes are one
   variety of LDPC codes.             QC LDPC codes have a structure that is particularly suited to
                                                   10
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   hardware implementation.                   In fact, most standards in use today employ QC LDPC
   codes.        The PCM of a QC LDPC code has a special configuration made up of a
   plurality of circulant matrices.               A circulant matrix is a square matrix in which each
   row is a cyclic shift of the elements in the previous row, and has one, two, or more
 5 folded diagonals.                 Each circulant matrix has a size of QxQ.     Here, Q represents  the
   cyclic factor of the QC LDPC.                       The above-described quasi-cyclic configuration
   allows       Q    check nodes to be processed in parallel, which is clearly beneficial for
   efficient hardware implementation.
   [0017]
10               Fig. 2 shows the PCM of a QC LDPC code having a cyclic factor               Q of eight,
   as an example.                 In Fig.2, as well as in later-described Figs. 3 and 5, the smallest
   squares each represent one element of the PCM, where the black squares are
   one-elements and all other squares are zero-elements.                  The PCM shown has circulant
   matrices with one or two folded diagonals apiece.                   This QC LDPC code encodes a
15 block of 8x6 = 48 bits into a codeword of 8x12 = 96 bits.                    Accordingly, the coding
   rate of the QC LDPC is 48/96 = 1/2. The codeword bits are divided into a plurality of
   blocks of Q bits each. The               Q bit blocks are hereinafter termed cyclic blocks (or cyclic
   groups) for this relation to the cyclic factor of Q.
   [0018]
20               A special variety of QC LDPC codes are repeat-accumulate quasi-cyclic
   low-density parity check (hereinafter, RA QC LDPC) codes.                    RA QC LDPC codes are
   well known as being easy to encode, and are therefore used in a wide variety of
   standards (e.g., in second-generation DVB standards, including DVB-S2, DVB-T2, and
   DVB-C2).               The right-hand side of the PCM corresponds to the parity bits.             The
25 one-elements therein are arranged in a staircase structure.               Fig. 3 shows an example of
   a PCM for a RA QC LDPC having a coding rate of 2/3.

 5 [0020]
                 By applying a simple row permutation to the PCM shown in Fig. 3, the
   quasi-cyclic structure of the RA QC LDPC codes is revealed, with the exception of the
   parity portion, shown in Fig. 4.             The row permutation is a simple change of the
   graphical representation having no influence on the code definition.
10 [0021]
                 The quasi-cyclic structure of the PCM parity portion is imparted by applying a
   suitable row permutation to only the parity bits of the PCM shown in Fig. 4.             This
   technique is widely known in the field and is used in standards such as DVB-T2, under
   the name of parity interleaving or of parity permutation.             Fig. 5 shows the PCM
15 obtained as a result of applying such parity permutation to the PCM shown in Fig. 4.
   [0022]
                 Typically, the bits of an LDPC codeword vary in importance, and the bits of a
   constellation vary in robustness level.          Mapping the bits of an LDPC codeword to a
   constellation directly, i.e., without interleaving, leads to suboptimal performance.
20 Thus, the bits of the LDPC codeword require interleaving prior to mapping onto
   constellations.
   [0023]
                 For this purpose, the bit interleaver 130 is provided between the LDPC
   encoder 120 and the constellation mapper 140, as shown in Fig. 1. By carefully
25 designing the bit interleaver 130, the association between the bits of the LDPC
   codeword and the bits encoded by the constellation is improved, leading to improved
   receiver performance.              Performance is typically measured using the bit-error rate
   (hereinafter, BER) as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (hereinafter, SNR).
                                                      12
    10047624_1(GHMatters) P95158.AU.2

   [0024]
                 The bits of the LDPC codeword differ in importance primarily because not all
   bits are necessarily involved in the same number of parity checks.                    The more parity
   checks (check nodes) a given codeword bit (variable node) is involved in, the more
 5 important the given codeword bit is in an iterative LDPC decoding process.                    A further
   reason is that the variable nodes each have different connectivity to the cycles of a
   Tanner graph representing the LDPC codes.                    Therefore, the codeword bits are likely
   to differ in importance despite being involved in the same number of parity checks.
   These ideas are well understood in the field.               As a rule, the importance of the variable
10 nodes increases as the number of check nodes connected therewith increases.
   [0025]
                 In the particular case of QC LDPC codes, all bits included in a cyclic block of
   Q bits       have the same number of parity checks applied thereto, and have the same
   connectivity to the cycles of the Tanner graph.                       Thus, all bits have the same
15 importance.
   [0026]
                 Similarly, the encoded bits of a constellation are widely known to have
   different levels of robustness.                For example, a quadrature amplitude modulation
   (hereinafter, QAM) constellation is made up of two independent pulse amplitude
20 modulation (hereinafter, PAM) symbols, one symbol corresponding to the real part and
   the other symbol corresponding to the imaginary part.                    The two PAM symbols each
   encode M bits.                Fig. 6 shows 8-PAM symbols using Gray encoding.           As shown, the
   bits encoded by in each PAM symbol vary in terms of level of robustness.                           The
   difference in robustness is a result of the distance between two subsets defined by each
25 bit (e.g., 0 or 1) being different for each of the bits.            The greater the distance, the more
   robust and reliable the bit.             Fig. 6 indicates that bit b3 has the highest robustness level,
   while bit bI has the lowest robustness level.
   [0027]
                                                           13
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

                 Thus, a 16-QAM constellation encodes four bits and has two robustness levels.
   Also, a 64-QAM constellation encodes six bits and has three robustness levels.
   Likewise, a 256-QAM constellation encodes eight bits and has four robustness levels.
   [0028]
 5               The following parameters are hereinafter used throughout the present
   description.
   [0029]
                 Cyclic factor: Q = 8
                Number of cyclic blocks per LDPC codeword: N= 12
10              Number of bits per constellation: M= 4 (i.e., 16-QAM)
                 Given the above parameters, the number of constellations to which each LDPC
   codeword is mapped is equal to QxN/M = 24.              Typically, the parameters  Q and N are
   selected such that QxN is equal to a multiple of M for all constellations supported by
   the system.

                 Fig. 7 is a block diagram showing the configuration of a typical interleaver
   when the above parameters are applied.             In Fig. 7, the 12 cyclic blocks are labeled
   QB1, ..., QB 12, and the 24 constellations are labeled Cl, ..., C24.          A bit interleaver
   710 interleaves the 96 bits of the LDPC codeword.
20 [0031]
                 A conventional bit interleaver is known from the DVB-T2 standard (see ETSI
   EN       302       755).          The DVB-T2 standard  is  a television   standard  presenting
   improvements over the DVB-T standard, and describes a second-generation baseline
   transmission system for digital television broadcasting.          The DVB-T2 standard gives
25 the details of a channel coding and modulation system for broadcast television services
   and generic data.

   DVB-T2 standard (i.e., a DVB-T2 modulator).            The DVB-T2 modulator 800 includes
   an input processor 810, a BICM encoder 820, a frame builder 830, and an OFDM
   generator 840.
   [0033]
 5               The input processor 810 converts an input bitstream into blocks of a
   predetermined length.             The BICM encoder 820 applies BICM processing to the input.
   The frame builder 830 uses input from the BICM encoder 820 and the like to generate
   a distribution frame structure in the DVB-T2 fonnat.             The OFDM generator 840
   performs pilot addition, fast Fourier transform application, guard interval insertion, and
10 the like on the distribution frame structure, then outputs a transmission signal in the
   DVB-T2 format.
   [0034]
                 The BICM used in the DVB-T2 standard is described in chapter 6 of the ETSI
   EN 302 755 standard.                The aforementioned standard is incorporated herein by
15 reference and explained below.
   [0035]
                 Fig. 8B is a block diagram showing the structure of the BICM encoder 820 in
   the DVB-T2 modulator 800 illustrated in Fig. 8A.          Fig. 8B omits outer BCH encoding,
   constellation rotation, the cell interleaver, the time interleaver, and the like.
20 [0036]
                 The BICM encoder 820 includes an LDPC encoder 821, a bit interleaver (in
   turn including a parity interleaver 822 and a column-row interleaver 823), a bit-to-cell
   demultiplexer 824, and a QAM mapper 825.
   [0037]
25               The LDPC encoder 821 encodes the blocks into codewords using LDPC codes.
   The bit interleaver (which includes the parity interleaver 822 and the column-row
   interleaver 823) performs interleaving on the bits of the codewords.           The bit-to-cell
   demultiplexer 824 demultiplexes the interleaved bits of the codewords into cell words
                                                    15

   (constellation words).              The QAM mapper 825 maps the cell words (constellation
   words) to complex QAM symbols.                   The complex QAM symbols are also termed cells.
   In fact, the bit-to-cell demultiplexer 824 may also be considered a part of the bit
   interleaver.             In such situations, the BICM encoder conforming to the DVB-T2
 5 standard may be considered to have the basic structure shown in Fig. 1.
   [0038]
                 The LDPC codes used in the DVB-T2 standard are RA QC LDPC codes
   having a cyclic factor of Q = 360.              Two codeword lengths are defined for the DVB-T2
   standard, one being 16200 bits and the other being 64800 bits.                        In the present
10 document, LDPC codes using a codeword length of 16200 bits are referred to as 16K
   codes (or as 16K LDPC codes), and LDPC codes having a codeword length of 64800
   bits are referred to as 64K codes (or as 64K LDPC codes).                    The number of cyclic
   blocks per codeword is 45 for the 16K codes and 180 for the 64K codes.                           The
   available codes corresponding to each block length (codeword length) are given in
15 Tables Al through A6 of ETSI EN 302 755 for the DVB-T2 standard.
   [0039]
                 The bit interleaver is used only for constellations larger than quadrature
   phase-shift keying constellations                (hereinafter, QPSK), and includes the parity
   interleaver 822, the column-row interleaver 823, and the bit-to-cell demultiplexer 824.
20 According to the DVB-T2 standard, the bit interleaver does not include the bit-to-cell
   demultiplexer 824.                However, the present document pertains to interleaving as applied
   to LDPC codes prior to constellation mapping.                 As such, the bit-to-cell demultiplexer
   824 is treated as a part of the bit interleaver.
   [0040]
25               The parity interleaver 822 performs parity permutation on the parity bits of
   each codeword so as to clarify the quasi-cyclic structure thereof, as described above
   (see Figs. 4 and 5).
   [0041]

                 Conceptually, the column-row interleaver 823 operates by writing the bits of
   each LDPC codeword column-wise in an interleaver matrix, then reading the bits
   row-wise.             The first bit of the LDPC codeword is written first, and is read first.
   After writing and before reading the LDPC codeword bits, the column-row interleaver
 5 823 cyclically shifts the columns of bits by a predetermined number of positions.
   This is termed column twisting in the DVB-T2 standard.          The number of columns Nc
   and the number of rows Nr in the interleaver matrix are given in Table 1 for several
   constellation sizes, according to the two aforementioned LDPC codeword lengths.

                 The number of columns Nc is twice the number of bits per constellation, with
   the exception of 16K codes with a 256-QAM constellation.              This exception occurs
   because the LDPC codeword length of 16200 is not a multiple of 16, i.e., is not twice
   the number of bits per 256-QAM constellation.
15 [0043]
                 The codeword bit writing process and bit reading process for 16K codes
   performed by the column-row interleaver 823 is illustrated in Figs. 9A and 9B for
   twelve columns, and in Figs. 1OA and 10B for eight columns.               Each of the small
   squares corresponds to one bit of the LDPC codeword.                 The blackened square
20 represents the first bit of the LDPC codeword.        The arrows indicate the order in which
   the bits are written to and read from the interleaver matrix.       For example, when the
   interleaver matrix has twelve columns, the codeword bits of the 16K code are written in
   the order given in Fig. 9A, namely (Row 1, Column 1), (Row 2, Column 1), ..., (Row

   Column 12), (Row 2, Column 1),          ... , (Row 1350, Column 12).    Figs. 9A, 9B, IA, and
    lOB do not illustrate the column twisting process.
 5 [0044]
                  Prior to QAM mapping, the bit-to-cell demultiplexer 824 demultiplexes the
   LDPC codewords to obtain a plurality of parallel bit streams.           The number of streams
   is twice the number of encoded bits M per QAM constellation, i.e., 2xM, with the
   exception of 16K LDPC codes with a 256-QAM constellation.                For 16K LDPC codes
10 with a 256-QAM constellation, the number of streams equal to the number of encoded
   bits M per QAM constellation.          The M encoded bits per constellation are referred to as
   one cell word (constellation word).             For the 16K LDPC codes, the number of cell
   words per codeword is 16200/M, as given below.
   [0045]
15                8100 cells for QPSK,
                  4050 cells for 16-QAM,
                  2700 cells for 64-QAM, and
                  2025 cells for 256-QAM.
                  According to Table 1, given above, the number of parallel streams is equal to
20 the number of columns in the column-row interleaver for constellations larger than
   QPSK.            The bit-to-cell demultiplexers corresponding to 16-QAM constellations,
   64-QAM constellations, and 256-QAM constellations for 16K LDPC codes are
   respectively shown in Figs. 11, 12, and 13.              The bit notation used is that of the
   DVB-T2 standard.
25 [0046]
                  As shown in Fig. 11 (and Figs. 12 and 13), the bit-to-cell demultiplexer 824
   includes a simple demultiplexer 1110 (also 1210, 1310) and a demux permutator 1120
   (also 1220, 1320).
                                                      18

   [0047]
                 In addition to having the simple demultiplexer 1110 (1210, 1310) simply
   demultiplex the LDPC codewords, to which interleaving has been applied, the
   bit-to-cell demultiplexer 824 also has the demux permutator 1120 (1220, 1320)
 5 perform a permutation on the demultiplexed parallel bit streams.
   [0048]
                 However, when the column-row interleaver is used (i.e., for 16-QAM
   constellations or larger), the permutation applied to the bit streams is identical to a
   permutation applied to the columns of the column-row interleaver due to the number of
10 parallel bit streams being equal to the number of columns.               Therefore, the permutation
   performed by the bit-to-cell demultiplexer 824 is regarded as a part of the bit
   interleaver.
   [0049]
                 The bit interleaver used in the DVB-T2 standard essentially has two problems.
15 [0050]
                 The first problem is that parallelism is impaired when the number of cyclic
   blocks in the LDPC codeword is not a multiple of the number of columns in the bit
   interleaver matrix.                Reduced parallelism leads to increased latency.          This is
   especially problematic when iterative BICM decoding is used by the receiver.                   This
20 situation occurs for several combinations of LDPC codeword length and constellation
   size in the DVB-T2 standard.
   [0051]
                 Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate the aforementioned situation for 16K LDPC code
   cases where the interleaver matrix has eight and twelve columns, respectively.                Eight
25 columns are used in the interleaver matrix for 16-QAM constellations and 256-QAM
   constellations.               Twelve columns are used in the interleaver matrix for 64-QAM
   constellations.              In Figs. 14 and 15, the grid represents an LDPC codeword, the small
   squares each represent one bit of the LDPC codeword, the rows correspond to the
                                                          19
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   cyclic blocks, and the columns correspond to bits of the same bit index within a cyclic
   block.         The blackened squares represent eighth and twelfth bits of the first row in the
   interleaver matrix.                For ease of comprehension, the number of bits per cyclic block
   has been reduced from 360 to 72.                 However, this does not affect the understanding.
 5 [0052]
                  The second problem is that, in the DVB-T2 standard, the number of possible
   bit interleaver configurations is limited by the number of columns in the bit interleaver
   matrix.
   [0053]
10                A further problem of the DVB-T2 bit interleaver is that the regularity and
   parallelism of the permutation is impaired by the column twisting process.                  Figs. 16
   and 17 respectively illustrate the same situations as Figs. 14 and 15, with the addition
   of the column twisting process.                When the interleaver matrix has eight columns for the
    16K LDPC codes, the column twisting values for the columns of the DVB-T2 bit
15 interleaver are (0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 20, 20, 21).             Similarly, when the interleaver matrix has
   twelve columns for the 16K LDPC codes, the column twisting values for the columns
   of the DVB-T2 bit interleaver are (0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 7).
   [0054]
                  Accordingly, a bit interleaver that reduces latency while improving parallelism
20 is desired.            These properties are particularly important in iterative BICM decoding.
   [0055]
                  (Experimenter Discoveries)
                  The inventor has discovered, as the fruit of prolonged experimentation, that an
   interleaver satisfying the following two conditions is extremely efficient.
25 [0056]
                  (Condition 1)
                  The M bits of each constellation are each mapped to one of M different cyclic
   blocks of the LDPC codeword.                     This is equivalent to mapping one bit from M

   different cyclic blocks of the LDPC codeword to a constellation word.                    This is
   schematically illustrated in Fig. 18A.
   [0057]
                 (Condition 2)
 5               All constellation words mapped to the M cyclic blocks are mapped only to that
   particular cyclic block.          This is equivalent to mapping all MxQ bits of the M different
   cyclic blocks each made up of                 Q  bits to exactly   Q  constellations.   This is
   schematically illustrated in Fig. 18B.
   [0058]
10               The above conditions imply that exactly      Q constellations  are mapped to each
   set of M cyclic blocks.
   [0059]
                 (Embodiment 1)
                 The following describes the details of a bit interleaver (i.e., a parallel bit
15 interleaver) that satisfies conditions 1 and 2 given above.         In the following description,
   processing and the units performing such processing are labeled with the same
   reference numbers wherever applicable.
   [0060]
                 In the present document, each group of M cyclic blocks and each group of Q
20 constellation words is referred to as a section (or as an interleaver section).
   [0061]
                 Figs. 19 and 20 are block diagrams respectively illustrating the mapping
   function of a bit interleaver satisfying Conditions 1 and 2 and corresponding to the
   aforementioned parameters (i.e.,          Q=  8, M = 4, N = 12), and a sample configuration for
25 such a bit interleaver.
   [0062]
                 In Figs. 19 and 20, the QC-LDPC codewords are made up of N             = 12 cyclic
   block, each in turn made up of Q = 8 bits.           Each of the 24 constellation words is made

   up of M = 4 bits.                 Each constellation word indicates one of 2 m = 16 constellation
   points.        The bit interleaver is divided into N/M = 3 sections.         The 24 constellation
   words are each associated one of the three sections.
   [0063]
 5               A bit interleaver 2000 includes a bit permutator 2010, which in turn includes
   N/M (= 3) section permutators 2021, 2022, and 2023, each operating independently.
   However, rather than providing three section permutators, a single section permutator
   may, for example, be provided so as to perform the three section permutation processes
   described below, switching therebetween over time.
10 [0064]
                 The section permutators (2021, 2022, and 2023) each independently perform a
   section permutation on the 32 bits making up each of 4 cyclic blocks, such that one bit
   from every four cyclic blocks (i.e., QB1 through QB4, QB5 through QB8, and QB9
   through QB 12) is mapped to each group of eight constellation words (i.e., C1 through
15 C8, C9 through C16, and C17 through C24).
   [0065]
                 Conditions 1 and 2, described above, ensure that the bit interleaver is divisible
   into N/M parallel sections.              The section permutations applied to the parallel sections
   may all apply the same permutation rules, may each apply different permutation rules,
20 or may involve a subset of the sections applying identical permutation rules while other
   differ.
   [0066]
                 For example, the section permutators may map the Q bits of a cyclic block
   (which each have the same importance in LDPC decoding) to bits having the same bit
25 index (i.e., having the same robustness level) in the Q constellation words.             For each
   cyclic block, the Q bits may be in sequential or in permutated order.            The latter case is
   described with reference to Figs. 21A and 21B, while the former case is described with
   reference to Figs. 22A and 22B.

   [0068]
                  The section permutator 2101 includes intra-cyclic-block permutators 2111
 5 through 2114 and a column-row permutator 2131.                          Rather than providing four
   intra-cyclic-block permutators, for example, a single intra-cyclic-block permutator may
   be provided and perform the four intra-cyclic-block permutation processes, described
   later, switching therebetween over time.
   [0069]
10                The         intra-cyclic-block    permutators     (2111-2114)    each  perform     an
   intra-cyclic-block permutation on the Q-bit (8-bit) cyclic blocks (QB1-QB4).                    The
   intra-cyclic-block permutations applied to the cyclic blocks in each section may all
   apply the same permutation rules, may each apply different permutation rules, or may
   involve a subset of the sections applying identical permutation rules while other differ.
15 [0070]
                  The column-row permutator 2131 performs a column-row permutation on each
   group of MxQ (= 32) bits.                  Specifically, the column-row permutator 2131 writes the
   MxQ bits row-wise into a MxQ (8x4) matrix, then reads the MxQ bits column-wise
   therefrom, thus applying the column-row permutation.                   The column-row permutation
20 applied by the column-row permutator 2131 resembles the permutation applied to the
    12x 1350 matrix shown in Figs. 9A and 9B, where                 Q columns  and M rows are used, the
   writing process occurs column-wise, and the reading process occurs row-wise.
   [0071]
                  Figs. 21B is a structural representation of the section permutator shown in Fig.
25 21A.         In Fig. 21B, the constellation words of M= 4 bits are each denoted bI through
   b4.
   [0072]
                  However, a variation in which the intra-cyclic-block permutation process is not

   part of the section permutation process is also plausible.
   [0073]
                 For example, a section permutation implemented without executing the
   intra-cyclic-block permutation and a structure of mapping by the section permutator are
 5 shown in Figs. 22A and 22B.                  The section permutator 2201 includes a column-row
   permutator 2131 and performs a simple column-row permutation.                      In Fig. 22B, the
   constellation words of M= 4 bits are each denoted bI through b4.
   [0074]
                 The section permutation described in Figs. 21A, 21B, 22A and 22B may be
10 applied to cyclic blocks QB5-QB8 and QB9-QB12.
   [0075]
                 Advantageously, an additional cyclic block permutation may be applied to the
   N cyclic blocks before the bit interleaver performs the section permutation.               Fig. 23 is
   a structural diagram of the additional cyclic block permutation applied by the bit
15 interleaver.            In this context, the cyclic block permutation plays a role similar to that of
   the permutation performed by the bit-to-cell demultiplexer in the DVB-T2 standard.
   [0076]
                 The bit interleaver 2300 shown in Fig. 23 includes a cyclic block permutator
   2310 and a bit permutator 2010 (which in turn includes section permutators
20 2021-2023).
   [0077]
                 The cyclic block permutator 2310 performs cyclic block permutations
   2311-2318 on the cyclic blocks QB1-QB12.                     Here, the cyclic block permutations
   2311-2318 all follow the same permutation rules.
25 [0078]
                 The cyclic block permutation performed on the N cyclic blocks is particularly
   advantageous in enabling optimized mapping of the LDPC codeword bits onto the
   constellation bits, resulting in optimized performance.

   2101-2103).                    The    section permutator 2101    (2102,   2013)   includes    the

   column-row permutator 2131 (2132, 2133).
   [0082]
                 In the bit interleaver 2400, the (inter) cyclic block permutation is performed by
   the cyclic block permutator 2310 (stage A), the intra-cyclic-block permutation is

   perform the intra-cyclic-block permutation.                Also, the bit interleaver 2400 may

   permutations may consist of cyclical shifts, which allow for efficient hardware
   implementation using barrel shifters.                 An implementation using the barrel shifters in
   the LDPC decoder is also possible.

   [0087]
                 The LDPC encoder 2510 encodes input blocks into codewords using

   [0088]
                 The bit interleaver 2520 receives the codeword in QC-LDPC code from the

   block including              Q=   8 bits.  The bit interleaver 2520 performs interleaving on the bits
25 of the codewords so as to permute the bits of each of the codewords.                          The bit
   interleaver 2520 divides the interleaved codeword into a plurality of constellation

                  The following describes a BICM encoder that includes the bit interleaver
   performing a bit interleaving process that satisfies Conditions 1 and 2, with reference to
15 Fig. 26.
   [0092]
                  Fig. 26 is a block diagram of an example BICM encoder pertaining to a further
   Embodiment of the disclosure.           In Fig. 26, the BICM encoder 2600 corresponds to the
   above-given parameters (i.e.,         Q= 8, N= 12, M= 4).
20 [0093]
                  The BICM encoder 2600 shown in Fig. 26 includes a main memory 2601, an
   LDPC controller 2611, a rotator 2612, a check node processor group 2613, a de-rotator
   2614, a QB counter 2631, table A 2632, interleaver B 2633, a register group 2634,
   interleaver C 2635, and a mapper group 2651.
25 [0094]
                  In Fig. 26, given that Q=  8, the main memory 2601 reads eight bits at a time,
   the check node processor group 2613 includes eight check node processors, and the
   mapper group 2651 includes eight mappers.             Also, given that M = 4, the register group

   2634 includes four registers.
   [0095]
                 The main memory 2601 receives a sequence of bits for transmission from, for
   example, the (non-diagrammed) input processor, and stores the received bit sequence.
 5 [0096]
                 The LDPC controller 2611 outputs a read address to the main memory 2601.
   The main memory 2601 accordingly outputs the bit sequence, eight bits at a time
   beginning with the lead bit, to the rotator 2612.              The rotator 2612 is controlled by the
   LDPC controller 2611 to perform a predetermined number of cyclical shifts on the
10 eight bits supplied thereto by the main memory 2601, and then outputs the eight
   cyclically-shifted bits to the check node processors of the check node processor group
   2613, one bit at a time, the bits and the check node processors being in one-to-one
   correspondence.                  Each check node processer of the check node processor group 2613
   is controlled by the LDPC controller 2611 to perform check node processing on each
15 bit input thereto, then outputs the results to the de-rotator 2614.            The de-rotator 2614
   is controlled by the LDPC controller 2611 to perform a predetermined number of cyclic
   shifts on the eight bits received from the check node processor group 2613 so as to
   cancel the cyclic shift applied by the rotator 2612, and then outputs the eight shifted
   bits to the main memory 2601.                 The LDPC controller 2611 outputs a write address to
20 the main memory 2601.                    The main memory 2601 accordingly stores the eight bits
   supplied thereto by the de-rotator 2614.               The LDPC controller 2611, the rotator 2612,
   the check node processor group 2613, and the de-rotator 2614 make up the BICM
   encoder in the LDPC encoder 2510 shown in Fig. 25.
   [0097]
25               The QB counter 2631 counts from 0 to 11 and outputs the counter value to
   table A 2632.               The count operation of the QB counter 2631 is defined in consideration
   ofN= 12.
   [0098]

                 Table A 2632 is a simple look-up table in which the cyclic block permutation
   rules are stored.               That is, table A 2632 stores N = 12 pieces of cyclic block read order
   information (information associating a different cyclic block with each of the 12
   counter values from the QB counter 2631).                    Table A 2632 outputs a read address to
 5 the main memory 2601 such that the bits of one cyclic block (i.e.,                        Q   = 8 bits)
   corresponding to the counter value supplied by the QB counter 2631 are supplied from
   the main memory 2601 to interleaver B 2633.                    Thus, the main memory 2601 outputs
   the bits of one cyclic block corresponding to the counter value of the QB counter 2631
   to interleaver B 2633.                 The processing using table A 2632 is executed as the cyclic
10 block permutation process (stage A).
   [0099]
                 Interleaver B 2633 performs a predetermined number of cyclical shifts on the
   bits of the cyclic block supplied by the main memory 2601, and outputs the results to a
   first tier register of the register group 2634.              The processing by interleaver B 2633 is
15 executed as the intra-cyclic-block permutation process (stage B).                 Each register in the
   register group 2634 stores one cyclic block of bits with timing matching the reception
   of a control pulse, and outputs the cyclic block of bits before receiving the next control
   pulse.
   [0100]
20               When the QB counter 2631 performs the aforementioned process for counter
   values 0 through 3, the bits of four cyclic blocks (i.e., 32 bits) are input to interleaver C
   2635.        At this time, interleaver C 2635 interleaves the bits of the four cyclic blocks
   input thereto, and the mappers of the mapper group 2651 output one constellation word
   of bits (i.e., M = 4 bits).                Through the interleaving process, four bits, i.e., one from
25 each of the four registers in the register group 2634, are supplied to each mapper.
   This processing by interleaver C 2635 is executed as the column-row permutation
   process (stage C).

                 The QB counter 2631, table A 2632, interleaver B 2633, the register group
   2634, and interleaver C 2635 make up the bit interleaver 2520 of the BICM encoder
   shown in Fig. 25.
   [0102]
 5               The mappers of the mapper group 2651 each map four bits supplied thereto
   from interleaver C 2635 to a constellation, then output the results.        The mapper group
   2651 makes up the constellation mapper 2530 of the BICM encoder shown in Fig. 25.
   [0103]
                 For each codeword, the above-described set of processes is applied three times,
10 once each for counter values 0-3, 4-7, and 8-11 of the QB counter 2631.
   [0104]
                 The Embodiment depicted in Fig. 26 includes    Q mappers    operating in parallel.
   However, the rappers are also realizable as a BICM encoder so as to decrease or
   increase the parallelism.           For example, the number of parallel interleaver sections in
15 the bit interleaver, i.e., the quotient of N/M, obviously may be increased so as to easily
   enhance parallelism.              Such methods enable the parallelism to be optimized by
   parallelizing the QxN/M mappers.            Implementing such parallelism, without drawbacks,
   in the bit interleaver is beneficial.

20               The following describes a receiver receiving signals from a transmitter that
   includes the bit interleaver performing a bit interleaving process that satisfies
   Conditions 1 and 2, with reference to Fig. 27.
   [0106]
                 Fig. 27 is a block diagram of an example receiver, including a non-iterative
25 BICM decoder, pertaining to a further Embodiment of the disclosure.               The receiver
   performs the transmitter operations in reverse.
   [0107]
                 The receiver 2700 shown in Fig. 27 includes a demodulator 2710 and a

   non-iterative BICM decoder (which in turn includes a constellation demapper 2720, a
   bit deinterleaver 2730, and an LDPC decoder 2740).
   [0108]
                 The demodulator 2710 performs a demodulation process through OFDM, for
 5 example, and outputs the demodulated results.
   [0109]
                 The constellation demapper 2720 of the non-iterative BICM decoder generates
   a soft bit sequence by applying a demapping process to the input from the demodulator
   2710, and outputs the soft bit sequence so generated to the constellation demapper
10 2730.        The soft bits are a measure of probability that a given bit is a zero-bit or a
   one-bit.        Typically, the soft bits are represented as log-likelihood ratios (hereinafter,
   LLRs), defined as follows.
   [0110]
                 LLR(b)         =  ln [p(b = 0)/p(b = 1)]
15               where p(b = 0) indicates the probability of the given bit b being a zero-bit, and
   p(b = 1) represents the probability of the given bit b being a one-bit.       Of course, p(b  =
   0)+ p(b= 1)= 1.
   [0111]
                 The bit deinterleaver 2730 performs an interleaving process (i.e., a bit
20 de-interleaving process) on the soft bit sequence output from the constellation
   demapper 2720 so as to cancel the bit interleaving process applied to the bit sequence
   by the bit interleaver 2730 in the transmitter illustrated in Fig. 25.
   [0112]
                 The LDPC decoder 2740 receives the soft bit sequence deinterleaved by the bit
25 deinterleaver 2730, and performs an LDPC decoding process using the soft bit
   sequence so received.

   [0115]
                 As shown in Fig. 28, a receiver 2800 includes the demodulator 2710 and an
   iterative BICM decoder (which in turn includes the constellation demapper 2720, the
   bit deinterleaver 2730, the LDPC decoder 2740, a subtractor 2760, and a bit interleaver
10 2750).
   [0116]
                 The receiver 2800 of Fig. 28 has the constellation demapper 2720 performing a
   constellation demapping process, the bit deinterleaver                        2730 performing a bit
   deinterleaving process, and the LDPC decoder 2740 performing an LDPC decoding
15 process.
   [0117]
                 After one or more LDPC decoding iterations, extrinsic information, obtained
   by the subtractor 2760 subtracting the input to the LDPC decoder 2740 from the output
   of the LDPC decoder 2740, is output to the bit interleaver 2750.                    The bit interleaver
20 2750 performs an interleaving process on the extrinsic information using the same
   interleaving rules as those applied to the bit sequence by the bit interleaver of the
   transmitter depicted in Fig. 25.                      The bit interleaver 2750 then feeds back the
   interleaved            extrinsic       information    to   the constellation  demapper    2720.     The
   constellation demapper 2720 uses the extrinsic information so fed back as a-priori
25 information to compute more reliable LLR values.                       The bit deinterleaver 2730 then
   performs an interleaving process on the newly computed LLR values (i.e., a bit
   de-interleaving process) so as to cancel the bit interleaving process applied to the bit
   sequence by the bit interleaver in the transmitter depicted in Fig. 25 and restore the
                                                               32

                 As shown in Fig. 28, an iterative decoding loop is made up of four elements,
 5 namely the constellation demapper 2720, the bit deinterleaver 2730, the LDPC decoder
   2740, and the bit interleaver 2750.                 The bit deinterleaver 2730 and the bit interleaver
   2750 have beneficially very low latency, ideally zero, and low complexity.                        This
   results in a more efficient receiver implementation.                  The bit deinterleaver 2730 and
   the bit interleaver 2750 described above satisfy both of these conditions.

   above-given parameters (i.e.,              Q=   8, N= 12, M= 4).
   [0121]
                 As shown, the BICM decoder 2900 includes a main LLR memory 2901, a
   buffer LLR memory 2902, an LDPC controller 2911, a rotator 2912, a check node

25               In Fig. 29, given that        Q=   8, the main LLR memory 2901 and the buffer LLR
   memory 2902 each read eight LLR values at a time, the check node processor group

   include four registers.
   [0123]
                 The demappers in the demapper group 2937 each perform a demapping
   process on the output of a demodulator (not diagrammed), then outputs the LLR values
 5 so obtained to deinterleaver C 2938.                    The demapper group 2937 makes up the
   constellation demapper 2720 of the iterative BICM decoder shown in Fig. 28.
   [0124]
                 Deinterleaver C 2938 applies a deinterleaving process to the LLR values (i.e.,
   a new interleaving process cancelling the interleaving process applied by the
10 transmitter during stage C), then outputs the deinterleaved LLR values to the registers
   of the register group 2939.                Each register stores one cyclic block of LLR values (i.e.,
   eight LLR values).                In register group 2939, the cyclic block of LLR values stored by
   each register is sequentially output to a later tier such that the content of each register is
   sequentially updated.                Deinterleaver B 2940 applies a deinterleaving process to the
15 cyclic block of (eight) LLR values (i.e., a new interleaving process cancelling the
   interleaving process applied by the transmitter during stage B), then writes the results
   to the main LLR memory 2901 and the buffer LLR memory 2902 in accordance with
   table A 2932 (discussed later).                 An interleaving process cancelling the interleaving
   process applied by the transmitter during stage A is achieved by this writing to the
20 main LLR memory 2901 and the buffer LLR memory 2902 in accordance with the
   content of Table A 2932.
   [0125]
                 Thus, the main LLR memory 2901 stores the post-deinterleaving LLR values,
   and is also used by the LDPC decoder (i.e., the LDPC controller 2911, the rotator 2912,
25 the check node processor group 2913, and the de-rotator 2914).                  The LDPC decoding
   process is an iterative process involving one or more iterations.                    In each LDPC
   decoding iteration, the LLR values in the main LLR memory 2901 are updated.                       In
   order to compute the extrinsic information needed for iterative BICM decoding, the old

   2901 in accordance with the parity-check matrix of the LDPC codes.             Thus, the main
   LLR memory 2901 sequentially outputs one cyclic block of LLR values to the rotator
   2912.        The rotator 2912 is controlled by the LDPC controller 2911 to perform a
   predetermined number of cyclical shifts on the cyclic block of LLR values supplied
10 sequentially by the main LLR memory 2901, then outputs the LLR values so shifted to
   the check node processors of the check node processor group 2913 one at a time.           The
   check node processors of the check node processor group 2913 are controlled by the
   LDPC controller 2911 to perform a check node process on the sequence of LLR values
   sequentially input thereto.          Next, the check node processors of the check node
15 processor group 2913 are controlled by the LDPC controller 2911 to sequentially
   output the LLR values resulting from the check node process.           The de-rotator 2914 is
   controlled by the LDPC controller 2911 to performs a predetermined number of cyclic
   shifts cancelling the cyclic shift applied to the cyclic block sequentially received from
   the check node processor group 2913 by the rotator 2912, then sequentially outputs the
20 shifted results to the main LLR memory 2901.           The LDPC controller 2911 outputs the
   write address to the main LLR memory 2901 in accordance with the parity-check
   matrix of the LDPC codes.           Thus, the main LLR memory 2901 stores the cyclic block
   of results sequentially supplied thereto by the de-rotator 2914.        The LDPC controller
   2911 repeatedly executes the above-described processing in accordance with the
25 parity-check matrix of the LDPC codes.
   [0128]
                 After a predetermined number of LDPC iterations, a BICM iteration is
   performed.             The LDPC and BICM iterations are also respectively referred to as inner
                                                   35

   and outer iterations.                  These two types of iterative may also overlap in some
   implementations.                  This enables the speed of convergence to be increased.         The
   BICM and LDPC decoding processes are well known in the field, and the details
   thereof are thus omitted.

                 The QB counter 2931 counts from 0 to 11 and outputs the counter value to
   table A 2932.               The count operation of the QB counter 2931 is defined in consideration
   ofN= 12.
   [0130]
10               Table A 2932 is a simple look-up table in which the cyclic block permutation
   rules are stored.               That is, table A 2932 stores N = 12 pieces of cyclic block read (and
   write) order information (i.e., with information associating a different cyclic block with
   each of the 12 counter values from the QB counter 2631).                  Table A 2932 outputs the
   read address to the main LLR memory 2901 and to the buffer LLR memory 2902 such
15 that one cyclic block of LLR values corresponding to the counter value supplied by the
   QB counter 2931 are supplied to the subtractor group 2933 by the main LLR memory
   2901 and to the buffer LLR memory 2902.                      Thus, the main LLR memory 2901 and
   the buffer LLR memory 2902 each output a cyclic block of LLR values corresponding
   to the counter value of the QB counter 2931 to the subtractor 2933.                The delayer 2941
20 makes a delay adjustment such that the position of the LLR value read from the main
   LLR memory 2901 and the buffer LLR memory 2902 match the write position of the
   same LLR values to the main LLR memory 2901 and the buffer LLR memory 2902.
   The processing using table A 2932 is executed as the cyclic block permutation process
   (stage A).
25 [0131]
                 The subtractor 2933 in the subtractor group subtracts the output of the buffer
   LLR memory 2902 from the output of the main LLR memory 2901, then outputs the
   extrinsic information for one cyclic block thus obtained (i.e., eight pieces of extrinsic
                                                           36

   information) to interleaver B 2934.
   [0132]
                  Interleaver B 2634 performs a predetermined number of cyclical shifts on the
   pieces of extrinsic information for one of the cyclic blocks supplied by the subtractor
 5 2933, and outputs the results to a first tier register of the register group 2935.            The
   processing performed by interleaver B 2934 corresponds to the intra-cyclic-block
   permutation (stage B).             Each register in the register group 2935 stores eight bits with
   timing matching the reception of a control pulse, and outputs the eight bits before
   receiving the next control pulse.
10 [0133]
                  When the QB counter 2631 performs the aforementioned process for counter
   values 0 through 3, the extrinsic information for four cyclic blocks (i.e., 32 pieces of
   extrinsic information) are input to interleaver C 2936.               At this time, interleaver C
   2936 performs an interleaving process on the extrinsic information input thereto for
15 four cyclic blocks, then outputs one constellation word of extrinsic information (i.e., M
   = 4 pieces of extrinsic information) to each demapper of the demapper group 2937.
   Through the interleaving process, the four pieces of extrinsic information are supplied
   to the demappers of the demapper group 2951 from the four registers in register group
   2935, one at a time.               This processing by interleaver C 2936 is executed as the
20 column-row permutation process (stage C).
   [0134]
                  The QB counter 2931, table A 2932, interleaver B 2934, the register group
   2935, and interleaver C 2936 make up the bit interleaver 2750 of the BICM decoder
   shown in Fig. 28.
25 [0135]
                  The demappers of the demapper group 2937 uses the four pieces of extrinsic
   information supplied by interleaver C 2936 as a-priori information to perform a
   demapping process, then output the resulting LLR values to deinterleaver C 2938.

                 Deinterleaver C 2938 applies a deinterleaving process to the LLR values (i.e.,
   a new interleaving process cancelling the interleaving process applied by the
   transmitter during stage C), then outputs the deinterleaved LLR values to the registers
 5 of the register group 2939.                Each register stores one cyclic block of LLR values (i.e.,
   eight LLR values).                In register group 2939, the cyclic block of LLR values stored by
   each register is sequentially output to a later tier such that the content of each register is
   sequentially updated.                Deinterleaver B 2940 applies a deinterleaving process to the
   cyclic block of (eight) LLR values (i.e., a new interleaving process cancelling the
10 interleaving process applied by the transmitter during stage B), then writes the results
   to the main LLR memory 2901 and the buffer LLR memory 2902.                          The main LLR
   memory 2901 and the buffer LLR memory 2902 receive the write address from table A
   2932 via the delayer 2941, then store one cyclic block of LLR values (i.e., eight LLR
   values) received from the deinterleaver 2940 in accordance with the received write
15 address.         An interleaving process cancelling the interleaving process applied by the
   transmitter during stage A (i.e., a deinterleaving process) is achieved by this writing in
   accordance with the content of table A 2932.
   [0137]
                 For each codeword, the above-described set of processes is applied three times,
20 once each for counter values 0-3, 4-7, and 8-11 of the QB counter 2931.
   [0138]
                 The QB counter 2931, table A 2932, deinterleaver B 26938, the register group
   2939, and interleaver C 2940 make up the bit interleaver 2730 of the BICM decoder
   shown in Fig. 28.
25 [0139]
                 Interleaver B 2934 and deinterleaver B 2940 are reconfigurable.                  This
   requires a certain hardware cost, but this cost is minimized by attentive design.
   Interleaver C 2936 and deinterleaver 2938 implement the column-row permutation.

   This permutation is uniform for a predetermined constellation size.                  Thus, the cost of
   implementation is reduced.
   [0140]
                 The Embodiment depicted in Fig. 29 includes                Q   demappers operating in
 5 parallel.        However, the demappers are also realizable as an iterative BICM decoder by
   decreasing or increasing the parallelism.                   For example, the number of parallel
   interleaver sections in the bit interleaver, i.e., the quotient of N/M, obviously may be
   increased so as to easily enhance parallelism.               Such methods enable the parallelism to
   be optimized by parallelizing the QxN/M demappers.                          The above-described bit
10 interleaver has the merit of being implementable with such parallelism without trouble.
   [0141]
                 (Further Experimenter Discoveries)
                 The interleavers satisfying Conditions 1 and 2 given above (i.e., parallel
   interleavers) assume that the number of bits per constellation word M is a divisor of the
15 number of cyclic blocks N.               However, M is not typically a divisor of N.      For example,
   the 16K LDPC codes used in the DVB-T2 standard has N                      = 45 cyclic blocks per 16K
   LDPC codeword.                    When M is not a divisor of N, the mapping of square constellations,
   such as QAM constellations where M is even, is not straightforward.
   [0142]
20               Thus, a particular solution is proposed that involves excluding one or more of
   the N cyclic blocks and implementing the interleaver discussed in Embodiment 1 (i.e.
   the parallel interleaver), above, only to the remaining cyclic blocks.
   [0143]
                 In other words, N' cyclic blocks are selected from among the N cyclic blocks
25 such that N' is a multiple of the number of bits per constellation words M in the bit
   interleaver.            The bit interleaver divides the N' selected cyclic blocks into N'/M
   sections such that each section includes M cyclic blocks, then performs a section
   permutation on each section.                The bits of the excluded (i.e., not selected) cyclic block

   may or may not be interleaved.
   [0144]
                  For example, the excluded cyclic blocks may be the cyclic blocks having a
   variable node of the lowest weight.               For the example RA QC LDPC codes (see Fig.
 5 5),the excluded cyclic blocks are the cyclic block of the parity section (having a
   variable node weight of two), and are beneficially the last one or more cyclic blocks of
   the codeword.
   [0145]
                  Fig. 30 illustrates a cyclic block subject to and a cyclic block excluded from
10 (i.e., an excluded block of) the interleaving process described above (i.e., Embodiment
    1).     In Fig. 30, the code is 16K LDPC code conforming to the DVB-T2 standard, and
   the constellation is a 16-QAM constellation.                As shown, 44 of the cyclic blocks are
   subject to interleaving (i.e., blocks 1 through 44), and cyclic block 45, in the last row,
   is the one cyclic block not subject to interleaving (i.e., the excluded block).             The four
15 blackened squares represent the four bits of the first constellation.
   [0146]
                  In general, the number of interleaver sections (each made up of M cyclic
   blocks) is given by floor(N/M), and the number of excluded cyclic blocks is given by
   rem(N, M).               Here, floor(N/M) is a function that returns the largest integer smaller than
20 or equal to NIM, and rem(N, M) is a function that returns the remainder of dividing N
   by M.
   [0147]
                  Table 2 indicates the number of sections and the number of excluded cyclic
   blocks for various constellation sizes (i.e., number of bits per constellation M), for the
25  16K LDPC codes of the DVB-T2 standard (where N                    45 cyclic blocks are used).

                 According to the interleaving method satisfying Conditions 1 and 2 as
   described above, each constellation word is mapped onto M cyclic blocks.                 However,
   for large constellations (i.e., constellations having many constellation points), an
   interleaving method satisfying Conditions 1 and 2 requires an extremely large amount
 5 of delay registers (see the implementation described with reference to Figs. 26 through
   29).      Using an extremely large amount of registers leads to an increase in circuit area
   and electric power consumption.                In addition, reducing the number of cyclic blocks
   onto which each constellation word is mapped is beneficial for increasing the overlap
   between the outer (BICM) iterations and the inner (LDPC) iterations, in turn reducing
10 overall BICM decoding latency.
   [0149]
                 By mapping two or more bits of each constellation word onto the same cyclic
   block, the number of cyclic blocks onto which each constellation word is mapped is
   reduced.          The number of constellation word bits mapped onto the same cyclic block is
15 termed the folding factor and is denoted F.              For example, when F = 2 for a 16-QAM
   constellation, each constellation word is mapped onto four cyclic blocks rather than
   two.        The only constraint is that the folding factor F (which is an integer greater than
   one) must be a divisor of both M and             Q.   When F = 1, no folding is involved, i.e., the
   situation corresponds to Embodiment 1, described above.
20 [0150]
                 A complex QAM constellation symbol is decomposed into two identical real
   PAM symbols.                   Thus, the M bits of the QAM constellation are divided into two
   identical real PAM symbols, which are sets of M/2 bits.              The bits of each constellation
   word are then mapped onto the same number M/2 of cyclic blocks .                   A folding factor
25 of F = 2 is advantageous for QAM constellation.

   [0151]
                 For complex constellations that cannot be decomposed into real numbers, such
   as 8-PSK (phase shift keying), 16-APSK (amplitude phase shift keying), 32-APSK and
   so on in the DVB-S2 standard, the folding method is not easily applicable.             However,
 5 the folding method is usable when F is a divisor of M.              Unfortunately, this prevents
   any guarantee that each cyclic block has only bits of the same robustness level from the
   constellations mapped thereto.
   [0152]
                 Beneficially, the folding method is, for example, applied such that only bits of
10 the same robustness level in the constellations are mapped to the cyclic blocks.
   [0153]
                 Folding is also beneficial in reducing the number of excluded cyclic blocks, or
   even eliminating the need to exclude any cyclic blocks.            As described above, a certain
   number of cyclic blocks making up the codeword must be excluded when the
15 interleaver described in Embodiment 1 (i.e., a parallel interleaver) is used.
   [0154]
                 Without folding (i.e., when F = 1), the number of groups of M cyclic blocks
   (i.e., the number of sections) is floor(N/M), and the number of excluded cyclic blocks is
   rem(N, M).                  With folding, the number of groups of M/F cyclic blocks is
20 floor(N/(M/F)), and the number of excluded cyclic blocks is rem(N, MIF).                Specific
   example of these numbers are given in Table 3, for the LDPC codes used in the

   equal to or greater than two), Conditions I and 2 must be modified into Conditions 1A
   and 2A, as given below.
   [0156]
 5                (Condition 1A)
                  The M bits of each constellation word are each mapped to one of MIF different
   cyclic blocks of the LDPC codeword.                  This is equivalent to mapping one bit from M/F
   different cyclic blocks of the LDPC codeword to a constellation word.                         This is
   schematically illustrated in Fig. 3 1A.
10 [0157]
                  (Condition 2A)
                  All constellation words mapped to the M/F cyclic blocks are mapped only to
   that particular cyclic block.              This is equivalent to mapping all MxQ/F bits of the MIF
   different cyclic blocks each made up of Q bits to exactly Q/F constellations.                  This is
15 schematically illustrated in Fig. 31B.
   [0158]
                  When F = 1, no folding is involved, and thus Conditions 1A and 2A are
   equivalent to Conditions 1 and 2.
   [0159]
20                (Embodiment 2)
                  The following describes the details of a bit interleaver (i.e., a parallel bit
   interleaver) that satisfies conditions 1A and 2A, given above.                      In the following
   description, processing and the units performing such processing are labeled with the
                                                           43

   same reference numbers wherever applicable.
   [0160]
                 In the present document, each group of M/F cyclic blocks or of QIF
   constellation words is referred to as a folding section (or as a folding interleaver
 5 section).
   [0161]
                 When F = 1 (i.e., no folding), the folding interleaver sections match the
   interleaver sections and the bit interleaver is configured identically to the bit interleaver
   from Embodiment 1.
10 [0162]
                 Folding occurs when F is an integer greater than one.                Embodiment 2
   describes an example of folding where F = 2.
   [0163]
                 Fig. 32 is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a bit interleaver
15 satisfying Conditions 1A and 2A, when                Q  = 8, M = 4, N = 12, and F = 2, as another
   Embodiment of the disclosure.
   [0164]
                 In Fig. 32, the QC-LDPC codewords are made up ofN= 12 cyclic blocks QBI
   through QB12, each in turn made up of Q = 8 bits.                Each of the 24 constellation words
20 is made up of M = 4 bits.                   Each constellation word indicates one of 2m = 16
   constellation points.             The bit interleaver is divided into FxN/M = 6 folding sections,
   and 24 constellation words are each associated with one of the FxNIM = 6 folding
   sections.
   [0165]
25               The bit interleaver 2000A includes a bit permutator 2010A.                    The bit
   permutator 2010A includes FxN/M = 6 folding section permutators 2021A-2026A
   each operating independently.               Rather than providing six folding section permutators,
   a single folding section permutator may be provided so as to performs six (later
                                                         44
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   described) folding section permutation processes, switching therebetween over time.
   [0166]
                 The folding section permutators (2021A, 2022A, 2023A, 2024A, 2025A,
   2026A) are independent and each apply a folding section permutation process to the 16
 5 bits of two cyclic blocks such that F = 2 bits from each of M/F = 2 cyclic blocks
   (QBI-QB2,               QB3-QB4,       QB5-QB6,      QB7-QB8,      QB9-QB1O,    QB11-QB12)        are
   mapped to a given set of four constellation words (CI-C4, C5-C8, C9-C12, C13-C 16,
   C17-C20, C21-C24).
   [0167]
10               Conditions 1A and 2A, described above, simply ensure that the bit interleaver
   is divisible into FxN/M parallel folding sections.                The folding section permutations
   applied to the parallel folding sections may all apply the same permutation rules, may
   each apply different permutation rules, or may involve a subset of the sections applying
   identical permutation rules while other differ.
15 [0168]
                 For example, the folding section permutators may map          Q bits from each cyclic
   block to bits of Q/F constellation words having the same robustness level.                  This is
   illustrated in Figs. 33A, 33B, 34A, and 34B for a situation where            Q = 8 and M     4.
   [0169]
20               Fig. 34A is a block diagram of a (folding) section permutator when F        =   1 (i.e.,
   without folding), and is similar to Fig. 22A.
   [0170]
                 Fig. 34B is a block diagram of two folding section permutators from Fig. 32
   where F       =   2 (i.e., with folding).
25 [0171]
                 However, in the example of Fig. 34B, the constellations are 16-QAM
   constellations.              Thus, the bits of the constellations have two robustness levels.    Bits
   bI and b3 have the same robustness level, and bits b2 and b4 have the same robustness
                                                          45

   level, the former robustness level being different from the latter robustness level.
   [0172]
                 The folding section permutators       2201A (and 2202A) each include          a
   column-row permutator 213lA (or 2132A).
 5 [0173]
                 The column-row permutators 213 1A (and 2132A) each perform a column-row
   permutation process on QxM/F = 16 cyclic blocks QB1 and QB2 (or QB3 and QB4).
   To be exact, the column-row permutators 2131A (and 2132A) write QxM/F = 16 bits
   row-wise into a QxM/F (8x2) matrix, then read the 16 bits so written column-wise to
10 perform the column-row permutation process.             The column-row permutation applied
   by the column-row permutators 2131A and 2132A resembles the permutation applied
   to the 12x 1350 matrix shown in Figs. 9A and 9B, where          Q columns   and MIF rows are
   used, the writing process            occurs  row-wise, and the reading        process occurs
   column-wise.
15 [0174]
                 Folding with a folding factor of F reduces the number of cyclic blocks mapped
   to a single constellation word.        Thus, the matrix used in the column-row permutation
   is reduced in size, from M rows to MIF rows.
   [0175]
20               Fig. 33A illustrates the mapping function performed by the (folding) section
   permutator from Fig. 34A.           Fig. 33B illustrates the mapping function performed by
   the two folding section permutators from Fig. 34B.             In Figs. 33A and 33B, each
   constellation word of M = 4 bits is denoted bI through b4.           The portions outlined in
   thicker lines represent the portions mapped to constellation C1.
25 [0176]
                 As shown in Figs. 33A and 34A, the eight bits of a cyclic block (being of equal
   importance) are each mapped to the bits of eight constellation words having the same
   bit index (i.e., having the same robustness level).         Also, in Figs. 33B and 34B, the
                                                    46

   eight bits of a cyclic block (being of equal importance) are mapped to the bits of four
   constellation words having the same robustness level.
   [0177]
                 The folding section permutation described in Fig. 34B may be applied to cyclic
 5 blocks QB5-QB6, QB7-QB8, QB9-QB 10, and QB1 1-QB12.
   [0178]
                 The folding section permutators of Figs. 34A and 34B may also include a
   subunit performing an intra-cyclic-block permutation on the bits of cyclic blocks
   QB 1-QB4 prior to the column-row permutation.
10 [0179]
                 Advantageously, an additional cyclic block permutation may be applied to the
   N cyclic blocks before the bit interleaver performs the folding section permutation.
   Fig. 35 is a structural diagram of the additional cyclic block permutation applied by the
   bit interleaver.
15 [0180]
                 The bit interleaver 2300A shown in Fig. 35 includes the cyclic block
   permutator 2310 and a bit permutator 2010A (which in turn includes folding section
   permutators 2021A-2026A).
   [0181]

   23.
   [0182]
                 The bit interleaver 2400A shown in Fig. 36 includes the cyclic block
   permutator 2310 and a bit permutator 2200A (which in turn includes folding section
25 permutators 2201A-2206A).
   [0183]
                 The folding section permutators 2201A-2206A each include a column-row
   permutator 2131A-2136A.              The folding section permutators 2133A-2136A each

                 The bit interleavers shown in Figs. 35 and 36 may each include an additional
 5 subunit performing an intra-cyclic-block permutation on the bits of cyclic blocks
   QB 1-QB 12 before or after the cyclic block permutation.

                 The following describes a transmitter that includes the bit interleaver
   performing a bit interleaving process that satisfies Conditions 1A and 2A, with
10 reference to Fig. 37.
   [0186]
                 Fig. 37 is a block diagram of a transmitter pertaining to a further Embodiment
   of the present disclosure.                The transmitter 2500A shown in Fig. 37 is configured
   similarly to the transmitter 2500 of Fig. 25, differing in that the bit interleaver 2520 is
15 replaced with a bit interleaver 2520A.
   [0187]
                 The bit interleaver 2520A receives the codeword in QC-LDPC code from the
   LDPC encoder 2510.                  The codeword is made up of N = 12 cyclic blocks, each cyclic
   block including              Q=   8 bits.  The bit interleaver 2520A performs interleaving on the
20 bits of the codewords.               The bit interleaver 2520A divides the interleaved codeword
   into a plurality of constellation words, each made up of M = 4 bits and indicating one
   of 2      = 16 constellation points, then outputs the constellation words to the constellation
   mapper 2530.                 The bit interleaver 2520A may apply the bit interleaving process
   discussed with reference to Figs. 32 through 34, or may apply a variant bit permutation
25 process (excluding cases where F = 1).                Also, the bit interleaver 2520A may apply an
   additional cyclic block permutation process (excluding cases where F = 1), such as the
   process discussed with reference to Figs. 35 and 36 or a variation thereof.

                 The following describes a receiver receiving signals from a transmitter that
   includes the bit interleaver performing a bit interleaving process that satisfies
   Conditions IA and 2A.
   [0189]
 5               Fig. 38 is a block diagram of an example receiver, including a non-iterative
   BICM decoder, pertaining to a further Embodiment of the disclosure.          The receiver
   performs the transmitter operations in reverse.      The receiver 2700A shown in Fig. 38
   is configured similarly to the receiver 2700 of Fig. 27, differing in that the bit
   deinterleaver 2730 is replaced by a bit deinterleaver 2730A.
10 [0190]
                 The bit deinterleaver 2730A performs an interleaving process on the soft bit
   sequence output from the constellation demapper 2720 so as to cancel the bit
   interleaving process applied to the bit sequence by the bit interleaver 2520A in the
   transmitter 2500A.
15 [0191]
                 Fig. 39 is a block diagram of an example receiver, including a non-iterative
   BICM decoder, pertaining to a further Embodiment of the disclosure.          The receiver
   performs the transmitter operations in reverse.      The receiver 2800A shown in Fig. 39
   is configured similarly to the receiver 2800 of Fig. 28, differing in that the bit
20 deinterleaver 2730 and the bit interleaver 2750 are replaced by a bit deinterleaver
   2730A and a bit deinterleaver 2750A.
   [0192]
                 The bit interleaver 2750A performs an interleaving process on the extrinsic
   information using the same interleaving rules as the interleaving process applied to the
25 bit sequence by the bit interleaver 2520A in the transmitter 2500A.
   [0193]
                 From a hardware implementation perspective, folding is desirable in that, for
   example, the bits of a constellation are thereby located in fewer LLR memory locations.
                                                 49
    10047624_1(GHMatters P95158.AU.2

   Typically, the LLR memory in the decoder includes GxN addressable memory
    locations, each location being capable of storing QIG LLR values.                 Here, G is an
    implementation parameter that is a divisor of              Q  and is hereinafter referred to as
   memory granularity.                The LLR memory locations in the decoder and the LLR values
 5  of the first constellation are shown in Fig. 40, where M = 4, F = 2,            Q=   12, and G  =
    1-12.
    [0194]
                  The number of LLR values per memory location, i.e., the value of Q/G, is
   necessarily a multiple of F.              The LLR values of each constellation are thus stored at
10 the same position in all memory locations.              This ensures that the LLR values of any
    constellation word are stored in MIF memory locations.              A counter-example is given
    in Fig. 40 where G = 4, and 12/4 = 3 LLR values are stores at each memory location.
   The LLR values of the second and fifth constellation words are each stored at four
   memory locations rather than at two memory locations.
15  [0195]
                  In addition to simple QAM constellations where folding with F = 2 is
    applicable, folding is even more useful when two or more constellation symbols are
   jointly         decoded.            Joint  decoding  is   necessary,   for   instance,    for  the
   maximum-likelihood decoding of block codes (e.g., space-time codes, space-frequency
20  codes, and the like), and for rotated constellations in two or more dimensions.
    [0196]
                  In general, a block code encodes two or more input symbols (e.g., x 1, ..., XK)
    onto two or more output symbols (e.g., y1 , ..., yL.             Here, L is at least equal to K.
   The block codes are modeled on an LxK generator matrix.                   Here, the output signal
25 vector Y is obtained as a result of left-multiplying the input signal vector X by the
   generator matrix G (i.e., Y= GX).
    [0197]
                  The elements of the input signal vector X and the output signal vector Y, as
                                                       50
     10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   well as the elements of the generator matrix G, may be real or complex.                   Depending
   on the type of code, the output signal vector Ymay be transmitted in different time slots
   or in different frequency slots, may be transmitted over different antennas, or may be
   transmitted using a variety of different time slots, frequency slots, and antennas.
 5 [0198]
                  In the receiver, maximum-likelihood decoding is required in order to decode
   all elements of the input signal vector X. Examples of block codes for multiple-input
   multiple-output (hereinafter, MIMO) systems include Alamouti codes, Golden codes,
   and spatial multiplexing.
10 [0199]
                  When K symbols are encoded in the same block, a folding factor of up to K is
   obviously useable.                 Further, provided that the symbols are QAM symbols (including
   two divisible PAM symbols), then the folding factor may be increased to 2K.
   [0200]
15                According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, when constellations of
   different sizes, i.e., hybrid constellations, are jointly encoded, the two constellations
   have different robustness levels.               Thus, for example, the cyclic block to which the bits
   of one constellation word are mapped is distinct from the cyclic block to which the bits
   of the other constellation word are mapped.
20 [0201]
                  The following describes an example of a coded spatial-multiplexing MIMO
   system using two transmit antennas.                 The complex signal prior to coding is X= [xi x 2 ].
   Here, xi is a signal to which QPSK has been applied, and x2 is a signal to which
    16-QAM has been applied.                   The complex signal after decoding is Y= [y 1 y2].  Here,
25 yi and y 2 are signals respectively transmitted by a first antenna and a second antenna.
   Y is obtained through a left-multiplication of X with a 2x2 generator matrix G (where
   the elements of G may be either real or complex) (i.e., Y= GX).

                 Fig. 41 illustrates an example of mapping with a folding factor of F = 2, when
   multiplexing QPSK symbols with 16-QAM symbols in a single block code.                 Fig. 41
   indicates only the first seven bits of the cyclic blocks.        The two complex symbols x1

                 x1 is a QPSK symbol having a real part bI and an imaginary part b2.

10 [0205]
                 The two symbols are jointly decoded by the receiver and thus form a
   constellation block or generated block.

   [0210]
                 When one of the constellations has M1 bits and the other constellation has M2
   bits, the N cyclic groups are divided into one or more groups of M1 cyclic block and
   one or more groups of M2 cyclic blocks in order to perform the bit interleaving
25 process.

                 (Embodiment 3)
                 The following describes an example of an interleaver perfonring folding in a
                                                    52

   situation where N is not a multiple of M.
   [0212]
                  Fig. 42 illustrates a cyclic block subject to and a cyclic block excluded from
   (i.e., an excluded block) the interleaving process where F = 2, described above.             In
 5 Fig. 42, the code is 16K LDPC code conforming to the DVB-T2 standard, and the
   constellation is a 16-QAM constellation.              As shown, 44 of the cyclic blocks are
   subject to interleaving (i.e., blocks I through 44), and cyclic block 45, in the last row,
   is the one cyclic block not subject to interleaving (i.e., the excluded block).        The four
   blackened squares represent the four bits of the first constellation.
10 [0213]
                  Fig. 43 is a schematic block diagram of a bit interleaver performing folding
   when N is not a multiple of M.           For simplicity, the following values hold: N = 13, Q=
   8, M= 4, and F= 2.
   [0214]
15                The number of folding sections is floor(N/(M/F)) = 6, and the number of
   excluded cyclic blocks is rem(N, MIF) = 1.
   [0215]
                  The bit interleaver 2000B selects 13-1 = 12 cyclic blocks from among cyclic
   blocks QB1-QB13, such that the selected cyclic blocks QB1-QB 12 satisfy conditions
20 Al and A2 and are subject to interleaving.               The bit permutator 2010A in the bit
   interleaver 2000B performs the permutation process described with reference to Fig. 32
   on the twelve selected cyclic blocks.          Although the bits of cyclic block QB 13 are here
   mapped to a constellation word without interleaving, interleaving may also be applied
   prior to mapping to the constellation word.
25 [0216]
                  As an example of an interleaver not performing folding when N is not a
   multiple of M, the bit permutator 2010A shown in Fig. 43 may be replaced by the
   permutator 2010 shown in Fig. 20.

                  (Supplement 1)
                  The present disclosure is not limited to the Embodiments described above.
   Provided that the aims of the invention and accompanying aims are achieved, other
 5 variations are also possible, such as the following.
   [0218]
   (1)            Embodiment 1 is described above using the parameters N = 12,          Q = 8, and M=
   4.      However, no limitation to the parameters N, M, and            Q is intended.   Here, N may
   be any multiple of M.               When N is two or more times M, the processing by the bit
10 interleaver is divisible into a plurality of sections.
   [0219]
   (2)            In Embodiment 2, when folding is used, i.e., when F is two or greater, the
   parameters given for the example are N = 12,              Q=   8, M = 4, and a folding factor of F =
   2.      However, no limitation to the parameters N, M, Q, and F is intended.            Here, F is a
15 divisor of M and Q, and N is a multiple of MIF.
   [0220]
   (3)            In Embodiment 2, when folding is used, the value of F is given as two, which
   is the number of bits having the same robustness level in a single 16-QAM
   constellation.              However, no limitation is intended.   The value of F need not be equal
20 to the number of bits having the same robustness level in a constellation, and may
   indeed be other than the number of bits having the same robustness level in a
   constellation.
   [0221]
   (4)            In Embodiment 2, when folding is used, the example describes a folding factor
25 of F = 2, and QAM constellations being 16-QAM constellations.                         However, no
   limitation is intended.             When F = 2, the QAM constellations may be other than
    16-QAM constellations (e.g., 64-QAM constellations or 256-QAM constellations).
   [0222]

   (5)            In the above-described Embodiments, the constellations are described as
    16-QAM (i.e., M = 4).                   However, the constellations may be specified by other
   modulation methods such as QPSK and QAM, such as the circular constellations
   employed in the DVB-S2 standard, higher-dimensional constellations, and so on.
 5 [0223]
   (6)            The methods and devices discussed in the above Embodiments may be
   implemented as software or as hardware.                 No particular limitation is intended in this
   regard.         Specifically, the above-described Embodiments may be implemented as a
   computer-readable medium having embodied thereon computer-executable instructions
10 that are adapted for allowing a computer, a microprocessor, a microcontroller, and the
   like       to     execute          the above-described   methods.     Also,    the  above-described
   Embodiments may be implemented as an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
   (ASIC) or as an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

                  The bit interleaving method, bit interleaver, bit deinterleaving method, bit
   deinterleaver, and decoder of the present disclosure, and the effects thereof, are
   described below.
   [0225]
20                In a first aspect of a bit interleaving method, a bit interleaving method for a
   communication system using quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes comprises: a
   reception step of receiving a codeword of the quasi-cyclic low-density parity check
   codes made up of N cyclic blocks each including                   Q bits; a bit permutation step of
   applying a bit permutation process to the codeword so as to permute the bits in the
25 codeword; and a division step of dividing the codeword, after the bit permutation
   process, into a plurality of constellation words, each of the constellation words being
   made up of M bits and indicating one of 2m constellation points in a predetermined
   constellation, wherein prior to the bit permutation process, the codeword is divided into
                                                          55
     10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   FxN/M folding sections, F being an integer greater than one, each of the folding
   sections including MIF of the cyclic blocks, and each of the constellation words being
   associated with one of the FxN/M folding sections, and in the bit permutation step, the
   bit permutation process is applied such that the M bits in each of the constellation
 5 words include F bits from each of MIF different cyclic blocks in a given folding section
   associated with a given constellation word, and such that all bits in the given folding
   section are mapped to only Q/F of the constellation words associated with the given
   folding section.
   [0226]
10               In another aspect, a first bit interleaver for a communication system using
   quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes comprises: a bit permutation unit receiving
   a codeword of the quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes made up of N cyclic
   blocks each including             Q bits, applying a bit permutation process to the codeword so as
   to permute the bits in the codeword, and dividing the codeword, for output after the bit
15 permutation process, into a plurality of constellation words, each of the constellation
   words being made up of M bits and indicating one of 2m constellation points in a
   predetermined constellation, wherein prior to the bit permutation process, the codeword
   is divided into FxN/M folding sections, F being an integer greater than one, each of the
   folding sections including MIF of the cyclic blocks, and each of the constellation words
20 being associated with one of the FxN/M folding sections, and the bit permutation unit
   applies the bit permutation process such that the M bits in each of the constellation
   words include F bits from each of M/F different cyclic blocks in a given folding section
   associated with a given constellation word, and such that all bits in the given folding
   section are mapped to only QIF of the constellation words associated with the given
25 folding section.
   [0227]
                 Accordingly, reductions           in circuit surface area and in electric power
   consumption are achieved, in addition to enabling the realization of a bit interleaving
                                                         56
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   process having high parallelism.
   [0228]
                 In a second aspect of the bit interleaving method, the bit permutation step
   includes a folding section permutation step of independently applying a folding section
 5 permutation process to each of the FxN/M folding sections so as to permute the bits in
   each of the folding sections.
   [0229]
                 Also, in a second aspect of a bit interleaver, the bit permutation unit includes a
   folding section permutation unit independently applying a folding section permutation
10 process to each of the FxNIM folding sections so as to permute the bits in each of the
   folding sections.
   [0230]
                 Accordingly,        a plurality of folding section permutation processes are
   executable in parallel.
15 [0231]
                 In a third aspect of the bit interleaving method, in the folding section
   permutation step, the folding section permutation process is performed such that the           Q
   bits in a given cyclic block are each mapped to a bit of an identical robustness level in
   the Q/F constellation words associated with one of the folding sections that
20 corresponds to the given cyclic block.
   [0232]
                 Also, in a third aspect of a bit interleaver, the folding section permutation unit
   applies the folding section permutation process such that the           Q bits  in a given cyclic
   block are each mapped to a bit of an identical robustness level in the QIF constellation
25 words associated with one of the folding sections that corresponds to the given cyclic
   block.
   [0233]
                 Accordingly, bits of the codeword having the same importance are mapped to
                                                      57
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   bits of the constellation word having the same robustness level, allowing a matching of
   importance and robustness level.                   For example, the bit of the codeword having the
   highest importance may be mapped to a bit of the constellation word having the highest
   robustness level.                 In such a case, high reliability is achieved at reception time for the
 5 bit of the codeword having the highest importance, resulting in greater reception
   capability.
   [0234]
                 In a fourth aspect of the bit interleaving method, F is equal to a number of bits
   of an identical robustness level in one of the constellation words .
10 [0235]
                 Also, in a fourth aspect of a bit interleaver, F is equal to a number of bits of an
   identical robustness level in one of the constellation words.
   [0236]
                 Accordingly, an effective hardware implementation is realized.
15 [0237]
                 In a fifth aspect of the bit interleaving method, F = 2, and the constellation
   words are QAM constellations.
   [0238]
                 Also, in a fifth aspect of a bit interleaver, F = 2, and the constellation words
20 are QAM constellations.
   [0239]
                 Accordingly, an effective hardware implementation is realized.
   [0240]
                 In a sixth aspect of the bit interleaving method, the folding section permutation
25 step includes a column-row permutation step of applying a column-row permutation
   process to the M/FxQ bits in each of the folding sections so as permute the M/FxQ
   bits.
   [0241]
                                                            58
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

                 In a seventh aspect of the bit interleaving method, the column-row permutation
   process is equivalent to writing the M/FxQ bits row-wise into a matrix having                 Q
   columns and MIF rows, then reading the M/FxQ bits column-wise.
   [0242]
 5               Also, in a sixth aspect of a bit interleaver, the folding section permutation unit
   applies a column-row permutation process to the M/FxQ bits in each of the folding
   sections so as permute the M/FxQ bits.
   [0243]
                 Accordingly, a column-row permutation is used in the folding section
10 permutation process, thus enabling the realization of an extremely efficient folding
   section permutation process.
   [0244]
                 In a further aspect, a bit deinterleaving method for deinterleaving a bit stream
   in a communication                system using quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes
15 comprises: a reception step of receiving a bit sequence made up of NxQ bits; and a
   reverse bit permutation step of applying a reverse bit permutation process to the
   received bit sequence so as to permute the bits in the bit sequence in order to restore the
   codeword of the quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes, wherein the reverse bit
   permutation process reverses the bit permutation process in the bit interleaving method
20 of the first aspect.
   [0245]
                 In an alternate aspect, a bit deinterleaver for deinterleaving a bit stream in a
   communication system using quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes comprises: a
   reverse bit permutation unit receiving a bit sequence made up of NxQ bits, and
25 applying a reverse bit permutation process to the received bit sequence so as to permute
   the bits in the bit sequence in order to restore a codeword of the quasi-cyclic
   low-density parity check codes , wherein the reverse bit permutation process reverses
   the bit permutation process applied by the bit interleaver of the first aspect.
                                                      59
    10047624_1(GHMatter1 P95158.AU.2

   [0246]
                 In another aspect, a decoder for a bit interleaving and demodulating system
   using quasi-cyclic low-density parity check codes, comprising:                a constellation
   demapper generating a soft bit sequence indicating a probability of a corresponding bit
 5 being one of a zero-bit and a one-bit; the bit deinterleaver of the alternate aspect
   deinterleaving the soft bit sequence; and a low-density parity check decoder decoding
   the deinterleaved soft bit sequence.
   [0247]
                 In yet another aspect, the decoder of the other aspect further comprises: a
10 subtraction unit subtracting input to the low-density parity check decoder from output
   of the low-density parity check decoder; and the bit interleaver of the first aspect,
   providing the difference from the subtraction unit to the constellation demapper as
   feedback.
   [0248]
15               Accordingly, a bit interleaving process having high parallelism is realizable.
   [Industrial Applicability]
   [0249]
                 The present invention is applicable to a bit interleaver in a bit-interleaved
   coding and modulation system used for quasi-cyclic low-density parity codes, and to a
20 bit deinterleaver corresponding to such a bit interleaver.
