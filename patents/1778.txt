   RELATED APPLICATION
   This application claims priority from Australian provisional patent application number
 5 <removed-apn>, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   Embodiments relate generally to systems and methods for marking waypoint locations.
   BACKGROUND
   Marine fishing vessels tend to carry separate GPS and fish finder units on board. These
10 devices can both generate and store geographical waypoints or markers which can be
   used to mark geographical points of interest, such as schools of fish, refuelling depots
   or geological features. There are pros and cons to storing waypoints on each type of
   device.    A benefit of fish finders is that they allow users to mark waypoints at
   geographical locations other than the current location of the fish finder, enabling after
15 the-event waypoint marking of sites of interest. GPS units typically only allow users to
   mark waypoints in realtime, each waypoint associated with the realtime location of the
   GPS unit. GPS units do, however, provide storage for many more waypoints than the
   typical fish finder. GPS units are also able to use waypoints for navigational purposes,
   such as controlling auto-pilot equipment, plotting lay-lines etc.
20 Many GPS and fish finder units include functionality to communicate waypoint (and
   other) information between one another to maximise the benefits of both a vessel's
   GPS and its fish finder. These units tend to use a standard communications protocol,
   such as National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) protocol number 0183 or
   similar to communicate.     However, whilst some GPS and fish finder manufacturers
25 follow the strict protocols set out in the NMEA-0183 protocol, other manufacturers
   deviate from the standard, preventing devices using an NMEA                standard from
   communicating with their devices. An example of this is the Furuno (RTM) brand of
   fish finder, examples of which transmit waypoint information in a different format to

                                                2
   that defined by the NMEA. This different format cannot be read by most non-Furuno
   (RTM) made GPS units.
   Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has
   been included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or
 5 all of these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge
   in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of
   each claim of this application.
   SUMMARY
   Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or
10 "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or
   step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element,
   integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Embodiments described herein provide a translation device which enables data transfer
   between GPS and fish finder units communicating using different protocols.
20 Particularly, embodiments enable communication between devices using a NMEA
   protocol, such as NMEA-0183 or NMEA-2000, and devices using the Furuno (RTM)
   proprietary protocol. Such communication is aided by way of a translation device
   configured to monitor an output stream from one device and translate information
   having one format into another, different format readable by another device.
25

                                                   7
   As an example, Figure 1 provides a schematic illustration of a system 100 in
   accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.          The system 100 comprises a
   GPS unit 102, a fish finder 104 and a waypoint translation device 106.
 5 The GPS unit 102 and the fish finder 104 may be operatively coupled to one another
   via one or more wired or wireless interconnects 108 to provide the fish finder 104 with
   geographical location data generated by the GPS unit 102. In some embodiments, the
   fish finder 104 may have its own inbuilt GPS, in which case this connection may not be
   required. In some embodiments, the one or more wired or wireless interconnects 108
10 may comprise a converter, adapter or gateway (not shown) operable to convert data
   transmitted between the GPS unit 102 and the fish finder 104 into different formats.
   For example, where the GPS unit 102 communicates using NMEA-2000 and the fish
   finder 104 communicates using NMEA-0183, the interconnect(s) 108 may be operable
   to convert NMEA-0183 data into NMEA-2000 data and vice-versa.              Such data may
15 include dynamic GPS data associated with the current position of the GPS unit 102.
   The fish finder 104 is provided with a user interface comprising a display 110 which
   graphically displays measurements of reflected sound received at a submerged antenna
   (not shown), together with an input device 112 which allows the user to operate the fish
20 finder 104. The input device 112 may be implemented in hardware using, for example,
   hard buttons. Additionally or alternatively, the input device 112 may be implemented
   in software using a touch screen integrated into the display 110. The input device 112
   may comprise a waypoint "Mark" button 114.              When the waypoint button 114 is
   pressed by the user, the fish finder 104 generates a waypoint sentence comprising
25 geographical location (waypoint) data. The geographical waypoint data generated by
   the fish finder 104 may be associated with the current location of the fish finder or with
   a location different to the current location which has been chosen by the user upon
   interaction with the user interface.     As such, it will be appreciated that geographical
   waypoint data is distinguished from GPS location data in that GPS data is dynamically
30 updated based on the position of a GPS receiver, whereas geographical waypoint data
   is not dependent on the location of a GPS receiver. Instead, geographical waypoint
   data is data which is associated with a geographical location that a user wishes to
   record so that it can be recalled at a later time or date.
35 The fish finder further comprises at least one serial waypoint output 116 that outputs
   the waypoint data in a format or communications protocol used by the fish finder 104,

                                               8
   hereinafter referred to as a first communications protocol (protocol 1). The fish finder
   waypoint output 116 is operatively coupled to an input of the waypoint translation
   device 106.
 5 The GPS unit 102 is also provided with a user interface comprising a display 118 and a
   input device 120. The input device may comprise a waypoint "Mark" button 122
   which, when pressed by a user, causes the GPS unit 102 to generate a waypoint
   sentence comprising geographical location data associated with the current location of
   the GPS unit. The GPS unit 102 is further provided with at least one serial waypoint
10 input 124 configured to receive serial waypoint data in a format associated with a
   communications protocol used by the GPS unit 102, hereinafter referred to as a second
   communications protocol (protocol 2). An output of the waypoint translation device
   106 is communicatively coupled to the waypoint input of the GPS unit 102.
15 The system may also comprises a remote waypoint controller 126 communicatively
   coupled to the waypoint translation device 106. The remote waypoint controller 126
   comprises a waypoint input device 128, such as a button. In response to a user pressing
   interacting with the waypoint input device 128, remote waypoint controller 126 may
   cause the waypoint translation device 106 to output waypoint data in the second format
20 to the GPS unit 102, causing the GPS unit 102 to store a waypoint associated with the
   current geographical position of the GPS unit 102. The remote waypoint controller 126
   may be physically connected to the waypoint translation device 106. Alternatively the
   remote waypoint controller 126 may be a wireless device operable to be wirelessly
   coupled to the waypoint translation device 106 in any known manner. In some
25 embodiments, the remote waypoint controller 126 may be implemented on a
   smartphone running software configured to wirelessly communicate with the waypoint
   translation device 106.
   Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a variation of the system 100 shown in Figure 1,
30 where like parts have been denoted with like numbering. In the system 130 shown in
   Figure 1, instead of there being provided one or more separated wired or wireless
   interconnects 108 as present in the system 100 of Figure 1, the GPS unit 102 and the
   fish finder 104 may be operatively coupled to one another via the waypoint translation
   device 104, via wired or wireless interconnects 132, 134, for transmission of
35 geographical location data generated by the GPS unit 102 to the fish finder 104. In
   which case, the waypoint translation device 104 may be operable to convert data

                                                9
   transmitted between the GPS unit 102 and the fish finder 104 into different formats.
   For example, where the GPS unit 102 communicates using NMEA-2000 and the fish
   finder 104 communicates using NMEA-0183, the waypoint translation device 106 may
   be operable to convert NMEA-0183 data received from the fish finder into NMEA
 5 2000 data for onward transmission to the GPS unit 102, and vice-versa.
   It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the GPS location data may be
   communicated via the same communications path as that which is used to transmit or
   receive waypoint data. For example, GPS location data may be output to the waypoint
10 translation device 106 from the waypoint input 124. In which case, interconnect 132
   may not be required. In such cases, the GPS unit 102 may be operable to communicate
   using the NMEA-2000 protocol, which supports bidirectional communication.
   Additionally or alternatively, the fish finder may be operable to receive GPS location
   data from the waypoint translation device 106 over the same communications path as
15 that which is used to transmit waypoint data, i.e. via the serial waypoint output 116. In
   which case, interconnect 134 may not be required.
   Figure 3 schematically illustrates the waypoint translation device 106 in more detail.
   The translation device 106 comprises a processor 202, memory 204, and an
20 input/output (I/O) module 206 for receiving data from the fish finder 104 and waypoint
   controller 108 and sending data to the GPS unit 102. The processor 202, memory 204
   and input/output module 206 communicate via a communications bus 208 in any
   manner known in the art.
25 In some embodiments, both the GPS unit 102 and the fish finder 104 are configured to
   communicate waypoint information in serial, for example using RS-232 or RS-485,
   whereas the waypoint translation device 106 may be configured to receive parallel data.
   In such circumstances, the system 100 may further comprises a serial to transistor
   transistor logic (TTL) converter 210 to convert serial data output from the fish finder
30 waypoint output 116 into TTL format for input to the I/O module and a TTL to serial
   converter 212 to convert digital data output from the 1/0 module to serial data for input
   to the waypoint input 112 of the GPS unit 102. In other embodiments, the waypoint
   translation device 106 may be configured to receive serial data or the serial to TTL
   converter 210 and the TTL to serial converter 212 may be integral to the waypoint
35 translation device 106.

                                                10
   The waypoint translation device 106 may be implemented in hardware or software or a
   combination thereof. In some embodiments, the waypoint translation device 106 is
   implemented using a microcontroller, an example of which is the ATmega328P from
   Atmel (RTM).
 5
   A problem arises when the first communications protocol used by the fish finder 104 is
   different to the second communications protocol used by the GPS unit 102. As will be
   explained in more detail below, the waypoint translation device 106 is configured to
   convert data in the format associated with the first protocol (a first format) to data in a
10 format associated with the second protocol (a second format) so that the GPS unit 102
   can successfully interpret data output from the fish finder 104.
   In the following examples, the second communications protocol used by the GPS unit
   102 is NMEA-0 183 and the first communications protocol used by the fish finder is an
15 unconventional non-NMEA protocol, such as the Furuno (RTM) protocol.             It will be
   appreciated that other embodiments of the waypoint translation device 106 may equally
   be able to interpret and convert data in formats other than those described in the
   following examples. In some embodiments, for example, the second communications
   protocol is NMEA-2000 and the waypoint translation device 106 is operable to
20 translate NMEA-2000 into a non-NMEA protocol, such as the Furuno (RTM) protocol.
   NMEA-0183
   NMEA-0183 sentences are transmitted and received using standard serial transmission
25 protocol RS-232, and in some cases RS-485. These are both electrical standards which
   define the voltages, timing, and format of the bytes of serial data. In some instances,
   GPS unit 102 may be configured to transmit and receive both RS-485 and RS-232
   encoded data.
30 A typical NMEA-0 183 sentence format is shown below.
   $(Sentence ID), (Field1), (Field2), (Field 3), . . . , (Field N)*(Checksum)<CR><LF>
   All sentences begin with a '$' character immediately followed by a five character
35 sentence ID. Each sentence contains a series of ASCII data fields separated by a

                                                11
   comma. Fields with no information are left empty, with no spaces taken up (but with
   the separation commas left intact).
   An asterisk '*' designates the end of the last data field and is followed by a two digit
 5 hexadecimal checksum. The checksum is the hexadecimal result of the logical function
   "Exclusive OR" (XOR) of all the characters in the sentence between, but not including,
   the '$' and the '*'.
   Following the checksum, the sentence is terminated with a carriage return character and
10 a line feed character.
   The maximum length of a sentence is 82 characters including the return and line feed
   characters.
15 There are several types of NMEA-0 183 sentence indicated by a standard NMEA-0 183
   message description included in the first field of a sentence.            Examples of these
   message descriptions include RMC (recommended minimum data for GPS), GGA (Fix
   information), GLL (Latitude/longitude data) and WPL (waypoint location information).
   The first field of each sentence also includes a two letter prefix which indicates the
20 source of the sentence, or alternatively, the company code. As an example, the prefix
   "GP" in the first field of a sentence indicates that it was sourced from a GPS, whereas
   the prefix "SD" means that it was sourced from a depth sounder. The majority of fish
   finders on the market do not have inbuilt GPS transceivers. Accordingly, at least one
   of the type RMC, GGA and GLL sentences may be transmitted via interconnect 108 to
25 the fish finder 104 from the GPS unit 102.
   Examples of the above NMEA-0183 sentence types will now be described. For data
   translation purposes, the two letter prefix is functionally irrelevant and in the following
   examples, to avoid confusion, the prefix has been replaced by "--".

   Non-NMEA protocols
20 In some embodiments, the fish finder 106 is configured to transmit waypoint data using
   a non-NMEA protocol.        In this example, this first communications protocol take a
   slightly different format to that ofNMEA-0183. Firstly, the sentence description is not
   a recognised NMEA sentence description.          Instead, the sentences transmitted and
   received at the fish finder 104 have the sentence description "TLL".

10
   It can be seen from the above that much of the same information as that contained in a
   NMEA WPL sentence is provided in a TLL sentence, but the position of the
   information in the sentence is not standard.
15 Accordingly, in order to communicate waypoint information between the GPS unit 102
   and the fish finder 104, the waypoint translation device 106 must be provided to
   translate the information received in TLL format from the fish finder 104 into WPL
   format for transmission to the GPS unit 102.          Figures 3 to 6 illustrate processes
   associated with performing this translation.
20
   Figure 4 illustrates a process 300 executed by the waypoint translation device 106 in
   accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.         The process is repeated constantly
   while the translation device 106 is active (e.g. switched on).
25 At step 302, the translation device 106 polls for incoming data from the fish finder 104.
   If it is determined at step 304 that no data has been received from the fish finder 104,
   the process transitions back to step 302 where polling for incoming data is repeated. If
   it is determined at step 304 that data is being received at the I/O device 206, then at step
   306 incoming characters are read and stored in a data buffer or other memory.
30
   At step 308, the process 300 then checks that the received character is indicative of the
   end of a sentence, i.e., the received character is an end-of-sentence character such as
   "<CR><LF>". If it is determined that the end of a sentence has not been reached, the
   process 300 returns to step 302, where the next character is read, stored and added to
35 the sentence. If on the other hand it is determined that the end of the sentence has been
   reached, the incoming sentence is finalised at step 310. The process 300 is repeated

                                                16
   constantly while the device is switched on to ensure no incoming sentences (or
   characters thereof) are missed.
   As soon as the data buffer is flagged as containing a complete sentence, the sentence is
 5 analysed to determine how it is to be handled by the translation device 106. A process
   400 for performing such analysis is shown in Figure 5.
   Firstly, at step 402, the message description field of the sentence is parsed to check
   what type of sentence has been received. At step 404, if the sentence is determined to
10 be in the TTL format, the sentence is flagged at step 406 for translation into WPL
   format. If the sentence is found not to be in the TTL format, optionally at step 408, a
   determination is also made as to whether the sentence is an RMC, GGA or GLL
   sentence received from a GPS device ("GP"). If this is the case, the sentence is sent to
   a co-ordinate storage process at step 410 to store the coordinates contained in the
15 sentence. If the sentence is not a GPRMC, GPGGA or GPGLL sentence, then at step
   412 the sentence is sent to the I/O module 206 to be sent to the GPS unit 102 without
   change. The process 400 then ends at step 414 and analysis of the next received
   sentence is commenced.
20 A process 500 for generating a WPL format sentence based on a received TLL format
   sentence is shown in Figure 6. An array, "WPLSentence" is created in memory which
   provides a WPL format template, as shown below.
   WPLsentence      = "$GPWPL," + WPTlat +         "," + WPTns +   "," + WPTlong +    "," +
25 WPTew + ",Fish-" + WaypointNumber + "1*";
   Referring to Figure 6, at step 502, the first relevant (non-empty) field in the TLL
   sentence, e.g. TLL latitude, is read from the sentence and copied to the relevant
   variable of the WPLsentence array, e.g. "WPTlat" at step 504. At step 506, the process
30 500 checks whether there are any further unchecked fields in the received TLL
   sentence. If unchecked fields exist, the process 500 repeats steps 502, 504 and 506
   until there are no unchecked fields in the received TLL sentence. At step 508, the full
   sentence is built and all field variables are copied into the new WPL sentence at step
   510. When it is determined that there are no more fields to add to the WLP sentence at
35 step 512, a waypoint name and number are added to the sentence (as these are not
   typically present in a TLL sentence) at step 514. A new checksum is then calculated at

                                               17
   step 516 associated with the new WPL sentence and at step 518 the complete WPL
   sentence is sent to the I/O module 206 for transmission to the GPS unit 102 and the
   process ends (520). The process is repeated for each new TLL sentence received by the
   waypoint translation device 106.
 5
   In some embodiments, the step of calculating the checksum (step 516) involves
   calculating the logical "XOR" of all the characters in the WPL sentence between, but
   not including the "$' and the "*" symbols. The result is a 2 digit hexadecimal number
   which can be stored in the checksum field of the WPL sentence.
10
   As mentioned above, in some embodiments, a remote waypoint controller 126 is
   provided which allows a user to mark a waypoint on the GPS unit 102 remotely without
   needing to interact with either the GPS unit 106's waypoint button 122 or the fish
   finder 104's waypoint button 114. Figure 7 provides a flow diagram of an exemplary
15 process 600 for operating the remote waypoint controller 126. As mentioned above,
   one or more of an RMC, GGA or GLL NMEA-0 183 sentence may be transmitted either
   from the fish finder 104 or the GPS unit 102. It is noted that not all GPS devices are
   configured to transmit all three of the above references sentence types. Accordingly,
   preferably the waypoint translation device 106 is configured to recognise any one of
20 these sentence types.
   Referring again to Figure 7, at step 602, the RMC, GGA or GLL sentence is input into
   the process 600.       At step 604, the first relevant (non-empty) field in the
   RMC/GGA/GLL sentence is read from the sentence and copied to the relevant variable
25 of the WPLsentence array, e.g. "WPTlat" at step 606. At step 608, the process 600
   checks whether there are any further unchecked fields in the received sentence.         If
   unchecked fields exist, the process 600 repeats steps 604, 606 and 608 until there are no
   unchecked fields in the received sentence.
30 At step 610, the process 600 checks to see whether the remote waypoint controller 126
   has signalled a user interaction (e.g. the user has triggered the waypoint input device
   128). If it is determined at step 610 that the input device 128 has been triggered, then
   the received RMC, GGA or GLL sentence is discarded and the process ends (626). If,
   however, it is determined at step 610 that the remote waypoint controller 126 has been
35 triggered, the process 600 triggers a lockout of the waypoint controller 126 at step 612
   for a predetermined period of time, e.g. 5 seconds.         Any event at the waypoint

                                                 18
   controller 126 during this time period are discarded. This ensures that identical WPL
   sentences will not be generated in quick succession in the event that the waypoint
   button 128 is continuously triggered (e.g. held down for an extended period).
 5 At step 614, the full WPL sentence is built and all field variables are copied into the
   new WPL sentence at step 616. When it is determined that there are no more fields to
   add to the WLP sentence at step 618, a waypoint name and number may be added to
   the sentence at step 620. A new checksum may then be calculated at step 622
   associated with the new WPL sentence and at step 624 the complete WPL sentence is
10 sent to the I/O module 206 for transmission to the GPS unit 102 and the process ends
   (626).
   It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or
   modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments, without departing
15 from the broad general scope of the present disclosure. The present embodiments are,
   therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.
