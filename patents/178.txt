   Background of the Invention
           Current methods for reducing the appearance of skin imperfections, for example
   wrinkles, fine lines, age spots, enlarged pores or scars, include invasive and non-invasive
   methods and formulations. Invasive techniques, such as surgery, fillers (e.g., Restylane,
   Juvederm), laser resurfacing or Botox", may provide longer-lasting effects and can treat
   prominent imperfections. However, many consumers either cannot afford or do not wish
25  undergo such drastic cosmetic treatments.
           Examples of non-invasive methods include hiding imperfections by applying a
   foundation-type make-up to the skin or applying a cosmetic formulation that includes an
   ingredient that may reduce the appearance of the imperfections over time (e.g., an anti
   wrinkle cream), Unfortunately, foundation make-up is not durable and cannot reduce the
30 appearance of pronounced skin imperfections, such as deep wrinkles or scars, while
   cosmetic formulations containing ingredients that may reduce the appearance of an
   imperfection take time to produce an effect, and also may not reduce the appearance of a
   pronounced imperfection. In particular, many current cosmetic formulations do not have
   the required mechanical properties to reduce the appearance of pronounced imperfections

              High molecular weight polymers, including proteins and polysaccharides, have
     been used in attempts to develop anti-aging skin care cosmetic formulations (Jachowicz
     et al., Skin Res. and Tech., 2008, 14:312-319). While these polymers change the
     physical properties (e.g., elasticity and stiffness) of the skin upon application to the skin,
 5   they did not provide the durability to enable natural, repeated facial motion for extended
     wear. The commercially available polymer materials used in skincare products today do
     not necessarily provide the elasticity, environmental resistance and skin adhesion for
     long lasting product performance nor do they provide the aesthetic feel and appearance
     required by the consumer of cosmetic products.

             Figure 3 is a chart illustrating the investigator's assessment of two formulations
     by attribute in a randomized double blind clinical trial. The formulations are provided in
     Example 5. The attributes scored included extent of shine reduction, pore reduction,
     deep wrinkle reduction and fine wrinkle reduction. For all attributes the applications of
 5   these two films provided an improvement for the 22 subjects evaluated. These four
     attributes were further detailed by treatment site. These sites are forehead, crow's feet,
     undereye, and the nose bridge ('number 1I's'). Improvements were observed for each
     targeted treatment area.
             Figure 4 is a chart illustrating the assessor's assessment of two formulations
10   described in Example 5 by attribute in a randomized double blind clinical trial. The
     assessor's assessments show an improvement in each of the beauty attributes scored
     following application of the formulations.
             Figure 5 is a chart illustrating the panelist's assessment of two formulations
     described in Example 5, by attribute, in a randomized double blind clinical trial. The
15   attributes evaluated were youthful appearance, mattification (or shine reduction), pore
     size, even skin tone, tightened skin appearance, and wrinkling. For each attribute, the
     panelists, on average experienced an improvement in each benefit following treatment
     with the formulations.
             Figure 6 is a chart illustrating the average age reduction of the panelists as
20   determined by the assessors. Overall age reductions of 8.7 years and 7.7 years age were
     observed for formulation 60-140-LX2 and for formulation 60-140-1, respectively.
             Figure 7 is a chart illustrating the average Griffith's score result from the blinded
     evaluation of the panelist's photographs. The Griffith's score is a standardized
     quantitative measure of the extent of photodamage, where a score of 0 corresponds to no
25   photodamage, and a score of 9 represents severe photodamage. For the two examples,
     the Griffith's score was reduced by 2.15 and by 1.25 points, following application of
     formula 60-140-LX2 and 60-140-1, respectively. This result is consistent with Figures 4
     and 5, where panelists appeared younger following formulation application.

             The language "body corrective formulation" or "formulation" includes cosmetic
     compositions that, when applied to the body, form a film on the body that ameliorate
 5   body imperfections. The language "body imperfections" includes those parts of a
     subject's body that the subject perceives as blemished or a flawed, or in which a skilled
     artisan, for example a dermatologist, an aesthetician or a plastic surgeon, would consider
     as blemished or flawed. The language "body imperfections" include skin imperfections,
     as well as sagging of soft body tissues (e.g., loose or sagging skin, sagging breasts,
10   buttocks, abdomen, jowls, neck and the like). The language "skin imperfections"
     include those items on a subject's skin that the subject perceives as a blemish or a flaw.
     Examples of skin imperfections include port wine stain or nevus flammeus (e.g., nevus

     use of a capillary viscometer, rotational viscometer or rheometer to measure viscosity at
     an instrument specific strain. Specific methods for determining the viscosity of a fluid
20   are shown in Example 8.

     by theory, the cross-linking component induces a reaction between the one or more
10   organopolysiloxanes and the hydride functionalized polysiloxane of the reactive
     reinforcing component causing the condensation of these constituents, such that a film is
     formed upon the skin.
             In some embodiments, the cross-linking component comprises a metal catalyst,
     for example, a platinum catalyst, a rhodium catalyst or a tin catalyst. Examples of
15   platinum catalysts include, for example, platinum carbonyl cyclovinylmethylsiloxane
     complexes, platinum divinyltetramethyldisiloxane complexes, platinum
     cyclovinylmethylsiloxane complexes, platinum octanaldehyde/octanol complexes and
     combinations thereof. An example of a rhodium catalyst includes Tris (dibutylsulfide)
     Rhodium trichloride. Examples of tin catalysts include tin II octoate, Tin II
20   neodecanoate, dibutyltin diisooctylmaleate, Di-n-butylbis(2,4 pentanedionate)tin, di-n
     butylbutoxychlorotin, dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dineodecanoate,
     dimethylhydroxy(oleate)tin and tin II oleate.
             In some embodiments, the cross-linking component further comprises a vinyl
     terminated organopolysiloxane (e.g., a compound of Formula I, II Ila, Ilb or Ic). In
25   some embodiments, the amount of vinyl-terminated polysiloxane is a stabilizing amount
     of vinyl-terminated polysiloxane. The language "stabilizing amount" includes an
     amount that prevents the degradation of the catalyst and/or the crosslinking component
     and/or the body corrective film. In some embodiments, the stabilizing amount of vinyl
     terminated polysiloxane is less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about
30   30%, less than about 20%, less than about 10%, less than about 5% or less than about
     2%. In some embodiments, the stabilizing amount of vinyl-terminated polysiloxane is
     about 1%.

             In some embodiments, the cross-linking component has a viscosity of between
     about 1,000 and about 50,000 cSt or cP at 25 'C.
             In some embodiments, the catalyst is added as a solution and the solution
     comprises between about 1.0 and about 5.0% of the cross-linking component, for
 5   example, about 1.5%, about 2.0%, about 2.5%, about 3.0%, about 3.5%, about 4.0% or
     about 4.5%. In one embodiment, the catalyst is about 2.0% of the cross-linking
     component.
             In some embodiments, the catalyst comprises between about 0.005 and about
     0.04% of the cross-linking component, for example, about 0.005%, about 0.010%, about
10   0.015%, about 0.020%, about 0.025%, about 0.030% or about 0.035% or about 0.040%.
     In one embodiment, the catalyst is about 0.02% of the cross-linking component.
             In some embodiments, the catalyst is present in the cross-linking component in
     an amount of between about 100 ppm and about 500 ppm.
             In some embodiments, the reactive reinforcing component and the cross-linking
15   component are prevented from coming into contact prior to use. The reactive
     reinforcing component and the cross-linking component can be kept from coming into
     contact prior to use by usual means known to one of skill in the art. In one embodiment,
     the skin corrective formulation is a two part formulation in which the reactive
     reinforcing component and said cross-linking component are packaged in separate
20   containers and mixed prior to use. In another embodiment, the reactive reinforcing
     component is applied to the skin first, and the cross-linking component is applied on top
     of the reactive reinforcing component. In yet another embodiment, the cross-linking
     component is applied to the skin first and the reactive reinforcing component is applied
     on top of the cross-linking component. In a further embodiment, the reactive reinforcing
25   component and the cross-linking component are packaged together in the same container
     with a barrier between the two components, and are mixed when the components are
     extracted from the container.

             In some embodiments, the films and formulations described herein comprise one
     or more pigments. The include natural or non-natural coloring agents or dyes. In one
20   embodiment, the pigments are fluorescent dyes.
             In some embodiments, the films and formulation further comprise a pigment
     dispersion formulation. The language "pigment dispersion formulation" includes a
     formulations that are capable of providing one or more pigments to the films or
     formulations as a separate component of the formulation or film. In some embodiments,
25   the pigment dispersion formulation allows for an even distribution of the pigment in the

 5            In some embodiments, the pigment dispersion formulation is applied prior to or
     after the application of the reactive reinforcing component to the skin. In some
     embodiments, the pigment dispersion formulation is applied prior to or after the
     application of the cross-linking component to the skin. In some embodiments, the
     pigment dispersion formulation is applied in between the application of the reactive
10   reinforcing component and the cross-linking component to the skin.
              In some embodiments, the pigment dispersion formulation may be applied to
     skin that has not been subjected to the application of a body corrective formulation or
     film. For example, a subject may apply the pigment dispersion formulation to the skin
     in the area around the body corrective film or formulation, or the subject may apply the
15   pigment formulation to the skin in lieu of applying the body corrective film or
     formulation.

              In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a kit comprising
     a body corrective formulation comprising a reactive reinforcing component and a cross
     linking component. In some embodiments, the kit is a multi-compartment kit
25   comprising at least two compartments in which one compartment comprises the reactive
     reinforcing component and the second compartment comprises the cross linking
     component. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions for use of the
     kit, one or more brushes, one or more swabs, a film removing cleanser or a mirror. In
     some embodiments, the kit further comprises one or more finishing formulations.
30            In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a body corrective
     film prepared by a process comprising the steps of applying a reactive reinforcing
     component to the body; and applying a cross-linking component to the reactive

     reinforcing component, in which the cross-linking component catalyzes an in situ cross

              In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a body corrective
     film prepared by a process comprising the steps of applying a cross-linking component
 5   to the body; and applying a reactive reinforcing component to the cross-linking
     component, in which the cross-linking component catalyzes an in situ cross-linking of
     the reactive reinforcing component.
              The language "body corrective film" includes films that are formed upon the
     reaction of the reactive reinforcing component and the cross-linking component and that,
10   upon formation, ameliorate one or more body imperfections. In some embodiments, the
     body corrective film is a skin corrective film (e.g., a film that ameliorates one or more
     skin imperfections).
              In some embodiments, the body corrective film has an appearance of natural skin
     upon application to the skin. The language "appearance of natural skin" includes the
15   perception that the body corrective film, when applied to the skin, has the look, feel and
     texture of real skin and that the film treated skin has the physical properties (e.g., the
     elasticity and stiffness) of real (e.g., live) skin. A trained observer and/or a technician
     would be able to determine whether the film upon application to the body has the
     appearance of natural skin. For example, a trained observer would be able to determine
20   whether the film, upon application to the body, appears excessively shiny, as described
     in Example 3, or whether the film appears not to move with the underlying musculature
     of the skin by, for example, breaking, buckling or deforming, in response to natural skin
     motion.
              A technician would be able to determine whether the film has the appearance of
25   natural skin upon application to the body. For example, the elasticity and stiffness of
     skin, with or without the body corrective film applied to it, can be assessed by a wide
     variety of methods (Agache et al., Arch. Dermatol.Rev., 269 (1980) 221, the teachings
     of which are incorporated herein by reference). For example, the DermaLab suction cup
     instrument provides one common method to assess the mechanical properties of skin,
30   and has previously shown younger skin to be less stiff and more elastic than aged skin
     (Grahame et al. ClinicalScience 39 (1970) 223-238, the teachings of which are
     incorporated herein by reference). With this method, the stiffness of the skin is
                                                     34

   WO 2012/030984                                                           PCT/US2011/050003
     indicated by the Young's Modulus, a measure calculated by the instrument based on the
     pressure required to suck skin up a predetermined distance.
              In some embodiments, the Young's Modulus of the skin treated with a body
     corrective formulation is reduced by between about 5% to about 70%, for example,
 5   between about 30% and about 60%, or between about 40% and about 50% compared to
     untreated skin. In some embodiments, the Young's Modulus of skin treated with a body
     corrective formulation is reduced by between about 5% and about 25% compared to
     untreated skin.
              The elasticity of the skin is determined by the skin retraction time. The
10   retraction time is obtained by measuring the time it takes for the skin to drop a
     predetermined distance towards its natural position, after the suction pressure is
     removed. In some embodiments, the retraction time of skin treated with a body
     corrective formulation is decreased by between about 5% and about 75%, for example,
     between about 30% and about 60%, or about 50% and about 65% when compared to
15   untreated skin. In some embodiments, the retraction time of skin treated with a body
     corrective formulation is decreased by between about 5% and about 10% compared to
     untreated skin. In some embodiments, the retraction time of the skin treated with the
     film approaches the retraction time of the film alone.
              The skin of the bicep and hand was evaluated before and after the body
20   corrective treatment was applied, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The DermaLab results
     confirmed that the skin was less stiff (Figure 1) and more elastic (Figure 2) after
     product application. The observed reduction in stiffness and the increase in skin
     elasticity are consistent with skin being more youthful.
              In some embodiments, the body corrective film, upon application to the skin, has
25   the appearance and physical properties of youthful, unblemished natural skin. The
     language "youthful skin" includes skin that has mild or no damage, as measured by the
     Griffith's score. The Griffith's score (GS), as shown below, is a quantitative
     measurement of the amount of skin damage subject has.
          -   0-1: No damage
30        -   2-3:  Mild damage
          -   4-5: Moderate damage
          -   6-7: Moderate to severe damage
          -   8-9: Severe damage

              In some embodiments, youthful skin includes skin that has a Griffith's score of
     between about 0 and about 3.
              In some embodiments, the subject has a negative change in Griffith's score
     (AGS) of about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7 or about 8 after
 5   application of the body corrective formulation. In some embodiments, the subject has a
     AGS of between about -0.5 and about -3.0 upon application of the body corrective
     formulation. In one embodiment, the subject has a AGS between about -1 and about
      1.5, between about -1.2 and about -1.3 (e.g., about-1.25) upon application of the body
     corrective formulation. In another embodiment, the subject has a AGS of between about
10   -2.0 and about -3.0, for example, between about -2.0 and about -2.5, or between about
     2.1 and about -2.2 (e.g., about- 2.15) upon application of the body corrective
     formulation.
              One of skill in the art would be able to determine whether the film, upon
     application to the body, has the appearance of youthful, unblemished natural skin by the
15   methods disclosed in Example 6.
              In other embodiments, the film, upon application to the skin, provides stiffness
     and elasticity such that the skin treated with the film appear substantially more similar to
     youthful skin than untreated skin. The term "elasticity" includes the skin's tendency to
     return to its original shape once it's been deformed. The language "elasticity
20   substantially similar to youthful skin" includes the ability of the skin to return to its
     original shape once it's been deformed in a manner similar to that of young skin. The
     term "stiffness" includes the skin's resistance to deformation. The language "stiffness
     substantially similar to youthful skin" includes the ability of the skin to resist
     deformation in a manner similar to that of young skin. A technician would also be able
25   to determine whether the film, upon application to the body, has the aforementioned
     physical properties of youthful, unblemished, natural skin by the techniques described
     above (e.g., using the Dermalab suction cup instrument).
              In some embodiments, the subject and/or observers of the subject perceive an age
     reduction upon application of the body correction formulation. In some embodiments,
30   the perceived age reduction is about 1 year, about 2 years, about 3 years, about 4 years,
     about 5 years, about 6 years, about 7 years, about 8 years, about 9 years, about 10 years,
     about 11 years, about 12 years, about 13 years, about 14 years or about 15 years less
     than the subject's actual age. In some embodiments, the perceived age reduction is
                                                   36

   WO 2012/030984                                                        PCT/US2011/050003
     about 7.5 years less than the subject's actual age upon application of the body corrective
     formulation. In other embodiments, the perceived age reduction is about 8.5 years less
     than the subject's actual age upon application of the body corrective formulation.
              The language "the film is formed" and "film formation" includes the results of
 5   the polymerization reaction that occurs upon the interaction of the reactive reinforcing
     component and the cross-linking component. Without being bound by theory, film
     formation is characterized by a phase transition from the viscous sol state of a mixture to
     that of a continuous interconnected polymer state of film.
              A technician could determine when the film is formed on the body by using
10   routine methods. For example, rheological measurements using small amplitude
     oscillatory shear can determine the continuous evolution of the viscoelastic properties,
     such as elastic modulus (G'), the viscous modulus (G") and the loss of tangent (tan 6) of
     the reacting mixture continuously through the film formation process. In some
     embodiments, the rheometer can be used to determine the cross over time between G'
15   and G" and the time when tan 6 becomes frequency independent, which is a measure of
     film formation. In some embodiments, the film is formed within at least about five
     minutes, for example, within about one minute, about two minutes, about three minutes
     or about four minutes. In some embodiments, the film is formed within at least about 10
     seconds and about 3 minutes.
20            In some embodiments, the skin or body corrective film has a Young's Modulus
     (e.g., tensile strength) of between about 0.01 and about 1 MPa, as illustrated in Example
      1.
              In some embodiments, the fracture strain of the skin or body corrective film has a
     fracture strain of at least about 150%, as measured by Example 1.
25            In some embodiments, the skin or body corrective film has a leather adhesive
     force of greater than about 20 N/mm, for example, greater than about 25 N/mm, greater
     than about 30 N/mm, greater than about 35 N/mm, greater than about 40 N/mm, greater
     than about 45 N/mm, greater than about 50 N/mm, greater than about 55 N/mm, greater

              In some embodiments, the skin or body corrective film has a hysteresis of less
     than about 10% for example, least than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about
     7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less
     than about 2%, less than 1% or about 0%.
 5            In some embodiments, the skin or body corrective film is between about 10 im
     and about 1500 im thick, for example, between about 50 im and about 500 im thick.
     In some embodiments, the film is less than about 100 im thick. The film thickness may
     be measured by methods known to one of skill in the art, for example, by the
     combination of calipers and a calibrated microscope. The thickness of the film may also
10   be digitally measured from a micrograph of the film cross-section. The microscope
     calibration allows for the conversion of measured pixelar distance into metric distance
     units.
              In some embodiments, the skin or body corrective film shrinks by less than
     between about 1 and 30%, for example, between about 1 to about 15%. The amount of
15   shrinking may be determined by methods known to one of skill in the art, for example,
     by the Croll method (Croll, S.G. J. Coatings Tech. 52 (1980) 35, the teachings of which
     are incorporated herein by reference). In this method the film is used to coat one side of
     a thin flexible substrate. The amount of curve developed in the substrate due to the
     shrinking of the coating is used to calculate the magnitude of shrinking of the coating
20   (Francis et al., JMaterSci 2002; 37:4717-31, the teachings of which are incorporated
     herein by reference.)
              In some embodiments, the body corrective films are physiologically stable. The
     language "physiologically stable" includes the durability of the film upon exposure to
     normal skin conditions, for example, humidity, tears, sweat or sebum. The physiological
25   stability may be determined by methods typically used by one of ordinary skill in the art,
     such as an uptake test, which measures the change in weight of the film after exposure to
     a physiological factor. For example, the uptake test may employ a formulation of
     simulated sweat (e.g., 1X phosphate buffered saline solution) or simulated sebum (e.g.,
     25% wax monoesters, 41% triglycerides, 16% free fatty acids and 12% squalene). In
30   some embodiments, the weight of the film increases by less than about 10%, for
     example, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about
     6%, less than about 5%, less than 4%, less than 3%, less than 2%, less than 1% or
     exhibits no increase upon exposure to humidity, tears, sweat or sebum.

     formulation for application to a subject's body, comprising at least one preselected
 5   function modulating component, wherein said composition forms a body corrective film
     upon application to the subject's body.
             The term "preselected" includes components that are chosen prior to the
     preparation of the formulation. For example, the components may be chosen during the

15   physical properties of the film that are necessary to be effectively applied for a particular
     use of the film. For example, if the formulation will be used to minimize shine, the
     modulus should be low relative to the values of the other physical properties of the
     resulting film.
             In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a body corrective
20   formulation that targets a treatment area on a subject's body, comprising at least one

     the body corrective formulations to be selectively adjusted for a target treatment area on
     the body (e.g., under the eye, forehead, lips, buttocks, neck, etc...). The treatment
     specific component or components may be selected based on the physical properties of
     the film that results from the formulations that are necessary to be effectively applied to
30   a target treatment area, as shown in Table 1. For example, if the target treatment area is
     under the eye, the modulus should be low relative to the values of the other physical
     properties of the resulting film.

     constituent.
              The language "adhesion component" includes components that modulate the
20   adherence of the resulting film to the skin, as measured by the leather adhesive test (see
     Example 2). Examples of adhesion components include the reactive constituent (e.g.,
     organopolysiloxane and/or hydride functionalized polysiloxane) and the reinforcing
     constituent.
              The language "matte component" includes components that modulate the gloss

              The language "textural component" includes components that modulate the
     texture of the film so that the resulting film has the look and feel of natural skin, and is
     measured by determining the friction of the film. One of skill in the art can readily
     determine methods to measure the friction of the film, for example, by pressing in and
 5   dragging a cantilever across the surface and recording the resisting force. Higher
     friction corresponds to higher recorded force and rougher surfaces tend to have higher
     friction.
              In some embodiments, the invention pertains, at least in part, to a film removing
     cleanser for use in removing a body corrective film, wherein said film is prepared by a

15   cleanser comprising a film wetting component, a penetration component, a film swelling
     component and a film release component.
              The language "film removing cleanser" includes a cosmetic formulation that,
     when applied to a body corrective film, breaks down the components of the film such

     Example L Cyclic and Extension Pull Test
     Sample preparation: For the purpose of bulk mechanical property determination, target
     materials were cast inside dumbbell shaped molds. The dimensions of the neck of the
     mold were 20 mm in length, 5 mm in width and 1.5 mm in depth. The "handles" of the
 5   mold were 20 mm by 15 mm and provided adequate area to insure secure slip-free grip
     during testing. The mold dimensions are consistent with the ASTM D638 guidelines.
              Once the poured specimens were fully cured and dried, the formed samples were
     extracted from their individual molds by means of a spatula and the geometry of the
     finished pieces was measured with digital calipers to determine precise dimensions.
10
     Mechanical Testing: Mechanical characterization of specimens was carried out on the
     Instron 3342 (Instron, Norwood MA) equipped with 100N load-cell (Instron #2519
      103). Dumbbell shaped samples were mounted onto the instrument via modified Instron
     27 10-101 grips which insured sample didn't slip or fail inside the grips during testing.
15   Two types of tests were performed sequentially on each sample, first the Cyclic Test
     followed by the Extension Pull Test. It is noted that the first test (e.g., the cyclic test)
     had negligible effects on the result of the second test (e.g., the extension pull test). Each
     test was preprogrammed into Bluehill Lite Software used to operate the instrument. The
     parameters and data analysis associated with each of the two tests is described below.
20
     Cyclic Test: In order to determine the elasticity of the materials, a cyclic test was
     designed. The cyclic test was used to determine the most elastic (e.g., spring-like)
     material and an Instant Residual Strain (I.R.S.) was obtained from this test, as described
     below. Generally, the more elastic the material, the faster it returns to its original shape
25   after deformation. For perfectly elastic materials, the I.R.S. and cycle test area approach
     zero, and therefore, the lower the value the better.
             Prior to starting the test, a sample was mounted onto the instrument such that the
     rectangular handle portions of the specimen and none of the specimen neck were fixed
     within the instrument grips. The instrument grip distance was adjusted such that the
30   sample was at neutral extension as indicated by the instrument force being close to zero
     (0.01N). Subsequently, cyclic extension was performed at 1 mm/s to a maximum
     extension of 15% of initial sample length. A total of 15 cycles are executed and
                                                   48

     recorded. The stress strain data recorded by instrument was exported into Excel where
     the reported mechanical properties were calculated.
             An Excel template was used to automatically extract a number of parameters.
     The cyclic Young's Modulus as calculated as the straight line slope of the stress-strain
 5   curve of first cycle between 1% and 4%. The R squared value of the linear fit was above
     0.99 or the Young's Modulus was discarded. The Instant Residual Strain (I.R.S.) was
     calculated for each cycle as the strain difference between the loading and unloading
     curves at half the maximum stress achieved during the 1st cycle. The I.R.S. for the first
     cycle as well as the average I.R.S. for the 4th through 14th cycles were recorded. The
10   area bound by the loading and unloading curves of each cycle was also calculated.
     Good agreement was observed between the I.R.S. and the calculated cycle area.
             The majority of the materials evaluated were sufficiently flexible and elastic such
     that the Cyclic Test could be repeated on the same sample without a significant change
     in calculated properties. This suggests this test does not result in long lasting changes to
15   the tested material.
     Extension Pull Test: The Extension Pull test was used to determine the stiffness and
     stretchiness of a material by measuring the Young's Modulus and Ultimate Strain. The
     Young's Modulus was utilized as a measure of material stiffness, while the Ultimate
20   Strain was used as a measure of material flexibility. In order to develop a film with the
     appearance of skin, the Young's Modulus should fall within a target range (e.g., 0.1-1.0
     MPa), while the fracture strain (as measured by the Ultimate Strain) should be
     sufficiently high (e.g., greater than about 150%) so that the film will not break when
     being deformed by skin movement.
25           The sample was mounted onto the instrument such that the rectangular handle
     portions of the specimen and none of the specimen neck were fixed within the
     instrument grips. The instrument grip distance was adjusted such that the sample was at
     neutral extension as indicated by the instrument force being close to zero (0.0 IN).
     Subsequently, extension until sample failure was performed at 10 mm/s. The stress
30   strain data recorded by instrument during the extension was exported to Excel where the
     reported mechanical properties were calculated.
             An Excel template was used to automatically extract a number of parameters
     from the instrument generated data. The extension Young's Modulus (YM) as
                                                   49

   WO 2012/030984                                                          PCT/US2011/050003
     calculated as the straight line slope of the stress-strain curve between 6% and 11%. The
     R squared value of the linear fit was above 0.99 or the Young's Modulus was calculated
     from a more linear 5% strain range on the stress strain curve. The Shear Modulus (G)
     was determined from the same strain range as the YM. G was calculated as the slope of
 5   the best line fit between recorded stress and a-a-2, where a is 1 plus the instantaneous
     strain. The Yield strain was determined as the strain at which the measured stress
     differed by more than 10% from the Neo-Hookean stress; the multiple of G and (a-a-2).
     Ultimate Stress was calculated as the maximum stress recorded during the experiment.
     The mechanical property calculations presented here are consistent with ASTM D412.

     Example 2: Leather T-Peel Adhesion Test: To determine adhesiveness of the target
     materials, the materials were spread onto a piece of soft flexible leather 25.4 mm wide
     and 76.2 mm long. The leather used as test substrate was light weight upholstery leather
     (AD1100 from Leather Unlimited, Belgium WI). Immediately after spreading the
15   material onto the first piece of leather, a second equivalent piece of leather was placed
     on top to sandwich a thin layer of material between the two pieces. The two pieces of
     leather were pressed together to leave a thin homogeneous layer of material at the
     interface of the two leather substrates. The edges were wiped to remove access
     materials and the material was allowed to cure and dry to form a test specimen.
20            The adhesion test sample was partially pealed at one end by hand to separate
     enough of the two leather substrates for effective grip by Instron 3342 mounts. Each
     leather substrate was secured in its own instrument grip and an extension test was
     performed at a rate of 10 mm/s to peel the two substrates from each other. The force vs.
     time data was recorded by instrument during the extension and exported to Excel where
25   the reported adhesive force was calculated.
              An Excel template was used to automatically extract adhesive parameters from
     the instrument generated data. The sample average adhesive force was calculated by
     averaging the instantaneous force measured by the instrument during the experiment
     normalized by the sample width (25.4mm). This test method was developed in
30   accordance with ASTM D1876. The minimum acceptable adhesion, which depends on
     the stiffness of the material and the area on which the film is placed, was approximately
     greater than 25 N/mm

   WO 2012/030984                                                          PCT/US2011/050003
     Example 3. Image analyses measures
     Shine: In order to measure shine, either in vitro or in vivo, a light box with a light source
     placed at a 450 angle relative to the site being measured was used to create shine, and a
     camera, positioned such that the angle formed by a line drawn from the lens to the area
 5   being measured is 450, was used to photograph the site. The white balance, F-stop and
     ISO of the camera were manually fixed at set values to give adequate exposure and good
     color temperature. One picture was taken without any diffusing element between the
     light source and the site to capture the shine. Then, a diffusing surface was placed
     between the light source and site and another photograph was taken (altering shutter
10   speed such that the exposure is similar or equal to the first photograph). This
     photograph captured the surface without any shine present while the first photograph
     captured the maximum amount of shine as a result of specular reflectance. These
     photographs were overlaid and cropped to the relevant sample area and then the diffused
     photograph was subtracted from the maximum shine photograph to create a photograph
15   with only the shine highlights present. The entire subtracted photograph was then
     summarized by finding the average grey value along with the standard deviation. This
     average grey value was denoted as the shine value and was used to compare the amount
     of specular reflectance present in each sample. For each sample, the camera settings for
     each situation (with and without the diffuser) were identical.
20
     Photo set up capture: To ensure maximum repeatability in panelist placement for every
     photograph taken for product performance evaluation, a Head Positioning System (HPS)
     was created. This HPS had two configurations: forehead-only evaluations and a whole
     face evaluation. In both configurations, a model 819 series table clamped chin-rest from
25   Applied Science Laboratories (ASL) was used as a base to mount the two different
     configurations to a table. Two cameras were used to capture the subject from two
     different angles. The first camera (normal shot) was positioned face-on such that line of
     the lens through the camera was positioned relative to the plane of the subject's face at
     an angle of approximately 900. A second camera (450 shot) was positioned to the
30   subject's left such that the line of the lens through the camera was positioned relative to
     the plane of the subject's face at an angle of approximately 450 capturing primarily the
     left side of the subject's face. The position of the cameras relative to the chin-rest was
     kept fixed.
                                                    51

   WO 2012/030984                                                          PCT/US2011/050003
     In the first configuration, an ASL cheek-rest (819-2155) was mounted to the ASL chin
     rest. In this setup, the panelist's head was positioned such that the line formed from the
     center of the camera lens to the area of evaluation is normal to the area of evaluation on
     the forehead. In the second configuration, an ASL forehead-rest (819-2150) was
 5   attached to the chin-rest. In this setup, the chin-rest cup was positioned such that the
     horizontal bar on the forehead-rest was situated at the panelist's horizontal hairline,
     maximizing the area of evaluation in every photograph.
              Lighting for the photography consisted of two Calumet Quattro fluorescent
     lamps (CF0003) with four Calumet 35 Watt 5500K daylight color temperature
10   fluorescent lights (OL2003) placed in front of and on either side of the panelist, angled
     to point directly at the panelist. A glare stop polarizing filter from Visual Pursuits, Inc.
     was also placed on the front of each lamp. The lights were allowed to warm up for at
     least 10 minutes prior to taking any photographs. In addition to the lighting, a circular
     polarizing filter was used on each of the camera lenses to control the type of light in
15   each photograph.
              For each evaluation, two sets of pictures were taken for the normal shot camera.
     In the first set, the camera's circular polarizing filter was configured such that its
     polarization was parallel to the polarization of the fluorescent lights, giving a picture that
     highlighted the shine as well as the fine wrinkles, pores and skin texture. In the second
20   set, the circular polarizing filter was configured such that the polarization was
     perpendicular (or cross) to the polarization of the fluorescent lights yielding a result that
     eliminated all glare and shows the underlying skin tone, discoloration, and deep
     wrinkles. The 450 shot camera was configured for each evaluation such that the
     camera's circular polarizing filter was configured so that its polarization was parallel to
25   the polarization of the fluorescent lights, giving a picture that highlighted the shine as
     well as fine wrinkles, pores and skin texture.
     Brow-lift measure of photo: To measure the brow height of a photograph, a photograph
     was obtained using the method of photo capture previously described above. A "canthus
30   line" was then drawn on the photograph from the medial to the lateral canthus on each
     eye. This canthus line was used as a base from which the brow height was measured.
     The eyebrow was isolated from the image by applying valley detection, edge detection
     and thresholding graphical operations on the image. Within one experiment, the
                                                    52

   WO 2012/030984                                                        PCT/US2011/050003
     parameters for valley and edge detection and thresholding were constant so that the same
     portions of the eyebrow from each image series was the same. To accurately isolate the
     eyebrow, these parameters were changed to account for differences in photographic
     exposure between experiments and skin and brow colors between panelists. From these
 5   methods, a binary mask was created which was then further manipulated in order to
     ensure only the eyebrows were isolated in the picture. For overall height change
     measurements, the center of mass of each eyebrow was then determined from its binary
     mask. The parameters for the binary operations and center of mass determination were
     always kept constant. The height of each brow was the normal from its center of mass
10   to its corresponding canthus line. This method measured overall height change but did
     not capture the magnitude of change for severe arching or angling where portions were
     raised and portions were lowered. For such cases, instead of measuring the brow's
     center of mass, the heights of the brow normal to the canthus line at its left and right
     edges and at its center were determined from the binary mask.
15
     Redness reduction photo measure: Photographs are obtained of the panelist using the
     photographic setup previously described. Comparisons of redness are only done on
     photographs taken within the same experiment because the exposure, and light and face
     positioning are only constant within a single experiment. After the series of photographs
20   in the experiment are taken, the cross-polarized pictures are overlaid such that the area to
     be evaluated for redness reduction remains as fixed as is possible between each image.
     Using graphical manipulation software, the L*a*b* channels in the CIELAB colorspace
     are created for each image in the series. The L* value represents the degree of
     illumination, while a* and b* define the chromaticity. Specifically, a* represents the
25   degree of redness (+ values) or greenness (- values). The intensity of the red color
     square on the color card in the baseline photograph's a* channel is then used to
     normalize the subsequent images by adjusting the intensity of the subsequent image a*
     channels until the a* values within the red color square on the color cards in those
     images equals the baseline value. The area of evaluation is then cropped out of the
30   photographs. Redness reduction is then determined by subtracting the a* values for the
     area in the 'before' photographs from the a* values in the 'after' photographs. A
     negative value from this subtraction indicates a reduction in redness while a positive
     value indicates an increase.

     Example 4: Stress Testing Methods
             The mechanical durability of the materials was evaluated by creating an artificial
     brow lift by applying one of the following methods of pre-tensioning the skin during
 5   product application. These methods of pre-tensioning were used to stress the skin
     surface and pull the brow into a lifted position:
          -   "brow orthogonal push," in which a stress was applied that originated at the
             eyebrow and is vectored anteriorly away from the eyebrow at an angle that was
10           between 800 and 1000 relative to the line of the eyebrow,
          -   "corner hairline diagonal pull," in which a stress was applied that originated at
             the most anterior and lateral point on the panelist's hairline and was vectored
              anteriorly away from and at an angle between 100 and 800 relative to the line of
             the eyebrow,
15        -   "corner hairline orthogonal pull," in which a stress was applied that originated at
             the most anterior and lateral point on the panelist's hairline and was vectored
              anteriorly away from and at an angle between 800 and 1000 relative to the line of
             the eyebrow,
          -   "lateral hairline orthogonal push" in which a stress was applied that originated at
20           the most lateral point of the hairline that was at or above the level of the eyes and
             was vectored anteriorly away from at an angle between 800 and 1000 relative to
             the line of the eyebrow.
             While the brow was held lifted by one of these stresses, the product was applied
25   to the area of skin over which the tension was being applied. Once the film cured, the
     stress was removed and the mechanical durability of the film's ability to hold the
     tensions in the skin was evaluated. This evaluation was achieved by measuring the
     degree of brow lift using the methods described before and after product application.
     Durability of the effect was measured by allowing time, normal and exaggerated facial
30   expressions and environmental stresses such as water, sweat, heat, sebum production
     and surface contact to interact with the film. The amount of lift was tracked at regular
     intervals to determine how quickly the film's ability to hold the mechanical benefit
     lasted. A film was determined to be mechanically durable if it could withstand the
                                                   54

              Components 1-8 were mixed together and homogenized at 26,000 RPM for 10
     minutes. After 10 minutes, component 9 was added and homogenized again for 10
 5   minutes at 26,000 RPM. To this homogenized mixture, components 10-15 were added
     and mixed with an overhead stirrer at 2,000 RPM until homogenous in appearance (this
     is the siloxane phase). In a separate container, components 16-19 were mixed until
     homogenous to form the water phase. The water phase was added to the siloxane phase
     very slowly, with continuous stirring at 2,000 RPM. Once the water phase was
10   completely mixed in, components 20 and 21 were added to the formula and mixed at
     2,000 RPM until homogenous.

     Example 6: A 2 day, double blinded study evaluating 2 different formulations to achieve
     a cosmetic benefit on aged skin
     Purpose: The goal of the study was to identify the lead candidates, of 2 different
     formulation candidates, to advance to a subsequent confirmatory clinical study.
15   Selection criteria was based on the immediately visualizable improvements in the
     appearance of fine lines, evenness in skin tone, skin texture and pores, as well as the
     duration of the effect over a six hour period. An additional goal was to determine the
     ease of application of each formulation for a typical user when self-applying.
20   Background: This trial was an early stage development project focused on bringing
     polysiloxane based reactive systems to topical human use studies. Currently, the
     performance evaluation studies have been restricted to supervised, limited-use
     applications. The systems evaluated consisted of vinyl terminated polysiloxanes, silicon
     hydride functionalized polysiloxanes, fumed silica particles, and a platinum catalyst. In
25   these studies, the polysiloxane systems were applied to the skin surface and cured
     by the addition of the platinum catalyst.
     Test Material Composition: The formulation compositions under consideration
     generally consisted of the following ingredients:
30       -   vinyl terminated polysiloxane,
         -   hydride functional polysiloxane,
         -   fumed silica particles,
         -   platinum catalyst, and
                                                  115

   WO 2012/030984                                                         PCT/US2011/050003
              Commercially available cosmetic ingredients.
              The polysiloxanes under consideration all exceeded a molecular weight of 600
     Daltons. The percent compositions of the polysiloxanes evaluated are summarized in
     the table below. These represent the upper concentration ranges of the siloxane and
 5   fumed silica materials present in the total formulation. For example, the addition of
     cosmetic ingredients at a level of 50% would lead to a dilution of each ingredient by a
     factor of 2, such that composition number 1 was a 35% vinyl terminated polysiloxane,
      15% hydride functional polysiloxane, 0% fumed silica, and 50% commercially available
     cosmetic ingredients. The platinum catalyst in the final formulation was always present
10   at concentrations less than 500 ppm. The two treatments tested were formulations 60
      140-1 and 60-140-LX2 and the cross-linking component used was 60-148-99.
     Subject enrollment:
              Number of subjects: Approximately 25 subjects were screened in order to enroll
15   a total of 20 subjects to ensure that at least 15 subjects completed the study.
              Informed Consent and Release Form: Two copies of a statement of informed
     consent were given to each subject before the start of this study. The subject was given
     the opportunity to have her questions answered to her satisfaction. However, if further
     questions existed, the subject was given sufficient time on the first visit to clarify open
20   questions and concerns regarding the study and/or the informed consent
     with the investigator prior to signing.
              Subject Identification: Subjects were assigned a three-digit number which, when
     used in conjunction with the clinical study number, uniquely identified every subject in
     the study. This number remained with the subject throughout the study.

 5   Preparation: Prior to any panelist's arrival, the 2 formulations were randomized such
     that the investigator and photographer are not aware of the identity of each formulation.
     Photography: Panelists were photographed under two different lighting conditions
     (parallel polarized lighting and cross polarized lighting) and at two different camera
10   angles relative to the plane of the face (900,         450). Panelists were positioned in a facial
     positing system to reduce dorsal-ventral rotation and to position the face in
     approximately the same location relative to the camera each time. Refer to "Photo set
     up capture" example in "Image analyses measures" section
15   Visit 1:
      1.      Upon arrival, individuals were evaluated against the exclusion/inclusion criteria
              and were recruited for the study if they met the requirements
     2.       After recruitment, subjects were given a brief description of the study and an
              informed consent form and signed (along with a witness) after all questions
20            about the study had been adequately answered
     3.       After signing all the paperwork, subjects were assigned the next available subject
              number
     4.       The two formulations that were tested on that subject according to the
              randomization scheme were then be applied by the investigator in a small area on

             the subject's arm and allowed to remain for 5 minutes to determine any
              sensitivity to the products
     5.      If the panelist was not sensitive to the product then they had their face cleaned
             with a gentle facial cleanser
 5   6.      After washing the face, a baseline photograph was taken of the subject's whole
             face
     7.      After the baseline photograph, the subject was asked to apply the test materials to
             the entire upper half of her face (below eyes to hairline, avoiding area below
             cheek bones), using the finger to apply, under supervision
10   8.      The panelist was then photographed after 2-5 min to obtain the after application
             photograph
     9.      The panelist was then asked to complete a questionnaire about the test products
              applied
      10.    The investigator completed a live-evaluation of the panelist for efficacy against
15           baseline
      11.    The panelist was then be allowed to leave for 6-8 hours and given the following
             instructions:
              a.      Do not rub or scratch the face
             b.       Do not shower or get the face wet
20           c.       Do not apply additional products to the face
             d.       If any adverse event occurs in the area of application, the panelist should
                      call the investigator and come in for evaluation and removal of the film.
      12.     Once the panelist returned they were photographed and the panelist and
             investigator completed evaluation forms
25    13.    If an expert live assessor was scheduled for that evening then the panelist was
             instructed to wait until the assessment period at which point the assessors graded
             the appearance of the panelist against their baseline photograph
      14.    After assessment the panelist was then given an assessment form to leave their
             impressions and comments on each product
30    15.    After assessment was finished the panelist was then instructed on the removal of
             the product using makeup remover and did so
      16.    A commercial skin care moisturizer with SPF15 was then applied to the
             panelist's face as a moisturizer

     Visit 2:
      1.      Upon arrival, the panelist had their face cleaned with a gentle facial cleanser
 5   2.       After washing the face, a baseline photograph was be taken of the subject's
              whole face
     3.       After the baseline photograph, the subject was instructed on the method of
              application (see below) for each formulation and allowed to apply each
              formulation to the entire upper half of their face according to the randomization
10            scheme in Appendix A (switching the side of application compared to the
              previous visit)
     4.       The procedure then continued as in Visit 1 step 7
     Photographic analysis:
15            After the study concluded, the "baseline", "after application", and "after 6-8
     hour" photographs were compiled into a blinded deck and submitted to an expert
     assessor to grade the extent of wrinkling in each photograph using the Griffiths scale
     exampled below:
          -   0-1: No damage
20        -   2-3:  Mild damage
          -   4-5: Moderate damage
          -   6-7: Moderate to severe damage
          -   8-9: Severe damage
              The deck was assembled such that the timepoint for the picture being evaluated
25   was not known. This was done to eliminate any bias for an expected result from the
     evaluation. Because the Griffiths score is an absolute one, differences from baseline
     were calculated afterwards in the data analysis.
     Results:
30            Evaluation Forms: From the Investigator Evaluation Forms a scale of -2, -1, 0,
     +1, +2 (for Strong Reduction/Lift, Some Reduction/Lift, No Reduction/Lift, Some
     Increase/Drop and Strong Increase/Drop), was created for all of the different parameters

             From the Assessor Evaluation Forms the same scale of -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 were
     applied to obtain the same statistical data in regards to the evaluations it contained.
 5   From these average values and standard deviations, confidence in the ability of each
     individual formula to affect the parameter being investigated was determined.
             Panelist Evaluation Forms were on a scale of -1, 0, +1 for each attribute being
     evaluated. The average value on this scale was determined per panelist both after
     application and after duration to give an indication of short and long term performance.
10   The trending of this result was evaluated against the assessor and investigator evaluation
     results for correlation.
             Comments on all three forms were tracked and examined for any similarities.
     Because the expert assessor did not have an evaluation for each week, only the
     investigator and panelist forms were compared across the week for consistency in
15   efficacy for each formulation despite the side of the face to which it was applied.
     Photographic analysis: For the post-clinical photographic analysis, each picture was
     assigned a Griffiths score by the evaluator. The average change in this score from the
     corresponding baseline picture for each formulation gave an indication of its efficacy at
20   smoothening the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as creating a more
     youthful look. These results were compared to the live assessments for correlation.
     Week 2 Results Overview: As Table 3 below shows, 60-140-LX2 was far less durable
     compared to 60-140-1.

             The Investigator assessment of the panelists revealed two significant differences
     between the performance of the two formulations (see Figure 3). Formulation 60-140
     LX2 showed a significantly greater overall improvement in the appearance of Forehead
30   wrinkles. Conversely 60-140-1 showed a significantly greater improvement in the
     appearance of Under Eye wrinkles. This is significant in that it confirmed the
                                                   121

     hypothesis that a softer formulation should be applied to the thinner skin under the eyes
     to achieve a positive result. Alternatively, because the skin is thicker on the forehead, a
     stiffer film may be needed to produce a stronger wrinkle reduction. Mattification,
     reduction of Fine Wrinkles and Pore Reduction were the top three overall performers
 5   according to the investigator assessments.
              The assessors were able to distinguish differences in three attributes between the
     two formulations (see Figure 4). Formulation 60-140-LX2 showed a significant
     increase in More Youthful Appearance and Natural Feel vs. 60-140-1, while formulation
     60-140-1 showed a significantly greater Look of Tightening vs. 60-140-LX2. All other
10   attributes showed no significant difference between the two formulas. The top three
     attributes for greatest overall change observed show that no matter what the formula
     mattification, reduced pores and improved fine wrinkles consistently showed the largest
     noticeable improvement vs. baseline.
              Panelist data showed no significant differences between the two formulas tested
15   (see Figure 5). The top average scorer for 60-140-LX2 was the Look of Tightening
     attribute. The difference between 60-140-LX2 and 60-140-1 for this attribute was not
     significant (p-0.24), but it was the most significantly different attribute of those
     examined below. The sample size was very small for this study so the difference may
     not have been significantly detectable without further testing. One hypothesis for why
20   this attribute stands above More Youthful Appearance, Extent of Wrinkling and
     Mattification is that the panelist's may have perceived the feeling of Tightness greatest
     in 60-140-LX2 thus rating that formula higher than 60-140-1. Discounting this result,
     the top three performing attributes are More Youthful overall, Reduced Wrinkling and
     Mattification. Pore size did not stand out among the panelists although for both the
25   assessors and investigators, this attribute was always highly ranked. It may be that the
     panelists do not remember their baseline pore size.
              Finally, assessors were asked to estimate the Panelist's age at each assessment.
     The difference between this age and their real age was then calculated and it was found
     that 60-140-LX2 had a more significant effect on the age estimate by -8.7 years
30   compared to -7.7 years with 60-140-1. (see Figure 6).
              The Panelist's were also assessed on the Griffith's scale, using before and after
     pictures. Figure 7 illustrates the average Griffith's score result from the blinded
     evaluation of the panelist's photographs. For the two examples, the average Griffith's
                                                   122

     score was reduced by 2.15 and by 1.25 points, following application of formula 60-140
     LX2 and 60-140-1, respectively. This result is consistent with Figures 4 and 5, where
     panelists appeared younger following formulation application.
 5   Study Investigator's Evaluation: A significant improvement was observed in the reduced
     appearances of wrinkles, pores and shine. The treatments using two formulations
     selected from the first week (60-140-LX2 and 60-140-1) on the panelist's upper half
     face reduced appearance of fine wrinkles of the panelists according to the study
     investigator evaluations. 60-140-LX2 reduced the appearance of fine wrinkles by 100%
10   while 60-140-1 reduced them by 96% (Table 4). These formulations also reduced deep
     wrinkles but to a lesser extent (75% and 67% respectively) compared to fine wrinkles.

     Example 7: Development of Cleanserto Remove Body Corrective Compositions
                It was found that commercially available cleansers were not effective at
     removing the film formed upon application of the body corrective compositions of the
20   invention. To evaluate the performance of the cleansers, the film was applied to facial
     skin of volunteers. Following six to eight hours, the cleanser was rubbed onto the film
     and left on the film for 30 seconds. The subject was then instructed to remove the film
     with a towelette of a given surface roughness by gentle wiping the swollen film from the
     skin. The following commercially available products were tested:

             As none of the aforementioned products were effective at removing the film, a
     cleanser was prepared to disrupt the mechanical integrity of the film and to facilitate the
20   delivery of the cleanser components into the film. Without being bound by theory, the
     removal mechanism can be described in four steps with key formula components for
     each step indicated in parentheses:
              1.      Film wetting (Silsoft 034, Silsoft ETS, 5CS dimethicone)
             2.       Penetration of formula components (siloxane emulsifiers, siloxane phase,
25                    glycols, Cremaphor EL)
              3.      Film swelling (Silsoft 034, Silsoft ETS, Isododecane, 5CS dimethicone)
             4.       Film release from skin (glycols, water)
              Silsoft 034, Silsoft ETS, 5CS dimethicone readily wet the surface of the film.
     The siloxane emulsifiers or the Cremaphor EL incorporate the aqueous phase into the
30   siloxane phase, and may facilitate delivery of the film swelling components into the
     film. Silsoft 034, isododecane, and Silsoft ETS contribute to swelling the film and
     mechanical disruption. This enables penetration of the aqueous phase, hydration of the
     skin and reduction of the film's adhesion to the skin.

        I.   Overview
             This protocol determines the viscosity (cP) on a Brookfield Viscometer. This
             protocol can be performed on a wide variety of formulations including but not
             limited to immediate effects treatment, and perfector.
 5     II. Background
             The viscosity of formulation is critical to its performance and its aesthetics.
             Furthermore a change in viscosity with time or exposure to a stress condition is an
             important indicator of formulation instability. As such, it is important to be able to
             reproducibly and accurately evaluate formulation viscosity. The following protocol
10           can be used to determine the viscosity at single shear rate of a formulation whose
             viscosity is between 50 and 300 Pas.
