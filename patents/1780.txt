   Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane, with its characteristic asymmetric bilayer
   as a hallmark. The outer membrane bilayer consists of an inner monolayer containing
   phospholipids (primarily phosphatidyl ethanolamine) and an outer monolayer that is mainly
   composed of a single glycolipid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). There is an immense diversity of
25 LPS structures in the bacterial kingdom and the LPS structure may be modified in response to
   prevailing environmental conditions. The stability of the LPS layer and interaction between
   different LPS molecules is mainly achieved by the electrostatic interaction of divalent ions
   (Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +) with the anionic components of the LPS molecule (phosphate groups in the lipid
   A and the inner core and carboxyl groups of KDO). Furthermore, the dense and ordered
30 packing of the hydrophobic moiety of lipid A, favored by the absence of unsaturated fatty
   acids, forms a rigid structure with high viscosity. This makes it less permeable for lipophilic
   molecules and confers additional stability to the outer membrane (OM).
   Various types of agents having bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity are known, e.g.
35 antibiotics, endolysins,      antimicrobial peptides   and defensins.   Increasingly   microbial

   resistance to antibiotics, however, is creating difficulties in treating more and more infections
   caused by bacteria. Particular difficulties arise with infections caused by Gram-negative
   bacteria like Pseudomonasaeruginosaand Enterobacteriaceae.
 5 Endolysins are peptidoglycan hydrolases encoded by bacteriophages (or bacterial viruses).
   They are synthesized during late gene expression in the lytic cycle of phage multiplication
   and mediate the release of progeny virions from infected cells through degradation of the
   bacterial peptidoglycan. They are either B(1,4)-glycosylases (lysozymes), transglycosylases,
   amidases or endopeptidases. Antimicrobial application of endolysins was already suggested in
10 1991 by Gasson (GB2243611). Although the killing capacity of endolysins has been known
   for a long time, the use of these enzymes as antibacterials was ignored due to the success and
   dominance of antibiotics. Only after the appearance of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria
   this simple concept of combating human pathogens with endolysins received interest. A
   compelling need to develop totally new classes of antibacterial agents emerged and
15 endolysins used as 'enzybiotics' - a hybrid term of 'enzymes' and 'antibiotics' - perfectly met
   this need. In 2001, Fischetti and coworkers demonstrated for the first time the therapeutic
   potential of bacteriophage Cl endolysin towards group A streptococci (Nelson et al., 2001).
   Since then many publications have established endolysins as an attractive and complementary
   alternative    to control bacterial    infections,  particularly    by Gram positive     bacteria.
20 Subsequently     different endolysins    against   other Gram positive pathogens        such    as
   Streptococcus pneumoniae (Loeffler et al., 2001), Bacillus anthracis(Schuch et al., 2002), S.
   agalactiae (Cheng et al., 2005) and Staphylococcus aureus (Rashel et al, 2007) have proven
   their efficacy as enzybiotics. Nowadays, the most important challenge of endolysin therapy
   lies in the insensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria towards the exogenous action of endolysins,
25 since the outer membrane shields the access of endolysins from the peptidoglycan. This
   currently prevents the expansion of the range of effective endolysins to important Gram
   negative pathogens.
   Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a wide range of short, cationic, gene encoded
30 peptide antibiotics that can be found in virtually every organism. Different AMPs display
   different properties, and many peptides in this class are being intensively researched not only
   as antibiotics, but also as templates for cell penetrating peptides. Despite sharing a few
   common features (e.g., cationicity, amphipathicity and short size), AMP sequences vary

    WO 2010/149792                                                              PCT/EP2010/059146
                                                   3
   greatly, and at least four structural groups (a-helical, P-sheet, extended and looped) have
   been proposed to accommodate the diversity of the observed AMP conformations. Likewise,
   several modes of action as antibiotics have been proposed, and it was shown e.g. that the
   primary target of many of these peptides is the cell membrane whereas for other peptides the
 5 primary target is cytoplasmic invasion and disruption of core metabolic functions. AMPs may
   become concentrated enough to exhibit cooperative activity despite the absence of specific
   target binding; for example, by forming a pore in the membrane, as is the case for most
   AMPs. However, this phenomenon has only been observed in model phospholipid bilayers,
   and in some cases, AMP concentrations in the membrane that were as high as one peptide
10 molecule per six phospholipid molecules were required for these events to occur. These
   concentrations are close to, if not at, full membrane saturation. As the minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) for AMPs are typically in the low micromolar range, scepticism has
   understandably arisen regarding the relevance of these thresholds and their importance in vivo
   (Melo et al., Nature reviews, Microbiology, 2009, 245).

   Defensins are a large family of small, cationic, cysteine- and arginine-rich antimicrobial
   peptides, found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Defensins are divided into five groups
   according to the spacing pattern of cysteines: plant, invertebrate, a-, P-, and 0-defensins. The
   latter three are mostly found in mammals. a -defensins are proteins found in neutrophils and
20 intestinal epithelia. P-defensins are the most widely distributed and are secreted by leukocytes
   and epithelial cells of many kinds. 0-defensins have been rarely found so far e.g. in leukocytes
   of rhesus macaques. Defensins are active against bacteria, fungi and many enveloped and
   nonenveloped viruses. However, the concentrations needed for efficient killing of bacteria are
   mostly high, i.e. in the p-molar range. Activity of many peptides may be limited in presence
25 of physiological salt conditions, divalent cations and serum. Depending on the content of
   hydrophobic amino acid residues Defensins also show haemolytic activity.
   Thus, there is a need for new antimicrobial agents.

   to dysentery, septicemia, enterotoxemia, mastitis and dysentery.
10
   In another specific embodiment of the present invention the disorder, disease or condition is
   caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, in particular pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis and
   infections of the urinary tract.
15 Preferably, a fusion protein according to the present invention is used for medical treatment, if
   the infection to be treated (or prevented) is caused by multiresistant bacterial strains, in
   particular by strains resistant against one or more of the following antibiotics: streptomycin,
   tetracycline, cephalothin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, cephalosporin, ceftazidime or imipenem.
   Furthermore, a fusion protein according to the present invention can be used in methods of
20 treatment by administering it in combination with conventional antibacterial agents, such as
   antibiotics, lantibiotics, bacteriocins or endolysins, etc.
   The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical pack comprising one or more
   compartments, wherein at least one compartment comprises one or more fusion protein
25 according to the present invention and/or one or more hosts transformed with a nucleic acid
   comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein according to the present
   invention or a composition according to the present invention,
   In another aspect the present invention relates to a process of preparation of a pharmaceutical
30 composition, said process comprising admixing one or more fusion protein according to the
   present invention and/or one or more hosts transformed with a nucleic acid comprising a
   nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein according to the present invention with a
   pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient or carrier.

                                                   24
   In an even further aspect the composition according to the present invention is a cosmetic
   composition. Several bacterial species can cause irritations on environmentally exposed
   surfaces of the patient's body such as the skin. In order to prevent such irritations or in order
 5 to eliminate minor manifestations of said bacterial pathogens, special cosmetic preparations
   may be employed, which comprise sufficient amounts of the fusion protein according to the
   present invention in order to degrade already existing or freshly settling pathogenic Gram
   negative bacteria.
10 In a further aspect the present invention relates to the fusion protein according to the present
   invention for use as diagnostic means in medicinal, food or feed or environmental diagnostics,
   in particular as a diagnostic means for the diagnostic of bacteria infection caused in particular
   by Gram-negative bacteria. In this respect the fusion protein according to the present
   invention may be used as a tool to specifically degrade pathogenic bacteria, in particular
15 Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. The degradation of the bacterial cells by the fusion
   protein according to the present invention can be supported by the addition of detergents like
   Triton X-100 or other additives which weaken the bacterial cell envelope like polymyxin B.
   Specific cell degradation is needed as an initial step for subsequent specific detection of
   bacteria using nucleic acid based methods like PCR, nucleic acid hybridization or NASBA
20 (Nucleic Acid Sequence         Based Amplification),     immunological      methods    like IMS,
   immunofluorescence or ELISA techniques, or other methods relying on the cellular content of
   the bacterial cells like enzymatic assays using proteins specific for distinct bacterial groups or
   species (e.g. P-galactosidase for enterobacteria, coagulase for coagulase positive strains).
25 In a further aspect the present invention relates to the use of the fusion protein according to
   the present invention for the treatment, removal, reduction or prevention of Gram-negative
   bacterial contamination of foodstuff, of food processing equipment, of food processing plants,
   of surfaces coming into contact with foodstuff such as shelves and food deposit areas and in
   all other situations, where pathogenic, facultative pathogenic or other undesirable bacteria can
30 potentially infest food material, of medical devices and of all kind of surfaces in hospitals and
   surgeries.

                                                     25
   In particular, a fusion protein of the present invention may be used prophylactically as
   sanitizing agent. Said sanitizing agent may be used before or after surgery, or for example
   during hemodialysis. Moreover, premature infants and immunocompromised persons, or
   those subjects with need for prosthetic devices may be treated with a fusion protein according
 5 to the present invention. Said treatment may be either prophylactically or during acute
   infection. In the same context, nosocomial infections, especially by antibiotic resistant strains
   like Pseudomonas aeruginosa(FQRP), Acinetobacter species and Enterobacteriaceae such as
   E.coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Citrobacter, Edwardsiella, Enterobacter, Hafnia, Klebsiella,
   Morganella, Proteus, Providencia, Serratia and Yersinia species                may be treated
10 prophylactically or during acute phase with a fusion protein of the present invention.
   Therefore, a fusion protein according to the present invention may be used as a disinfectant
   also in combination with other ingredients useful in a disinfecting solution like detergents,
   tensids, solvents, antibiotics, lanthibiotics, or bacteriocins.
15 For the use of the fusion protein according to the present invention as a disinfectant e.g. in
   hospital, dental surgery, veterinary, kitchen or bathroom, the fusion protein can be prepared in
   a composition in form of e.g. a fluid, a powder, a gel, or an ingredient of a wet wipe or a
   disinfection sheet product. Said composition may additionally comprise suitable carrier,
   additives, diluting agents and/or excipients for its respective use and form, respectively, - but
20 also agents that support the antimicrobial activity like EDTA or agents enhance the
   antimicrobial activity of the fusion proteins. The fusion protein may also be used with
   common disinfectant agents like, Alcohols, Aldehydes, Oxidizing agents, Phenolics,
   Quaternary ammonium compounds or UV-light. For disinfecting for example surfaces,
   objects and/or devices the fusion protein can be applied on said surfaces, objects and/or
25 devices. The application may occur for instance by wetting the disinfecting composition with
   any means such as a cloth or rag, by spraying, pouring. The fusion proteins may be used in
   varying concentration depending on the respective application and the ,,reaction time"
   intended to obtain full antimicrobial activity.
30 Another aspect of the present invention is that the invention can be used like a tool box, i.e.
   any peptide stretch disclosed above may be fused to any endolysin, autolysin or bacteriocin
   disclosed herein. Thus, it is possible to combine the respective peptide stretch, which enables
   the binding of the fusion protein to the respective bacteria and the endolysin, autolysin or

    WO 2010/149792                                                              PCT/EP2010/059146

   bacteriocin, which inhibit the growth of the respective bacteria. Consequently, it is possible to
   construct a suitable fusion protein for any bacteria which should be eliminated.
   Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed
 5 description given hereinafter, however, it should be understood that the detailed description
   and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by
   way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope
   of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.
   It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed
10 description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as
   claimed.
   The following examples explain the present invention but are not considered to be limiting.
   Unless indicated differently, molecular biological standard methods were used, as e.g.,

   EXAMPLE 1. Cloning, expression and purification of gp144 and gp188 modified with an
20 amphipathic peptide.
   As a proof of principle, the potential of the LPS disrupting activity of amphipathic peptides to
   lead gp144 and gp188 through the outer membrane and the consequent antibacterial activity
   against Gram-negative bacteria is demonstrated. Gp144 and gp188 are modular endolysins
25 originating from Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages (pKZ and EL with an N-terminal
   peptidoglycan binding and C-terminal catalytic domain (Briers et al., 2007).

  were purified by Ni2 + affinity chromatography using the C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The yields for
  different purifications are shown in table 4. Remarkably, a4-KZ144 production was not toxic
  for the host, in contrast to KZ144, resulting in a significant higher yield.

   ensure high purity.
   Characterizationof gp144 and gp188 modified with an amphipathicpeptide
15
   l.A. Enzymatic activity of gp144 and gp188 modified with an amphipathic peptide
    To assess the influence of the modification on the enzymatic activity of gp144 or gp188, the
   specific activity of the variants was measured on chloroform-permeabilized Pseudomonas
20 aeruginosa cells and compared to the corresponding unmodified endolysin. Different
   incremental amounts of all modified endolysins were tested to determine the corresponding
   saturation curve. The slope of the linear regression of the linear region of this curve is a
   measure for the specific activity and was expressed relatively to the slope of unmodified
   gp144 or gp188 (Table 5).

   1.B. Antibacterial activity of gp144 and gp188 modified with an amphipathic peptide
   Exponential (-10 6/ml) P. aeruginosa PAG1 cells were incubated at room temperature with
   unmodified and modified gp144/gp188. After 1 hour, cell suspensions were diluted and
 5 plated. The residual colonies were counted after an overnight incubation (Table 6).
   Unmodified gp144 gp188 does not reduce cell numbers significantly compared to the
   negative control. This observation illustrates the efficacy of the outer membrane as a barrier.
   Fusion proteins with the amphipathic a4-helix inactivate exponential cells with 50  11 and
   34  11 % for a4-KZ144 and a4-EL188, respectively. When stationary cells with a 100-fold
10 higher density are used, these values are similar (35  18 and 32  17%, respectively). Despite
   the rather high variability between different replicates, these values differ significantly from
   the untreated cells (a = 0.05). In general, modified gp144 derivatives tend to have a higher
   antibacterial activity than gp188 derivatives.

   The nucleic acid molecules encoding the respective peptide stretches were synthetically
   produced with a Nde I (5'-CAT ATG-3') restriction site at the 5'-end of the nucleic acid

   with a Nco I restriction site plus two additional nucleotides (5'-CCA TGG GC-3') at the 5'
   end of the nucleic acid molecule.
10 Fusion proteins are constructed by linking at least two nucleic acid sequences using standard
   cloning techniques as described e.g. by Sambrook et al. 2001, Molecular Cloning: A
   Laboratory Manual. Therefore the nucleic acid molecules encoding the peptide stretches were

    WO 2010/149792                                                             PCT/EP2010/059146
                                                   34
   cleaved in a digest with the respective restriction enzymes Nde I and BamH I and in case of
   the nucleic acid molecule encoding the peptide stretch Sushi 1 the digest was performed with
   the restriction enzymes Nco I and BamH I. Subsequently the cleaved nucleic acids encoding
   the peptide stretches were ligated into the pET21 b expression vector (Novagen, Darmstadt,
 5 Germany), which was also cleaved in a digest with the respective restriction enzymes Nde
   land BamH I before. The cleaved nucleic acid molecule encoding the peptide stretch Sushi I
   was ligated into a modified pET32 b expression vector (unmodified vector obtainable from
   Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), which was also cleaved in a digest with the respective
   restriction enzymes Nco I and BamH I before. The modification of the pET32b expression
10 vector refers to the deletion of the sequence encoding a S-tag and the central His-tag.
   Afterwards, the nucleic acid molecule encoding the endolysin KZ144 was cleaved in a digest
   with the restriction enzyme BamH I and Xho I, so that the endolysin could be ligated into the
   pET21b expression vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and the modified pET32 b
15 expression vector, respectively, which were also cleaved in a digest with the respective
   restriction enzymes BamH I and Xho I before. The nucleic acid molecule encoding the
   endolysin STMOO16 and the nucleic acid molecule encoding the endolysin N4gp61 were
   cleaved in a digest with the restriction enzyme BamH I and Xho I, so that the respective
   endolysin could be ligated into the pET21b expression vector (Novagen, Darmstadt,
20 Germany).
   Thus, the nucleic acid molecule encoding the peptide stretch is ligated into the respective
   vector at the 5'-end of the nucleic acid molecule encoding the endolysin KZ144 or STMOO16.
   Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule encoding the endolysin KZ144 or STMOO16 is ligated
25 into the respective plasmid, so that a nucleic acid molecule encoding a His-tag consisting of
   six histidine residues is associated at the 3'-end of the nucleic acid molecule encoding the
   endolysin.
   As some fusion proteins may either be toxic upon expression in bacteria, or not homogenous
30 due to protein degradation, the strategy might be to express these fusion proteins fused or
   linked to other additional proteins. Example for these other additional protein is thioredoxin,
   which was shown to mediate expression of toxic antimicrobial peptides in E.coli (TrxA
   mediating fusion expression of antimicrobial peptide CM4 from multiple joined genes in

    WO 2010/149792                                                              PCT/EP2010/059146

   Escherichia coli. Zhou L, Zhao Z, Li B, Cai Y, Zhang S. Protein Expr Purif. 2009
   Apr;64(2):225-230). In the case of the fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal Sushi 1
   peptide and the endolysin KZ144, the Sushi 1 peptide is ligated into the modified pET32 b
   expression vector, so that an additional thioredoxin is associated at the 5'-end of the Sushi 1
 5 peptide. The thioredoxin could be removed from the expressed fusion protein by the use of
   enterokinase, therefore between the nucleic acid molecule encoding the Sushi peptide and the
   one encoding the thioredoxin is an enterokinase restriction site introduced.
   The sequence of the endolysin-peptide-fusions was controlled via DNA-sequencing and
10 correct clones were transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) for
   protein expression.
   Recombinant expression of the fusion proteins according to SEQ ID NO: 77 to 90                is
   performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen, Darmstadt,
15 Germany). The cells were growing until an optical density of OD600nm of 0.5-0.8 was
   reached. Then the expression of the fusion protein was induced with 1 mM IPTG
   (isopropylthiogalactoside) and the expression was performed at 37'C for a period of 4 hours.
   E.coli BL21 cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 6000g and disrupted via
20 sonication on ice. Soluble and insoluble fraction of the E.coli crude extract were separated by
   centrifugation (Sorvall, SS34, 30 min, 15 000 rpm). All proteins were purified by Ni2 ' affinity
   chromatography (Akta FPLC, GE Healthcare) using the C-terminal 6xHis-tag, encoded by the
   pET2lb or pET32b vectors.
25 As described above, some of the fusion proteins were expressed using a modified pET32b
   vector (S-tag and central His-tag deleted), which fuses thioredoxin on the N-terminus of the
   proteins of interest. The vector also contains an enterokinase cleavage site right before the
   protein of interest. This site allows the proteolytic cleavage between thioredoxin and the
   protein of interest, which can purified via the remaining C-terminal His-tag. For antimicrobial
30 function of the fusion protein Sushi 1-KZ144 it may be necessary to remove the thioredoxin
   by proteolytic cleavage. Therefore the fusion protein was cleaved with 2-4 units/mg
   recombinant enterokinase (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove the thioredoxin

   protein was purified via His-tag purification as described below.

   temperature:

       2. Loading of the total lysate (with wanted fusion protein) on the Histrap FF 5 ml
           column at a flow rate of 3-5 ml/min.
        3. Washing of the column with up to 10 column volumes of Washing Buffer to remove
           unbound sample followed by a second washing step with 10% Elution buffer
15         (500 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl and 20 mM Hepes on pH 7.4)at a flow rate of 3-5
           ml/min.
       4. Elution of bounded fusion proteins from the column with a linear gradient of 4 column
           volumes of Elution Buffer (500 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl and 20 mM Hepes on pH
