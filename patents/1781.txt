   However,         it      will      be      understood            that      embodiments              of   the
   present          invention              are        not      just        applicable              to     this
   specific          procedure,               and      may      include         substantially               any
   procedure on biological tissue.
25           Surgeon        12     inserts         a   guidewire           16    into      a   nostril        18
   of    patient          14,     so    that      a    distal        end     20    of    the     guidewire
   enters        a   nasal         sinus       cavity         21    of    the     patient.             Distal
   end     20    comprises           position           sensor        22.       A    proximal          end    24

   10.
         Apparatus     10    is    controlled         by    a   processor        28,   which
   is  located in console            26.       Console       26   comprises        controls
 5 30,  which are    used by surgeon               12   to     communicate with the
   processor.      During       the    procedure,          processor         28   tracks    a
   location    and   an     orientation            of    distal         end    20    of  the
   catheter,    using       any      method        known       in      the    art.       For
   example,   processor 28 may use a magnetic tracking method,
10 wherein magnetic       transmitters 31,              external          to patient 14,
   generate   signals     in     coils      located       in    position       sensor    22.
   The   signals    from        the      sensor       coils       are      connected      to
   console 26 and further to magnetic tracking module 23 and
   are    analyzed        by         the        magnetic            tracking          module
15 communicating      with       processor          28.          The      Carto®      system
   produced   by   Biosense         Webster,        of    Diamond         Bar,    CA,   uses
   such a tracking method.
         The  software       for     processor         28    may     be    downloaded     to
   the  processor     in      electronic          form,       over      a   network,     for
20 example.    Alternatively            or additionally, the software may
   be  provided    on     non-transitory              tangible          media,     such   as
   optical,     magnetic,             or       electronic             storage         media.
   Processor 28    is coupled to a display screen 32.
         In  order      to      operate         apparatus          10,     processor      28
25 communicates     with       electronics          34,      which       incorporates       a
   magnetic tracking module 23 and other modules used by the
   processor to    operate the apparatus.                      For     simplicity, such
   other   modules,     which        may      comprise        hardware        as   well   as
   software    elements,          are       not      illustrated            in    Fig.    1.

   predefined default                radiodensity, which is                      set in        step 52,
   and is      herein assumed to be that of                          air, -1000            HU.       After
   the    re-assignment,              processor            28    passes         the      re-assigned
25 voxel to a re-assembly step 61.
           In    no-change          step      60,     the      voxel       that       processor           28

   conical      imaging           volume        74      (Fig.       6),     spherical           imaging
   volume    80       (Fig.      7),      and    offset         spherical         imaging         volume
   82   (Fig.        8)     in    the       same     fashion          as     that     for       conical
   imaging volume             70    in     Fig.    5.       The     images      displayed after

   as   air,    increasing         the     contrast      and      clarity      of    the
   features within these imaging volumes.
         Returning       to   the    flowchart,      in    a   decision     step     63,
   surgeon 12 decides whether he/she wants to move guidewire
 5 16  to   a new position          within     nasal    sinus      cavity     21.     If
   he/she    desires        to   move      guidewire        16,    he/she      may    at
   defining    step     56 either       re-define     the     imaging volume,         or
   alternatively leave it as previously defined.                          The latter
   alternative        corresponds       to   moving     distal       end   20   within
10 nasal   sinus cavity 21          and imaging in           a scanning      fashion.
   Scanning    distal      end 20     within     nasal     sinus     cavity     21   has
   the effect      of increasing the contrast                 and clarity       of the
   features within the scanned imaging volume.
         If    surgeon       12   decides      not     to     move    guidewire       16
15 further, the procedure ends.
         The   description        above     has   assumed       the predetermined
   threshold to be         that of mucus,        but    it    will    be understood
   that   other     threshold      values     may be       used.       For   example,
   surgeon    12    may    choose     the    radiodensity         threshold       to  be
20 the radiodensity of a selected tissue or bone, which will
   have     the      effect      of      making       the       tissue      or      bone
   radiographically          transparent       within       the     imaging     volume
   defined by surgeon 12 in defining step 56.
         It     will       be    appreciated         that        the     embodiments
25 described above are cited by way of example, and that the
