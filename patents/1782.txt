   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   In a preferred embodiment the invention there is provided a roof rack for a vehicle.
   References to vehicle throughout the specification relate to any type of motor car such
20 as a sports utility vehicle, van, station wagon, truck etc.
   Figure 1 shows a roof rack 1 which has been installed on the roof of a vehicle 2. As
   can be seen the roof rack 2 has a cargo box 3 attached to it however those skilled in
   the art will appreciate that other cargo items such as sport equipment (e.g. skis,
25 bicycles and golf equipment etc) can be attached to the roof rack 1 instead of a cargo
   box 3. References throughout the specification to cargo relates to anything being
   transported on the roof rack and includes the cargo box 3 (which can be opened and
   closed) and what is housed within the cargo box e.g. luggage, sports gear etc.
30 Figure 2 shows a platform 4 which forms part of the roof rack 1. As can be seen the
   platform 4 has two elongate members 5 which when installed run lengthwise along the
   roof of a vehicle 2 and two connecting elongate members 6 which run perpendicular to
   the lengthwise members 5. The platform also has four rail to rack clamps 7, one of
   which is shown in more detail in figure 3. These clamps 7 are attached to a vehicle's

                                                  6
   roof rail (not shown) in use. The clamps 7 shown are designed for a Subaru Forester
   TM however those skilled in the art will appreciate that they can be adapted to other
   models of vehicles and that the number of clamps 7 can vary. In some embodiments
   the apparatus 1 does not have a platform 4 as other forms of attachment to the vehicle
 5 2 can be used. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that instead of using the
   clamps 7 shown in the drawing any other suitable type of means of attachment of the
   roof rack to a vehicle can be used for example clamping to roof rack cross bars (with a
   plate and bolt set) etc.
10 Shown in figure 4 is a carrier 8. This carrier 8 and a second carrier which is not shown
   in this figure sits squarely on top of the platform 4 when installed and its end 9 extends
   no further than the hinge of a vehicle's 2 hatch back door (not shown).
   Figure 5 shows a disassembled load and tilt control assembly 10. There are preferably
15 two of these assemblies 10 and each is attached to a carrier 8 when in use. The
   assembly 10 has a tilt (or pivot) arm 11, a tilt guide 12 at one end and a T-nut swivel 13
   at the other end. The assembly 10 also has a gas spring 14, a hydraulic ram or damper
   15, a second tilt (or pivot) arm 16 and pivoting member 17. Figure 6 shows the
   assembly 10 when assembled and figures 7 and 8 shows the assembly 10 when
20 connected to the carrier 8. As can be seen one end of the springs 14 and dampers 15
   are attached to the carrier 8 by bolts of the like 18 and the tilt arm 11 is also connected
   to the carrier 8 via the T-nut swivel 13 and by bolts of the like 19.
   Figures 9 and 10 show a cargo frame 20. In figure 9 the frame 20 is next to platform 4
25 and in figure 10 the frame 20 sits on top of the carriers 8 which are on top of the
   platform 4. The frame 20 has two elongated members 21 which run lengthwise of a
   vehicle 2 when installed and three members 22 which are perpendicular to them. Items
   such as skis, bikes and cargo boxes 3 are attached to the cargo frame 20 when in use
   with clamps (not shown) or with other attachment types of means.
30
   The platform 4, carriers 8, and the frame 20 are held together in their travelling or
   home position by a rear lock assembly shown in figure 11 which comprises a jump
   stopper 23, a hook-lock 24, a cam 25 and a drop lock 26. Figures 12, 13 and 14 shows
   rear two locking assemblies when assembled and a user unlocking it. Firstly the hook-

                                                  7
   locks 24 are lifted by a user. Then the drop-locks 26 are pulled back. This causes the
   cams 25 to lift and rotate the drop-lock sear to lift and rotate, freeing itself from an
   aperture or slot in the platform (not visible). When the rear lock assembly is unlocked
   the carriers 8 are able to slide to the rear and lock about 9 inches beyond the rear of
 5 the vehicle and platform 4 as shown in figure 15.
   Figure 16 shows a zee-lock 27. As shown in figure 17 the carriers 8 has two male
   members (e.g. bolts) 28 one of which engages into a locking relationship with zee-lock
   27. When in this locking relationship it prevents the carriers 8 from accidentally sliding
10 back as the weight of the cargo box 3 moves to the rear so that the cargo box 3 cannot
   crash into the back of the vehicle 2. Figure 18 shows when the members 28 and zee
   lock 27 are not in a locking relationship. When in this unlocked relationship the carrier
   is locked in its rear position and allows the cargo frame 20 to move to the rear. Those
   skilled in the art will appreciate that instead of the locking system shown in the
15 drawings an alternative locking system can be used for example a garden gate latch
   type locking system could be used.
   As can be seen in figure 19 the carrier 8 has a rear tilt pivot guide 29 attached (e.g. by
   fasteners or the like) to it which has the cargo frame 20 running through it.
20
   In use once the carriers 8 are deployed to the rear and locked in place, the cargo
   frame 20 can be pulled to the rear of the vehicle 2. When the cargo boxes 3 centre of
   mass moves to the rear and passes the fulcrum of the pivot guides 29, the cargo frame
   20 tilts from horizontal towards about 70 degrees vertical. Those skilled in the art will
25 appreciate that references to substantially vertical throughout the specification relate to
   between about 60 degrees to about 90 degrees. As the cargo frame 20 tilts, the rate of
   descent is controlled by the tilt and load control assembly 10.
   Figures 20 and 21 shows that the gas springs 14 and hydraulic dampers 15 are
30 attached at one end to two separate tilt arms 11 and 16 which guide the cargo frame
   20 as it arcs from horizontal towards vertical. The other ends of the springs 14 are
   attached to the carriers 8 as are the other end of the arms 11, 16.

                                                    8
   Figure 22 shows stoppers 30 at the end of the cargo frame 20. These stoppers 30 stop
   the cargo boxes 3 descent when in use when the stoppers 30 reach a set of forward
   pivot guides 31 which are attached to the tilt arm 11 as shown in figure 23. In use once
   the cargo box 3 has been un/loaded, the user gives the cargo frame 20 a gentle push,
 5 and with the assistance of the gas springs 14, it rises up until the cargo's 3 centre of
   mass reaches the fulcrum point and begins to tilt toward horizontal. To prevent the load
   from crashing onto the vehicle's roof, a pair of hydraulic dampers 15 arrest the rate of
   tilt from vertical to horizontal. Once fully horizontal, the cargo frame 20 is pushed
   forward toward their travelling or home position. Lugs on the cargo frame 20 disengage
10 the zee-locks 27, which allow the carriers 8 to also move forward. Once the carriers 8
   and the cargo frame 20 reach the travelling or home position, drop-locks attached to
   the end of the cargo frame 20 drop automatically into place. For double security, hook
   locks 24 are automatically deployed to prevent any possibility of the drop-locks 26 from
   disengaging. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that instead of the locking system
15 shown in the drawings an alternative locking system can be used for example a garden
   gate latch type locking system could be used.
   Figure 24 shows the cargo box 3 being retrieved by pulling the frame 20 towards the
   rear. As can be seen in figure 25 when the cargo boxes 3 centre of mass reaches a set
20 of hinges, the frame 20 tilts from horizontal towards a vertical aspect. The cargo box 3
   slides down over the back of the vehicle 2 on rails like shown in figure 26. The cargo
   box 3 comes to a stop at approximately waist-height. As shown in figure 27 once the
   cargo has been removed from the box 3, the cargo frame 20 is lifted until its own
   weight causes it to tilt and then rotate to horizontal. The cargo frame 20 is then pushed
25 along the roof until it returns to its starting point or home position like that shown in
   figure 28.
   In some embodiments (e.g. for particularly tall vehicles) the roof rack 1 has an
   additional third-tier cargo frame (not shown) that would operate similar to an extension
30 ladder. The roof rack 1 can also be automated (e.g. operated electrically by servo
   motors such as modern vehicles have servo-driven hatchback doors etc) in some
   embodiments. It will also be appreciated that the locking system can be augmented by
   springs instead of being gravity operated.

                                                  9
   It will be appreciated that the various parts of the roof rack 1 can be produced in a
   range of different sizes and from a number of different materials e.g. aluminium,
   stainless steel, high density plastic etc. It will also be appreciated that the roof rack 1
   can be made in a number of different ways.
 5
   The roof rack 1 has a number of benefits and advantages over known roof racks. The
   roof rack 1 improves the safety and convenience during loading and unloading of cargo
   from the roof of a vehicle and to reduce damage to the vehicle. The roof rack 1 does
   not require the vehicle to be modified before installing it. The roof rack 1 is rear loading
10 which is an advantage over side loading roof racks as these can be very difficult to use
   in places such as ski area parking lots where vehicles are parked close together. The
   roof rack 1 does not have pivot points fixed beyond the rear of the vehicle like some
   roof racks which prevents vertically ascending hatchback type doors from fully
   opening. The roof rack 1 also controls the cargos rate of descent and stops the cargo
15 crashing into the back or roof of the vehicle.
   It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of
   the various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing
   description, together with details of the structure and functioning of various
20 embodiments of the invention, this disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be
   made in detail so long as the functioning of the invention is not adversely affected. For
   example the particular elements of the platform, clamps, carriers, tilt and load
   assembly, cargo frame, cargo, rear lock assembly, zee-locks, rear tilt guide, forward
   pivot guides etc may vary dependent on the particular application for which it is used
25 without variation in the spirit and scope of the present invention.
   In addition, although the preferred embodiments described herein are directed to a roof
   rack, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that variations and modifications
   are possible within the scope of the appended claims.
