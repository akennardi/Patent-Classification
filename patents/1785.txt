   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
               This invention relates to gaming systems, and more particularly relates to
 5 awards for the players of such systems.
               Gaming machines offer various awards for play, including a cash award, a point
   award convertible to cash, a complementary award convertible to goods or services
   (e.g., food or lodging), but not to cash, and an award of a bonus game. U.S. Patent No.
   5,761,647 (Boushy, issued June 2, 1998) describes the award of points and
10 complementaries. U.S. Patent No. 6,375,567 describes an award of a bonus or
   secondary game.
               However, none of the foregoing patents enables a player to select the type of
   award desired by the player. This deficiency may decrease the level of interest in play
   due to the player's inability to pursue a desired form of award. This invention
15 addresses the problems presented by the foregoing patents and provides a solution or
   at least provides the public with a useful alternative.
               As used herein, except where the context requires otherwise, the term
   'comprise" and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and
   'comprised", are not intended to exclude further additives, components, integers or
20 steps.
   BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
               In one aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for a gaming
   system comprising a gaming machine for providing play of at least a first game by a
25 player, the apparatus for enabling the player to select one of a plurality of different
   award types, comprising:
               a game controller for establishing winning odds for a predetermined winning
   outcome;
               a display for displaying to the player a representation of a plurality of different
30 award types available for selection for said winning outcome;
               an interactive communication unit for receiving a selection by the player of said
   award types for said winning outcome after said step of establishing winning odds:

                                                    2
               wherein the game controller further determines the outcome of a play of the first
   game according to the winning odds, wherein said winning odds are not dependent on
   said award types available for selection; and
               wherein the game controller further pays to the player an award in accordance
 5 with said one of said award types selected by the player.
               In another aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for a gaming
   system comprising a gaming machine arranged to enable play of at least a first game
   by a player, the apparatus for enabling the player to select an award type comprising:
               a game controller for establishing winning odds for a predetermined winning
10 outcome;
               a memory for storing signals identifying a plurality of award types, and
               for storing an account for the player;
               a display for displaying a representation of the types of awards available for
   selection for said winning outcome;
15             an interactive communication unit for enabling the player to select one of the
   award types for said winning outcome after said step of establishing the winning odds,
   wherein the winning odds for said winning outcome are not dependent on the award
   types available for selection;
               wherein the memory is arranged to store the selected award type in relationship
20 to the account for the player.
               Also, an account for the player may be stored in memory. The processor may
   store an award type in relation to the account for the player in response to a selection
   of the award type by the player.
               One method form of the invention is useful in a gaming system comprising a
25 gaming machine arranged to enable play of at least a first a game by a player. In such
   an environment, a player is enabled to select a type of award by a method comprising
   storing signals identifying a plurality of award types. A representation of the types of
   awards available for selection is displayed and the player is enabled to select one of
   the award types.
30             Also, an account for the player may be stored in memory. The selected award
   type may be stored in relationship to the account for the player.

10
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
               Referring to Figure 1, gaming system 100 includes several gaming locations
   102, 104 and 106 that may include various non-machine games, such as craps and
   blackjack, or may include gaming machines, such as slot machines, video poker
15 machines, video roulette machines, and the like.
               Gaming location 102 is exemplary of gaming locations 104 and 106. If gaming
   location 102 includes a gaming machine 102A, a game controller 108 and a game
   display 110 are provided. For both a non-machine gaming location and a gaming
   machine location, a location interface 112, an optional alphanumeric keypad 114 and a
20 touch screen message display 118 are provided. Display 118 may comprise a touch
   screen liquid crystal display (LCD) similar to the displays used in laptop computers. A
   similar message display 118A is provided at gaming location 106. Display 118 is
   coupled to or located inside the cabinet of gaming machine 102A, and may, for
   example, take the form of a rectangle about 3 inches high and 4 inches wide. Using an
25 LCD inside a gaming machine in order to display graphics images and to display a
   numeric or alphabetic input image is advantageous because it eliminates the need for
   a separate keypad for the interactive entry of data. In addition, an LCD requires less
   space than many other types of displays. These considerations are important, because
   there usually is very limited space inside or adjacent a gaming machine. An optional
30 alphanumeric keypad 114 may be placed for convenient manipulation while a player is
   using gaming location 102.
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                      4
               A conventional graphics display controller 117 controls display 118. Controller
    117 can display either vector graphics or bit-mapped graphics on display 118,
   depending on the type of application program stored in a memory 146 used for graphic
   display and the type of data stored for purposes of generating graphics images. The
 5 image data resulting in graphics images can be stored in memory 146 of the interface
    112. Alternatively, the image data can be stored in a memory 121 of a central authority
    120 and transmitted via a network 126 to controller 117 for a particular graphic image.
   The image data can be either vector data or bit-mapped data. A central processing unit
   (CPU) 144 of the interface 112 controls the transfer of the image data to controller 117
10 in response to application programs stored in memory 146 that determine the location
   of the graphics images on display 118 and also determine the time at which the
   graphics displays are presented.
                Interface 112, optional keypad 114, controller 117 and display 118 comprise an
   interactive communication unit 119. Each of the gaming locations 104 and 106 include
15 an interactive communication unit like unit 119. For example, gaming location 106
   includes a communication unit 119A like unit 119. In one embodiment, a player enters
   alphabetic and numeric information by touching display 118. In such an embodiment,
   keypad 114 may not be provided. For the non-machine gaming locations, interface 112
   comprises a communication controller 148, such as a modem.
20              In this specification, interactive means capable of accepting input from a
   human. Communication unit 119 comprises one or more programs for accepting such
   input from, for example, a touch screen alphanumeric image. Such programs are well
   known to those skilled in computer communication.
                For a gaming machine location, interface 112 may include, for example, an
25 RS485 interface such as that implemented by a SentineTM Interface from Aristocrat
   Technologies, Inc. Other interfaces and network architectures (e.g., Ethernet, parallel
   port, and the like) may be substituted however. Furthermore, interface 112 may
   implement, for example, the IGT Gaming SASTM communication protocol or the CDS
   GDAPTM communication protocol for communication with gaming machine 102A, or a
30 custom communication protocol. In gaming machine 102A, message display 118 may
   be coupled to the frame of the gaming machine or may be inside the cabinet of the
   gaming machine. However, any means of associating display 118 with gaming
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                   5
   machine 102A may be used as long as display 118 is visible from gaming machine
   102A.
                Interface 112 is programmed to provide an interactive data entry operation.
   That is, user message activity, such as touching an active area of display 118 or
 5 entering information from keypad 114, causes a response from or action by system
   100. One such response is storage of data selected by a player in memory 146 of the
   interface 112 or in memory 121 of the central authority 120.
               User preferences of award types may be stored in interface memory 146 that is
   controlled by CPU 144. CPU 144 controls the sending of data by gaming location 102
10 to the central authority, the receipt of messages by gaming location 102 from the
   central authority, and the display of messages by gaming location 102 in a well-known
   manner. Thus, CPU 144 may send data as to user preferences of award types to the
   central authority for storage in memory 122.
               Game controller 108 is responsible for operation of the gaming machine 102A.
15 Thus the game controller may include a microprocessor, memory, game software, and
   support circuitry to implement a slot machine or other type of game. The display 110
   provides displays which are necessary for the play of the game, such as a display of
   slot machine rotors. Game display 110 and message display 118 may be combined
   into a single display device, if desired.
20             Gaming location 102 also includes a club card reader 150 that can read a MAG
   number located on a magnetic strip of a club card 152, which may, for example, be a
   smart card. The MAG number is unique for each player. Card 152 also sometimes
   bears a player ID number that is human readable, but is not machine-readable. The
   card reader sends the MAG number to central authority 120, which converts the MAG
25 number to an OCR number. This feature prevents any potential misuse due to
   fraudulent creation of a bogus club card. Memory 121 maintains a table that correlates
   OCR numbers with player ID numbers.
               Central authority 120 translates an OCR number to a corresponding player ID
   number. This feature allows a single player ID number to identify more than one OCR
30 number. The player ID number can be used by the central authority to address the
   value of an account corresponding to the player ID number or to access preferences,
   such as award type, of the player. Thus, the central authority keeps no account value
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                    6
   or preferences corresponding to the MAG number or OCR number; it only keeps an
   account value and preferences corresponding to the player ID number, correlated with
   the OCR number by a table.
               Central authority 120 includes a central processing unit (CPU) 122 that
 5 operates through a network interface 124 and a network 126 to enable communication
   of data with gaming locations 102, 104 and 106. Network 126 may be a conventional
   local area network, which allows data to be sent directly between any of gaming
   locations 102, 104 and 106, and central 10 authority 120. Memory 121 also may store
   data for the award type display shown in Figure 2. Alternatively, the data for the award
10 types may be stored locally in the memories for each of the gaming locations, such as
   memory 146.
                Figure 2 illustrates message display 118 in relationship to game display 110.
   Display 118 illustrates an exemplary display 160 representing the types of awards
   available for selection by a player. As will suggest itself, display 118 may be
15 implemented as a window within display 110, for example.
                Four award types are shown in Figure 2, although additional award types may
   be displayed for selection by the player. The selection of an award type by the player
   dictates how awards will be processed by the system. In certain regulated jurisdictions,
   players are not permitted to change the award type. In those jurisdictions, the
20 machines payout only cash, for example. However, bonus awards may be unregulated,
   and thus, the player may be allowed to select the type of bonus award. Thus, in certain
   regulated jurisdictions, embodiments of the invention may be limited to bonus awards
   only and may not be used for regulated gaming machine payouts.
               Referring again to Figure 2, award type 1 is cash. For example, when the
25 player wins or is granted an award during play of a game on machine 102A, cash may
   be dispensed by the game in the form of coins. Typically, however, the cash won will
   be put on the credit meter in the form of credits. The player may then press the
   cashout button on the gaming machine to obtain cash, or merely play out all or some of
   the credits.
30             Award 2 is points which are convertible to cash. For example, if a player wins a
   game or is awarded a bonus on machine 102A, the value of the win or bonus is
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                   7
   transferred to the player's account in memory 121 in the form of points, which may be
   redeemable for cash (or for play) at a later time.
               Award 3 is complementaries (comps) that are not convertible to cash, but are
   convertible to other awards, such as goods (e.g., meals) or services (e.g., hotel
 5 accommodations). For example, if a player wins a game or is awarded a bonus on
   machine 102A, the value of the win or award may be transferred to the player's
   account in memory 121 in the form of comps, that is, in the form of comp dollars. Such
   comp dollars may be used to purchase goods or services.
               Award 4 is a bonus game. For example, if a player wins a game or is awarded
10 a bonus on machine 102A, the win or bonus award may be the activation of a
   secondary bonus game.
               As will be appreciated from the above discussion, "cash" is an award type
   whereas; "$5.00" is an award and not an award type. "Points" is an award type;
   whereas, "50 points" is an award and not an award type. "Credits" is an award type;
15 whereas, "5 credits" is an award. "Comps" or "comp dollars" is an award type; whereas
   "$5.00 comp value" is an award. "Bonus game" is an award type. "Secondary game" is
   an award type. Even where the game indication is specific as to the type of game, it is
   still an award type. For example, "roulette game" or "dice game" or "card game" or
   "blackjack" is an award type.
20             As shown in Figure 1, images required for play of the bonus game are
   displayed in a bonus game window 115 of message display 118. The bonus game is
   controlled by a conventional bonus game controller 116 that receives signals from CPU
    144 as shown. A similar bonus game controller 116A is provided at gaming location
    106. Bonus game controller 116 need not be a separate piece of hardware or software,
25 but may comprise software in interface 112 which is executed by CPU 144. Bonus
   game controller 116 may be software and/or hardware located anywhere in the
   system, which generates the bonus game in window 115.
               The bonus game is an award for a single gaming machine played by a single
   player, and not an award triggered by a group of gaming machines played by a
30 plurality of players. Play of the bonus game itself could result in an award, either fixed
   in type (e.g., cash) or selectable as to type by the player via a display 160. Further,
   play of the bonus game could result in another second bonus game, different than the
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                   8
   first bonus game. Such subsequent bonus games may increase in level of difficulty
   (based on odds, for example) with the player given the opportunity (by a display 160
   following each game) to select an award which has incremented in value to a level
   depending on the difficulty of the last bonus game played or to select a more difficult
 5 bonus game than the last bonus game played.
                For example, the bonus game may include the display of a plurality of images
   in window 115. The player selects one of the displayed images by touching the image
   on the display. This touch action by the player reveals a bonus award beneath the
   touched image, which is granted to the player. The bonus award under the touched
10 image may be $50, for example. A bonus award under another image which was not
   touched may be 500 points, for example. The bonus award under a third untouched
   image may be a buffet dinner. Other bonus games may be used as will suggest
   themselves to persons skilled in the art. It is to be appreciated that award preferences
   earlier selected by the player could control the bonus game presented. For example,
15 where the player prefers credits, a bonus game that awards only credits would be used
   with that player.
               Signals identifying the award types shown in Figure 2 may be stored in memory
   146 or memory 121. Memory 121 also may store an account for the player that is
   correlated with the ID number of the player associated with club card 152.
20 Alternatively, the account for the player may be correlated to the player at the gaming
   machine in a way other than the Club Card, as for example, by the player typing a
   password on the keypad, or responding at the keypad to visual display prompts, or by
   a finger print reader or other biometric entry device.
               Either CPU 144 or CPU 122 causes the available award type data stored in
25 memory 146 or memory 121 to result in the display shown in Figure 2 on message
   display 118. As shown in Figure 2, the player is encouraged to select one of the four
   types of awards listed on the display. Selection can be performed by touching the
   image of the desired award type on screen 118, or by entering the number
   corresponding to the desired award type on keypad 114, followed by depression of an
30 "ENTER" button on the keypad.
               The selected award type is then used immediately (if there is an award
   pending) to issue the award in the selected form. Thus, display 160 may be presented
   each time an award is won.
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                    9
               Alternatively, display 160 may be used to obtain the player's preference before
   the award is won. The selected award is stored in memory 146 or may be stored in
   memory 121 in relationship to the player account for the player. For example, the
   selected award type may be indexed or correlated with the ID number of the player.
 5 Alternatively, the selected award type may be stored in the account for the player.
               Thus, after a player has been identified at a gaming machine due to use of a
   player card or otherwise, CPU 122 downloads the player's preference as to award
   types from memory 121 to memory 146. CPU 144 then controls the awards in
   accordance with the downloaded preference.
10              For example, a bonus award having a value of $5.00 may be granted each time
   the game reels display 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. When the bonus award is won, CPU 144 will
   make payment according to the appropriate award type based on the player's
   preference of award type that was downloaded when the player was earlier identified.
   That is, the bonus award having a $5.00 value will be either (1) cash in the form of 5
15 credits put on the credit meter, assuming this to be a $1.00 denomination game, (2) 50
   points added to the player's account, (3) $5.00 of comp value added to the player's
   account, or (4) the play of a bonus game.
                Ifthere are no preferences available to CPU 144 because the player does not
   have an account, for example, or that the player has not stored preferences in
20 association with his or her account, or otherwise, CPU 144 may generate display 160.
   The player then responds to display 160 to receive the award in the type selected.
               Alternatively, the casino may establish specific awards on the screen 160. For
   example, number 1 on display 160 may be set to read "5 credits", number 2 may be
   set to read "50 points", 5 number 3 may be set to read "$10.00 comp" or "Free Buffet
25 Dinner". This allows the casino to customize the display 160. Further, a different
   display 160 may be used for a different bonus award. If the reel combination is 2, 4, 6,
   8, 10, then one display 160 with preprogrammed settings is displayed to the player; if
   the reel combination is 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, then another display 160 with different
   preprogrammed settings is displayed to the player. The casino may cause individual
30 gaming machines to store signals for a display 160 in memory 146, or the casino may
   cause the signals for display(s) 160 to be stored in memory 121.
   10183869_1(GHMaters) P88337.AU.4

                                                      10
               A player may change his stored preference at the gaming machine through
   interaction with the display 118 and/or keypad 114. The change in preference may
   then be uploaded to memory 121.
               Still further, in the event that a player does not have an account, the selected
 5 award type (for example, cash or bonus game) may be stored at the gaming machine
   in memory 146. This selected award type then controls the following play on that
   gaming machine. For example, the machine 102A could generate display 160 as each
   new player begins play. This could occur from a fixed time after the credit meter
   reaches zero, to indicate that a new player has begun to play. This allows a player to
10 select cash or bonus game awards to be the set criteria, without the need for the player
   to have a player account. The set criteria could be stored in memory 146.
               The award selection screen shown in Figure 2 may be presented before a
   game is played on gaming machine 102A, during the play of such a game, or after
   completion of play of the game on machine 102A (or after a bonus award has been
15 won). The time of the display of the display 160 is controlled by CPU 144 or CPU 122
   in a well-known manner.
               The display 160 of the award selection screen shown in Figure 2 may result
   from play of a first game on machine 102A. For example, the display may be triggered
   by winning of a game played on machine 102A or by occurrence of a random event
20 during play of the game on machine 102A. Alternatively, the display 160 shown in
    Figure 2 may be triggered by a random event at a time when no game is being played
   on machine 102A. For example, as soon as the player logs onto machine 102A by
   inserting his club card, the CPU 122 may note that the player is having a birthday, and
   may initiate the display shown in Figure 2 as a reward.
25             As understood, points or comp awards, as well as award preferences, may be
   stored in memory 146 during play by the player of gaming machine 102A and then
   uploaded to memory 121 every hour or at the time of removal of the player card 152
   from card reader 150.
