ABSTRACT
A urinary catheter deployment cassette or system includes a catheter pack, a urinary catheter,
and an introducer aid. The catheter pack defines an interior compartment having a rotatable
spindle at least partially positioned therein. The urinary catheter is at least partially received
within the interior compartment of the catheter pack and associated with the spindle. The
catheter pack includes a deformable or pierceable cover that the spindle engagement member
of the introducer aid is pressed to rotate the spindle and deploy the catheter from the catheter
pack. In another embodiment, a catheter pack includes an associated drainage adaptor for
draining fluid from the catheter pack or a urinary catheter positioned within the catheter pack.
In another embodiment, a cassette includes a rotatable drum with a two-piece catheter
wrapped around it and a joining tube that places the pieces of the catheter in fluid
communication.

RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]     This application claims the benefit of and priority of U.S. Provisional Patent
Application Serial No. 61/857,282, filed July 23, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated
by reference herein.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The present disclosure generally relates to urinary catheters. More particularly, the
present disclosure relates to cassettes for deploying urinary catheters.
BACKGROUND
[0003]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0004]     Catheters are used to treat many different types of medical conditions and typically
include an elongated shaft that is inserted into and through a passageway or lumen of the
body. Catheters, and in particular intermittent catheters, are commonly used by those who
suffer from various abnormalities of the urinary system, such as urinary incontinence. With the
advent of intermittent catheters, individuals with urinary system abnormalities can self-insert
and self-remove intermittent catheters several times a day. Such catheters typically include a
shaft that is sufficiently flexible to navigate the curves of the urethra (especially catheters
intended for male users), yet rigid enough to be pushed through the urethra without collapsing
or buckling before an end of the catheter reaches the bladder.
[0005]     With proper training and experience, urinary catheters may be easily used by those
of sufficient hand dexterity. However, for those of limited hand dexterity, using a urinary
catheter can be difficult, such that it would be advantageous to provide a urinary catheter
deployment system for users of limited hand dexterity.
SUMMARY
[0006]     There are several aspects of the present subject matter which may be embodied
separately or together in the devices and systems described and claimed below. These

                                                  -2
aspects may be employed alone or in combination with other aspects of the subject matter
described herein, and the description of these aspects together is not intended to preclude the
use of these aspects separately or the claiming of such aspects separately or in different
combinations as set forth in the claims appended hereto.
[0007]     In one aspect, a urinary catheter deployment system is provided. The system
includes a catheter pack, a urinary catheter, and an introducer aid. The catheter pack defines
an interior compartment having a rotatable spindle at least partially positioned therein. A
deformable or pierceable cover is associated with the interior compartment. The urinary
catheter is at least partially positioned within the interior compartment of the catheter pack and
associated with the spindle. The introducer aid includes at least one spindle engagement
member configured to cooperate with the catheter pack to deform or pierce the cover and
engage the spindle for deploying the urinary catheter from the catheter pack.
[0008]     In another aspect, a urinary catheter deployment system is provided. The system
includes a catheter pack, a urinary catheter, and a pusher. The catheter pack defines an
interior compartment having a rotatable spindle, the urinary catheter, and the pusher at least
partially positioned therein. The pusher is associated with the spindle and configured to rotate
therewith and contact the urinary catheter, thereby deploying the urinary catheter from the
catheter pack.
[0009]     In yet another aspect, a urinary catheter deployment system is provided. The
system includes a housing, with a rotatable inner drum and urinary catheter at least partially
positioned within an interior compartment of the housing. The urinary catheter is associated
with the inner drum such that rotation of the inner drum deploys the urinary catheter from the
housing. The urinary catheter includes separate first and second pieces that are secured to
the inner drum, with the inner drum having a joining tube in fluid communication with the two
pieces of the urinary catheter.
[0010]     In one aspect, a urinary catheter deployment system is provided. The system
includes a catheter pack defining an interior compartment; a rotatable spindle at least partially
positioned within the interior compartment of the catheter pack; a urinary catheter at least
partially positioned within the interior compartment of the catheter pack; and a pusher
associated with the spindle and at least partially positioned within the interior compartment of
the catheter pack, wherein the pusher is configured to rotate with the spindle and contact the
urinary catheter, thereby deploying the urinary catheter from the catheter pack.

claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
"including, but not limited to".

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS
[0071]     The embodiments disclosed herein are for the purpose of providing a description of
the present subject matter, and it is understood that the subject matter may be embodied in
various other forms and combinations not shown in detail. Therefore, specific embodiments
and features disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting the subject matter as defined
in the accompanying claims.
[0072]     An exemplary male urinary catheter C according to conventional design is shown in
Fig. 1. A proximal end P of the catheter C includes one or more draining holes or eyes E for
the drainage of bodily fluids therethrough and into an internal conduit or lumen of the catheter
C. The distal end D of the catheter may include a connecting member F, such as a funnel, for
fluidly connecting the catheter C to a collection container, such as a collection bag into which
urine drains.

                                                  -8
[0073]     The catheter C may be used in combination with a protective tip or cover T (Fig. 2)
that substantially encircles at least a portion of the proximal end P. Fig. 3 shows the proximal
end P of the catheter C received within the protective tip T. The protective tip T has a
generally tubular body portion B defining an interior cavity V (Fig. 3) that extends between an
open end 0 and an access end A. The open end 0 is the end of the protective tip T into which
the catheter C is inserted (in a direction toward the access end A). The access end A is
movable between a generally closed condition when the proximal end P of the catheter C is
positioned within the protective tip T (illustrated) and a generally open condition when the
catheter C is advanced proximally (i.e., in a right-to-left direction in the orientation of Fig. 3) so
as to pass through the access end A for advancement into and through the urethra. As shown
in Figs. 2 and 3, the access end A of the protective tip T may include one or more slits S,
according to conventional design, that allow it to move between the generally closed and
generally open conditions.
[0074]     The protective tip T serves to isolate the proximal end P of the catheter C (including
the eyes E) from the outside environment (e.g., from touch contamination whereby bacteria
present on a user's hands might be transferred to the proximal end P of the catheter C) prior to
insertion into the urethra and from the relatively high concentration of bacteria typically present
in the distal urethra. By isolating the proximal end P of the catheter C from the outside
environment, the sterility of the proximal end P may be maintained.
[0075]     Figs. 4-15 show one embodiment of a catheter pack or package 10 of a deployment
cassette or system 12 (Fig. 19). As seen in Figs. 6-8, the catheter pack 10 may define an
interior chamber or compartment 14 in which at least a portion of a catheter C may be
received. In the illustrated embodiment, only a portion of the catheter C is positioned and
housed within the interior compartment 14, with the proximal end P of the catheter C, including
the protective tip T being positioned and housed within an adjacent, adjoining interior
compartment 16 of the catheter pack 10. In a preferred embodiment, the catheter C is
provided without a funnel F at its distal end D, but it is also within the scope of the present
disclosure for the catheter C to include a distal funnel F or the like without departing from the
scope of the present disclosure.
[0076]     The illustrated first interior compartment 14 is defined by a bottom wall 18 and
upstanding sidewall 20 to have a generally circular or cylindrical shape, with a passage 22
extending through the sidewall 20 to allow the first interior compartment 14 to communicate
with the second interior compartment 16. The sidewall 20 includes a drainage opening or

                                                -9
passage 24 that allows communication between the first interior compartment 14 and the
outside of the catheter pack 10. The drainage opening 24 allows for removal of urine or fluid
from the catheter pack 10, as will be described in greater detail herein.
[0077]     Fig. 7 shows a catheter C positioned within the catheter pack 10, with a distal portion
of the catheter C wrapped around a spool or spindle 26 located within the first interior
compartment 14. The spindle 26 and catheter C are further illustrated in Figs. 8-11. At least a
portion of the spindle 26 is configured to rotate within the first interior compartment 14, such as
by rotating about a pin or peg 28 extending into the compartment 14 from the bottom wall 18.
In one embodiment, only an upper portion of the spindle 26 (i.e., the portion spaced away from
the bottom wall 18) rotates, while a lower portion of the spindle 26 does not rotate, but is
instead substantially stationary with respect to the catheter pack 10. In such an embodiment,
the pin or peg 28 (if provided) may be used to properly position the spindle 26 within the
interior compartment 14 without the spindle 26 rotating about the pin or peg 28. At least a
portion of the spindle 26 rotates to advance or pay out the catheter C from the interior
compartment 14, via the passage 22 and the second interior compartment 16, as seen in Fig.
10 and as will be described in greater detail.
[0078]     As best shown in Fig. 9, the distal end D of the catheter C may be connected or
secured to a portion of the spindle 26. If the distal end D of the catheter C is secured or
connected to the spindle 26, it may be connected to either a rotatable portion or a non
rotatable portion of the spindle 26. The spindle 26 may define a chamber 30 in fluid
communication with the distal end D of the catheter C, which configuration allows for urine to
drain out of the catheter C and into the chamber 30. The urine may subsequently be drained
out of the catheter pack 10, as will be described in greater detail herein.
[0079]     In the illustrated embodiment, the spindle 26 and the chamber 30 may be separated
from the bottom wall 18 by a permeable layer 32 and/or a vapor insert or disk 34, as shown in
Fig. 11. In one embodiment, the vapor disk 34 is treated with a vapor-donating fluid (e.g.,
water), while the permeable layer 32 acts as a barrier that prevents direct contact between the
vapor disk 34 and the other components within the compartment 14. The permeable layer 32
may be secured to (e.g., by heat-sealing) the vapor disk 34 and/or the bottom wall 18 to isolate
the vapor disk 34 from the other components within the compartment 14. The permeable layer
32 may be formed of calcium carbonate or a comparable material that allows vapor to pass
from the vapor disk 34 into the compartment 14, where the vapor interacts with the catheter C.
The catheter C may include a hydrophilic coating that, when exposed to vapor from the vapor

                                                    -10
disk 34, provides the catheter C with a lubricious surface, for increased comfort when the
catheter C is advanced into a urethra. It may be advantageous to isolate the vapor disk 34
from the catheter C to prevent water droplets from forming on the catheter C or elsewhere
within the compartment 14. In an alternative embodiment, the vapor disk 34 may be replaced
with a vapor-permeable sachet, which may be disk-shaped for example, with the sachet being
filled with a vapor-donating hydration fluid.
[0080]      The catheter pack 10 further includes a cover 36 positioned opposite the bottom wall
18. The cover 36 is sealed against the upper ends of the sidewall 20 to effectively close the
top of the compartments 14 and 16.
[0081]      The spindle 26 may include a formed feature or cavity 38 (Fig. 7) facing the cover 36.
In the illustrated embodiment, the feature 38 is a generally pyramid-shaped cavity (with the
apex of the pyramid spaced from the cover 36 and the base of the pyramid positioned adjacent
to the cover 36), but other configurations may be employed without departing from the scope
of the present disclosure. The cover 36 is preferably manufactured from a material, such as a
thin foil material, that may be deformed and/or pierced to access the cavity 38 through the
cover 36 using an external device, as will be described in greater detail herein.
[0082]      Fig. 5 illustrates an at least partially removable portion or side cover 40 of the
catheter pack 10, with Fig. 12 showing the side cover 40 being partially removed. As shown in
Figs. 6-8, the sidewall 20 may extend only partially around the perimeter of the bottom wall 18,
leaving a gap associated with the second interior compartment 16. The side cover 40 is
sealed against the sidewall 20, bottom wall 18, and cover 36 (of which the side cover 40 may
be an integrated or separate component) to effectively close the open portion or gap of the
second interior compartment 16. As shown in Fig. 12, the side cover 40 may be at least
partially detached to allow access into the second interior compartment 16 for removal of the
catheter C therefrom, as will be described in greater detail herein. In other embodiments, the
side cover 40 may be differently configured or omitted, depending on the configuration of the
catheter pack 10.
[0083]      Returning now to the drainage opening 24 in the sidewall 20, it may receive an
extendable drainage channel or tube 42 (Figs. 13-14). The channel 42 may be substantially
rigid or collapsible. If the channel 42 is rigid, it may move between a retracted position, in
which it is at least partially (but, preferably, substantially entirely) received within the first
interior compartment 14 (e.g., within the spindle chamber 30, if provided) and an extended

                                                   - 11
position (Fig. 13), in which it is at least partially (but, preferably, substantially entirely)
positioned outside of the first interior compartment 14. If provided, the channel 42 may include
a removable or detachable cover flap 44 sealed to its outer end 46 to effectively close the
channel 42 prior to use. Fig. 4 shows the cover flap 44 in a sealed condition, while Fig. 13
shows the cover flap 44 in an open or unsealed condition. Figs. 13-14 show the channel 42 in
an extended condition, but it should be understood that the channel 42 may be maintained
within the catheter pack 10 prior to use. As will be explained in greater detail herein, the
channel 42 may be used to drain urine from the first interior compartment 14 during and/or
after use of the catheter pack 10. In other embodiments, which will be described in greater
detail herein, other means may be provided for draining urine from a catheter pack, so it
should be understood that the drainage opening 24 and channel 42 are optional features of a
catheter pack according to the present disclosure.
[0084]      Fig. 15 shows the underside of the catheter pack 10, with a strap or retention feature
48 (illustrated as a hand strap) secured thereto. If provided, the hand strap 48 may be held by
a user during use of the catheter pack 10 to stabilize and/or orient the catheter pack 10.
[0085]      Figs. 16-18 illustrate an exemplary embodiment of an introducer aid 50 that may be
used in combination with the catheter pack 10 of Figs. 4-15 to provide a urinary catheter
deployment cassette or system 12 (Figs. 19-22). The introducer aid 50 includes a base or
body 52 with a rotatable element 54 on its upper side. The rotatable element 54 is illustrated
as a disk, but it may be otherwise shaped without departing from the scope of the present
disclosure. The rotatable element 54 may be provided with an audible feature, such that it
makes a sound (e.g., a "clicking" noise) as it rotates.
[0086]      The underside of the introducer aid 50 (Fig. 17) includes a spindle engagement
member or projection 56. The spindle engagement member 56 is associated with the rotatable
element 54 such that rotation of the rotatable element 54 rotates the spindle engagement
member 56 to the same degree. The spindle engagement member 56 is shaped and
configured to be received by the cavity 38 at the upper end of the spindle 26 of the catheter
pack 10. Preferably, the spindle engagement member 56 is shaped and configured to engage
the cavity 38 (either directly by piercing the cover 36 of the catheter pack 10 or indirectly by
deforming the cover 36) and rotate the spindle 26 when the spindle engagement member 56 is
pressed against the cover 36 and rotated. Most preferably, the spindle engagement member
56 has a shape that is complementary to the shape of the cavity 38 (e.g., a pyramid shape in

                                                 - 12
the illustrated embodiment), but the spindle engagement member 56 may be otherwise
configured without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0087]      As noted above, the spindle engagement member 56 may be rotated by rotating the
rotatable element 54. The rotatable element 54 may be rotated by directly contacting it and
rotating it around an axis (e.g., a central axis of the spindle engagement member 56) or by use
of an associated pull string or draw string 58. At least a portion of the rotatable element 54
(e.g., the upper surface, as shown in Fig. 16) may be textured or otherwise configured for
improved traction when rotating the rotatable element 54 by direct contact (e.g., by the hand of
a user). Fig. 18 shows a portion of the rotatable element 54 omitted, with the pull string 58
wrapped around and secured to a central hub 60 of the rotatable element 54. By pulling the
pull string 58 away from the introducer aid 50, the pull string 58 unwinds from the central hub
60, thereby causing the central hub 60, the rotatable element 54, and the spindle engagement
member 56 to rotate about a common axis. Typically, using the pull string 58 causes the
rotatable element 54 and the spindle engagement member 56 to rotate more quickly than
when directly contacting and manually rotating the rotatable element 54. When the introducer
aid 50 is provided with a pull string 58, the introducer aid 50 may include a mechanism for
automatically retracting the pull string 58, such as a spring-operated retractor or retraction
device, such that the pull string 58 is biased to its original position. Alternatively, the rotatable
element 54 may be rotated (in a direction opposite to the direction in which it rotates in order to
advance or pay out the catheter C) to retract the pull string 58.
[0088]      Figs. 19-21 show the introducer aid 50 being moved into cooperative engagement
with the catheter pack 10. In particular, the introducer aid 50 is oriented with the underside of
the introducer aid 50 (and, hence, the spindle engagement member 56) facing the cover 36 of
the catheter pack 10. The underside of the introducer aid 50 is pressed against the cover 36
of the catheter pack 10, with the spindle engagement member 56 in alignment with the cavity
38 of the spindle 26. It may be preferable for the shapes of the introducer aid 50 and the
catheter pack 10 to be provided so as to encourage or enforce proper alignment of the spindle
engagement member 56 and the catheter pack 10, such that there is only one way in which
the two may be fully pressed together. For example, as in the illustrated embodiment, one or
both of the catheter pack 10 and the introducer aid 50 may include ribs or projections that can
only be received in corresponding cavities or openings of the other device when the two
devices are properly oriented with respect to each other.

                                                -13
[0089]      Fig. 21 shows the catheter pack 10 and the introducer aid 50 fully connected to each
other, with the spindle engagement member 56 at least partially received within the cavity 38
of the spindle 26. The spindle engagement member 56 deforms and/or pierces the cover 36 of
the catheter pack 10 to move into the cavity 38 of the spindle 26. One or both of the catheter
pack 10 and the introducer aid 50 may include features that allow the catheter pack 10 and the
introducer aid 50 to be temporarily retained or locked together when the spindle engagement
member 56 has been at least partially received within the cavity 38 of the spindle 26, such as
the extending clip or rim 62 of the catheter pack 10 and the groove or lip 64 of the introducer
aid 50 (Fig. 20) that receives the clip or rim 62. With the catheter pack 10 and the introducer
aid 50 so joined as shown in Fig. 21, the spindle 26 may be rotated by rotating the rotatable
element 54 of the introducer aid 50.
[0090]      Figs. 23-26 show an exemplary method of using the urinary catheter deployment
cassette or system 12. First, a user obtains a catheter pack 10 and an introducer aid 50. In
one embodiment, the catheter pack 10 is a single-use item, while the introducer aid 50 is a
more durable item, which is intended for repeated use. In other examples, both of the items
may be intended for single use or for multiple use, or the catheter pack 10 may be intended for
reloading and reuse, while the introducer aid 50 is a single-use item. In the event that the
catheter pack 10 is a single-use item, as in a preferred embodiment, a plurality of catheter
packs 10 may be provided in a container or housing 66 (Fig. 22), with the user obtaining a
single catheter pack 10 from the container 66 prior to use.
[0091]      The user grips or otherwise engages the catheter pack 10 (e.g., using the hand strap
48, if provided, as shown in Fig. 23) and at least partially removes the side cover 40 (Fig. 24)
to allow access to the interior of the catheter pack 10 via the second interior compartment 16.
As shown in Fig. 24, the side cover 40 may include one or more formations (e.g., a tab or
annular thumb loop 68) to allow a user to more easily remove or detach the side cover 40. In
the illustrated embodiment, the side cover 40 includes thumb loops 68 at opposite ends of the
side cover 40, thereby allowing for either right- or left-hand manipulation and removal of the
side cover 40.
[0092]      With the side cover 40 at least partially detached, the user presses the spindle
engagement member 56 of the separate introducer aid 50 into the cavity 38 of the spindle 26
of the catheter pack 10 (Fig. 25) until the catheter pack 10 and the introducer aid 50 are
temporarily secured together to define the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 12,
as described above in greater detail. One or both of the devices may be provided with

                                                 - 14
graphical indicia to help orient the introducer aid 50 with respect to the catheter pack 10.
Additionally, only a portion of the cover 36 of the catheter pack 10 may be deformable or
pierceable or may be more deformable or pierceable than other portions of the cover 36 (e.g.,
the portion overlaying the spindle 26 may be the only deformable or pierceable portion of the
cover 36), to prevent deformation or piercing of an improper location of the cover 36.
[0093]      With the catheter pack 10 and the introducer aid 50 connected to form the urinary
catheter deployment cassette or system 12 (Fig. 26), the rotatable element 54 of the introducer
aid 50 may be rotated to rotate the spindle engagement member 56 which, in turn, rotates the
spindle 26, as described above in greater detail. By so rotating the spindle 26, the catheter C
is advanced or paid out from the interior of the catheter pack 10 via the open portion of the
second interior compartment 16 that is exposed by detaching the side cover 40 (if provided).
In one embodiment, the catheter C is configured and positioned within the catheter pack 10
such that the protective tip T and at least a portion of the proximal end P will automatically
move outside of the catheter pack 10 upon detachment of the side cover 40, without having to
rotate the spindle 26.
[0094]      With at least the protective tip T and a portion of the proximal end P of the catheter C
positioned outside of the catheter pack 10, the proximal end P of the catheter C may be
advanced into the urethra by proper alignment of the catheter C and use of the rotatable
element 54. It may be advantageous for the user to directly contact and rotate the rotatable
element 54 initially to more slowly advance or pay out the catheter C from the catheter pack 10
and ensure proper introduction of the catheter C into the urethra. When the user is assured
that the catheter C has been properly introduced into the urethra, the pull string 58 may be
used to more quickly rotate the rotatable element 54 and advance or pay out the catheter C to
its final insertion location, with the proximal end P of the catheter C positioned within the
bladder.
[0095]      With the catheter C properly positioned, the cover flap 44 of the catheter pack 10
may be opened or unsealed, and then the channel 42 may be extended, as shown in Fig. 26.
Urine flowing through the catheter C enters the interior of the catheter pack 10, to a location in
fluid communication with the channel 42 (e.g., the spindle chamber 30). The channel 42
drains the urine from the interior of the catheter pack 10 into a toilet or other disposal location.
[0096]      When the user is done with the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 12,
the catheter C is retracted from the urethra into the catheter pack 10 by rotating the rotatable

                                                 -15
element 54 in the opposite direction of the direction in which it was initially rotated to advance
or pay out the catheter C. Alternatively, the catheter C may be removed from the urethra by
moving the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 12 in a distal direction away from
the urethra. With the catheter C fully removed from the urethra, the introducer aid 50 may be
detached from the catheter pack 10 by moving the two devices away from each other in a
direction opposite to the direction in which they were initially moved to join them. Detachment
of the introducer aid 50 from the catheter pack 10 may be simplified by providing one or both
devices with a removal aid, such as the thumb ring or loop 70 of the illustrated introducer aid
50 (Fig. 16), that may be gripped by a user following use of the urinary catheter deployment
cassette or system 12. Finally, the catheter pack 10 may be disposed of, while the introducer
aid 50 is retained for subsequent use with another catheter pack 10 (if the catheter pack 10 is
disposable and the introducer aid 50 is reusable, as in a preferred embodiment). If the
introducer aid 50 is to be reused, it is preferred for urine flowing through the catheter pack 10
to avoid contact with the spindle engagement member 56, such that the introducer aid 50 is
not contaminated by urine during use.
[0097]      Urinary catheter deployment cassettes or systems according to the foregoing
description have a number of advantages. For example, the user is not required to grip or
directly handle the catheter during use, thereby reducing the risk of contamination. Also, the
cassette or system can be easily used by a person with limited dexterity, while also providing a
consistent routine for catheterization. Furthermore, the catheter itself is provided in a package
(which may be hydrophilic) that is compact and discrete, such that a user could conceal the
catheter pack (and the catheter housed therein) prior to use.
[0098]      Figs. 27-53 illustrate another embodiment of a urinary catheter deployment cassette
or system 100 (Fig. 37) having these same benefits. Figs. 27 and 28 show a packaged
catheter pack 102 (Fig. 27) and a packaged drainage adaptor 104 (Fig. 28) of the urinary
catheter deployment cassette or system 100. The catheter pack 102 is shown in greater detail
in Figs. 29-34, while the drainage adaptor 104 is shown in greater detail in Figs. 35 and 36.
The combined catheter pack 102 and drainage adaptor 104 (i.e., the urinary catheter
deployment cassette or system 100) are shown in Figs. 37-41. Figs. 42-53 illustrate an
exemplary embodiment of a method of using the urinary catheter deployment cassette or
system 100.
[0099]     The catheter pack 102 includes a base or body 106 with a rotatable element 108
associated therewith. The rotatable element 108 is illustrated as a disk associated with the

                                                 -16
upper surface of the catheter pack body 106, but it may be otherwise shaped and positioned
without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The rotatable element 108 may be
provided with an audible feature, such that it makes a sound (e.g., a "clicking" noise) as it
rotates.
[00100]    The rotatable element 108 includes a downwardly extending projection or spindle
110 (Fig. 33) that enters into the interior compartment 112 of the catheter pack 102 via an
opening or aperture in the upper surface of the catheter pack body 106. The spindle 110 is
associated with the rotatable element 108 such that rotation of the rotatable element 108
rotates the spindle 110 to the same degree. A pusher 114 is associated with the spindle 110
for rotation with the spindle 110. In the illustrated embodiment, the pusher 114 includes an
arm 116 that extends radially outwardly from the spindle 110 and a catheter-engagement
portion 118 associated with the pusher arm 116 at a position spaced radially outwardly of the
spindle 110. The pusher arm 116 may have an intermediate rigidity, allowing it to be
sufficiently rigid to engage and press a catheter C along a generally helical guide or track 120
positioned within the compartment 112, while also being sufficiently flexible to follow along the
track 120 as the elevation of the track 120 with respect to the pusher arm 116 changes. The
way in which the pusher 114 and track 120 cooperate to deploy a catheter C will be described
in greater detail herein.
[00101]    The spindle 110 and pusher 114 may be rotated by rotating the rotatable element
108, either by directly contacting it and spinning it around an axis (e.g., a central axis of the
spindle 110) or by use of an associated pull string or draw string 122 (Fig. 34). At least a
portion of the rotatable element 108 (e.g., its upper surface) may be textured or otherwise
configured for improved traction by the hand of a user for rotation by directly contacting the
rotatable element 108. Fig. 33 shows a cross-section of the catheter pack 102, with the pull
string 122 wrapped around and secured to a central hub 124 associated with the pusher 114,
although it is also within the scope of the present disclosure for the pull string 122 to be
wrapped around and secured to the spindle 110. If provided, the central hub 124 may be
secured to the pusher 114, such that rotation of the rotatable element 108 serves to rotate the
central hub 124 and vice versa. A shaft or stem 126 may pass through openings or apertures
of the pusher 114 and central hub 124 and be received within a cavity of the spindle 110 to
help align the spindle 110, the pusher 114, and the central hub 124 and to simplify assembly of
the catheter pack 102.

                                                -17
[00102]    By pulling the pull string 122 away from the catheter pack 102, the pull string 122
unwinds from the central hub 124 and/or the spindle 110, thereby causing the rotatable
element 108 and the pusher 114 to rotate about a common axis. Typically, using the pull
string 122 causes the rotatable element 108 and the pusher 114 to rotate more quickly than
when directly contacting and rotating the rotatable element 108 by hand.
[00103]    The track 120 of the illustrated catheter pack 102 extends between a first or lower
opening 128 defined in the bottom wall or surface 130 of the catheter pack 102 (Fig. 32) and a
second or upper opening 132 (Fig. 30) defined in a sidewall of the catheter pack 102. The
track 120 defines a generally helical path through the interior compartment 112 of the catheter
pack 102 that is traversed by at least a portion of the catheter C during use of the urinary
catheter deployment cassette or system 100. In contrast to the first embodiment, the catheter
C and the means for deploying the catheter C are both incorporated into the catheter pack
102, rather than having a separate introducer aid. In particular, the catheter-engagement
portion 118 of the pusher 114 contacts a distal portion or end D of the catheter C and pushes
the catheter C along the track 120 as the pusher 114 is rotated (by either rotating the rotatable
element 108 or pulling the pull string 122). Sufficient advancement of the catheter C along the
track 120 causes the proximal end P of the catheter C to exit the catheter pack 102 via the
second opening 132 for introduction into the urethra. The pusher 114 may provide a positive
stop or impediment that allows only a portion of the catheter C to be deployed from the
catheter pack 102, while preventing complete removal of the catheter C from the catheter pack
102. While it may be advantageous for the catheter pack 102 to include a generally helical
track 120 to guide the catheter C out of the catheter pack 102 during use, it is also within the
scope of the present disclosure for the track 120 to have a different shape or for a track 120 to
be omitted from the catheter pack 102.
[00104]    The second opening 132 of the catheter pack 102 may be configured to receive a
separately provided protective tip T that may be loaded into and temporarily retained within the
second opening 132 after the catheter pack 102 has been removed from its container 134.
The protective tip T may be provided in a cap 136 that may be handled without directly
contacting the protective tip T. Prior to use, the cap 136 (with the protective tip T loaded
therein) is pressed into the second opening 132, such that at least a portion of its body portion
B is retained within the second opening 132, while at least the access end A is positioned
outside of the catheter pack 102. Subsequently, the cap 136 is removed (Fig. 34) to expose
the protective tip T, which is eventually engaged by the proximal end P of the catheter C as the
catheter C is advanced along the track 120 to the second opening 132, as described above.

                                                -18
[00105]    The lower opening 128 allows for urine to drain from the catheter C and/or the
interior compartment 112 into the associated drainage adaptor 104, as will be described in
greater detail herein. If the track 120 is configured to extend between the lower and upper
openings 128 and 132 of the catheter pack 102, then the track 120 may guide or direct urine
from the catheter C to the lower opening 128. The bottom wall 130 of the catheter pack 102
may be configured to assist in directing urine drained through the catheter C to the lower
opening 128, such as by having slanted surfaces that define a funnel centered about the lower
opening 128. Additionally, the bottom wall 130 may include a permeable layer and vapor disk
or sachet (not illustrated), similar to the permeable layer 32 and the vapor disk 34 of the first
embodiment, for hydrating and lubricating the catheter C positioned within the catheter pack
102.
[00106]    It may be advantageous to maintain the catheter pack 102 in a sterile environment
prior to use. Figs. 27 and 29 illustrate an exemplary container or housing 134 for the catheter
pack 102. The catheter pack 102 may be maintained within the container 134 prior to use,
with a cover or lid 138 of the container 134 being at least partially detachable to remove the
catheter pack 102 for use with the drainage adaptor 104 (as will be described in greater detail
below). If the catheter pack 102 is intended to be reused, then the cover or lid 138 may be
resealably associated with the container 134; otherwise, if the catheter pack 102 is intended as
a single-use item, then the cover or lid 138 may be permanently detachable from the container
134 to access the catheter pack 102.
[00107]    Figs. 35 and 36 illustrate the drainage adaptor 104 with a cover or lid 140 (Fig. 28)
removed therefrom. The drainage adaptor 104 includes a collapsible collection bag 142 (Fig.
36) that may be moved from a collapsed condition (Fig. 35) to an expanded condition (Fig. 36).
In the collapsed condition, the collection bag 142 is stored in the drainage adaptor 104 prior to
use without significantly increasing the height or size of the drainage adaptor 104. The
collection bag 142 may include labels, markings, or graphics to show the amount of urine
contained therein, and may also include a built-in handle or strap 144 to aid in holding the
collection bag 142 during use of the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100. The
bottom of the drainage adaptor 104 may include an engagement feature 146 (Fig. 36)
configured to retain the bottom of the drainage adaptor 104 in place against a toilet or other
surface. In one embodiment, the engagement feature 146 may be comprised of a sticky or
adhesive material that temporarily holds the bottom of the drainage adaptor 104 in position
against a surface, but also allows for the bottom of the drainage adaptor 104 to be removed
from the associated surface as desired.

                                                -19
[00108]    In the illustrated embodiment, the collection bag 142 extends between an upper end
or frame 148 and a lower end or frame 150 (Fig. 37), with the lower frame 150 being secured
to the body or base 152 of the drainage adaptor 104 and the upper frame 148 being movable
away from the drainage adaptor body 152. In one embodiment, the upper frame 148 may be
freely movable away from the drainage adaptor body 152 to expand the collection bag 142
whereas, in other embodiments, the drainage adaptor 104 may incorporate a release feature
(e.g., a pull tab or the like) that may be manipulated to release the upper frame 148 from the
body 152 to expand the collection bag 142.
[00109]    The frames 148 and 150 may be differently sized to allow the smaller one to fit or
nest within the larger one when the collection bag 142 is in a collapsed condition (as in Fig. 35,
where the upper frame 148 is larger than the lower frame 150) to reduce the total height of the
drainage adaptor 104 prior to use. The upper frame 148 is configured to be received by the
underside of the catheter pack 102 during use, as shown in Fig. 36. The upper frame 148
includes at least one opening to allow fluid from the catheter C of the catheter pack 102 to
drain out of the catheter pack 102 via the lower opening 128 and into the collection bag 142,
as will be described in greater detail herein.
[00110]    The drainage adaptor body 152 may further include a pull tab 154 (Fig. 36) or other
drain actuator that may be pulled or otherwise actuated by a user to drain urine out of the
collection bag 142, as will be described in greater detail herein.
[00111]    Similar to the catheter pack 102, it may be advantageous to maintain the drainage
adaptor 104 in a sterile environment prior to use. For example, Fig. 28 shows the drainage
adaptor 104 with a removable lid or cover 140 secured to the drainage adaptor body 152,
thereby sealing the collection bag 142 and frames 148 and 150 within an interior compartment
of the drainage adaptor 104 prior to use.
[00112]    Figs. 38-41 show the catheter pack 102 being moved into cooperative engagement
with the drainage adaptor 104. In particular, the catheter pack 102 is oriented with the
underside of the catheter pack 102 facing the upper frame 148 of the drainage adaptor 104.
The underside of the catheter pack 102 is pressed against the drainage adaptor 104 to seat
the upper frame 148 against or around the bottom wall 130 of the catheter pack 102. One or
both of the catheter pack 102 and the drainage adaptor 104 may include clips or the like to
allow the drainage adaptor 104 to be temporarily or permanently secured to the catheter pack
102. With the catheter pack 102 secured to the drainage adaptor 104, the catheter pack 102

                                                 - 20
may be rotated with respect to the drainage adaptor 104 to move it from an unaligned
condition or position (Fig. 39) to a properly aligned and oriented condition or position (Figs. 40
and 41) for use as a urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100.
[00113]     Figs. 42-53 show an exemplary method of using the urinary catheter deployment
cassette or system 100. First, a user obtains a catheter pack 102 and a drainage adaptor 104
and at least partially detaches or unseals the associated covers/lids (Figs. 42-43). The covers
or lids may include features or formations (e.g., the thumb holes or loops 156 of the illustrated
embodiment) to facilitate gripping and removing the covers/lids for users having limited hand
dexterity. If provided, the loops 156 or a separate loop or hanger or formation 158 (Fig. 29)
may be used to hang the container 134 during and/or prior to use of the catheter pack 102. If
the catheter pack 102 and/or drainage adaptor 104 includes an additional sanitary cover or
seal 160 (e.g., a material layer overlaying the rotatable element 108, as shown in Fig. 44), it
may be removed or detached at this time.
[00114]     The user then presses the body portion B of the protective tip T into the second
opening 132 of the catheter pack 102 using the cap 136, as shown in Fig. 45. The cap 136 is
removed from the protective tip T, leaving the protective tip T in the second opening 132 of the
catheter pack 102, as shown in Fig. 46. This may be done before or after the catheter pack
102 and the drainage adaptor 104 are pressed together and rotated into alignment to define in
combination the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100, as described above in
greater detail and shown in Figs. 39-41.
[00115]     With the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100 fully assembled, the
user places the protective tip T of the catheter C into the urethra and then rotates the rotatable
element 108 either by direct contact (Fig. 47) or using the pull string 122 (Fig. 48) to advance
the catheter C, as described above. In one embodiment, the rotatable element 108 may
initially be turned via direct contact to slowly advance the catheter C out of the catheter pack
102 via the second opening 132 and into the protective tip T. The protective tip T may be
advanced into the urethra either prior to advancing the proximal end P of the catheter C into
the protective tip T or after the proximal end P of the catheter C has been advanced into the
protective tip T. In this embodiment, after the proximal end P of the catheter C has exited the
protective tip T and entered the urethra, the pull string 122 of the catheter pack 102 may be
pulled to more quickly advance the catheter C through the urethra until the proximal end P is
properly positioned within the bladder.

                                               -21
[00116]    With the catheter C properly positioned (or prior to the proximal end P of the catheter
C being advanced into the bladder), the user may deploy and expand the collection bag 142,
as shown in Fig. 49. Urine drains from the bladder into the collection bag 142 via the catheter
C, with urine in the catheter C passing through the interior compartment 112 and lower
opening 128 of the catheter pack 102 to reach the collection bag 142.
[00117]    When the user is done with the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100,
the catheter C is retracted from the urethra into the catheter pack 102 by rotating the rotatable
element 108 in the opposite direction of the direction in which it was initially rotated to advance
or pay out the catheter C. Alternatively, the catheter C may be removed from the urethra by
moving the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100 in a distal direction away from
the urethra. If provided, the strap or handle 144 of the collection bag 142 may be used to grip
and move the urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100 after use.
[00118]    The urinary catheter deployment cassette or system 100 may then be placed
adjacent to a toilet or other disposal device. If provided, the engagement feature 146 of the
drainage adaptor 104 may be used to secure the collection bag 142 in place against the toilet,
disposal device, or another suitable surface, as shown in Fig. 50. With the collection bag 142
in place, the pull tab 154 of the drainage adaptor 104 may be manipulated (Fig. 51) to open a
portion of the collection bag 142 or a fluid passage defined in the body 152 of the drainage
adaptor 104 and allow for urine to drain out of the collection bag 142 and into the toilet or
disposal device.
[00119]    Finally, the drainage adaptor 104 may be disposed of (Fig. 52), while the catheter
pack 102 is retained for subsequent use with another drainage adaptor 104 (if the drainage
adaptor 104 is disposable and the catheter pack 102 is reusable, as in a preferred
embodiment). At the same time, the protective tip T may be disposed of (Fig. 53) by
disassociating it from the catheter pack 102, such as by pressing an ejection or release button
162 (Fig. 31) associated with the second opening 132 of the catheter pack 102 or otherwise
disconnecting the protective tip T from the catheter pack 102. The catheter pack 102 and its
catheter C may be washed or otherwise decontaminated and returned to its container 134 prior
to use with another drainage adaptor 104 and protective tip T.
[00120]    Figs. 54-59 illustrate another embodiment of a urinary catheter deployment cassette
or system 200 (Fig. 54) according to an aspect of the present disclosure. Fig. 55 shows the
various components of the system 200, which may include a body or housing 202, an outer

                                                 - 22
drum 204, an inner drum 206 including a catheter 208, and a cover or lid 210. As will be
described in greater detail, the system 200 may include additional or alternative components
without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, a permeable layer
and vapor disk or sachet of the type described above with respect to the embodiment of Figs.
4-26 may be positioned within the housing 202 to hydrate the catheter 208. In another
embodiment, the outer surface of the housing 202 may include an engagement feature (e.g.,
an adhesive material with a removable cover, similar to the engagement feature 146 described
above) to allow the housing 202 to be temporarily secured to a toilet, disposal device, or
another suitable surface (such as a leg of the user) during use.
[00121]    The housing 202 may be formed of a generally rigid material (e.g., a plastic material)
that defines an interior compartment 212 in which the outer and inner drums 204 and 206 are
at least partially received. The outer and inner drums 204 and 206 may be formed of the same
material as each other and as the housing 202 or they may be formed of different material(s).
The housing 202 may be formed of two separate halves or pieces, with Fig. 56 showing one of
the pieces 214 of the housing 202. The other half or piece may be provided as a general
mirror image of the piece 214 of Fig. 56 or may be differently configured. If multiple housing
pieces are provided, they may be joined together by a snap-fit or by a weld or adhesive or
mechanical fasteners or any other suitable joinder means.
[00122]    At least a portion of the interior compartment 212 of the housing 202 is sized and
configured to receive and immobilize the outer drum 204 (Fig. 56). The outer drum 204 may
be immobilized via a friction fit or interference fit or by any other suitable means (e.g., an
adhesive or mechanical fastener). It may be advantageous for the shape of the compartment
212 and housing 202 to match the shape of the outer surface of the outer drum 204
(substantially circular in the illustrated embodiment), which allows the size of the housing 202
to be decreased, making it easier for a user to discretely carry the system 200. In other
embodiments, the outer surface of the outer drum 204 may be differently shaped (i.e., non
circular and non-cylindrical), with the compartment 212 and the housing 202 being adapted to
either match the shape of the outer drum 204 or to be differently shaped. Regardless of the
shape of the outer surface of the outer drum 204, it is preferred for the inner surface of the
outer drum 204 to define a substantially circular cavity for receiving the inner drum 206, as will
be described in greater detail herein.
[00123]    The outer drum 204 defines at least two slots 216 and 218 that receive portions of
the catheter 208 and through which the catheter 208 may pass, as will be described in greater

                                                - 23
detail. The sidewall 220 of the housing 202 (which extends generally perpendicularly between
two opposing faces of the housing 202 in the illustrated embodiment) may define two openings
or apertures 222 and 224 (Fig. 56), with each opening 222, 224 being aligned with a respective
slot 216, 218 of the outer drum 204.
[00124]     The cover or lid 210 is removably secured to the housing 202 to overlay the
openings 222 and 224 of the sidewall 220, thereby isolating the interior compartment 212 from
the outside environment prior to use of the system 200. The cover or lid 210 may be
configured to be permanently removed from the housing 202 immediately prior to use of the
system 200 or to be removed for use and then reattached afterward. If the cover or lid 210 is
intended for permanent removal, it may be preferred for it to be formed of a foil material or the
like that is sealed to the sidewall 220 of the housing 202 to overlay at least the openings 222
and 224. If the cover or lid 210 is intended for removal and then reattachment, it may be
formed of a more durable material, such as plastic or the like, that is snap- or friction-fit onto
the housing 202 or attached by any other suitable means. The cover or lid 210 may include a
formation that simplifies removal of the cover or lid 210, such as the illustrated thumb loop or
tab 226. Additionally, while the illustrated embodiment includes only a single cover or lid 210,
it is within the scope of the present disclosure for the system 200 to include multiple covers of
lids, such as a separate cover or lid associated and overlaying each of the openings 222 and
224 of the sidewall 220.
[00125]     The inner drum 206 and associated catheter 208 are illustrated in greater detail in
Fig. 57. The illustrated inner drum 206 is generally annular or cylindrical, with an outer
diameter that is no greater than the inner diameter of the associated outer drum 204. By such
a configuration, the inner drum 206 may be positioned concentrically within the outer drum 204
(Fig. 58), with the catheter 208 (which extends beyond the outer perimeter of the inner drum
206) positioned within the slots 216 and 218 of the outer drum 206. Preferably, the outer
diameter of the inner drum 206 is substantially the same as the inner diameter of the outer
drum 204, such that the inner drum 206 is positioned inwardly of the outer drum 204 without
allowing translational movement of the inner drum 206 with respect to the outer drum 204.
While it is advantageous to avoid relative translational movement, the inner drum 206 is
configured to rotate with respect to the outer drum 204 and the housing 202, as will be
described in greater detail.
[00126]     The outer surface or perimeter of the inner drum 206 includes one or more grooves
228 (Fig. 55) in which a portion of the catheter 208 between the proximal end 230 and the

                                                  - 24
distal end 232 may be positioned. Preferably, the depth of the groove or grooves 228 is at
least equal to the diameter of the portion of the catheter 208 positioned therein to allow the
catheter 208 to be positioned fully within the groove or grooves 228 without extending beyond
the perimeter of the inner drum 206. The outer drum 204 serves to ensure that the catheter
208 remains within the groove or grooves 228, rather than uncoiling or deforming to be
positioned outside of the groove or grooves 228. In another embodiment, the outer drum 204
may be omitted, with the compartment 212 being shaped and configured to provide the same
function that is provided by the outer drum 204, although the use of an outer drum 204 may be
preferred to simplify manufacturing and assembly of the system 200.
[00127]    The proximal end 230 of the catheter 208 may include a protective tip 234 having a
greater diameter than the groove or grooves 228, such that the protective tip 234 is positioned
outside of the groove or grooves 228 and the inner drum 206, as shown in Figs. 55, 57, and
58. In this case, the housing 202 may be configured to accommodate the protruding protective
tip 234, such as by having an overall non-circular shape (e.g., a teardrop-shape, as in Fig. 54),
although it is also within the scope of the present disclosure for the housing 202 to be
generally circular. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing 202 includes a second chamber
or compartment 236 that is separated from the first compartment 212 by the sidewall 220, with
one of the openings 222 communicating between the compartments 212 and 236. The
catheter 208 passes through the opening 222 (and the associated slot 216 of the outer drum
204), with the protective tip 234 and proximal end 230 of the catheter 208 positioned within the
second compartment 236 and the remainder of the catheter 208 positioned within the first
compartment 212 (along with the outer and inner drums 204 and 206). The protective tip 234
preferably has a diameter greater than the opening 222 to prevent the protective tip 234 from
moving from the second compartment 236 into the first compartment 212 via the opening 222.
[00128]    Similar to the protective tip 234, at least a portion of the connecting member or
funnel 238 of the catheter 208 may be positioned outside of the groove or grooves 228 of the
inner drum 206, as shown in Fig. 55. In the illustrated embodiment, the funnel 238 is
positioned within the same compartment 212 as the outer and inner drums 204 and 206 (unlike
the protective tip 234), but it is also within the scope of the present disclosure for the housing
202 to define an additional compartment (separated from the first compartment 212 by the
sidewall 220, for example) in which the funnel 238 or a portion thereof may be positioned prior
to use. The funnel 238 and/or a portion of the distal end 232 of the catheter 208 extends
through one of the slots 218 in the outer drum 204, which is aligned with one of the openings
224 in the housing sidewall 220, as described above.

                                                 - 25
[00129]    In the illustrated embodiment, a tubular extension or joining tube 240 extends across
the open interior of the inner drum 206, from one location of the inner surface of the inner drum
206 to another location. The joining tube 240 may be formed of a generally flexible material or
a generally rigid material or a material having an intermediate rigidity. The joining tube 240 is
shown as extending through the central axis about which the inner drum 206 is defined (i.e.,
along a diameter), but it is also within the scope of the present disclosure for the joining tube
240 (if provided) to extend between one location of the inner surface of the inner drum 206 to a
second location that is not diametrically spaced from the first location.
[00130]    When a joining tube 240 is provided, the catheter 208 may be provided in two
separate pieces 242 and 244, with a proximal piece 242 that includes the proximal end 230
and a distal piece 244 that includes the distal end 232. The two pieces 242 and 244 of the
catheter 208 are provided in fluid communication with the opposite ends of the joining tube
240, such that the two catheter pieces 242 and 244 are in fluid communication with each other
through the joining tube 240. The inner drum 206 may include an opening or aperture at the
locations where the joining tube 240 meets the inner drum 206, with each catheter piece 242,
244 being associated with one of the openings or apertures by a fluid-tight connection. By
such a configuration, urine flows into the proximal catheter piece 242, through the joining tube
240, and then into the distal catheter piece 244 (Fig. 57), where it may be drained from the
system 200 (as will be described in greater detail herein). While the embodiment of Figs. 54
59 is provided with a joining tube 240 and a two-piece catheter 208, it is within the scope of the
present disclosure for the joining tube 240 to be omitted and for the two-piece catheter 208 to
be replaced by a one-piece catheter that is wound around the inner drum 206.
[00131]    The inner drum 206 is configured to rotate within the cavity defined by the inner
surface of the outer drum 204, with rotation of the inner drum 206 about its central axis in a
particular direction (in a clockwise direction in the orientation of Figs. 57 and 58) causing the
ends 230 and 232 of the catheter 208 to be advanced out of the openings 222 and 224 in the
housing sidewall 220. Similarly, grasping and pulling one of the ends 230, 232 of the catheter
208 out of the housing 202 will cause the inner drum 206 to rotate and the other end 232, 230
of the catheter 208 to be advanced out of the housing 202. For example, according to one
method of using the system 200, a user positions the protective tip 234 within the urethra and
then pulls the funnel 238 distally away from the housing 202, which has the effect of rotating
the inner drum 206 and advancing the proximal end 230 of the catheter 208 through the
urethra until it reaches the bladder. Urine drains from the bladder, through the catheter 208
(including the portion of the catheter 208 positioned within the housing 202), and then out of

                                               - 26
the catheter 208 via the funnel 238, which may direct the urine into a toilet or the like.
Thereafter, the housing 202 may be moved away from the body to retract the proximal end 230
of the catheter 208 from the urethra. With the catheter 208 fully removed from the urethra, it
may be wrapped around the housing 202 (optionally being tied into a simple knot to retain the
system 200 in a compact configuration) for disposal into a waste container (Fig. 59), such as a
garbage can. If the system 200 is made of recyclable materials, then it may be placed into a
recycling bin or container instead of a garbage can.
[00132]    In another embodiment, it is possible to retract the catheter 208 into the housing 202
after use. In such an embodiment, a separate introducer aid of the type described above with
respect to the embodiment of Figs. 4-26 may be employed. In such an embodiment, the
housing 202 may be configured to allow the introducer aid to engage the inner drum 206 or a
portion thereof (e.g., the joining tube 240, especially if it is formed of a generally rigid material).
This may be accomplished by providing a deformable or pierceable housing wall or section, as
in the embodiment of Figs. 4-26, with the introducer aid being pressed against the housing 202
to bring an engagement member of the introducer aid into engagement with the inner drum
206 or a portion thereof. With the introducer aid and housing 202 so connected, a rotatable
element of the introducer aid (such as a disk of the type described above with respect to the
embodiment of Figs. 4-26) may be rotated to rotate the engagement member, which rotates
the inner drum 206 to advance the catheter 208 out of the housing 202. After use, the
rotatable element may be rotated in the opposite direction to retract the catheter 208 into the
housing 202 for disposal or cleaning and reuse. Other means and methods for retracting the
catheter 208 into the housing 202 after use may also be employed without departing from the
scope of the present disclosure.
[00133]    It should be understood that the methods described herein are merely exemplary,
and that the steps described above may be carried out in a different order. Further, other
steps may be included when using the devices described herein. Additionally, one or more of
the steps described herein in connection with the methods may be omitted or modified without
departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Similarly, the systems described herein
are merely exemplary, and they may be differently configured (e.g., by combining one or more
components of one described embodiment with one or more components of another described
embodiment) without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
[00134]   Aspects of the present subject matter described above may be beneficial alone or in
combination with one or more other aspects. Without limiting the foregoing description, in

                                                 - 27

                                                  - 29
[00149]     In accordance with another aspect which may be used or combined with any of the
preceding aspects, the urinary catheter is a hydrophilic urinary catheter. A vapor-donating fluid
is positioned within the interior compartment of the catheter pack and emits a vapor that
contacts at least a portion of the urinary catheter.
[00150]     In accordance with another aspect, there is provided a urinary catheter deployment
system including a housing defining an interior compartment. A rotatable inner drum and a
urinary catheter are at least partially positioned within the interior compartment of the catheter
pack. The urinary catheter is associated with the inner drum such that rotation of the inner
drum deploys the urinary catheter from the housing. The urinary catheter includes separate
first and second pieces that are secured to the inner drum. The inner drum includes a joining
tube in fluid communication with the first and second pieces of the urinary catheter.
[00151]     In accordance with another aspect which may be used or combined with the
preceding aspect, an outer surface of the inner drum includes at least one groove and at least
