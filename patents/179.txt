HIGH-RATE INJECTION SCREEN ASSEMBLY WITH CHECKABLE
PORTS
ABSTRACT
A screen assembly (100) can be used for "gravel pack" or "frac pack" operations and can then
withstand high rate injections. The disclosed screen assembly (100) is able to withstand the flow
of the packing operation by not allowing fluid passage from the annulus to inside the screen
assembly (100). Then, the screen assembly (100) can be opened and facilitate high rate injection
for the life of the well. To achieve this, the disclosed screen assembly (100) does not allow slurry
flow to enter the screen assembly (100) during the packing operation. Then, after the packing is
completed, the screen assembly (100) provides enough open flow area so that a high injection
rate with solid content can be introduced into the annulus without eroding the screen.

              High-Rate Injection Screen Assembly with Checkable Ports
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION:
[0001]    This invention relates generally to a high-rate injection screen assembly with
checkable ports.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0002]    Reservoir completion systems installed in production, injection, and storage
wells often incorporate screens positioned across the reservoir sections to prevent sand
and other solids particles over a certain size from entering the reservoir completion.
Conventional sand screen joints are typically assembled by wrapping a filter media
around a perforated basepipe so fluids entering the sand screen from the wellbore must
first pass through the filter media. Solid particles over a certain size will not pass
through the filter media and will be prevented from entering the reservoir completion.
[0003]    For example, a reservoir completion system 10 in Figure 1 has completion
screen joints 20 deployed on a completion string 14 in a borehole 12. Typically, these
screen joints 20 are used for vertical, horizontal, or deviated boreholes passing in an
unconsolidated formation, and packers 16 or other isolation elements can be used
between the various joints 20 to isolate various zones 30A-30C of the formation.
During production, fluid produced from the borehole 12 directs through the screen joints
20 and up the completion string 14 to the surface rig 18. The screen joints 20 keep out
fines and other particulates in the produced fluid. In this way, the screen joints 20 can
prevent the production of reservoir solids and in turn mitigate erosion damage to both
well and surface components and can prevent other problems associated with fines and
particulate present in the produced fluid.
[0004]    In addition to open hole, the screen joints 20 can also be used in cased holes.
Additionally, the screen joints 20 can be used for gravel pack operations in which gravel
(e.g., sand) is disposed in the annulus of the borehole around the screen joint 20 to
support the unconsolidated formation of the open borehole 12.
                                               1

[0005]    Screen joints having selectable sleeves, inflow control devices, valves, and the
like have been designed in the past. As with other screen joints, these types of screen
joints are used for filtering the flow of production fluid into the screen joints and to
prevent flow of fluid out of the screen joints to the borehole.
[0006]    In contrast to the screen joints of the prior art, there is a need for a screen
assembly that can be used for "frac pack" operations and can then withstand high rate
injections without flowback.
                        SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE
[0007]    A screen assembly disclosed herein can be used for "gravel pack" or "frac
pack" operations and can then withstand high rate injections. The disclosed screen
assembly is able to withstand the flow of the packing operation by not allowing fluid
passage from the annulus to inside the screen assembly. Then, the disclosed screen
assembly can be opened and facilitate high rate injection for the life of the well. To
achieve this, the disclosed screen assembly does not allow slurry flow to enter the
screen assembly during the pack operation. Then, after the pack is completed, the
screen assembly provides enough open flow area so that a high injection rate with solid
content can be introduced into the annulus without eroding the screen.
[0008]    In one embodiment disclosed herein, an apparatus is used for controlling fluid
flow in a borehole. Method are also disclosed herein for controlling the fluid flow in the
borehole. The apparatus includes a basepipe, at least one first outflow valve, and a first
filter. The basepipe has an interior and defines at least one first orifice. The interior
conveying the fluid flow, and the at least one first orifice communicates the interior with
the borehole.
[0009]    The at least one first outflow valve is disposed at the at least one first orifice.
During operations, the at least one first outflow valve permits communication of the fluid
flow in an outflow direction from the interior to the borehole and prevents
communication of the fluid flow in an inflow direction from the borehole into the interior.
For its part, the first filter is disposed on the basepipe adjacent the at least one first
outflow valve. During operations, the first filter filters the fluid flow communicated
between the interior and the borehole.
                                                  2

[0010]     The at least one first outflow valve can include a ball movable between
engaged and disengaged conditions relative to a portion of the at least one first orifice,
which may or may not have an insert affixed therein. The first filter disposed on the
basepipe external to the at least one orifice can then hold the ball adjacent the at least
one first orifice.
[0011]     For instance, the first filter can comprise a plurality of rings stacked adjacent
one another on the exterior of the basepipe. To facilitate assembly, the rings can have
alignment features aligning the adjacent ones of the rings with one another. To hold the
check ball, however, at least some of the rings define a pocket that can capturing the
ball of the at least one first inflow valve.
[0012]     Overall, during gravel pack, frac pack, and production operations, the first filter
filters the fluid flow communicated in the inflow direction from the borehole to the interior
and prevents particulate from passing therethrough. During fluid loss operations,
however, the first filter can bridge off with particulate in the fluid flow of weighted fluid
communicated in the outflow direction from the interior to the borehole. Alternatively, a
second filter can be disposed adjacent the at least one first orifice to bridge off with
particulate in the fluid flow of weighted fluid communicated in the outflow direction from
the interior to the borehole. Moreover, the at least one first outflow valve can bridge off
with particulate in the fluid flow of weighted fluid communicated in the outflow direction
from the interior to the borehole. For example, the particulate can collect around the
ball of the outflow valve captured in the first orifice by the pocket of the first filter.
[0013]     In a further embodiment disclosed herein, the first filter and the basepipe define
a gap therebetween communicating the fluid flow, and a flow device in fluid
communication with the gap communicates the gap with the interior of the basepipe.
The flow device can have a flow restriction restricting the fluid flow from the gap into the
interior of the basepipe. In addition or as an alternative, the flow device can have at
least one inflow valve permitting communication of the fluid flow in the inflow direction
from the gap to the interior and preventing communication of the fluid flow in the outflow
direction from the interior to the gap.
[0014]     As part of the apparatus, a cross-over assembly can be operable in a first
operation communicating the fluid flow to the borehole. This first operation can be a
                                                 3

rack pack or gravel pack operation, for example. In the first operation, the at least one
first outflow valve prevents communication of returns of the fluid flow from the operation
in the inflow direction into the interior, while the flow device permits the returns in the
inflow direction into the interior.
[0015]     The apparatus can have at least one second outflow valve disposed at at least
one second orifice on the basepipe, such as at another isolated zone of the borehole.
The at least one second outflow valve permits communication of the fluid flow in the
outflow direction from the interior to the borehole and prevents communication of the
fluid flow in the inflow direction from the borehole into the interior. In this situation, the
cross-over assembly may prevent the returns in the interior from the flow device from
communicating with the at least one second outflow valve by using a packer, seals, and
the like. Alternatively, a sleeve disposed on the basepipe can be used to selectively
prevent the returns in the interior from the flow device from communicating with the at
least one second outflow valve.
[0016]     As part of the apparatus, an injection assembly can be operable in a second
operation to communicate the fluid flow into the interior of the basepipe. This second
operation can be an injection or treatment operation, for example, typically performed in
a borehole. In this situation, the at least one first outflow valve permits communication
of the fluid flow from the second operation in the outflow direction from the interior to the
borehole to achieve the injection or treatment desired.
[0017]     The foregoing summary is not intended to summarize each potential
embodiment or every aspect of the present disclosure.

                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0030]    As noted previously, there is a need for a screen assembly that can be used for
"frac pack" operations and can then withstand high rate injections. Frac packing is an
operation that combines fracturing a formation and gravel packing the annulus. Such a
screen assembly as disclosed herein is able to withstand the flow of the frac pack
operation by not allowing fluid passage from the annulus to inside the screen assembly.
Then, the disclosed screen assembly can be opened and facilitate high rate injection for
the life of the well. To achieve this, the disclosed screen assembly does not allow slurry
flow to enter the screen assembly during the frac pack operation. Then, after the frac
pack is completed, the screen assembly provides enough open flow area so that a high
injection rate with solid content can be introduced into the annulus without eroding the
screen.
                                                 5

[0031]    Figures 2A-2B illustrate a screen assembly 100 according to the present
disclosure during frac pack and injection operations. The screen assembly 100 includes
a basepipe 110 having a sand control jacket, filter, or screen 120 disposed thereon.
The basepipe 110 defines a through-bore or interior 112 and can have couplings,
threads, or the like at the ends (not shown) for connecting to another assembly or to
tubulars of a production or work string 14. Inside the through-bore 112, the basepipe
110 defines perforations, slots, ports, or orifices 114 where the jacket 120 is disposed.
[0032]    For its part, the sand control jacket 120 disposed around the outside of the
basepipe 110 covers the perforations 114 and defines an annular gap or drainage layer
125 with the exterior of the basepipe 110.       The jacket 120 can use any suitable type of
filter medium, such as a wire-wrapped screen, a sintered metal, a perforated tubular, or
the like that allows fluid to flow therethrough but prevents particulate matter of sufficient
size from flowing therethrough. For example, the jacket 120 can be a wire-wrapped
screen having rods or ribs (not shown) arranged longitudinally along the basepipe 110
with windings of wire (not shown) wrapped thereabout to form various slots for passage
of fluid and prevention of particulate. Alternatively, the jacket 120 can have a plurality of
stacked rings (not shown) with gaps therebetween for passage of fluid and prevention of
particulate. Other types of filter media known in the art can be used so that reference to
"jacket" or "screen" is meant to convey any suitable type of filter media.
[0033]    A plurality of outflow or injection valves 130 communicate between the
basepipe's bore 112 and the jacket's annular gap 125. (In general, the injection valves
130 can be one-way, check, or ball valves. In particular, the valves 130 as discussed
below can use trapped check balls. Although the valves 130 disclosed herein can use
such check balls, other types of check valves, poppet valves, one-way valves, or the
like can be used.) The injection valves 130 allow fluid to flow from the basepipe's bore
112 to the jacket's gap 125 so the flow can pass out through the jacket 120. However,
the valves 130 prevent fluid flow from the gap 125 into the basepipe's bore 112.
[0034]    To begin a frac pack or gravel pack operation, an upper packer 16 and a lower
packer (not shown) may be used to isolate an interval of the borehole 12. Portion of
one isolated zone 30A is shown in Figures 2A-2B. Downhole of the assembly 100, the
                                                 6

tubing string 14 may have any other suitable device (not shown), such as a
conventional gravel pack screen, sliding sleeve, completion component, etc.
[0035]    A cross-over assembly 60 having a washpipe 64 and a cross-over tool 62 can
position adjacent to crossover ports 19, which can be disposed in the screen assembly
100 or elsewhere along the isolated interval. Fluid slurry containing gravel, proppant,
particulate, or other treatment material is pumped downhole in the tubing 14 and into
the isolated borehole annulus via the cross-over tool 62 and the cross-over ports 19.
[0036]    Exiting the cross-over ports 19, the fluid slurry treats the surrounding formation
of the isolated zone 30A. For example, the fluid slurry may be pumped at an elevated,
fracture pressure to create fractures 17 (Fig. 2B) in the surrounding formation.
Proppant in the pumped slurry can then prop those fractures 17 open. The proppant
may also pack inside the borehole annulus surrounding the screen assembly 100.
[0037]    During this process, fluid returns are not allowed to pass through the jacket 120
and the injection valves 130 back into the assembly 100. In this way, the slurry pumped
at the fracture pressure can build up in the annulus and against the surrounding
formation.
[0038]    It may be desirable to eventually allow fluid returns to enter the screen
assembly 100 at some point during the process. Therefore, the screen assembly 100
may have one or more return ports 140 for passage of fluid returns into the basepipe's
bore 112. The return ports 140 may be open ports or may have inflow valves, movable
sleeves, rupture disks, or the like. Once opened or activated, such return ports 140
may allow fluid in the gap 125 between the jacket 120 and the basepipe 110 to enter the
basepipe's bore 112 so it can travel into the washpipe's inlet 65 and up the washpipe 64
to the surface. Opening of the return ports 140 can be selectively operated so that
fracture treatment can first be achieved and then gravel packing with fluid returns can
be initiated once the return ports 140 open. The return ports 140 may even be used for
later production operations once the cross-over assembly 60 is removed so that the
tubing string 14 with the screen assembly 100 can be used as a production screen
during later operations.
[0039]    In some cases, it may be necessary to isolate the flow of fluid returns from the
return ports 140 to the washpipe 64 so that the fluid returns do not open the injection
                                               7

valves 130 on this screen assembly 100 or any other screen assembly (100) along the
tubing string 14. Therefore, flow of the fluid returns may be isolated into the washpipe
64 by isolating the washpipe's inlet 65 from the assembly's injection valves 130 using a
straddle packer (not shown) on the washpipe 64, using a sleeve (not shown) inside the
basepipe 110, using seals and seats (not shown) between the washpipe 64 and the
bore 112 inside the basepipe 110, or using some other form of isolation. Further details
related to isolation for these purposes are discussed below in relation to Figure 2C, for
example.
[0040]    As shown in Figure 2B, once frac-pack operations are completed and fractures
17 are formed, the cross-over assembly 60 may be removed so that injection treatments
can be performed. An injection assembly having a workstring 70 can be disposed in the
screen assembly 100 to inject treatment fluid in the basepipe's bore 112. Alternatively,
instead of using the workstring 70, the injection assembly can have treatment pumped
directly down the bore 112 of the basepipe 110, can have a capillary line run in the
basepipe 110 for injecting the treatment fluid, or can use some other acceptable
procedure and components for injecting the treatment fluid. The treatment can include
any suitable type of treatment to be applied to the borehole, including acid, stimulant,
steam, biocide, chemical, etc.
[0041]    While the treatment is pumped, the injection valves 130 permit the treatment to
pass from the basepipe's bore 112, into the drainage layer 125, out through the jacket
120, and into the borehole 12 to treat the formation. The treatment can pass through
any packed gravel in the annulus and can enter the propped fractures 17 of the
formation. Flow back is typically not permitted during the treatment operation.
Therefore, the return ports 140 (if present) may be closed or sealed, e.g., by using a
straddle packer (not shown) on the worksting 70, using a movable sleeve (not shown)
inside the basepipe 110 at the return ports, using seals and seats (not shown) between
the workstring 70 and the bore 112 inside the basepipe 110, or using some other form
of isolation. Alternatively, the return ports 140 may simply remain open without much
detriment to the treatment operation depending on the type of treatment performed and
other circumstances.
                                               8

[0042]    In some implementations, several screen assemblies 100 may be used along
the tubing string 14 for multiple zones. Fluid communication of fracture pressure during
operations may be able to communicate inside the tubing string 14 between adjacent
assemblies 100, which could cause the injection valves 130 on adjacent assemblies
100 to open and wash out any previous gravel packing. Therefore, in these
implementations, it may be necessary to isolate the injection valves 130 on the screen
assembly 100 of one zone 30A when frac packing another zone 30B.
[0043]    As shown in Figure 2C, a screen assembly 100B of an upper zone 30B is being
frac packed after previous operations have been performed on a lower zone 30A, such
as in Figures 2A-2B. Here in this upper zone 30B, fluid returns are permitted through
one or more return ports 140 on the upper screen assembly 100B. If allowed to
communicate insider the tubing string 14 to the screen assembly 1OA of the lower
zone 30A, the fluid pressure in the tubing string 14 could open the lower assembly's
injection valves 130 and potentially damage any gravel packing in the lower zone 30A.
Therefore, isolation is provided inside the tubing string 14 between the upper and lower
zones 30A-B so that fluid returns in the upper assembly 100B will not reach the injection
valves 130 of the lower assembly 1OA.
[0044]    Various forms of isolation can be used. As shown here, for example, the
washpipe 64 can have an inlet port 65 to receive the fluid returns from the return port
140 or the like of the upper assembly 100B in the upper zone 30B. However, the
washpipe 64 may have a straddle packer, an inflatable packer, or other isolation
element 66 to close off the lower assembly 1OCA in the lower zone 30A. In this way,
fluid returns inside the upper zone's assembly 100B can be prevented from affecting the
lower zone 30A.
[0045]    Rather than using an isolation element 66 on the washpipe 62 as shown in
Figure 2C, other forms of isolation can be used. Internal and external seals and seats
(not shown) can be provided between the washpipe 62 and the inner dimension of the
tubing string 14 or the assembly 100B at the upper zone 30B to prevent fluid returns
from the upper zone's return ports 140 or the like from reaching the lower zone's
assembly 1OCA. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 2D, the lower zone's assembly 1OA
may have a movable sleeve 68 that can be selectively shifted inside the assembly 1OCA
                                              9

to open or close fluid communication through the perforations 114 and injection valves
130. Thus, with the sleeve 68 closed on the lower zone's assembly 1OA as shown in
Figure 2D, any fluid returns from the return ports 140 or the like from the upper
assembly 100B will not be able to act against the injection valves 130 in the lower
assembly 1OA.
[0046]   Having an understanding of the screen assembly 100 and how it is used,
discussion now turns to particular embodiments of the jacket 120 and injection valves
130 of the disclosed screen assembly 100.
[0047]   Figure 3A illustrates a portion of a screen assembly 100 according to one
embodiment in partial cross-section. Figures 3B and 3C shows isolated views of
portions of the assembly 100 in Figure 3A. For the jacket 120, the screen assembly 100
in this embodiment uses a plurality of rings 122 made from (or coated with) an erosion
resistant material. The rings 122 are stacked on the exterior of the basepipe 110 in an
arrangement that maintains spacing or slots (S) between them adequate for sand
control between the rings 122 (i.e., to permit fluid flow but prevent certain particulates
from passing).
[0048]   An end ring or other component can be disposed on the basepipe 110 at one or
both ends of the jacket 120 to secure the rings 122 in place on the basepipe 110. For
example, one such end ring 128 is shown disposed on the basepipe 110 in Figure 3A.
Alternatively, one or more of the rings 122 may be affixed (e.g., welded, brazed, etc.) to
the basepipe 110 to hold the jacket 120 in place. The rings 122 may also define feet or
tabs (not shown) around their inner circumferences to hold the rings 122 at a spaced
distance from the exterior of the basepipe 110 to create an annular gap for the drainage
layer 125.
[0049]   As best shown in the detail of Figure 3B, the rings 122 may have alignment
features 124, such as teeth and detents on the sides of the rings 122. As the jacket 120
is manufactured, the alignment features 124 align and space the rings 122 relative to
one another as they are stacked along the length of the basepipe 110 at a defined
spacing (S).
[0050]   As best shown in Figure 3C, at least some of the rings 122 also have pocket
features 126 defined around their inner circumferences. These pocket features 126
                                              10

align with or position over the pattern of basepipe perforations 114. As the rings 122
are stacked on the basepipe 110 during manufacture, erosion resistant check balls 134
are disposed in widened seats 116 of the perforations 114, and the check balls 134 are
enclosed by the ring's pocket features 126.
[0051]   The captured check balls 134 serve as one-way check valves for the
perforations 114 during frac-pack or flow-back processes, as discussed previously.
Accordingly, flow out of the basepipe 110 is allowed through the perforations 114, past
the check balls 134, and out the screen of stacked rings 122 during injection operations.
However, during frac-pack or flow-back operations, the check balls 134 seat in the
perforations 114 and prevent fluid flowing through the stacked rings 122 and into the
basepipe 110 through the perforations 114.
[0052]   Thus, depending on the direction of flow, the check balls 134 can be moved in
the space defined by the pocket features 126 and the seats 116. The annular gap of
the drainage layer 125 around the inside circumference of the jacket 120 allows fluid to
flow along the outside of the basepipe 110. When the check ball 134 is unseated and
moved against the pocket features 126 of the adjacent rings 122 during injection, fluid
can flow along the layer 125 and also through the slots (S) between the rings 122.
[0053]    By contrast, when the check ball 134 is seated and moved against the seat 116
of the adjacent perforation 114 during frac-pack or flow back, at least most of the fluid
cannot pass into the basepipe 110. Flow may be allowed to pass through the slots (S)
between the rings 122, and the screened fluid can then flow along the annular gap of
the drainage layer 125. As noted above, the flow of screened fluid along the annular
layer 125 may eventually be allowed to enter the basepipe 110 through a return port, a
valve, sleeve, rupture disk, or other feature (140: Figs. 2A-2B). Further details of some
arrangements for this flow return are disclosed below with reference to Figures 5A-5B.
[0054]   Another embodiment of a screen assembly 100 is illustrated in Figure 4A,
which shows a portion of the screen assembly 100 in partial cross-section. Again, the
assembly's jacket 120 in this embodiment uses a plurality of rings 122 made from (or
coated with) an erosion resistant material. The rings 122 are stacked on the exterior of
the basepipe 110 in an arrangement that maintains spacing or slots (S) adequate for
sand control between the rings 122. As best shown in the detail of Figure 4B, the rings
                                             11

122 may have alignment features 124, such as teeth and detents on the sides, which
align and space the rings 122 relative to one another as they are stacked along the
length of the basepipe 122.
[0055]   As best shown in Figure 4C, the rings 122 also have pocket features 126
defined around their inner circumferences, which align with the pattern of basepipe
perforations 114. As the rings 122 are stacked on the basepipe 110 during
manufacture, erosion resistant check balls 134 are disposed in the perforations 114 to
be enclosed by the ring's pocket features 126.
[0056]    Rather than engaging against a seat formed in the perforations 114 as in the
previous arrangement, the check balls 134 engage against inserts 118 affixed inside the
perforations 114. For example, the inserts 118 can be composed of an erosion
resistant material and can thread, tack weld, or otherwise affix in the perforations 114 of
the basepipe 110. The captured balls 134 can move open or closed relative to the
inserts 118 to serve as check valves during frac-pack or flow-back operations.
Accordingly, flow out of the basepipe 110 is allowed through the perforations 112 and
the inserts 118, past the check balls 134, and out the screen of stacked rings 122 during
injection operations. However, during frac-pack or flow-back operations, the check balls
134 prevent fluid flowing into the basepipe 110 through the perforations 114 and the
inserts 118.
[0057]    Using the inserts 118 can have a number of advantages. For instance, the
order of manufacture can be altered. In this case, instead of installing the check balls
134 in the perforations 114 as the jacket 120 is formed, the check balls 134 can be
inserted from inside the basepipe's bore 112 after the jacket 120 is positioned outside
the basepipe 110. Then, the inserts 118 can be installed to capture the check balls 118.
[0058]    In another advantage, the inserts 118 can be configured with a particular orifice
size-as can the balls 134-so that a standard basepipe 110 with uniform sizes of
perforations 114 can be selectively configured with inserts 118 and check balls 134 of
one or more sizes. Additionally, the inserts 118 can prevent or reduce the erosion that
may occur during injection so that the check balls 134 are less likely to escape their
entrapment if the perforations 114 were subject to erosion.
                                            12

[0059]    As disclosed herein, the screen assembly 100 can be used on its own as an
injection screen. In other arrangements, the assembly 100 can be used with a return
port, a valve, a sleeve, a rupture disk, or other such feature (140: Figs. 2A-2B) that
allows flow back of screened fluid into the assembly 100. In a similar fashion, a screen
assembly 100 illustrated in partial cross-section in Figure 5A is a combination of
injection and production assembly. The screen assembly 100 shown in Figure 5A uses
the previously described features of a screen jacket 120 and injection valves 130 in
combination with an inflow control device 150, which can allow flow back of screened
fluid in a similar fashion as the return ports (140) discussed previously.
[0060]    Again as shown in Figure 5A, the assembly 100 includes a basepipe 110
surrounded by the screen jacket 120, which can be composed of a filter media, wire
wrapped screen, stacked rings, etc. Additionally, the basepipe 110 has perforations
114 with the injection valves 130. An end ring 121 can be disposed at one end of the
jacket 120 to close off fluid flow along the annular drainage layer 125 between the
jacket 120 and the basepipe 110. The other end of the jacket 120 connects with the
inflow control device 150 so that screened fluid flow passing along the drainage layer
125 can pass into the inflow control device 150.
[0061]    The inflow control device 150 includes an outer housing or sleeve 152 and has
one or more nozzles or flow restrictions 154 inside that create a pressure drop in the
flow of fluid from the annular gap 125 to additional ports or perforations 115 in the
basepipe 110. The purpose of the inflow control device 150 is to control flow of fluid
into the screen assembly 100-particularly to control the flow of production fluid during
production operations.
[0062]     During production, for example, reservoir fluids travel through the jacket 120
and into the drainage layer 125 between the jacket 120 and the basepipe 110. The
injection valves 130 prevent the flow from entering directly into the basepipe 110
through the perforations 114. Instead, the produced fluid passes along the drainage
layer 125 to the inflow control device 150. Entering the housing 152, the flow passes
through the flow restrictions 154 (e.g., tungsten carbide nozzles) before passing through
the ports 115 in the basepipe 110. The flow restrictions 154 produce a pressure drop in
                                               13

the fluid, and the size and/or number of the restrictions 154 can be configured for a
given implementation.
[0063]    At times before or during production, treatment operations may be performed to
treat the formation surrounding the assembly 100. For example, the screen assembly
100 of Figure 5A can be used for frac pack operations similar to those described above.
In this case, fracture treatment can be introduced into the annulus around the screen
assembly 100 from a cross-over or the like. The injection valves 130 prevent the flow of
returns, production fluid, or the like from passing from the screen jacket 125 to the
basepipe 110 without passing through the inflow control device 150. Fluid returns
through the inflow control device 150 can be prevented by isolating or covering the inner
ports 115 of the basepipe 110 in a manner discussed previously. Alternatively, fluid
returns through the inflow control device 150 may be permitted and may not adversely
affect the treatment.
[0064]    As before, the screen assembly 100 of Figure 5A can also be used for injection
operations. In this case, injection fluid pumped or introduced in the basepipe 110 may
be allowed to pass through the perforations 114 and injection valves 130. Yet, the
injection fluid may also be allowed to pass through the ports 115 and the inflow control
device 150 to the screen jacket 120. Although this may be effective for some injection
operations, the arrangement of the ports 115, the flow restrictions 154, and the like can
limit the injection rates that can be achieved. In any event, the injection valves 130
under the screen jacket 120 allow for increased injection rates to be achieved with the
disclosed assembly 100.
[0065]    Figure 5B illustrates an end of the disclosed screen assembly 100 having
another type of inflow control device 160 that may be used in a similar fashion as the
return ports (140) discussed previously. This device 160 includes a housing or sleeve
162 disposed on the basepipe 110. A restriction, nozzle, or seat 164 is disposed in the
housing 162, and an inflow valve in the form of a check ball 166 can allow flow from the
screen jacket 120, through the device 160, and into the basepipe's ports 115. However,
the check ball 166 prevents reverse flow from the basepipe 110 through the device 160.
This type of inflow control device 160 used with the disclosed screen jacket 120 and
                                              14

injection valves (130) of the screen assembly 100 can have a number of similar
advantages and uses.
[0066]    During production, for example, reservoir fluids travel through the screen jacket
120 and into the drainage layer 125 between the jacket 120 and the basepipe 110. The
injection valves (130) prevent the flow from entering directly into the basepipe 110
through the perforations (114). Instead, the produced fluid passes along the drainage
layer 125 to the inflow control device 160. Entering the device's housing 162, the flow
passes through the flow restrictions or seats 164 and passes the check balls 166 before
passing through the ports 115 in the basepipe 110. (Although the valve disclosed
herein uses check balls 166 and seats 164, other types of check valves, poppet valve,
one-way valves, or the like can be used.) The flow restrictions 154 produce a pressure
drop in the fluid, and the size and/or number of the restrictions 154 can be configured
for a given implementation.
[0067]    At times before or during production, treatment operations may be performed to
treat the formation surrounding the assembly 100. For example, the screen assembly
100 of Figure 5B can be used for frac pack operations similar to those described above.
In this case, fracture treatment can be introduced into the annulus around the screen
assembly 100 from a cross-over or the like. The injection valves (130) prevent the flow
of returns, production fluid, or the like from passing from the screen jacket 120 to the
basepipe 110 without passing through the inflow control device 160. Fluid returns
through the inflow control device 160 can be prevented by isolating or covering the inner
ports 115 of the basepipe 110 with a plug or tool disposed inside the bore 112.
Alternatively, fluid returns through the inflow control device 160 may be permitted and
may not adversely affect the treatment.
[0068]    As before, the screen assembly 100 of Figure 5B can also be used for injection
operations. In this case, injection fluid pumped or introduced in the basepipe 110 may
be allowed to pass through the perforations (114) and injection valves (130). Yet, the
injection fluid is not allowed to pass through the ports 115 and the inflow control device
160 to the screen jacket 120 due to the internal injection valves formed by the check
balls 166 and flow restriction 164.
                                               15

[0069]    As noted above, the assemblies 100 disclosed herein can be used for injection
operations alone or used for injection and production operations. In addition, the
disclosed assemblies 100 can be used for pressure control and well kill operations. For
example, a reservoir section of a well is typically kept under positive pressure that acts
to force reservoir fluids into the reservoir completion. During completion, work over,
intervention, and other operational periods when the well is not being produced, the
reservoir pressure must be controlled to prevent reservoir fluids from migrating into the
reservoir completion and to surface. This is typically achieved by filling the well with a
weighted fluid that will counteract the reservoir pressure. The disclosed assemblies 100
having the injection valve 130 will readily allow such weighted fluid to flow into the
annulus and counteract the reservoir pressure.
[0070]    At times, well kill operations may need to be performed in a reservoir
completion because fluid is being lost to the formation. In the well kill operation, a loss
prevention fluid is used to prevent the loss of fluid flow to the surrounding formation.
For example, a situation can arise where the balance between the fluid weight and the
reservoir pressure is lost, and fluid either begins to flow into or out of the reservoir in an
uncontrolled manner. In these situations, it is necessary to re-gain control of the fluid
balance through a process called "killing the well."
[0071]    Killing the well is typically achieved by circulating a weighted fluid into the well
that places a significantly high enough pressure against the wellbore to overcome the
reservoir pressure. It may also be necessary to prevent this weighted fluid from
continuing to leak into the reservoir section. This is achieved by mixing a Loss Control
Material (LCM) in with the weighted fluid. The material can be made up of solid
particles of a specific size that are designed to rest against the area where the fluid is
leaking into the reservoir section. As fluid leaks past the area, the solid particles bridge
off at the area and plug off the leak temporarily.
[0072]    The assemblies 100 disclosed can be used for these situations. In particular,
particulate material in weighted fluid can be communicated downhole in a well kill
operation. If fluid is leaking into the reservoir section adjacent the assembly 100, the
particulate material in the weighted fluid can pass to the basepipe's perforations 114. If
the assembly 100 is used exclusively for injection as with the assemblies 100 of Figures
                                                16

3A or 4A, then the basepipe's perforations 114 or the inserts 118 can have filter media
disposed at the openings facing the bore 112 against which the particulate material can
bridge. (For example, Figure 6A shows an insert 118 having a filter 119 against which
particulate material in weighted fluid can bridge off to prevent fluid loss during
operations.) Once the balance between the fluid in the wellbore and the reservoir
pressure has been re-established, the fluid from the well can be produced to the surface
in a controlled manner that will lift the particulate material away from any filter media
(e.g., filter 119) at perforations 114 or inserts 118 and re-establish the flow path.
[0073]     If the assembly 100 is used for injection and production as with the assemblies
100 of Figures 5A or 5B, then the particulate material in weighted fluid can then bridge
off against the inside diameter of the screen jacket 120. In addition (or as an
alternative), the particulate material can collect at the check ball 134. (For example,
Figures 6B-6C show particulate material in weighted fluid bridging off against the screen
jacket 120 and the injection valve 130 to prevent fluid loss during operations. For the
arrangement in Figure 6B, flow back of the particulate material bridging off against the
screen jacket 120 would need to be through a return port, an ICD, or the like (not
shown) on the assembly 100 because the valves 130 would close off fluid flow back
through the perforations 114.)
[0074]     Once the balance between the fluid in the wellbore and the reservoir pressure
has been re-established, the fluid from the well can be produced to the surface in a
controlled manner that will lift the particulate material away from the inside of the screen
joint 120 and out the inflow control device 150/160 to re-establish the flow path. In any
event, the basepipe's perforations 114 or the inserts 118 for these dual-purpose
assemblies 100 can have filter media disposed at the openings facing the bore 112
against which the particulate material in weighted fluid can bridge.
[0075]     In some embodiments, the check balls 134 can be composed of erosion
resistant material, such as an erosion resistant metal. In such circumstances, the check
balls 134 may be expected to remain permanently during use to block flow back.
Should one of the balls 134 fail, erode, or the like, then return fluid flow back through the
now open perforation 114 would at least be screened of particulate by the screen jacket
120.
                                                17

[0076]    As an alternative to permanent check balls 134, the balls 134 may be
removable (e.g., composed of a material to eventually dissolve, erode, or break apart)
from the perforations 114 so that the injection assembly 100 becomes a type of
production screen after a period of time. With the check balls 134 gone, the assembly
100 would allow fluid flow into the basepipe 110 through the jacket 120 and perforations
114. In yet another alternative, the balls 134 may or may not be of a permanent type of
material, but the inserts 118 as used in Figures 4A and 4C may be removable (i.e.,
composed of a material to eventually dissolve, erode, or otherwise be removed from the
perforations 114), allowing the balls 134 to escape and remove from the perforations
114.
