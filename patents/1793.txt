                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]         The present invention, in general, relates to compositions and methods for a)
regenerating pancreatic cells, 2) treating Type I diabetes, 3) treating Type II diabetes, 4) treating
the metabolic syndrome, 5) preventing Type II diabetes and other diseases associated with
metabolic syndrome. In particular, the present invention promotes pancreatic regeneration and
alleviates multiple common signs, symptoms and risk factors of both diabetes types. In addition
to promoting residential pancreatic regeneration, it can also be used to enhance and improve the
regenerative functions of transplanted stem cells when it is incorporated with the conventional
stem cell therapy.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0004]         Human metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus Type I, diabetes mellitus
Type II, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance are serious health conditions affecting over
a third of the adult population in the United States. Although effective in delaying morbidity,
standard treatments have not generally been able to reverse the associated damage of these
disorders.
                                                   1

[00051           Chemicals, cytokines/hormones and stem cell or islet transplantation that boost or
assist pancreatic regeneration have been used as diabetes therapy in order to augment or replace
insulin injections by increasing the number of, or enhancing the function of, endogenous insulin
producing     -cells.
[0006]           Diabetes mellitus Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are characterized by progressive beta
cell failure. By far, stem/progenitor cell transplantation is the only therapy available for advanced
stages of diabetes in an attempt to restore insulin production and replace insulin injection. However,
besides ethical issues, technical and safety challenges in stem cell isolation, maintenance, expansion,
donor-recipient matching and transplantation limit the efficacy of these strategies.
[00071           Accordingly, there is a need for safe, effective treatment protocols for metabolic
disorders such as diabetes that may reverse pancreatic damage and inhibit development of these
disorders.
                                              SUMMARY
[0008]           In at least one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of alleviating
symptoms of or treating pancreatic beta-cell damage in a subject. The method includes a step of
identifying a subject having pancreatic beta-cell damage.       Multiple cycles of a diet protocol are
administered to the subject. The diet protocol includes administering of a fasting mimicking diet and
a re-feeding diet where the fasting mimicking diet is provided for a first time period and the re
feeding diet is provided for a second time period.
[0009]           In another embodiment, a method of alleviating symptoms of or treating pancreatic
beta-cell damage in a subject is provided. The method includes a step of identifying a subject having
pancreatic beta-cell damage and insulin defeciency.           The subject's normal caloric intake is
determined. Multiple cycles of a diet protocol are administered to the subject. The diet protocol
includes administering of a fasting mimicking diet and a re-feeding diet where the fasting mimicking
diet is provided for a first time period (e.g., 2 to 6 days) and the re-feeding diet is provided for a
second time period (e.g., 7 to 85 days). The fasting mimicking diet provides less than about 50 % of
the normal caloric intake of the subject with both protein restriction and sugar restriction and the re
                                                            2

feeding provides 60-100 percent of the normal caloric intake of the subject, depending on the need to
lose additional weight.
[0010]          In another embodiment, a method of alleviating a symptom of diabetes is provided.
The method includes a step of identifying a subject having diabetes (Type I or II). The subject is
provided with multiple cycles of a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) (4-5 days every, 1-12 weeks) to
promote a reduction and reversal in symptoms.
[0011]          In another embodiment, a method of alleviating insulin resistance, insulin defeciency
and/or hyperglygemia is provided.       The method includes a step of identifying a subject having
insulin resistance, insulin defeceincy and/or fasting hyperglycemia diabetes. The subject is provided
with multiple cycles of a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) (e.g., 4-5 days every 4-12 weeks) to
promote a reduction in symptoms.
[0012]          In another embodiment, a method of alleviating a symptom of metabolic syndrome is
provided.    The method includes a step of identifying a subject having one or more metabolic
syndrome symptoms/risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, excess body fat around
the waist, high cholesterol). The subject is provided with multiple cycles of a Fasting Mimicking
Diet (FMD) (4-5 days every, 1-12 weeks) to promote a reduction in symptoms.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0023]          As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein;
however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the
invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to
scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components.
Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as
limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ
the present invention.
[0024]          The terms "kilocalorie" (kcal) and "Calorie" refer to the food calorie.        The term
"calorie" refers to the so-called small calorie.
[0025]          The term "subject" refers to a human or animal, including all mammals such as
primates (particularly higher primates), sheep, dog, rodents (e.g., mouse or rat), guinea pig, goat, pig,
cat, rabbit, and cow.
[0026]          The term "metabolic syndrome" as used herein means a disorder that increases a
subject's risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and Type II diabetes. The syndrome includes the
following metabolic risks factors: a large waistline, high blood pressure, low high density lipoprotein
(HDL) levels (< 40 mg/dL), and high fasting glucose levels (or a subject on medication to treat high
glucose levels). Typically, a subject having three or more of these risk factors is classified as having
metabolic syndrome.
[00271          The term "fasting glucose level" means the glucose level in the blood of a subject
after 8 hours of fasting. In human subjects, the normal fasting glucose blood level is less than 100
mg/dL (e.g. 70 to 99 mg/dL).
                                                            5

[00281          Abbreviations:
[0029]           "STZ" is Streptozotocin.
[0030]           "FMD" is fasting mimicking diet.
[0031]           "AL" is ad libitum.
[0032]           In an embodiment, a method of alleviating symptoms of or treating pancreatic beta
cell damage in a subject is provided. In this context, pancreatic beta-cell damage includes beta cell
loss , beta cell dysfunction, or combinations thereof. In variations of the present embodiment, the
method is used to treat or alleviate one or more symptoms of diabetes mellitus Type I, diabetes
mellitus Type II, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance.         The method includes a step of
identifying a subject having pancreatic beta-cell damage. The subject's normal caloric intake is
typically determined by interrogation or from the subject's weight. Multiple cycles of a diet protocol
are administered to the subject. The diet protocol includes administering of a fasting mimicking diet
and a re-feeding diet where the fasting mimicking diet is provided for a first time period and the re
feeding diet is provided for a second time period.
[0033]           The fasting mimicking diet provides the subject with less than about 50% of the
normal caloric intake of the subject. In a variation the fasting mimicking diet is provided with
protein restriction and/or carbohydrate restriction and/or sugar restriction. In one useful refinement,
the re-feeding provides 60-100 percent of the normal caloric intake of the subject. In a refinement,
the fasting mimicking diet provides the subject with at most, in increasing order of preference, 60%,
50%, 45%, 40%, or 35% of the normal caloric intake of the subject with both protein restriction and
carbohydrate/sugar restriction and at least, in increasing order of preference, 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15%
of the normal caloric intake of the subject with both protein restriction and sugar restriction. The re
feeding provides the subject with at least 60 percent of the normal caloric intake of the subject. In a
refinement, the re-feeding diet provides the subject with at least, in order of preference, 60%, 70%,
80%, 90%, or 100% of the normal caloric intake of the subject and at most, in order of preference,
 130%, 120%, 110%, or 105% of the normal caloric intake of the subject. In a variation, the re
feeding diet provides an amount of calories that depends on the need of the subject to lose weight.
For example, a subject needing weight reduction can be provided a re-feeding diet that provides
from 60 to 90 percent of their normal caloric intake. In a refinement, a subject needing weight
                                                           6

reduction can be provided a re-feeding diet that provides from 60 to 80 percent of their normal
caloric intake.   In another refinement, a subject needing weight reduction can be provided a re
feeding diet that provides from 60 to 70 percent of their normal caloric intake. Subject not requiring
weight loss can be provided with from 90 to 130 percent of their normal caloric intake during the re
feeding diet phase.
[0034]          In a variation, the fasting mimicking diet provides the subject with 4.5 to 7
kcal/pound of body weight/day on day 1 followed by 3 to 5 kcal kcal/pound of body weight/day for
days 2 to 5. In a refinement, the fasting mimicking diet provides the subject with 7 kcal/pound of
body weight/day on day 1 followed by 4 kcal kcal/pound of body weight/day for days 2-5.               In
another variation, the fasting mimicking diet provides the subject with       3-6 kcal/pound of body
weight/day on day 1 followed by 2-4 kcal kcal/pound of body weight/day for days 2-4.            In some
variations, the fasting mimicking diet includes 2 to 5% calories from glycerol. For example, the
fasting mimicking diet can include at least 60% calories from fatty acids,        2 -5%  calories from
glycerol and up to 5% of calories from plant-based proteins, and a maximum of 35% of calories
from carbohydrates.     Advantageously, the carbohydrates are complex carbohydrate from plant
sources such as soy, rice, or other grains and at least 50% of the calories from fatty acids are from
coconut oil and tree nuts (e.g., macadamia nuts, walnuts, or almonds).
[00351          Typical fat sources include vegetable oil such as soybean oil. In a further refinement,
the low protein diet incudes fat sources such that at least 25 percent of calories from fat are short
chain fatty acids having from 2 to 7 carbon atoms and/or from medium-chain saturated fatty acids
having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms. Specific examples of fatty acids include lauric and/or myristic
acid and fat sources include olive oil, kernel oil and/or coconut oil. In another refinement, the
fasting mimicking diet includes calories from fat in an amount from about 0 to 22 percent of total
calories contained in the diet.
[0036]          U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 14/178953 filed on February 12, 2014 provides examples of
fasting mimicking diets that are useful in the methods of the present invention. In this regard,
Figures 1-3 provide listings of the nutrients for day one through day five.         In addition to the
macronutrients, the diet should contain less than 30 g of sugar on day 1 and less than 20 g of sugar
on days 2-5.    The diet should contain less than 28 g of proteins on day 1 and less than 18 g of
                                                           7

proteins on days 2-5, mostly or completely from plant based sources.         The diet should contain
between 20 and 30 grams of monounsaturated fats on day 1 and 10-15 grams of monounsaturated
fats on days 2-5. The diet should contain between 6 and 10 grams of polyunsaturated fats on day 1
and 3-5 grams of polyunsaturated fats on days 2-5.        The diet should contain less than 12 g of
saturated fats on day 1 and less than 6 grams of saturated fats on days 2-5. Typically, the fats on all
days are derived from a combination of the following: Almonds, Macadamia Nuts, Pecans, Coconut,
Coconut oil, Olive Oil and Flaxseed.      In a refinement, the FMD diet includes over 50% of the
recommended daily value of dietary fiber on all days. In the further refinement, the amount of
dietary fiber is greater than 15 grams per day on all five days. The diet should contain 12-25 grams
of glycerol per day on days 2-5. In a refinement, glycerol is provided at 0.1 grams per pound body
weight/day. In a variation, the FMD includes the following micronutrients (at least 95% non-animal
based): over 5,000 IU of vitamin A per day (days 1-5); 60-240 mg of vitamin C per day (days 1-5);
400-800 mg of Calcium per day (days 1-5); 7.2-14.4 mg of Iron per day (days 1-5); 200-400 mg of
Magnesium per day (days 1-5); 1-2 mg of copper per day (days 1-5); 1-2 mg of Manganese per day
(days 1-5); 3.5-7 mcg of Selenium per day (days 1-5); 2-4 mg of Vitamin BI per day (days 1-5); 2-4
mg of Vitamin B2 per day (days 1-5); 20-30 mg of Vitamin B3 per day (days 1-5); 1-1.5 mg of
Vitamin B5 per day (days 1-5); 2-4 mg of Vitamin B6 per day (days 1-5); 240-480 mcg of Vitamin
B9 per day (days 1-5); 600-1000 IU of Vitamin D per day (days 1-5); 14-30 mg of Vitamin E per
day (days 1-5); over 80 mcg of Vitamin K per day (days 1-5); 16-25 mcg Vitamin B12 are provided
during the entire 5-day period; 600 mg of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, algae-derived) are provided
during the entire 5-day period. The FMD diet provides high micronutrient content mostly (i.e.,
greater than 50 percent by weight) from natural sources including: Kale, Cashews, Yellow Bell
Pepper, Onion, Lemon Juice, Yeast, Turmeric. Mushroom, Carrot, Olive Oil, Beet Juice, Spinach,
Tomato, Collard, Nettle, Thyme, Salt, Pepper, Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin), Beets, Butternut
Squash, , Oregano, Tomato Juice, Orange Juice, Celery, Romaine Lettuce, Cumin, Orange Rind,

[00371          In a variation as set forth above, the fasting mimicking diet also includes caloric
restriction with respect to proteins and sugars (e.g., glucose).        In one refinement, the fasting
mimicking diet includes protein in an amount that is less than 15 percent of total calories provided
by the fasting mimicking diet. In a further refinement, the fasting mimicking diet includes protein in
an amount that is at most, in increasing order of preference, 15%, 12%, 10%, 8%, or 5% of total
                                                               9

calories provided by the fasting mimicking diet and in an amount that is at least 0%, 2%, 3%, 5%, or
6% of total calories provided by the fasting mimicking diet. In another refinement, the fasting
mimicking diet includes sugars in an amount that is less than 15 percent of total calories provided by
the fasting mimicking diet. In a further refinement, the fasting mimicking diet includes sugars (e.g.,
glucose) in an amount that is at most, in increasing order of preference, 15%, 12%, 10%, 8%, or 5%
of total calories provided by the fasting mimicking diet and in an amount that is at least, in order of
preference, 0%, 2%, 3%, 5%, or 6% of total calories provided by the fasting mimicking diet.
[0038]           The first time period during which the fasting mimicking diet is provided is typically
from 2 to 6 days and the second time period during which the re-feeding diet is provide is typically 7
to 85 days. In a variation, the multiple cycles are administered once a month for at least 3 months.
In a refinement, the first time period during which the fasting mimicking diet is provided for is, in
increasing order of preference, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4, or 5 days. In another refinement, the second time period
during which the re-feeding diet is provided is from, in increasing order of preference, 1 to 6 weeks,
 1 to 5 weeks, 1 to 4 weeks, 1 to 3 weeks, or 1 to 2 weeks. The multiple cycles of the diet protocol
may continue indefinitely. Advantageously, the multiple cycles of the diet protocol lasts for at least
60 days.    In a refinement, the multiple cycles of the diet protocol lasts for at least, in order of
preference, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 180 days, 270 days, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, or for
the lifetime of the subject.
[0039]           Surprisingly, the method and FMD of the present embodiment is found to induce
pancreas and beta cell regeneration. This aspect of the invention is useful in treating subjects
exhibiting both insulin resistance and the need for new beta cells (e.g., late stage type 2 diabetes) and
subjects needing beta cell regeneration but do not have insulin resistance (e.g., type 1 diabetics). In
another aspect, the method and FMD is found to increase the insulin sensitizer adiponectin, promote
the loss of abdominal fat and cause insulin sensitization and a decrease in fasting glucose levels.
Advantageously, the ability of the diet to reverse insulin resistance is useful in preventing the
development     of diabetes     Type II in subjects exhibiting insulin resistance and/or fasting
hyperglycemia but not having a diagnosis of diabetes. However, the diet is also useful for a normal
subject who may be at risk of developing insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome or diabetes for any
reason including excess adiposity, poor diet, genetic risk factors for diabetes etc.

[00401           Cycles of the fasting FMD a) promote insulin producing P-cells regeneration, b)
prevents and reverses severe hyperglycemia (>300mg/dl) in both Type I and Type II diabetes in
mammals (mice) and c) alleviates other complications of diabetes including insulin secretion
deficiency, glucose tolerance impairment and insulin insensitivity. It also decreases fasting blood
glucose levels in a pre-diabetic human subject, and it increases the insulin sensitizer adiponectin and
the pancreatic regeneration factor betatrophin in humans confirming that this efficacy is conserved in
mice and humans. This high efficiency diet protocol has broad effects on multiple complications of
diabetes, low initial requirements and long-term safety/benefits allowing this invention to be
practically incorporated with various types of therapy, including other conventional regenerative
approaches as well as standard treatments of diabetes (under physician supervision) in a way that
directly stimulates the resident stem cells and/or may indirectly change the microenvironments for
promoting the regeneration of the transplanted stem cells in the recipients. The pancreatic
regeneration caused by the FMD is only part of its effects on Types 1 and 2 diabetes. In fact, the
FMD causes a reduction in glucose, reduction in IGF-I, decrease in insulin and an increase in insulin
sensitivity, all of which are independent or partly independent of regeneration and contribute to the
anti-diabetes effects.   In a refinement, the subject's levels of glucose, IGF-I, insulin and insulin
sensitivity are measured to verify the correct changes.
[0041]           In another embodiment, a method of alleviating a symptom of diabetes is provided.
The method includes a step of identifying a subject suffering from diabetes (Types I or II). The
subject is provided with multiple cycles of a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) (4-5 days every, 1-12
weeks depending on severity of symptoms and levels of risk factors) to promote a reduction in
symptoms. Cycles of the fasting FMD a) promote insulin producing P-cells regeneration, b) prevents
and reverses severe hyperglycemia (>300mg/dl) in both Type I and Type II diabetes in mammals
(mice) and c) alleviates other complications of diabetes including insulin secretion deficiency,
glucose tolerance impairment and insulin insensitivity. It also decreases fasting blood glucose levels
in a pre-diabetic human subject, confirming that this efficacy is conserved in mice and humans. It
also decreases abdominal fat and increases the levels of the insulin sensitizer adiponectin. This high
efficiency diet protocol has broad effects on multiple complications of diabetes, low initial
requirements and long-term safety/benefits allowing this invention to be practically incorporated

Treatment and prevention of Type 1 diabetes.
[0042]          Subjects with pancreatic beta-cell damage leading to partial or full Type I diabetes
undergo multiple cycles of the FMD 1 or 2 diets as described herein. The number of cycles will
depend on the severity of the disease and on the effect of each cycle of the FMD on beta cell
regeneration and insulin production. The FMD will substitute a subject's normal diet for a period of
4-5 days every 1-4 weeks depending on the type and severity of the diabetes and insulin resistance,
with the more frequent FMD prescribed to subjects with a more severe form of Type 1 diabetes. The
frequency of the diet will also depend on the ability of subjects to return to within 5% of the normal
weight before starting the next cycle of the diet and on the amelioration of the diabetes symptoms,
with discontinuation or major reduction of the cycles once the values of insulin and glucose return to
the normal range. For morbidly obese subjects, the FMD could be applied every 2 weeks for 5 days.
The diet consists of ingredients which are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) (see below).
Because of the combination of potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, the FMD
regimen described above can also be used to prevent the progression of Type 1 diabetes.
Treatment of Type 2 diabetes.
[0043]          Subjects with insulin resistance and/or pancreatic beta-cell damage leading to partial
of full Type II diabetes will be asked to undergo multiple cycles of the FMD diet as described
herein. The number and frequency of cycles can be determined by the physician depending on the
severity of the disease and on the effect of each cycle of the FMD on insulin resistance, glucose
tolerance, beta cell regeneration and insulin production and on the ability of the subject to maintain
                                                          12

these improvements. Depending on the stage of the diabetes, insulin production may not be affected.
The FMD will substitute a subject's normal diet for a period of 4-5 days every 1-12 weeks
depending on the type and severity of the diabetes and insulin resistance, with the more frequent
FMD prescribed to subjects with a more severe form of Type 2 diabetes, higher insulin resistance
and body mass index. For subject within a normal BMI (<25), the frequency of the diet will also
depend on the ability of subjects to return to within 5% of the normal weight before starting the next
cycle of the diet. For overweight and obese subjects, the FMD could be applied as frequently as
every week, based on the assessment of the physician. The diet consists of ingredients, which are
Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) (see below).
[0044]          FMD 1 (5 days): a low protein and low carbohydrate diet containing no or minimal
animal derived components. The diet provides 7 kcal/pound of body weight for day 1 followed by 4
kcal/pound of body weight/day for days 2-5. At least 60% of calories are from a composition of fatty
acids, preferably 100% from plant sources (with 50% or more coming from coconut oil and nuts
including macadamia, walnuts, almonds), glycerol (2-5% of kcal) and 5% of calories from plant
based proteins (soy, rice, other grains) + a maximum of 35% of calories from carbohydrates mostly
complex from plant sources. The diet is also high nourishment and provides, on each day, 30-50% of
the daily recommended intake for all vitamins and minerals + essential fatty acids, with at least 50%
of them coming from natural sources.
[00451          FMD 2 (4 days): a low protein and low carbohydrate diet containing no or minimal
animal derived components. The diet provides 3-5 kcal/pound of body weight for day 1 followed by
2-4 kcal/pound of body weight/day for days 2-4. At least 60% of calories are from a composition of
fatty acids (with 50% or more coming from coconut oil and nuts including macadamia, walnuts,
almonds), glycerol (2-5% of kcal) and 5% of calories from plant-based proteins (soy, rice, other
grains) + a maximum of 35% of calories from carbohydrates, mostly complex, from plant sources.
The diet is also high nourishment and provides, on each day, 30-50% of the daily recommended
intake for all vitamins and minerals + essential fatty acids, with at least 50% of them coming from
natural sources.
[0046]          In another embodiment, a method of alleviating or preventing insulin resistance
and/or hyperglycemia is provided.       The method includes a step of identifying a subject having

insulin resistance and/or fasting hyperglycemia diabetes.       In this regard, subjects having a family
history of, or showing trending towards, insulin resistance and/or fasting hyperglycemia diabetes can
also be treated to inhibit the development of these conditions.         Indications of a subject trending
towards insulin resistance and/or hyperglygemia include increasing weight, increasing fasting
glucose levels, increasing hyperglycemia, increasing insulin resistance, and the like over several
months to years (e.g., 6 months to 5 years). The subject is provided with multiple cycles of the
fasting mimicking diet as set forth above for treating beta-cell damage and diabetes. In one particular
variation, the FMD is provided to such subjects for 4-5 days every 4-12 weeks to promote a
reduction in symptoms.
[00471          In another embodiment, a method of alleviating a symptom of or preventing
metabolic syndrome is provided. The method includes a step of identifying a subject having one or
more metabolic syndrome symptoms/risk factors. Examples of such symptoms/risk factors include
high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, excess body fat around the waist, high total cholesterol, low
HDL, and the like. In this regard, subjects having a family history of or showing trending towards
metabolic syndrome can also be treated to inhibit the development of these conditions. Indications
of a subject trending towards metabolic syndrome include a decreasing HDL, increasing total
cholesterol, increasing weight, increasing fasting glucose levels, increasing hyperglycemia,
increasing insulin resistance, and the like over several months to years (e.g., 6 months to 5 years).
The subject is provided with multiple cycles of a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) as set forth above
for the treatment of beta-cell damage and diabetes.         In one particular variation, the subject is
provided with the FMD 4-5 days every 1-12 weeks to promote a reduction in symptoms.
[0048]          In another embodiment, a diet package for implementing the fasting mimicking diets
set forth above is provided.     In general, the diet package includes rations for implementing the
fasting mimicking diets set forth above. The sources of these rations are also set forth above. In
particular, the rations are divided in portions for each cycle of the fasting mimicking diet.
Alternatively, the rations are divided into portions for each day of the fasting mimicking diet. In
another variation, the rations are divided into portions for each meal of the fasting mimicking diet.
For example, the diet package includes a first set of rations for a fasting mimicking diet to be
administered for the first time period to a subject, the fasting mimicking diet providing from 4.5 to 7
                                                            14

kilocalories per pound of subject for a first day and 3 to 5 kilocalories per pound of subject per day
for a second to fifth day of the low protein diet. The diet package includes rations that provide less
than 30 g of sugar on the first day; less than 20 g of sugar on the second to fifth days; less than 28 g
of proteins on the first day; less than 18 g of proteins on the second to fifth days; 20 to 30 grams of
monounsaturated fats on the first day; 10 to 15 grams of monounsaturated fats on the second to fifth
days; between 6 and 10 grams of polyunsaturated fats on the first day; 3 to 5 grams of
polyunsaturated fats on the second to fifth days; less than 12 g of saturated fats on the first day; less
than 6 grams of saturated fats on the second to fifth days; and 12 to 25 grams of glycerol per day on
the second to fifth days.    In a refinement, the diet package further includes sufficient rations to
provide the micronutrients set forth above. In a further refinement, the diet package provides
instructions providing details of the methods set forth above.
[0049]          The substitution diets are scaled for mice in the experiments set forth below to obtain
equivalent changes in IGF-I (over 30% reduction), IGFBP1 (over 5 fold increase), ketone bodies
(detection of high levels of B hydroxyl butyrate), glucose (at least 20% reduction) and insulin (at
least 20% reduction). The FMD can be given as cycles of a preventive or therapeutic diet, every 1-12
weeks (see above) followed by a normal diet. Subsequent cycles must be postponed until the subject
returns to a BMI of at least 18 or what is considered by the physician to be a healthy weight.
[00501          The following examples illustrate the various embodiments of the present invention.
Those skilled in the art will recognize many variations that are within the spirit of the present
invention and scope of the claims.
Mouse FMD experiments
[00511          Figures 4A-E provide the results of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in Type I
diabetes mice as described in FMD1 and FMD2 sections set forth above. Figure 4A provides blood
glucose levels of mice with STZ-induced hyperglycemia. The vertical dash lines indicate the cycles
of FMD while the horizontal dash line indicates the level of blood glucose in healthy controls.
Figure 4B provides plasma insulin levels of STZ-treated mice with or without FMD. Figure 4C
provides glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance test results. Mice were injected with glucose or
insulin and the blood glucose levels were measured over a 60 min period. Figure 4D provides
immunostaining of pancreatic islets for insulin (bright area). In the FMD group, both rescued and
                                                           15

unrescued mice contained more insulin-secreting beta-cells comparing to the AL group. Finally,
Figure 4E provides a survival curve of STZ treated mice.
[0052]          Figures 5A-B provide the results of the fasting mimicking diet in Type II diabetes
mice (leprdb/db) (as described in FMD1 and FMD2 sections). Figure 5A provides the body weight
while Figure 5B provides the blood glucose level of db/db mice. In these experiments, 8-wks-old
db/db mice were fed ad libitum or FMD. Vertical dash lines indicate the cycles of FMD, while the
horizontal dash line indicates the blood glucose levels of non-diabetic controls.
[0053]          Figure 6 provides the effect of Fasting and a Fasting Mimicking Diet (as described in
FMD1 and FMD2 sections) in a pre-diabetic human subject. With respect to fasting plasma glucose
(FPG) levels in a pre-diabetic subject who underwent multiple cycles of a FMD, reduction in blood
glucose was found after cycles of fasting/diet cycles, at both the non-fasting phase and fasting/diet
phase. The horizontal line indicates the level for identifying pre-diabetes (FPG 110-125mg/dl).
Human FMD trials
[0054]          Figure 7 illustrates an experimental scheme of a human adapted version of the Fasting
Mimicking Diet (FMD). FMD was supplied to participants once per month for 3 consecutive cycles.
Each cycle consists of 5 days of FMD and 25 days of refeeding. Biomedical measurements presented
below were performed at baseline (E) and prior to the start of the diet (A), immediately after the first
FMD cycle (B) and during the refeeding period after the 1st cycle (C) and that after 3 cycles of
FMD+Refeeding (D).
[00551          Figure 8 provides the distribution of fasting blood glucose of human subjects. FMD
reduces blood glucose levels in human subjects originally with high basal blood glucose (baseline
>90 mg/dl). Fasting blood glucose was measured at indicated time points: A, before receiving FMD;
C, 7 days of refeeding after 1st FMD. See also Figure 7 for the experimental scheme. N=16.
[0056]          Table 5 provides the levels of fasting blood glucose of human subjects before and
after receving FMD. FMD reduces blood glucose levels in human subjects with high basal blood
glucose (>90 mg/dl) (p<0.05, t-test). Fasting blood glucose was measured at indicated time points:
pre-FMD, tme point A, before receiving FMD; post-FMD, time point C, 7 days of refeeding after 1st
FMD. See also Figure 7 for the experimental scheme.

[00581          Figure 9 provides plots of circulating betatrophin levels for human subjects. Sample
size is indicated in parentheses. It is observed that betatrophin levels were increased at post-FMD
refeeding compared to the baseline and before administration of the FMD.
[00591          Table 7 shows that levels of adiponectin in the serum of human subjects on FMD
were measured at baseline and after 3 cycles of the FMD, indicating a 40% increase in circulating
adiponectin after 3 cycles of the diet (post-FMD, 7 days refeeding after cycle 3). Higher adiponectin
levels are associated with insulin sensitization and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
