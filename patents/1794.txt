                              Invention Title
   Regulating method for an electric heater and the associated heater
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the
              best method of performing it known to me/us:-

                                                    2
              The present invention relates to a method of regulating a heater of the type
   comprising: an envelope defining an interior space and a space outside the apparatus; an
   electric heating element designed to convert electrical energy into heat and located in the
   interior space; an inertial element made of a material with thermal inertia, able to store the
 5 heat emitted by the electric heating element and to restore the heat to air outside the
   apparatus; a sensor of a temperature of the outside air; wherein the control method
   comprises a first mode of operation of the apparatus for maintaining the outside air at a first
   temperature T1, and a second mode of operation of the apparatus for maintaining the outside
   air at a second temperature Tc that is higher than the first temperature.
10            In such a heating apparatus, referred to as a thermal inertia apparatus, the heat of
   the heating element is transferred to the outside air by the inertial element. Thus, the outside
   temperature variations are attenuated compared to direct transfer, and which thus improves
   the comfort of the users.
              The regulation methods of electric heaters generally provide for an "economy mode"
15 and a "comfort mode", each aimed at keeping the outside air at a different temperature. The
   economy mode, which corresponds to the lowest temperature, is generally adopted in the
   absence of users. When switching to comfort mode, the heating element is supplied with
   electricity to raise the temperature of the room.
              In such a case, the presence of an inertial element slows the rise in temperature
20 compared with direct heat transfer between the heating element and the air.
              One solution to accelerate the temperature rise is to increase the maximum heating
   power of the apparatus. This solution is nevertheless expensive in energy.
              The present invention aims to provide a heater offering a rapid rise in temperature
   without significantly increasing the energy cost.
25            To this end, the object of the invention is a method of the aforementioned type,
   wherein: the heating apparatus further comprises a blowing device, capable of directing a
   flow of air towards the electric heating element and/or towards the inertial element, wherein
   the air flow is in communication with the outside air; and wherein the method comprises the
   following steps: with the apparatus in the first mode of operation and the blowing device
30 stopped, reception of a command to change to the second mode of operation; then
   increasing the electrical energy supplied to the heating element, and starting the blowing
   device; followed by stopping the blowing device if the temperature of the outside air reaches
   a first predetermined value equal to T1 + a (T, - T1), such that 0 < a 1.

                                                     3
              According to other advantageous aspects of the invention, the method comprises
   one or more of the following characteristics, taken separately or in any technically feasible
   combination:
              -  a lies between 70% and 99%, more preferably between 80% and 95%;
 5            -  when switching on the blowing device, the device operates according to a first
                 air flow rate d1 ; then, when the outside air temperature reaches a second
                 predetermined value equal to T1 + P(Tc - T1 ), where 0 < P < a, the blowing
                 device operates according to a second air flow rate d2 such that 0 < d2 < d1 ;
              -  the first air flow is substantially constant while the second air flow decreases
10               over time;
              -  a first period is measured between a first instant of start-up of the blowing device
                 and a second instant when the temperature of the outside air reaches the
                 second predetermined value; then, from the second instant, an air flow of the
                 blower device varies according to a predetermined model form that is designed
15               to decrease the air flow between the values d1 and 0 over a second period
                 calculated as a function of the first period;
              -  P lies between 50% and 90%, more preferably between 60% and 70%;
              -  when the electrical energy supplied to the heating element increases, electric
                 power is supplied to the heating element; then, if the temperature of the outside
20               air reaches a third predetermined value equal to T1 + y (Tc - T1 ), where 0 < y < a,
                 the supplied electric power decreases;
              -  the heater further comprises a presence detector near the apparatus; wherein
                 the method further comprises: a step of stopping the blowing device (20) when a
                 presence is detected; and a step of restarting the blowing device when no
25               presence is detected, and if the temperature of the outside air is lower than the
                 first predetermined value.
              The invention further relates to a heater comprising: an envelope defining an interior
   space and a space outside the apparatus; an electric heating element adapted to convert
   electrical energy into heat and located in the interior space; an inertial element formed of a
30 material with thermal inertia and able to store the heat emitted by the electric heating element
   and to restore the heat to air outside the apparatus; a sensor of the temperature of the
   outside air; and a blowing device that is designed to direct a flow of air towards the electric
   heating element and/or the inertial element, wherein the air flow is in communication with the

                                                    4
   outside air; and wherein the heater is provided with means for implementing a control method
   as described above.
              According to other advantageous aspects of the invention, the heating apparatus
   comprises one or more of the following characteristics, taken separately or in any technically
 5 feasible combination:
              -   the inertial element forms a front panel included in the envelope of the
                  apparatus, wherein the front panel has an internal face facing towards the
                  interior of the apparatus, and wherein the electric heating element is in contact
                  with the internal face;
10            -   the inertial element is formed of a material capable of emitting infrared radiation
                  under the effect of an increase in its temperature;
              -   the blowing device comprises at least one fan, preferably at least two fans,
                  located in the interior space.
              The invention will be better understood on reading the description which follows and
15 that is given solely by way of a non-limiting example with reference to the drawings, wherein:
              Fig. 1 shows a schematic sectional view of a heater according to one embodiment
                     of the invention;

              Fig. 4 graphically represents temperature and power variations as a function of time
                     for the heating apparatus of Fig. 1.
              Fig. 1 shows schematically and in section, a heating apparatus 10 according to one
   embodiment of the invention. Preferably, the apparatus 10 is a domestic heater or radiator. In
25 the following description, the heating apparatus 10 is considered to be installed in a room of a
   residential building.
              The heating apparatus 10 comprises, in particular, a main electric heating element
   12 and an inertial element 14 forming a front panel of the heating apparatus 10. The heating
   apparatus 10 further comprises a rear bodywork 16, assembled with the front panel 14 to
30 form an envelope of the heating apparatus 10. The envelope defines an interior space 17 and
   an outer space 18 of the apparatus.

                                                      5
              In the rest of the description, the terms "interior" and "exterior" refer respectively to
   the interior space 17 and exterior space 18 of the apparatus 10. The outer space 18 is
   considered to be limited to the room in which the device 10 is installed.
              The apparatus 10 further comprises a blowing device 20. In the embodiment of Fig.
 5 1, the apparatus 10 further comprises a secondary electric heating element 22. The blowing
   device 20 and the secondary heating electric element 22 are arranged in the interior space
   17.
              The apparatus 10 also comprises an electronic device 23 for regulating the
   electrical supply of the heating elements 12, 22 and the blowing device 20.
10            The front panel 14 is able to store the heat emitted by the heating elements 12, 22
   and to restore the heat to air outside the apparatus 10. The front panel 14 is preferably made
   of a thermal inertia material, particularly of the glass, stone or metal type, such as cast iron.
              Preferably, the material of the front panel 14 is also emissive, i.e. able to emit
   infrared radiation under the effect of an increase in temperature.
15            In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the front panel 14 has a substantially planar shape,
   arranged vertically in an operating position of the apparatus 10. According to the variant, the
   front panel 14 has a curved or angular shape.
              The front panel 14 comprises a front face 25 and a rear face 26, respectively
   oriented towards the outside and towards the inside of the apparatus 10.
20            The main electric heating element 12 is an electrical resistance, in thermal contact
   with the rear face 26 of the front panel 14. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the electrical
   resistance 12 is screen-printed on a plastic film 28, while the plastic film is stuck on the rear
   face 26 of the front panel. According to an alternative embodiment (not shown), the electrical
   resistance is formed by a heating cable applied to the rear face 26 of the front panel.
25            The rear bodywork 16 is, for example, made of metal and comprises means (not
   shown) for attachment to a vertical wall. The rear bodywork 16 further comprises lower
   openings 30 and upper openings 31 for a substantially vertical air flow in the interior space
   17.
              The blowing device 20 is preferably located in the lower part of the apparatus 10, in
30 particular near the lower openings 30 of the rear bodywork 16. The blowing device 20
   preferably comprises at least one fan, and more preferably two fans, arranged, for example
   on either side of a vertical median plane of the apparatus 10. The blowing device 20 is

                                                    6
   designed to direct an air flow 21 towards the electrical resistance 12 and to the front panel 14.
   The flow of air is, for example, oriented obliquely, from the bottom to the top.
              The secondary heating element 22 is preferably a convection heating element. The
   secondary heating element 22 comprises, for example, an electrical resistance embedded in
 5 a cast iron, ceramic or aluminum heater. The heating body is, for example, fixed to the rear
   bodywork 16.
              One considers a ratio between the maximum powers Pmaxi and Pmax2 of the power
   supply of the electric heating elements, respectively the main element 12 and the secondary
   element 22. Preferably, the ratio lies between 1 and 4.
10            The electronic control device 23 is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The electronic
   control device 23 comprises, in particular, a control unit 32 situated at the upper part of the
   apparatus 10. The control unit 32 comprises, for example, a microprocessor 33, a program
   memory 34 and at least one communication bus 36.
              The control unit 32 also comprises a man/machine                interface 40,   of the
15 screen/keyboard type, enabling a user to select parameters of the control method, such as a
   set temperature To of the apparatus 10.
              The electronic control device 23 also comprises a temperature sensor 42 located in
   the lower part of the apparatus 10 and connected to the control box 32. The sensor 42 makes
   it possible to measure a temperature T of the air outside the apparatus 10.
20            Optionally, the electronic control device 23 further comprises a presence detector
   43 that is able to detect a presence in the vicinity of the apparatus 10. This is, for example, an
   optical detector, especially an infrared, or an acoustic detector.
              The electronic control device 23 is able to supply electrically the electrical
   resistances of the heating elements 12, 22, as well as the blowing device 20.
25            More specifically, the program memory 34 contains a program 44 controlling the
   power supply of the heating elements 12, 22, as a function of the outside temperature T
   measured by the sensor 42, and with the set temperature To set at the interface 40.
              In the case where the apparatus 10 includes a secondary heating element 22, the
   main heating element 12 is preferably a priority in the program 44. In other words, as long as
30 the power supply of the resistance 12 is lower than the maximum power Pmax1, the resistance
   of the secondary heating element 22 is not supplied with electricity.
              Moreover, the program 44 provides a first mode of operation of the apparatus 10,
   the economy mode. The economy mode is intended to maintain the outside temperature T at

                                                     7
   a first value T1 . Preferably, T1 is equal to T. - AT, wherein T, is the setpoint temperature
   adjustable at the interface 40, while AT is a predefined interval in the program memory 34.
             The program 44 further provides a second mode of operation of the apparatus 10,
   the comfort mode. The comfort mode is intended to maintain the outside temperature T at a
 5 second value T2 that is greater than the first value T1. In the remainder of the description, T2 is
   considered to be equal to the set temperature Tc.
              Preferably, in the economic mode as in the comfort mode, the blowing device 20 is
   by default at a standstill. In other words, the operation of the apparatus 10 is primarily based
   on radiation, i.e. the infrared emission by the front panel 14, and on the natural convection, or
10 the heat transfer of the heating elements 12, 22 to the air without blowing.
             When switching from the economy mode to the comfort mode, the program 44
   executes the steps of a method according to one embodiment of the invention, as described
   below. The method is represented by a logic diagram in Fig. 3.
              Since the apparatus 10 is in economy mode, a first step of the method is the
15 reception 100 by the program 44 of a comfort mode command. This command is, for
   example, generated by time programming the apparatus 10. Alternatively, the command to
   change to comfort mode is generated by the detection of a presence by the detector 43.
             The command to pass to comfort mode leads to the supply 102 of power to the
   heating elements 12, 22, or to an increase in the power supplied compared to the economy
20 mode. Preferably, upon reception of the command to pass to comfort mode, each of the
   heating elements is supplied its maximum power, respectively Pmax1 and Pmax2.
              In a substantially simultaneous manner, the program 44 triggers the operation of the
   blowing device 20, or the fans, corresponding to a first air flow d1 . Preferably, d1 is equal to or
   close to a maximum air flow rate of the blowing device.
25           The blowing device 20 thus directs an air flow 21 towards the resistance 12 and to
   the front panel 14, wherein the air flow is directed from the bottom upwards. In other words,
   outside air enters the interior space 17 through the lower openings 30 of the rear bodywork
   16. The air is heated by contact with the resistance 12 and/or the front panel 14 and then
   comes out in the outer space 18 through the upper openings 31.
30            Preferably, the interior space 17 is small enough for the air flow 21 to be heated
   also by the secondary heating element 22.

                                                    8
              The outside air is thus heated by forced convection within the apparatus 10, which
   accelerates the rise of the temperature T with respect to a radiation/natural convection
   operation.
              The blowing device 20 is then stopped 106 when the temperature T of the outside
 5 air, measured by the sensor 42, reaches a third value T3 defined as a function of the set
   temperature Tc. T3 is, for example, calculated according to a predefined formula in the
   program memory 34, such that T3 = T1 + a(AT), where 0 < a s 1. In other words, the blowing
   device 20 stops when the temperature of the outside air has reached, or is at least sufficiently
   close to, the set temperature T.
10            Preferably, the value a lies between 70% and 99%, more preferably between 80%
   and 95%.
              According to a first variant of the method, represented by the arrow 108 in Fig. 3,
   the air flow of the blowing device 20 remains substantially constant until the step of stopping
   106.
15            The graph of Fig. 4 shows the variation of the outside temperature T as a function of
   time, for a heater 10 as described above, during a process according to the first variant
   above. The curve 50 represents a first so-called "dynamic" case, corresponding to a value a
   equal to 95%. The curve 52 represents a second case corresponding to a value a equal to
   65%.
20            The curve 54 represents a third reference case, called "static". In the "static" case,
   the blowing device 20 is not used, while the other steps of the above method are retained.
              The origin of the time axis corresponds to the command to change from economy
   mode to comfort mode. In the example shown in Figure 4, Te = 19 0C; AT = 3.5 'C; while the
   total electrical power of the apparatus 10, corresponding to Pmax1 + Pmax2, is 1000 W.
25            It is found that in the "dynamic" case, the temperature of 18.8 0C (i.e. To - 5% AT) is
   reached after 35 minutes, compared with 48 minutes in the "static" case. The time saving 56
   with respect to the rise in temperature, related to the use of a blowing device, is therefore
   about 27%.
              In the case of the curve 52, from the stopping of the blowing device 20, it is found
30 that the rise in temperature slows down sharply. In fact, the inertial material of the front panel
   14, previously cooled by the air flow 21, absorbs most of the heat emitted by the resistance
   12. From the stopping of the blowing device 20, the curve 52 thus approximates the curve 54
   ("static" case).

                                                        9
               In order to optimize both the heating comfort and the noise nuisance associated
   with the blowing device 20, a second variant of the method provides for a gradual decrease in
   the air flow rate until the blowing device is stopped.
               According to this second variant, represented by the arrow 110 in Fig. 3, the step
 5 104 corresponds to a first operating phase of the blowing device 20 according to the first
   airflow d1 . The temperature T increases until a fourth value T4 defined as a function of the set
   temperature To is reached. T4 is, for example, calculated according to a predefined formula in
   the program memory 34, such that T4 = T1 + P(AT), where 0 < P < a. Preferentially, the                p
   value lies between 50% and 90%, more preferably between 60% and 70%.
10             The program 44 then passes to a second phase 112 of operation of the blowing
   device 20 in a second air flow d2 where 0 < d2 < d1 . The temperature T continues to increase
   until it reaches the value T3 , which leads to the total stoppage of the blowing device 20.
               The reduction of the air flow makes it possible to limit the noise of the blowing
   device 20 when a certain level of heating comfort is already ensured in the room.
15             According to a first embodiment, the second air flow rate d2 is constant over the
   period of the second phase 112, wherein, for example, d2/d1 = 30%.
               According to a second embodiment, d2 decreases during the second phase 112, up
   to the step of stopping 106 the blowing device 20. The decrease of d2 during the second
   phase 112 is effected according to a predetermined model form, stored in the program
20 memory 34. It is, for example, an incremental decrease, or a continuous decrease, in
   particular linear.
               According to a first alternative of the second embodiment, a period        T2 of decrease at
   the rate d2 between the values d1 and 0 is predefined in the program memory 34, based on
   experimental data.
25             It is, however, difficult to set the period T2 before the installation of the apparatus 10,
   because the rate of rise in temperature depends on several parameters external to the
   apparatus. Such parameters include, in particular, the size of the installation piece, as well as
   the thermal characteristics of the building.
               Thus, if the period   T2  is chosen too short, the blowing device 20 stops before the
30 temperature T has reached the third value T3 . If the period         T2 is chosen too long, the noise
   nuisance related to the operation of the blowing device 20 is not optimized.

                                                          10
               In addition, according to a second alternative of the second embodiment, the period
   T2 of decrease at the rate d2 between the values d1 and 0 is calculated as a function of a
   period   T1 of the first phase 104.
               An example is considered where p = 63% and a = 95%. The period                     T1 of the first
 5 phase 104 is measured between an instant to of operating the blowing device and a time t,
   when the temperature T reaches the fourth value T4. Then, starting from said instant t1 ,
   defining the beginning of the second phase 112, the air flow d2 of the blowing device
   decreases according to a predetermined model form, for example linear. The model is
   configured to change the airflow from d, to 0 over a period               T2 calculated as a function of the
10 time  T1  previously measured.
               The program 44 provides, for example, that              T1 = T2 .  Other ratios may be defined
   between the periods T1 and       T2 , according to the values of a and        S.
               If the temperature T reaches the third value T3 before the end of the period               T2 , the
   blower 20 is stopped (step 106). Thus, in this example, the second phase 112 is designed to
15 have a maximum period equal to the period           T1  of the first phase 104.
               The example described above is illustrated in Fig. 4 by the curve 58, representing
   the temperature variation T. This curve 58 is very close to the curve 50 of the "dynamic" case.
   The example described above thus provides a heating comfort comparable to the "dynamic"
   case, while reducing the noise nuisance of the blowing device 20 if it is in the room.
20             According to a third alternative of the second embodiment, the program 44 provides
   for a determination of     T2 through self-learning of the apparatus 10. In other words, the period
   T2 is calculated on the basis of an average of the periods             T1  measured in previous phases of
   the change from economy mode to comfort mode.
               In parallel with the operation of the blowing device 20, it is possible to vary the
25 power supply of the heating elements 12, 22 as a function of time, in order to prevent the
   apparatus 10 from overheating.
               For example, program 44 provides that step 102 corresponds to a first phase of
   operation of the heating elements 12, 22, at a first electrical power. Preferably, upon receipt
   of the command to pass to comfort mode, each of the heating elements is supplied at its
30 maximum power, respectively Pmaxi and           Pmax2.
               The temperature T increases until it reaches a fifth value T5 defined as a function of
   the set temperature T. For example, T5 is calculated according to a predefined formula in the

                                                   11
   program memory 34, such that T5 = T1+ y(AT), where 0 < y < a. Preferably, the value y lies
   between 50% and 90%, more preferably between 60% and 70%.
              The program 44 then passes to a second phase 114 of operation of the heating
   elements 12, 22. During this second phase, the total power supplied to the heating elements
 5 12, 22 decreases gradually.
              Preferably, the power supplied to the main heating element 12 is substantially
   maintained at Pmaxi as long as the set temperature Tc, or even the third value T3 , is not
   reached. During the second phase 114, it is, therefore, the power supplied to the secondary
   heating element 22 which gradually decreases.
10            The curves 60 and 62 of Fig. 4 respectively represent the variations of the electric
   power supplied as a function of time, respectively in the "dynamic" and "static" cases as
   described above. The electric power supplied is expressed as a percentage of the total power
   of the apparatus 10.
              It may be seen that the use of blowing allows curve 60 of the "dynamic" case to
15 decrease earlier than in the "static" case. A space 64 between the curves 60 and 62
   illustrates an energy saving for the rise in temperature, linked to the use of a blowing device.
   This saving of energy is of the order of 6%. Such an energy gain largely offsets the energy
   consumed by the fans of the blowing device 20.
              In the "dynamic" case described above, the blowing is maintained at the first rate d1
20 until the third value T3 of the temperature T is obtained. According to a variant, the blowing
   device 20 is synchronized with the heating elements . More specifically, the program 44
   corresponds to the second variant described above, represented by the arrow 110 in Fig. 3,
   where T5 = T4 . Thus, from the moment T reaches the fourth value T4 , the flow rate of the
   blower 20 and the power supplied to the secondary heating element 22 decrease together.
25            Preferably, the electronic control device 23 offers the possibility to the user of
   disabling the execution of the program 44. Thus, the user may overcome the noise
   associated with the blowing device 20 if he is present in the room.
              According to one embodiment, in the case where the command to change to
   comfort mode is not related to the presence detector 43, the program 44 causes the blowing
30 device 20 to stop as the detector 43 detects a presence close to the apparatus 10. Thus, the
   blowing only works when the room is unoccupied, in order to reduce noise.
              The method as described above allows faster temperature rise than in the case of
   devices without a blowing device. Consequently, it is possible to configure an interval AT

                                                   12
   between the temperatures of the economy and comfort modes, greater than for radiators of
   the prior art.
              Preferably, AT is greater than 3.0 'C and more preferably between 3.5 'C and 5.0
    "C. Such a method thus allows energy savings in economy mode, without degrading the
 5 heating comfort in comfort mode.
              Similarly, the method described above may be used in the case of a change from a
   frost-free mode to comfort mode. The frost-free mode is characterized by a lower             Thg
   temperature than the economy mode. For example Thg = Tc - 10 C.
