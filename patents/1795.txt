FUEL/AIR MIXTURE AND COMBUSTION APPARATUS
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2014328025, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention relates generally to fuel-fired heating apparatus, such as fuel-fired
air heating furnaces, and more particularly relates to specially designed fuel/air mixing and
combustion sections of such fuel-fired heating apparatus.
[0003] In fuel-fired heating appliances such as, for example, furnaces, a known firing method is
to flow a fuel/air mixture into a burner box structure in which a suitable ignition device is
disposed to combust the fuel/air mixture and thereby create hot combustion gases used to heat
air (or another fluid as the case may be) for delivery to a location served by the heating
appliance. The hot combustion gases are flowed through a series of heat exchanger tubes,
externally across which the fluid to be heated is flowed, and then discharged from the heating
appliance into a suitable flue structure. Due to various configurational characteristics of the
heating appliance, during firing of the appliance undesirable uneven heating of the combustion
product-receiving heat exchanger tubes may occur such that an undesirable non-uniform
temperature distribution is present in the overall heat exchanger tube array.
[0004] In addition to this potential heat exchange unevenness problem, other problems that may
arise in the design of fuel-fired heating appliances include an undesirable noise level generated
in the creation of the fuel/air mixture delivered to the burner box, an undesirably low level of
mixing of the fuel and air, and an undesirably high level of NOx generated in the fuel/air
mixture combustion process.
[0005] As can be seen, a need exists for alleviating the above-noted problems associated with
conventional fuel-fired heating appliances of various types.

axially into the open inlet end portion 40 of the venturi structure 38 for purposes later described
herein.
[0022] Turning now to FIG. 1, the secondary fuel/air mixing structure 16 comprises a secondary
mixing housing 54 having an open inlet end 56 coupled to the open inlet end 48 of the housing
22, and an open outlet end 58 coupled to the open inlet end 60 of a burner box housing portion
62 of the fuel/air mixture combustion structure 18. Positioned at the juncture between the
housings 54 and 62 is a specially designed perforated diffuser plate 64 embodying principles of
the present invention and uniquely functioning in a manner later described herein. The housing
62 has a closed right end wall 66 spaced apart from and facing the perforated diffuser plate 64.
Positioned between the diffuser plate 64 and the end wall 66 is an igniter 68 operative to ignite a
fuel/air mixture entering the housing 62 as later described herein.
[0023] The previously mentioned heat exchanger tubes 20 form with the fuel/air mixture
combustion structure 18 a heat transfer structure portion of the furnace 12 and have, as viewed
in FIG. 1, left inlet end portions coupled to the housing 62 end wall 66 and communicating with
the interior of the housing 62. As viewed in FIG. 1, right outlet ends of the heat exchanger tubes
20 are communicated with the interior of a collector box structure 70 within which a draft
inducer fan 72 is operatively disposed.

                                                   11
[0024] Still referring to FIG. 1, during firing of the furnace 12 the draft inducer fan 72 draws
combustion air 74 into the open inlet end portion 40 of the venturi structure 38, across the vanes
32, and then rightwardly through the interior of the venturi structure 38. Vanes 32 cause the
combustion air 74 to internally traverse the venturi structure 38 in a swirling pattern 74a
generally centered about the venturi structure longitudinal axis 46. At the same time, the fuel
injector 52 receives gaseous fuel via a fuel supply line 76 and responsively discharges gaseous
fuel jets 78 radially outwardly into the swirling combustion air 74a. The gaseous fuel in the jets
78 mixes with the swirling combustion air 74a to form therewith a fuel/air mixture 80 that enters
the secondary mixing housing 54 and is further mixed therein.
[0025] The fuel/air mixture 80 within the secondary mixing housing 54 is then drawn through
the perforated diffuser plate 64 into the interior of the burner box housing portion 62 wherein
the igniter 68 combusts the fuel/air mixture 80 to form therefrom hot combustion gas 82 that is
flowed rightwardly through the heat exchanger tubes 20.
[0026] Simultaneously with the flow of hot combustion gas 82 through the heat exchanger tubes
20, a supply air fan portion of the furnace 12 (not shown) flows air 84 to be heated externally
across the heat exchanger tubes 20 to receive combustion heat therefrom and create a flow of
heated air 84a for delivery to a conditioned space served by the furnace 12. Combustion heat
transfer from the heat exchanger tubes 20 to the air 84 causes the tube-entering hot combustion
gas 82 to rightwardly exit the heat exchanger tubes 20 as cooled combustion gas 82a that enters
the collector box 70 and is expelled therefrom, by the draft inducer fan 72, to a suitable flue
structure (not shown).
[0027] Compared to conventional fuel/air mixing structures, the venturi-based primary fuel/air
mixing structure 14 provides several advantages. For example, due to the cross-flow injection
technique utilizing the combustion air 74a swirling through the venturi interior in combination
with the radially directed interior fuel jets 78, an improved degree of fuel/air mixing is achieved
within the venturi structure 38. This enhanced degree of fuel/air mixing is further increased by
the use of the secondary fuel/air mixing structure 16 which serves to further mix the fuel and air
by providing further "residence" time for the fuel/air mixture created in the venturi structure 38
before it enters the fuel/air mixture burner box housing 62 for combustion therein.

                                                  12
[0028] Additionally, the construction of the primary fuel/air mixing structure 14 substantially
reduces the fuel/air mixing noise during both start-up and steady state operation of the furnace
12. In the primary fuel/air mixing structure 14 the perforations 44 in the sidewall of the venturi
structure 38 permit the fuel/air mixture traversing it to enter and fill the chamber 50
circumscribing the venturi structure 38. This creates within the chamber 50 a fluid damping
volume that absorbs and damps noise-creating fluid pressure oscillations in the venturi interior,
thereby desirably lessening the operational sound level of the primary fuel/air mixing structure
14. Moreover, the enhanced mixing of the fuel/air mixture to be combusted desirably reduces
the level of NOx emissions created by the furnace 12 during firing thereof.
[0029] As may best be seen in FIG. 4, the draft inducer fan 72 is representatively centered in a
left-to-right direction within the collector box 70 and with respect to the five illustratively
depicted heat exchanger tubes 20. Accordingly, the suction force of the fan 72 is similarly
centered relative to the array of heat exchanger tubes 20. Without the incorporation in the
furnace 12 of a subsequently described feature of the present invention, the result would be that
the per-tube flow of hot combustion gas 82 is greater for the central tubes 20b than it is for the
end tubes 22a. In turn, this would create an undesirable non-uniform temperature distribution
across the heat exchanger tube array, with the central tubes 20b having higher operating
temperatures than those of the end tubes 20a.
[0030] With reference now to FIGS. 1 and 3, the previously mentioned diffuser plate 64
installed at the juncture between the secondary fuel/air mixing housing 54 and the burner box
housing 62 representatively has an elongated rectangular shape, and is substantially aligned with
the open inlet ends of the heat exchanger tubes 20. Along substantially the entire length of the
diffuser plate 64 are formed a series of relatively small perforations 86 (see FIG. 3), with
relatively larger perforations 88 being additionally formed through the opposite end portions of
the diffuser plate 64. This perforation pattern, as can be seen, provides opposite end portions of
the diffuser plate 64 (which are generally aligned with the inlets of the end heat exchanger tubes
20a) with greater fuel/air mixture through-flow areas than the diffuser plate fuel/air mixture
through-flow areas aligned with the inlets of the central heat exchanger tubes 20b.
[0031] Accordingly, during firing of the furnace 12, the presence of the diffuser plate 64 lessens
the flow of hot combustion gas 82 through the central heat exchanger tubes 20b and increases
the flow of hot combustion gas 82 through the end heat exchanger tubes 20a, with the

                                                   13
perforation pattern in the diffuser plate 64 functioning to substantially alleviate non-uniform
temperature distribution across the heat exchanger tube array that might otherwise occur. As can
readily be seen, principles of the present invention provide a simple and quite inexpensive
solution to the potential problem of non-uniform temperature distribution across the heat
exchanger tube array. Additionally, in developing the present invention it has been discovered
that the use of the non-uniformly perforated diffuser plate 64 also provides for further mixing of
the fuel/air mixture 80 entering the burner box housing 62, thereby providing an additional
beneficial reduction in the NOx level of the discharged combustion gas 82a.
[0032] While a particular hole pattern in the diffuser plate has been representatively described
herein, it will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this particular art that a variety
of alternative hole patterns and sizes may be alternatively be utilized if desired. For example,
while a combination of different size perforation has been representatively illustrated and
described, the perforations could be of uniform size but with more perforations/area being
disposed on the opposite ends of the diffuser plate 64 than in the longitudinally intermediate
portion thereof. Further, the hole pattern could be a non-uniformly spaced pattern to suit the
particular application. Additionally, if desired, the diffuser plate hole pattern could have a
different overall configuration operative to alter in a predetermined, different manner the
relative combustion gas flow rates through selected ones of the heat exchanger tubes 20.
[0033] While principles of the present invention have been representatively illustrated and
described herein as being incorporated in a fuel-fired air heating furnace, a combustion system
utilizing such invention principles could also be incorporated to advantage in the combustion
systems of a wide variety of other types of fuel-fired heating apparatus using fire tube-type heat
exchangers to heat either a gas or a liquid.
[0034] The foregoing detailed description is to be clearly understood as being given by way of
illustration and example only, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited solely
by the appended claims.
