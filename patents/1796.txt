   This application is a divisional application of Australian
   application no. <removed-apn>, which in turn is a divisional
10 application of Australian application no. 2013213733,

15 Field
   The present invention relates to a gaming system, a method
   of gaming and a jackpot game controller.
20 Background
   In existing jackpot systems, jackpot increments are
   received by a jackpot controller. If the jackpot
   controller maintains plural jackpots, the increment is
25 spread across the jackpots in accordance with a defined
   split of the increment. For example, three jackpots split
   60:30:10. The increments can be small   (fractions of what
   is wagered) and accordingly the split of the increments
   will result in smaller sums. By way of example, the soft
30 meters which hold the jackpot values may need to be able
   to hold up to 14 decimal places depending on regulatory
   requirements. The displayed value of the jackpot meter
   will only turnover when the soft meter increases by a
   designated amount.
35
   A need exists for alternative jackpot systems.

   Gaming devices
   Gaming devices capable of participating in the method of
   gaming of the embodiment can take any suitable form
15 including stand alone gaming machines and server based
   gaming terminals.
   A gaming device in  the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
20 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
25 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
30 card.  Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
   in that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
35 the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
                                              10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                                  - 11
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
 5 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
10 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating      to the game.        Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.       A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
15 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
20 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.       The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
25 type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
30
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
35 communication with the processor 102.       Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
                                                  10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 12
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
 5 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
10 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
15 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
20 screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
25 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
30 instructions may be used.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
35 information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
                                              10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 13
   controller, central controller, server or database.                  In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
 5 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
10 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
15 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
20 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
25 In a client server architecture a gaming device is
   provided by a gaming client and game server (and
   optionally other gaming network components). A gaming
   client has a similar outward appearance to gaming machine
   10 but the game server implements most or all of the game
30 and as such acts as the game controller while the terminal
   operated by the player essentially provides only the
   player interface.  The gaming terminal receives player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
35 machine for display.  Further details of a client/server
   gaming architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213 and
   PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 14
   incorporated herein by reference. In such an embodiment, a
   jackpot game controller can be provided, for example, by a
   dedicated server in data communication with the game
   server.

   Figure 5 shows that a gaming device may be connected
   within a gaming network 200 which provides additional
   and/or enhanced functionality.  The gaming network 200
   includes a network 201, which for example may be an
10 Ethernet network.  Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
   are connected to the network 201.  The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3. While
15 banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure
   5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
   envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
20 network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
25 promotional or informational material. In an embodiment, a
   jackpot controller can be provided for a bank of machines
   as illustrated in Figure 1.
   The jackpot game controller can be provided within such a
30 network 200 by jackpot server 207, such that the jackpot
   game server may implement a jackpot game for a plurality
   of different banks of gaming machines rather than a
   specific jackpot controller being provided for each bank
   of gaming machines. Alternatively, there may be a single
35 jackpot for the network managed by the jackpot server.
   A database management server 206 may manage storage of
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

   game programs and associated data for downloading or
   access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. A
   loyalty program server 212 may also be provided.
 5 Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
10 210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
15 network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
20 server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
25 Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.
   Figure 9 is a functional block diagram of a gaming device
   in the form of a stand alone gaming machine. The gaming
30 device 900 may be the same or different to gaming machine
   10,100 described above.  In Figure 9, the processor 930 of
   game controller 920 is shown implementing a number of
   modules based on program code and data stored in memory
   940. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
35 various of the modules could be implemented in some other
   way, for example by a dedicated circuit. Several features
   are shown in dotted lines in Figure 9 to indicate that
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

   they need not be present in all embodiments, and indeed
   jackpot meter data 942,943 is for standalone embodiments
   which are described below.
 5 The gaming device 900 includes a player interface 910
   having a display 911 for displaying game outcomes to a
   player and a game play mechanism 912 including input
   devices such as touch screen or buttons to enable the
   player to interact with the game by placing wagers and
10 entering any other instructions required to play the game.
   Game play mechanism 912 also enables the player to
   interact with the game to learn game rules etc.             The
   player interface 910 includes a credit mechanism 913
   allowing the player to input credit into the gaming device
15 900 and/or be paid out any winnings or remaining credit.
   A person skilled in the art will appreciate that other
   components will be present in a gaming device 900 such as
   those described in relation to Figures 2 to 4 above.                    The
   memory 940 includes program code for implementing a game
20 including game rule data 941 for implementing the rules of
   a game.
   The processor 930 when executing the program code stored
   in memory 940 is arranged to generate outcomes of the game
25 in response to the operation of the game play mechanism
   912.  The outcomes are generated with the outcome
   generator 931. The outcome evaluator 932 evaluates the
   game outcomes that are generated based on the wager
   specified with the game play mechanism 912 and updates
30 credit data 942 which stores a credit meter and a win
   meter for the game.
   The game that is played, may be for example, a spinning
   reel type game where a player places a wager by selecting
35 how many lines are played in each game and an amount to
   bet per line.  Such win lines are typically formed by a
   combination of symbol display positions, one from each
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 17
   reel, the symbol display positions being located relative
   to one another such that they form a line.
   In many games, the player may win in addition to winning
 5 combinations which occur on the selected win lines for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the evaluation of the generated outcome.
10 Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, an evaluation entitlement may be based on a
   number of reels to play such as in games are marketed
   under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure
   Industries Pty Ltd.  The selection of the reel means that
15 each displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted for a
   symbol at one or more designated display positions. In
   other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
   positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
   form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
20 designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
   display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
25 are used for non-selected reels.  As a result, the total
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
   number of active display positions of each reel, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
30 the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
   Once the player places a bet, the outcome generator
   selects symbols for each reel using stop positions for
35 each reel determined by random selection by the random
   number generator 934 these are evaluated by outcome
   evaluator against a pay table which forms part of game
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                                  - 18
   rule data.
   The processor 930 also implements a jackpot module 933
   which has a jackpot incrementer 933A which determines the
 5 jackpot increment which is to apply based on the wager
    (e.g. a fixed percentage of the amount wagered),                and in
   the embodiment, communicates the jackpot increment via
   communication interface 950 to the jackpot game
   controller. The jackpot module 933 also has a jackpot
10 award handler 933B which is arranged to communicate with
   the jackpot controller 150 when play of the gaming device
   900 results in award of a jackpot. In this respect, in the
   illustrated embodiment, jackpot module has a jackpot
   awarder 932A. Each time the player plays the game, the
15 jackpot awarder 933C conducts a random trial using random
   number generator      934 with a probability of success based
   on the size of the jackpot increment and a base jackpot
   probability stored in game rule data 941.        If the jackpot
   awarder 933C wins a jackpot, award handler 933B
20 communicates with the jackpot controller 150 that the
   award has been made and awaits confirmation and the amount
   one. Award handler 933B may also take other actions, for
   example to initiate an attendant call for payment of a
   large jackpot.
25
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that jackpots
   may be awarded in other ways by the game controller 920,
   or in other embodiments be awarded by the jackpot
   controller. For example, the above described random trials
30 could be conducted at the jackpot controller.
   Jackpot game controller     and its   operation within the
   gaming system
35 Referring to Figure 6 there is shown further detail of the
   jackpot game controller 150.        From Figure 6 it will be
   apparent that jackpot game controller 150 is in data
                                                  10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

   communication with a communal display 160 on which current
   values of the jackpot prizes can be displayed to the
   players playing the bank of gaming machines 10 shown in
   Figure 1.  In other embodiments, the gaming outcomes could
 5 be displayed on a top box of the individual gaming
   machines 10, rather than being displayed on a communal
   display, or in addition to such a display.
   Referring to Figure 6, the constitution of the jackpot
10 game controller 150 is similar to that of the gaming
   device illustrated in relation to Figures 2 to 4 and 9 in
   that it has a processor 151 arranged to implement the
   jackpot game based on program code stored in memory 152
   and a display driver 154 for driving the display 160 to
15 show the jackpot game outcome.  The jackpot game
   controller 150 also includes a communication interface 153
   which is designed to enable the processor 151 to
   communicate with each of the gaming devices 10 to receive
   jackpot increments and in relation to any prize award.
20
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate the above
   components are the core components for implementing a
   jackpot game but other components may be present in a
   jackpot game controller.
25
   Figure 7 is a functional block diagram of the jackpot
   gaming controller 150 which shows that the processor 151
   implements a number of modules in a similar manner to the
   processor of the gaming device shown in Figure 9.                The
30 processor executes program code stored in memory 152 to
   instantiate an increment processor 703 which receives a
   jackpot increments from the gaming devices 10.
   The increment processor 703 then determines which of the
35 jackpot's prizes to increment for each received jackpot
   increment.  In this respect, there are at least two
   different jackpot prizes and typically three or more
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 20
   jackpot prizes with different names such as "Grand, Major"
   and "Minor". For each of these prizes there is a soft
   meter which keeps and absolute value of the jackpot 711
   stored in memory 152.  The jackpot display controller 704
 5 determines from these absolute values what actual value of
   the prize is to be displayed on display 160.         In the
   embodiment, for each increment the random number generator
   is asked to return a value in the range of 0 to 1 and
   portions of this range are allocated to different ones of
10 the jackpot such that the increment processor, when it
   receives the random number generator, response determines
   which of the jackpot soft meters 711 to increment based on
   the range to which the returned number belongs.
   Accordingly, only one of the jackpot soft meters is
15 incremented for each increment.  As a result, there is an
   increased likelihood in this embodiment that one of the
   soft meters will increase to a value such that the
   displayed value by the jackpot display controller 704 will
   increase on the display because the entirety of increment
20 is being made to one of the jackpots under the selective
   control of the increment processor 704.
   The probabilities of particular jackpot prizes being
   incremented are stored as increment probability data 712
25 and memory 152.  These probabilities are chosen so that
   over time, the relative size of the jackpots will be
   controlled relative to a desired range.  A person skilled
   in the art will appreciate that as in existing jackpots,
   the embodiment could be employed in accordance with start
30 up values for each jackpot, including hidden pools where
   portions of the increment are syphoned to a start up pool
   for when the jackpot is won.
   In an alternative embodiment rather than the random
35 incrementation of the jackpot values, a sequence of
   increments may be stored in memory 152 which give the
   appearance of randomly apportioning the increments amongst
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 21
   the jackpot prizes but which otherwise achieve the desired
   effect of increasing the rate at which at least one prize
   value is displayed as incrementing because it receives all
   of the increment.
 5
   Figure 7 shows that the jackpot controller includes a
   jackpot awarder 706 which handles requests received from
   gaming devices 900 for award of a jackpot.      When the
   jackpot awarder 706 receives such a request it locks the
10 existing value of the jackpot in respect of which the
   award is to be made and starts a new soft meter for that
   jackpot.  The jackpot awarder 706 then communicates the
   amount won to the relevant gaming device by a data
   communication interface 153.
15
   In an alternative embodiment, the jackpot awarder 706 may
   conduct a random trial for each received increment to
   determine whether to award a jackpot in respect of the
   increment as described generally above.
20
   Figure 9, also shows how the gaming device 900 is modified
   to allow for the possibility of the game being played on a
   stand alone gaming machine. In this embodiment the jackpot
   soft meter 942 is stored in the memory 940 of the gaming
25 device.  In such embodiments, rather than the jackpot
   module 933 communicating the increments to the central
   jackpot controller, the jackpot incrementer 933A
   increments jackpot soft meter data and also updates
   display 911 to show the current values of the stand alone
30 jackpots which apply to the gaming device 900.           In such an
   embodiment, the jackpot awarder 933C can act as above to
   randomly conduct a trial using RNG 934 to determine
   whether to award a jackpot.   In an alternative embodiment
   the jackpot awarder 933C may be part of the outcome
35 evaluator 932 in the sense that one of the outcomes of the
   game may be a particular symbol combination which
   corresponds to award of a respective one of the jackpots
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 22
   which is evaluated as having occurred.
   In this embodiment, the award handler 933B may be required
   to initiate a communication with an attendant in respect
 5 of the jackpot if this requires a large payout.            A person
   skilled in the art will appreciate other variations which
   can be made to the gaming device.  Otherwise, the jackpots
   are incremented in the same manner as described above
   except that these functions are provided by the jackpot
10 module 933 rather than the increment processor 703.
   The method 800 of the embodiment is summarised in Figure 8
   and involves conducting 810 a jackpot with plural jackpot
   prizes, receiving 820 an increment and selectively
15 incrementing 830 a jackpot prize.
   In a further embodiment illustrated in Figure 10, the
   increment processor 1003 may be arranged to determine
   whether a threshold value 1012 of a prize has been
20 reached.  In such embodiments, the increment processor
   1003 selectively causes one or more others of the
   plurality of prize values to increment once one of the
   jackpots reaches a particular value based on increment
   rules 1013.  For example, there may be three prizes having
25 a $500 limit, a $1000 limit and a $5000 limit.           In one
   embodiment, the increments which are received by the
   increment processor 1003 are normally split in accordance
   with a desired probability ratio amongst the three jackpot
   prizes.  However, when one of the prizes reaches the
30 threshold 1012 stored in memory 152, the increment
   processor 1003 no longer increments and any further
   increments the jackpot and the increments are split
   between the other jackpots in accordance with a desired
   ratio.  A person skilled in the art will appreciate that
35 this embodiment can be combined with the first embodiment
   where the random number generator is employed such that
   the jackpot which is incremented is selected randomly
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 23
   until it reaches a particular threshold value after which
   selections are made randomly as to which of the other
   prize values to increment.
 5 In a further variation of this embodiment, the increment
   rules 1013 designate a specific one of the jackpot prizes
   which is to receive increments intended for a jackpot
   prize in respect of which a jackpot prize has been
   received. For example, the maximum allowable value of any
lo of the jackpots may be $1199. When any one of the jackpots
   reaches this value, it stays statics and another one of
   the jackpots is incremented.   Persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that the jackpot may be designated in a
   number of ways. For example, an ordering or ranking of the
15 jackpots may be applied such that, for example, the
   jackpot immediately above or below in the ranking will
   receive the increments intended for the jackpot in respect
   of which a threshold has been met. In another example, the
   increments may be provided to the jackpot which has the
20 lowest or highest current jackpot value. Depending on the
   embodiment, this decision could be made once or many
   times. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
   such embodiments could also be implemented in a standalone
   gaming device in an analogous manner. In one example,
25 there may be Major, Maxi and Mini jackpots. Once the Major
   jackpot reaches the threshold then one or other of the
   Maxi or Mini jackpots is selected to receive the jackpot
   increments intended for the Major jackpot -     for example,
   the Maxi jackpot. The Maxi jackpot then increments by its
30 own normal rate of progression plus the rate of
   incrementation for the Major jackpot.
   On example of such a method 1100 is shown in Figure 11,
   where the method involves conducting 1110 a jackpot with a
35 plurality of jackpot prizes, receiving a jackpot increment
   1120, and determining a jackpot prize which should be
   incremented 1130. The method determines 1135 whether the
                                             10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

                                - 24
   intended increment recipient has reached a threshold.
   Where the intended jackpot has not reached a threshold, it
   is incremented 1140. Where the intended jackpot has
   reached a threshold, the increment is provided to another
 5 jackpot prize 1150. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that various of the above steps may be altered.
   For example, a jackpot could be excluded as a potential
   increment recipient once it reaches a threshold.
10 Further aspects of the above methods will be apparent from
   the above description of the gaming system. It will be
   appreciated that at least part of the method will be
   implemented digitally by a processor. Persons skilled in
   the art will also appreciate that the method could be
15 embodied in program code. The program code could be
   supplied in a number of ways, for example on a tangible
   computer readable storage medium, such as a disc or a
   memory  (for example, that could replace part of memory
   103) or as a data signal   (for example, by transmitting it
20 from a server).  Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
25 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.   That is a processor may be
30 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
35 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor, for example, an application
   specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable
                                               10335975_1 (GHMatters) P80858.AU.4 5/06/18

   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
 5 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
10 For example, the jackpot game controller 150 is shown in
   Figure 1 as a separate entity to the gaming devices 10. In
   an alternative embodiment, it could be provided by one of
   the gaming devices incorporating a server module arranged
   to implement the jackpot game controller in the manner
15 described in Australian patent application 2008205413
   filed 13 August 2008.
