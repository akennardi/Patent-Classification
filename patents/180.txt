    RANDOM ACCESS RESPONSE METHOD, BASE STATION,
                                   AND TERMINAL
   [0001]       The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
   Application No. 2014387275, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
 5 reference.
                                    TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0002]       The present invention relates to the wireless communications field, and in
   particular, to a random access response method, a base station, and a terminal.
                                       BACKGROUND
10 [0003]       In a wireless communications system, a terminal (User Equipment, UE)
   needs to establish a connection to a network, and this procedure is referred to as a
   random access procedure. In a Long Term Evolution (LTE) or Long Term Evolution
   Advanced (LTE-A) system, the random access procedure is classified into a
   contention-based random access procedure and a non-contention based random access
15 procedure. Two contention-based random access procedures include four steps shown
   in FIG. 1, and the non-contention based random access procedure includes only the
   first two steps. For detailed descriptions about FIG. 1, reference may be made to a
   preface part of the description of embodiments, which is not described herein.
   [0004]       When the LTE or LTE-A system supports a machine type communication
20 (MTC) service, network coverage of LTE or LTE-A needs to be enhanced, that is,
   information on an LTE or LTE-A network needs to be sent in an enhanced manner. In
   the prior art, a method for sending, in an enhanced manner, a random access preamble
   carried by a physical random access channel (PRACH) is repeatedly sending the
   random access preamble. For related descriptions, reference may be made to the
25 preface part of the description of embodiments, which is not described herein. It can
   be learned from analysis that, during scrambling on physical downlink control

   channels (PDCCH) at different repetition levels, a same random access radio network
   temporary identifier (RA-RNTI) may be used to calculate scrambling code sequences,
   where the scrambling on the PDCCHs refers to scrambling cyclic redundancy check
   (CRC) of downlink control information (DCI) carried by the PDCCHs. In this way,
 5 when the UE detects the PDCCHs, if a base station sends, in one subframe, downlink
   control information (DCI) carried by the PDCCHs at different repetition levels and
   uses a same RA-RNTI when calculating scrambling code sequences for the PDCCHs
   at different repetition levels, the UE cannot distinguish the PDCCHs at different
   repetition levels. When detecting the PDCCHs, the UE may consider a PDCCH at
10 another repetition level as a PDCCH of the UE and successfully detect the PDCCH,
   and further detect a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) that carries a random
   access response (RAR) and is scheduled by using DCI carried by the PDCCH, which
   may cause the following problems:
   [0005]      A first problem is RAR missed detection. That is, a PRACH resource set
15 corresponding to the PDCCH at the another repetition level does not include a
   PRACH resource used when the UE sends the random access preamble. Therefore,
   when detecting the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI carried by the PDCCH, the
   UE cannot find a Media Access Control (MAC) subheader including a random access
   preamble index (RAPID) of the random access preamble sent by the UE, and
20 consequently considers that no RAR is received, which causes RAR missed detection,
   requires the random access preamble to be sent again, and causes power waste of the
   UE.
   [0006]      A second problem is an RAR false alarm. If the base station does not send
   the RAR to the UE, when time division multiplexing/frequency division multiplexing
25 (TDM/FDM) is used for random access preambles at different PRACH repetition
   levels, because a same code resource may be used for different PRACH repetition
   levels, and the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI carried by the PDCCH at the
   another repetition level may carry the MAC subheader including the PAPID of the
   random access preamble sent by the UE, the UE mistakenly considers, when detecting
30 the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI carried by the PDCCH, that the UE has
   detected the RAR, and executes a subsequent procedure for random access, which
   also causes power waste of the UE.
                                             2

   of the level information or the resource information included in the information that is
   carried by the PDSCH and that is received by the information receiving module.

   [0085]      The embodiments of the present invention provide a random access
20 response method, a base station, and a terminal, where the method includes: receiving,
   by the base station, a random access preamble sent in an enhanced manner;
   determining at least one of level information or resource information corresponding to
   the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, where the level information
   includes at least one of a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement
25 level index, a repetition level, a repetition level index, a repetition count, a resource
   level, a resource level index, a resource set level, a resource set level index, a resource
   set index, a time resource set index, a frequency resource set index, a preamble index,
   a preamble group index, or a channel quality characterization parameter, and the
   resource information includes at least one of a time-frequency resource index, a
30 resource index, a random access opportunity index, a physical random access channel
   PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint index, a time resource index, a
   frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of the first subframe in which a
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located, where a quantity of values
   of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the
                                                32

   random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater than 6; and sending a
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is carried by
   a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH. Based on the foregoing solutions
 5 provided in the embodiments of the present invention, after receiving the random
   access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, the base station further determines the
   at least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
   random access preamble, so as to send, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, the RAR corresponding to the random access
10 preamble. Therefore, the following problem is avoided so that power waste of a UE is
   reduced: When the base station sends, in one subframe, DCI carried by PDCCHs at
   different repetition levels, and schedules, by using the DCI, a PDSCH that carries an
   RAR, RAR missed detection or an RAR false alarm occurs because the UE cannot
   distinguish the PDCCHs at different repetition levels.

                           DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   [0109]      The following clearly and completely describes the technical solutions in
   the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying
   drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Apparently, the described
 5 embodiments are merely some but not all of the embodiments of the present
   invention. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art
   based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall
   within the protection scope of the present invention.
   [0110]      FIG. 1 is a schematic flowchart of a random access procedure in an LTE or
10 LTE-A system according to the prior art. The random access procedure specifically
   includes the following steps:
   [0111]      101. Message 1: A UE sends a random access preamble to a base station
   by using a PRACH.
   [0112]      The random access preamble is one of multiple preamble formats, and
15 each preamble format includes two parts: a cyclic prefix and a sequence. The PRACH
   occupies 1.08 MHZ in a frequency domain, that is, six physical resource blocks
   (PRB).
   [0113]      The UE sends the random access preamble on a predefined time resource
   and frequency resource. There are a total of 64 random access preambles in one cell.
20 Among the 64 random access preambles, some dedicated random access preambles
   are reserved for non-contention based random access, and remaining random access
   preambles are used for contention-based random access.
   [0114]      For the contention-based random access, the UE randomly selects a
   random access preamble from a set of contention-based random access preambles and
25 sends the random access preamble. Therefore, there is a possibility that multiple UEs
   simultaneously select a same random access preamble, which requires a subsequent
   contention solution. For the non-contention based random access, the base station
   configures a dedicated random access preamble by using dedicated signaling, and the
   UE performs random access by using the dedicated random access preamble.
                                               35

   [0115]      102. Message 2: The base station replies to the UE with an RAR.
   [0116]      After sending the random access preamble, the UE detects a PDCCH in
   each subframe within a random access response window. DCI carried by the PDCCH
   is used for scheduling a PDSCH, and the RAR is carried by the PDSCH. To identify
 5 that the RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI that is carried by the
   PDCCH is a reply for a random access preamble sent on which time resource and
   frequency resource, the base station calculates a scrambling code sequence by using
   an RA-RNTI, and scrambles the PDCCH, where the scrambling the PDCCH refers to
   scrambling cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the DCI carried by the PDCCH, and
10 the RA-RNTI is obtained by the base station with reference to a formula (1) according
   to the PRACH carrying the detected random access preamble:
               RA-RNTI=1+tid+10*fid formula (1)
               where tid represents a sequence number of the first subframe in which the
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble detected by the base station is located
15 and O<t id<10, and f id represents a second PRACH index of the first subframe in
   which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located and 0 f_id<6. It
   can be learned from the formula (1) that, if different UEs send random access
   preambles by using a same time resource and frequency resource, RA-RNTIs are the
   same, and corresponding PDSCHs carrying RARs are scheduled by using DCI of a
20 same PDCCH, where the RARs are transmitted on a same PDSCH.
   [0117]      The UE obtains an RA-RNTI with reference to the formula (1) according
   to the PRACH carrying the random access preamble sent by the UE. After detecting a
   PDCCH scrambled by using a scrambling code sequence obtained by calculation by
   using the RA-RNTI, the UE continues to detect a PDSCH scheduled by using DCI
25 carried by the PDCCH, and the UE searches a MAC header         part of a MAC protocol
   data unit (PDU) carried by the PDSCH for a MAC subheader           including a random
   access preamble index (RAPID) of the random access preamble selected by the UE,
   where the RAPID is used to indicate the random access preamble detected by the base
   station, and includes six bits, which are used to indicate 64 preambles. If the MAC
30 subheader is included, it indicates that the MAC PDU includes an RAR with respect
   to the UE. If the UE does not receive the RAR with respect to the UE within the
                                               36

   random access response window, the UE retransmits the random access preamble, and
   when a particular quantity of retransmissions is reached, random access fails. The
   RAR further includes information such as a timing alignment instruction, an initial
   uplink resource (UL grant) allowed to be transmitted for a message 3, and a temporary
 5 cell radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI).
   [0118]       103. Message 3: The UE sends a message 3 in a random access procedure
   to the base station by using a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH).
   [0119]       After successfully receiving the RAR for the UE within the random access
   response window, the UE transmits, in a determined subframe after receiving the
10 RAR, the message 3, such as a radio resource control (RRC) connection request, a
   tracking area update request, or a scheduling request, in the random access procedure
   to the base station by using the PUSCH. The message 3 is scrambled according to the
   temporary C-RNTI included in the RAR, and includes a UE identity in a local cell,
   where the UE identity is used for contention resolution.
15 [0120]       As described in step 101, in a contention-based random access procedure,
   there is a case in which multiple UEs simultaneously send a same preamble. In this
   case, different UEs receive a same RAR, obtain a same temporary C-RNTI, and
   consequently send the message 3 on a same time resource and frequency resource
   according to the same temporary C-RNTI, which causes a transmission collision of
20 the message 3. If the base station cannot successfully decode the message 3, the UE
   needs to retransmit the message 3, and when a maximum quantity of retransmissions
   is reached, the UE starts a new random access procedure. If the base station can
   successfully decode the message 3, step 104 is performed.
   [0121]       104. Message 4: The base station replies to the UE with a contention
25 resolution message.
   [0122]       If the UE receives a contention resolution message that is scrambled
   according to the UE identity in the local cell or that includes the UE identity in the
   local cell, random access is considered successful; otherwise, when a timer expires,
   current random access is considered failed.
30 [0123]       As described in the background, when the LTE or LTE-A system supports
                                                37

   an MTC service, network coverage of LTE or LTE-A needs to be enhanced. For
   example, coverage enhancement of additional 20 dB or 15 dB is performed on the
   basis of existing network coverage of LTE or LTE-A, so as to ensure that a UE that is
   located in a basement or whose channel quality is poor can reliably communicate with
 5 the base station. When coverage enhancement is performed for an LTE or LTE-A
   network, information on the LTE or LTE-A network needs to be sent in an enhanced
   manner.
   [0124]      In the prior art, a method for sending, in an enhanced manner, a random
   access preamble carried by a PRACH is repeatedly sending the random access
10 preamble. In the method, there are multiple PRACH repetition levels for repetition of
   the random access preamble, for example, three PRACH repetition levels, where the
   repetition levels are separately 1, 2, and 3, and preamble repetition counts included in
   different PRACH repetition levels may be the same or different. For each PRACH
   repetition level, a system pre-configures a PRACH resource set or a UE is notified of
15 a PRACH resource set by using signaling, where the PRACH resource set includes
   one or more PRACH resources, and each PRACH resource includes a code resource
   (random access preamble), a time resource, and a frequency resource that are used for
   sending the random access preamble. When sending the random access preamble in
   the enhanced manner, the UE uses a PRACH repetition level, and repeatedly sends,
20 according to a preamble repetition count included in the repetition level, the random
   access preamble on a PRACH resource included in a PRACH resource set.
   [0125]      Because different PRACH resource sets are used for random access
   preambles at different PRACH repetition levels, at least one of three manners, that is,
   code division multiplexing (CDM), TDM, and FDM, can be used for resource
25 multiplexing. In a CDM manner, PRACH resource sets used for different PRACH
   repetition levels include different code resources. In a TDM manner, PRACH resource
   sets used for different PRACH repetition levels include different time resources. In an
   FDM manner, PRACH resource sets used for different PRACH repetition levels
   include different frequency resources.
30 [0126]      The base station detects the random access preamble sent by the UE in the
                                                38

   enhanced manner, and sends, according to the detected random access preamble, DCI
   carried by a PDCCH and an RAR carried by a PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI.
   The PDCCH and the PDSCH are also sent in the enhanced manner of repeatedly
   sending and by using different repetition counts, and there are multiple PDCCH
 5 repetition levels and PDSCH repetition levels. The PDCCH repetition level and the
   PDSCH repetition level have a correspondence with the PRACH resource set.
   According to a PRACH resource set in which a PRACH resource used for the
   detected random access preamble is located, the base station repeatedly sends the
   PDCCH and the PDSCH by using a PDCCH repetition level and a PDSCH repetition
10 level that are corresponding to the PRACH resource set.
   [0127]      However, during sending and receiving, by using the multiple PDCCH
   repetition levels and PDSCH repetition levels, of the DCI carried by the PDCCH and
   the RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI, an RA-RNTI calculation
   manner described in the formula (1) has the following problems:
15 [0128]      In a case of CDM, although different random access preambles are used
   for different PRACH repetition levels, sequence numbers of the first subframes in
   which PRACHs carrying random access preambles are located may be the same, that
   is, tid is the same, and second PRACH indexes of the first subframes in which the
   PRACHs carrying the random access preambles are located may also be the same,
20 that is, fid is the same. Therefore, during scrambling on PDCCHs at different
   repetition levels, a same RA-RNTI may be used to calculate scrambling code
   sequences, and the PDCCHs at different repetition levels may be sent and received in
   a same subframe.
   [0129]      In a case of TDM, although different time resources are used for different
25 PRACH repetition levels, sequence numbers of the first subframes in which PRACHs
   carrying random access preambles are located may be the same, that is, tid is the
   same, and second PRACH indexes of the first subframes in which the PRACHs
   carrying the random access preambles are located may also be the same, that is, fid
   is the same. Therefore, during scrambling on PDCCHs at different repetition levels, a
30 same RA-RNTI may be used to calculate scrambling code sequences, and the
                                             39

   PDCCHs at different repetition levels may be sent and received in a same subframe.
   [0130]     In a case of FDM, although different frequency resources are used for
   different PRACH repetition levels, sequence numbers of the first subframes in which
   PRACHs carrying random access preambles are located may be the same, that is, tid
 5 is the same. In addition, during existing RA-RNTI calculation, O<f_id<6. When a
   quantity of PRACH frequency resources of the first subframes in which the PRACHs
   carrying the random access preambles are located is greater than 6, an existing second
   PRACH index fid cannot be used to distinguish frequency resources used for the
   PRACH repetition levels. Therefore, during scrambling on PDCCHs at different
10 repetition levels, a same RA-RNTI may be used to calculate scrambling code
   sequences, and the PDCCHs at different repetition levels may be sent and received in
   a same subframe.
                                        Embodiment 1
   [0131]     This embodiment of the present invention provides a random access
15 response method. The method is applied to a base station in an LTE or LTE-A system,
   and specifically, as shown in FIG. 2, includes the following steps:
   [0132]     201. The base station receives a random access preamble sent in an
   enhanced manner.
   [0133]     Specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, in a random access procedure in the LTE
20 or LTE-A system, a UE sends the random access preamble to the base station in the
   enhanced manner by using a PRACH, and in this case, the base station receives the
   random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner.
   [0134]     202. The base station determines at least one of level information or
   resource information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
25 enhanced manner.
   [0135]     The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
   enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
                                               40

   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
   time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
 5 a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
10 than 6.
   [0136]      Specifically, the foregoing level information may reflect a channel quality
   status between a UE and the base station. Level information corresponding to the
   random access preamble detected by the base station varies with the channel quality
   status between the UE and the base station.
15 [0137]      Exemplarily, there may be multiple PRACH repetition levels for repetition
   of the random access preamble, for example, PRACH repetition levels 1, 2, and 3. A
   repetition level corresponding to the random access preamble detected by the base
   station varies with the channel quality status between the UE and the base station.
   Each PRACH repetition level includes one or more repetition counts. If the UE
20 determines a repetition level, the UE repeatedly sends the random access preamble
   according to a repetition count included in the repetition level. Index numbering may
   be performed on the multiple repetition levels to obtain repetition level indexes. For
   example, for the foregoing three repetition levels, repetition level indexes are 0, 1, and
   2. Another manner may be that there are multiple levels or multiple enhancement
25 levels for PRACH enhanced sending, where index numbering is performed on the
   multiple levels to obtain level indexes, and index numbering is performed on the
   multiple enhancement levels to obtain enhancement level indexes. Therefore, the level
   information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced
   manner may be at least one of the level, the level index, the enhancement level, the
30 enhancement level index, the repetition level, the repetition level index, or the
                                               41

   repetition count.
   [0138]      Exemplarily, for a repetition level corresponding to each random access
   preamble sent in the enhanced manner, the system may pre-configure a resource set
   used for sending the random access preamble in the enhanced manner or the UE is
 5 notified, by using signaling, of a resource set used for sending the random access
   preamble in the enhanced manner. For different repetition levels, resource sets used
   for sending random access preambles in the enhanced manner are different. The
   resource set includes one or more resources used for sending the random access
   preamble in the enhanced manner. The resource includes a code resource (random
10 access preamble), a time resource, and a frequency resource that are used for sending
   the random access preamble in the enhanced manner. When sending the random
   access preamble in the enhanced manner, the UE repeatedly sends the random access
   preamble according to a repetition count at a repetition level and on a resource
   included in a resource set used for sending the random access preamble in the
15 enhanced manner. The resource set used for sending the random access preamble in
   the enhanced manner may be referred to as a resource set level, and one or more
   resources included in a resource set may be collectively referred to as a resource level.
   Index numbering is separately performed on the resource set, the resource set level,
   and the resource level to obtain a resource set index, a resource set level index, and a
20 resource level index. Therefore, the level information corresponding to the random
   access preamble sent in the enhanced manner may further be at least one of the
   resource level, the resource level index, the resource set level, the resource set level
   index, or the resource set index.
   [0139]      Exemplarily, when time resource sets used for sending random access
25 preambles at different repetition levels in the enhanced manner are different, the level
   information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced
   manner may be the time resource set index. When frequency resource sets used for
   sending random access preambles at different repetition levels in the enhanced
   manner are different, the level information corresponding to the random access
30 preamble sent in the enhanced manner may be the frequency resource set index. In
                                               42

   addition, random access preambles may further be grouped into multiple preamble
   groups. In this case, the level information corresponding to the random access
   preamble sent in the enhanced manner may be the preamble group index, that is, the
   preamble group index is used to indicate a preamble group, and random access
 5 preambles in different preamble groups are used for different PRACH repetition
   levels; alternatively, the level information corresponding to the random access
   preamble sent in the enhanced manner may be the preamble index.
   [0140]      Exemplarily, the level information corresponding to the random access
   preamble sent in the enhanced manner may further be the channel quality
10 characterization parameter. In the system or on a network, a coverage enhancement
   value, a path loss, a reference signal received power (RSRP), a reference signal
   received quality (RSRQ), and a channel quality indicator (CQI) that are between the
   UE and the base station may be divided into multiple ranges in advance, and a range
   index is used for representation. The channel quality characterization parameter may
15 include at least one of the following parameters: the coverage enhancement value, a
   coverage enhancement range index, the path loss, a path loss range index, the RSRP,
   an RSRP range index, the RSRQ, an RSRQ range index, the CQI, or a CQI range
   index.
   [0141]      It should be noted that the coverage enhancement value may be a value of
20 coverage enhancement required by a channel (coverage restricted channel or
   bottlenecked channel) having smallest coverage, or may be a value of coverage
   enhancement required by a channel, such as a value of coverage enhancement
   required by a PRACH. The coverage enhancement range index is used to indicate a
   range within which the coverage enhancement value falls, or may be used to indicate
25 whether information carried by one or more channels needs to be sent in the enhanced
   manner. For example, when the information does not need to be sent in the enhanced
   manner, the coverage enhancement range index is 0; when the information needs to be
   sent in the enhanced manner, the coverage enhancement range index is 1. Certainly,
   the channel quality characterization parameter may further include another parameter,
30 which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
                                               43

   [0142]      It should be noted that the foregoing level information is merely some
   possible level information corresponding to the random access preamble. Certainly,
   the random access preamble may also be corresponding to other level information,
   which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
 5 [0143]      Specifically, the foregoing resource information may reflect at least one of
   a time resource or a frequency resource used for sending the random access preamble
   in the enhanced manner.
   [0144]      Exemplarily, the time resource and the frequency resource that are used for
   sending the random access preamble in the enhanced manner may be collectively
10 referred to as a time-frequency resource. In one random access procedure, the UE
   sends a random access preamble in the enhanced manner on one random access
   opportunity. One random access opportunity includes a time-frequency resource used
   for sending the random access preamble in the enhanced manner in one random
   access procedure.
15 [0145]      Within predefined duration, random access opportunities are numbered
   first in ascending order of time and then in ascending order of frequencies to obtain
   random access opportunity indexes. That is, one random access opportunity index
   indicates a time-frequency resource used for sending a random access preamble in the
   enhanced manner in one random access procedure. A schematic diagram of a random
20 access opportunity index is shown in FIG. 23. In other words, the random access
   opportunity index may also be referred to as the time-frequency index, the resource
   index, or the PRACH mask index. It should be noted that the random access
   opportunity indexes may also be obtained by numbering the random access
   opportunities first in ascending order of frequencies and then in ascending order of
25 time, which is not limited in the present invention.
   [0146]      Within predefined duration, startpoints of time resources included in
   random access opportunities are numbered in ascending order of time to obtain time
   resource startpoint indexes, which, in other words, may also be referred to as time
   resource indexes.
30 [0147]      Frequency resources included in random access opportunities in one
                                               44

   subframe are numbered in ascending order of start frequencies of the frequency
   resources to obtain frequency resource indexes, which, in other words, may also be
   referred to as the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the PRACH
   carrying the random access preamble is located.
 5 [0148]      It should be noted that in the prior art, a maximum of six random access
   opportunities exist in one subframe, that is, the random access opportunities in one
   subframe include a maximum of six PRACH frequency resources. Therefore, in the
   formula (1), a quantity of values of a second PRACH index of the first subframe in
   which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive
10 integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 6. In this embodiment of the present
   invention, the frequency resource index and the first index are physical quantities
   different from the second index in the foregoing formula (1). The first index is a
   PRACH index of the first subframe in which the physical random access channel
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located. However, to avoid a case in
15 which when there are more than six PRACH frequency resources in one subframe, the
   existing second index cannot be used to distinguish frequency resources used by
   random access preambles corresponding to all level information, in this embodiment
   of the present invention, the quantity of PRACH indexes of the first subframe in
   which the physical random access channel PRACH carrying the random access
20 preamble is located is a positive integer greater than 6, that is, a quantity of first
   indexes is a positive integer greater than 6, and a quantity of frequency resource
   indexes is a positive integer greater than 6.
   [0149]      Specifically, after receiving the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner, the base station may determine, according to at least one of the
25 received random access preamble, or a time resource or a frequency resource on
   which the random access preamble is located, the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble. Certainly,
   the base station may further store a first correspondence between a random access
   preamble and level information. After receiving the random access preamble, the base
30 station may determine, according to the first correspondence, the level information
                                                45

   corresponding to the random access preamble, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0150]      203. The base station sends a random access response RAR of the random
   access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
 5 information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH.
   [0151]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, after determining
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to
   the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, the base station sends the
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble, where the RAR is
10 carried by the PDSCH, which can be specifically implemented in the following
   manners:
   [0152]      In a possible implementation manner, the sending, by the base station, a
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is carried by
15 a PDSCH may specifically include:
               scrambling, according to the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, CRC of DCI carried by a PDCCH;
               sending the scrambled DCI carried by the PDCCH, where the DCI is used
   for scheduling the PDSCH;
20             scrambling the RAR carried by the PDSCH; and
               sending the scrambled RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0153]      In this implementation manner, the scrambling the RAR carried by the
   PDSCH may be specifically implemented with reference to the formula (1) in an
   existing manner of scrambling the RAR carried by the PDSCH, that is, determining
25 an RA-RNTI in a manner described in the formula (1); determining a scrambling code
   sequence according to the RA-RNTI; and scrambling, by using the scrambling code
   sequence, the RAR carried by the PDSCH. Alternatively, the received RAR carried by
   the PDSCH may be scrambled according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the
30 present invention.
                                              46

   [0154]      In a possible implementation manner, the sending, by the base station, a
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is carried by
   a PDSCH may specifically include:
 5             scrambling, according to the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, the RAR carried by the PDSCH; and
               sending the scrambled RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0155]      In a possible implementation manner, the sending, by the base station, a
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least
10 one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is carried by
   a PDSCH may specifically include:
               determining a resource of a PDCCH according to the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information, where the resource includes at least one
   resource of a time resource or a frequency resource;
15             sending, on the resource, DCI carried by the PDCCH, where the DCI is
   used for scheduling the PDSCH; and
               sending the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0156]      In a possible implementation manner, the sending, by the base station, a
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least
20 one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is carried by
   a PDSCH may specifically include:
               sending DCI carried by a PDCCH, where the DCI includes the at least one
   of the level information or the resource information, and the DCI is used for
   scheduling the PDSCH; and
25             sending the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0157]      In a possible implementation manner, the sending, by the base station, a
   random access response RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is carried by
   a PDSCH may specifically include:
30             sending the RAR carried by the PDSCH, and adding the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information to the PDSCH.
                                              47

   [0158]      Specific implementation procedures of these possible implementation
   manners are described in detail in Embodiment 3, and details are not described herein.
   [0159]      It should be noted that the sending, by the base station, an RAR of the
   random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or the
 5 resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may further have
   another possible implementation manner, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0160]      The random access response method provided in this embodiment of the
   present invention includes: receiving, by a base station, a random access preamble
10 sent in an enhanced manner; determining at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced
   manner, where the level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
   enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
15 a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
   time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
20 index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6; and sending a random access response RAR of the random access preamble
25 according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information,
   where the RAR is carried by a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH. Based on
   the foregoing solutions provided in this embodiment of the present invention, after
   receiving the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, the base station
   further determines the at least one of the level information or the resource information
30 corresponding to the random access preamble, so as to send, according to the at least
                                               48

   one of the level information or the resource information, the RAR corresponding to
   the random access preamble. Therefore, the following problem is avoided so that
   power waste of a UE is reduced: When the base station sends, in one subframe, DCI
   carried by PDCCHs at different repetition levels, and schedules, by using the DCI, a
 5 PDSCH that carries an RAR, RAR missed detection or an RAR false alarm occurs
   because the UE cannot distinguish the PDCCHs at different repetition levels.
                                        Embodiment 2
   [0161]      This embodiment of the present invention provides a random access
   response method. The method is applied to a UE in an LTE or LTE-A system, and
10 specifically, as shown in FIG. 3, includes the following steps:
   [0162]      301. The UE determines a random access preamble to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, and determines at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble.
   [0163]      The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
15 enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
20 time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
25 PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6.
   [0164]      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, in a random access procedure in the LTE
   or LTE-A system, the UE sends the random access preamble to a base station in the
                                               49

   enhanced manner by using the PRACH. In this embodiment of the present invention,
   before sending the random access preamble to the base station in the enhanced
   manner by using the PRACH, the UE first determines the random access preamble,
   and determines the at least one of the level information or the resource information
 5 corresponding to the random access preamble.
   [0165]      The UE may store a first correspondence between a random access
   preamble and level information in advance. When determining the random access
   preamble, the UE determines, according to the first correspondence, the level
   information corresponding to the random access preamble, which is not specifically
10 limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0166]      In addition, when determining at least one of a time resource or a
   frequency resource for sending the random access preamble in the enhanced manner,
   the UE also determines the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present
15 invention.
   [0167]      It should be noted that a sequence in which the UE determines the random
   access preamble and determines the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information corresponding to the random access preamble is not specifically
   limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
20 [0168]      For related descriptions about the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information and the channel quality characterization parameter, reference
   may be made to descriptions in step 201 in Embodiment 1, and details are not
   described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0169]      For a difference between the first PRACH index of the first subframe in
25 which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located and a second
   PRACH index, in a formula (1), of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying
   the random access preamble is located, reference may be made to descriptions in step
   201 in Embodiment 1, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the
   present invention.
30 [0170]      302. The UE sends the random access preamble in the enhanced manner.
                                               50

   [0171]       Specifically, after determining the random access preamble to be sent in
   the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information corresponding to the random access preamble, the UE may send
   the random access preamble to the base station in the enhanced manner by using the
 5 PRACH, which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0172]       303. The UE receives an RAR of the random access preamble according to
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information, where the RAR is
   carried by a PDSCH.
   [0173]       Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, after sending the
10 random access preamble in the enhanced manner, the UE further receives the RAR of
   the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, where the RAR is carried by the PDSCH, which can be
   specifically implemented in the following manners:
   [0174]       In a possible implementation manner, the receiving, by the UE, an RAR of
15 the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may specifically
   include:
                receiving the RAR carried by the PDSCH; and
                descrambling, according to the at least one of the level information or the
20 resource information, the received RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0175]       In a possible implementation manner, the receiving, by the UE, an RAR of
   the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may specifically
   include:
25              receiving DCI carried by a PDCCH, where the DCI is used for scheduling
   the PDSCH;
                descrambling, according to the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, CRC of the received DCI carried by the PDCCH;
                receiving, according to scheduling of the DCI, the RAR carried by the
30 PDSCH; and
                descrambling the received RAR carried by the PDSCH.
                                                51

   [0176]      In this implementation manner, the descrambling the RAR carried by the
   PDSCH may be specifically implemented with reference to the formula (1) in an
   existing manner of descrambling the RAR carried by the PDSCH, that is, determining
   an RA-RNTI in a manner described in the formula (1); determining a scrambling code
 5 sequence according to the RA-RNTI; and descrambling, by using the scrambling code
   sequence, the RAR carried by the PDSCH. Alternatively, the received RAR carried by
   the PDSCH may be descrambled according to the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information, which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of
   the present invention.
10 [0177]      In a possible implementation manner, the receiving, by the UE, an RAR of
   the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may specifically
   include:
               determining a resource of a PDCCH according to the at least one of the
15 level information or the resource information, where the resource includes at least one
   resource of a time resource or a frequency resource;
               receiving, on the resource, DCI carried by the PDCCH, where the DCI is
   used for scheduling the PDSCH; and
               receiving, according to scheduling of the DCI, the RAR carried by the
20 PDSCH.
   [0178]      In a possible implementation manner, the receiving, by the UE, an RAR of
   the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may specifically
   include:
25             receiving DCI carried by a PDCCH, where the DCI includes the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, and the DCI is used for
   scheduling the PDSCH;
               determining whether the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information included in the received DCI is the same as the at least one of
30 the level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble; and
                                              52

               when the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   included in the received DCI is the same as the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble, receiving the
   RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI.
 5 [0179]      In a possible implementation manner, the receiving, by the UE, an RAR of
   the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may specifically
   include:
               receiving information carried by the PDSCH, where the information
10 carried by the PDSCH includes the RAR and the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information;
               determining the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information included in the information carried by the PDSCH;
               determining whether the at least one of the level information or the
15 resource information included in the information carried by the PDSCH is the same as
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to
   the random access preamble; and
               when the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   included in the information carried by the PDSCH is the same as the at least one of
20 the level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, obtaining the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0180]      Specific implementation procedures of these possible implementation
   manners are described in detail in Embodiment 3, and details are not described herein.
   [0181]      It should be noted that the receiving, by the UE, an RAR of the random
25 access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH may further have another
   possible implementation manner, which is not specifically limited in this embodiment
   of the present invention.
   [0182]      The random access response method provided in this embodiment of the
30 present invention includes: determining, by a UE, a random access preamble to be
   sent in an enhanced manner, and determining at least one of level information or
                                              53

   resource information corresponding to the random access preamble, where the level
   information is at least one of a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an
   enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level index, a repetition count,
   a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level, a resource set level index,
 5 a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency resource set index, a
   preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality characterization
   parameter, and the resource information is at least one of a time-frequency resource
   index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index, a physical random access
   channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint index, a time resource index,
10 a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of the first subframe in which a
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located, where a quantity of values
   of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the
   random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater than 6; sending the
   random access preamble in the enhanced manner; and receiving an RAR of the
15 random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH. Based on the foregoing
   solutions provided in this embodiment of the present invention, when determining the
   random access preamble, the UE further determines the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
20 preamble, so that after sending the random access preamble, the UE can receive,
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, the
   RAR corresponding to the random access preamble. Therefore, the following problem
   is avoided so that power waste of the UE is reduced: When a base station sends, in
   one subframe, DCI carried by PDCCHs at different repetition levels, and schedules,
25 by using the DCI, a PDSCH that carries an RAR, RAR missed detection or an RAR
   false alarm occurs because the UE cannot distinguish the PDCCHs at different

   [0183]      This embodiment of the present invention provides a random access
   response method. The method is applied to an LTE or LTE-A system, and is
   specifically described by using interaction between a UE and a base station as an
 5 example. As shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, the method includes the following steps:
   [0184]      401. The UE determines a random access preamble to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, and determines at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble.
   [0185]      The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
10 enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
15 time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
20 PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6.
   [0186]      Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the UE, the
   random access preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at
   least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
25 random access preamble, reference may be made to descriptions in step 301 in
   Embodiment 2, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [0187]      402. The UE sends the random access preamble in the enhanced manner.
   [0188]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, in a random
                                                55

   access procedure in the LTE or LTE-A system, after determining the random access
   preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the UE may send the random access preamble to the base station in the
 5 enhanced manner by using the PRACH, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0189]     403. The base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0190]     Specifically, after the UE sends the random access preamble in the
10 enhanced manner, the base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0191]     404. The base station determines the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
15 [0192]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the base
   station, the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, reference
   may be made to descriptions in step 202 in Embodiment 1, and details are not
   described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
20 [0193]     405. The base station scrambles, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, CRC of DCI carried by a PDCCH.
   [0194]     Specifically, the scrambling, by the base station according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, CRC of DCI carried by a
   PDCCH may specifically include:
25            determining an RA-RNTI according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information; and
              determining a scrambling code sequence according to the RA-RNTI, and
   scrambling, by using the scrambling code sequence, the CRC of the DCI carried by
   the PDCCH.
30 [0195]     It should be noted that as described in step 102 shown in FIG. 1, to identify
                                              56

   that an RAR carried by a PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI that is carried by the
   PDCCH is a reply for a random access preamble sent on which time resource and
   frequency resource, the base station scrambles the PDCCH by using a scrambling
   code sequence obtained by calculation by using the RA-RNTI. In this embodiment of
 5 the present invention, when determining the RA-RNTI, the base station determines
   the RA-RNTI according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information. In this way, the base station may further identify, by using the scrambling
   code sequence obtained by calculation by using the RA-RNTI, that the RAR carried
   by the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI carried by the PDCCH is a reply for a
10 random access preamble corresponding to which piece of level information or
   resource information. Therefore, during PDCCH detection, the UE does not consider
   a PDCCH at another repetition level as a PDCCH of the UE or successfully detect the
   PDCCH, and further does not detect a PDSCH scheduled by using DCI carried by the
   PDCCH to cause RAR missed detection or an RAR false alarm, thereby reducing
15 power waste of the UE.
   [0196]      It should be noted that when the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information has different values, determined RA-RNTIs are different.
   [0197]      Several methods for determining the RA-RNTI according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information are provided herein, which
20 are as follows:
   [0198]      Example 1:
   [0199]      The determining the RA-RNTI according to the level information may
   include:
               determining the RA-RNTI according to the level information and a first
25 formula, where the first formula may be shown as a formula (2):
               RA-RNTI=M+t id+10*f id              formula (2)
               where M is determined according to the level information, t id represents
   a sequence number of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random
   access preamble is located and 0st_id<10, and fid represents a second PRACH index
30 of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is
   located and O<f id<6.
                                               57

   [0200]      In the formula (2), when being sent on multiple different random access
   opportunities, random access preambles corresponding to same level information may
   have same tid and fid, and therefore, RA-RNTIs obtained by calculation are also
   the same. When performing random access response for the random access preambles
 5 that are corresponding to the same level information and that are sent on the multiple
   different random access opportunities, the base station may send, in one subframe,
   multiple pieces of DCI carried by PDCCHs, where the multiple pieces of DCI are
   separately used for scheduling PDSCHs carrying RARs of the random access
   preambles that are corresponding to the same level information and that are sent on
10 the multiple random access opportunities. When scrambling CRC of the multiple
   pieces of DCI, the base station may use a same RA-RNTI to calculate scrambling
   code sequences. In this way, during PDCCH detection, the UE cannot identify, in the
   subframe, that an RAR carried by a PDSCH scheduled by using DCI that is carried by
   a PDCCH is a reply for a random access preamble sent on which random access
15 opportunity. Consequently, an RAR false alarm or RAR missed detection is caused.
   [0201]      Therefore, Example 1 further includes: time resources included in multiple
   random access opportunities of random access preambles corresponding to same level
   information do not overlap. In addition, when the base station performs random
   access response for a random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner on a
20 random access opportunity, there is a fixed time offset between a start time of sending
   DCI used for scheduling the RAR and an end time of the random access opportunity.
   Therefore, the base station does not simultaneously send, in one subframe, multiple
   pieces of DCI used for scheduling RARs for random access preambles that are
   corresponding to same level information and that are sent on multiple random access
25 opportunities, thereby avoiding an RAR false alarm or RAR missed detection caused
   due to that the UE cannot distinguish the multiple pieces of DCI, and reducing power
   waste of the UE.
   [0202]      Example 2:
   [0203]      The determining the RA-RNTI according to the level information and the
30 resource information may include:
                                              58

               determining the RA-RNTI according to the level information, the resource
   information, and a second formula, where the second formula may be shown as a
   formula (3)/formula (4)/formula (5)/formula (6):
               RA-RNTI=M+tfid                       formula (3)
 5             RA-RNTI=M+tid+10*fid'                formula (4)
               RA-RNTI=M+t id'+T*fid                formula (5)
               RA-RNTI=M+t id'+T*f id'              formula (6)
               where M is determined according to the level information, t id represents
   a sequence number of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random
10 access preamble is located and O<t id<10, f id represents a second PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is
   located and Osf_id<6, tfid represents at least one of the time-frequency resource
   index, the resource index, the random access opportunity index, or the PRACH mask
   index, tid' represents the time resource startpoint index or the time resource index,
15 f id' represents the frequency resource index or the first PRACH index of the first
   subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located and
   Osf_id'<n, where n represents a quantity of values of f_id' and n>6, and T represents a
   quantity of values of tid'.
   [0204]      The resource information is at least one of tf id, t id', or f id'. For related
20 descriptions about tfid, tid', and fid', reference may be made to descriptions in step
   201 in Embodiment 1, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the
   present invention.
   [0205]      It should be noted that in the second formula, when being sent on multiple
   different random access opportunities, random access preambles corresponding to
25 same level information have at least one of tfid, tid', or fid' that is different, and
   therefore, RA-RNTIs obtained by calculation are also different.
   [0206]      It should be noted that in Example 2, the resource information is obtained
   by separately performing index numbering on random access opportunities used for
   sending random access preambles corresponding to each piece of level information.
30 For example, the resource information is obtained by numbering, from 0, the random
   access opportunities used for sending the preambles corresponding to each piece of
   level information. During the numbering, level information corresponding to a
                                               59

   random access preamble sent on a random access opportunity needs to be determined,
   and only random access opportunities corresponding to same level information are
   numbered. Index numbers of random access opportunities corresponding to different
   level information do not have a relationship. When first level information
 5 corresponding to a first random access preamble is different from second level
   information corresponding to a second random access preamble, some or all values of
   first resource information corresponding to the first random access preamble and
   second resource information corresponding to the second random access preamble are
   the same.
10 [0207]      Further, it can be learned from Example 1 and Example 2 that, if the
   PDCCH needs to be scrambled by using the scrambling code sequence obtained by
   calculation by using the RA-RNTI so as to identify that the RAR carried by the
   PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI carried by the PDCCH is a reply for a random
   access preamble corresponding to which piece of level information, M needs to be
15 determined according to the level information during calculation of the RA-RNTI.
   [0208]      In a possible implementation manner, that M is determined according to
   the level information may specifically include:
               M=X*L+Y, where
               L represents the level information, and X and Y are constant positive
20 integers.
   [0209]      For example, for the level information corresponding to the random access
   preamble sent in the enhanced manner, when a smallest value of L is 0, Y is fixed at
   61, and X is fixed at 60.
   [0210]      In another possible implementation manner, that M is determined
25 according to the level information may specifically include:
               when the level information is lowest level information corresponding to
   the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, M=61; or when the level
   information is not lowest level information corresponding to the random access
   preamble sent in the enhanced manner, M is equal to 1 plus a maximum value of an
30 RA-RNTI determined according to level information that is one piece of level
   information lower than the level information, where the lowest level information is
                                               60

   level information that has a smallest value and that is corresponding to the random
   access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, and the level information that is one
   piece of level information lower than the level information refers to level information
   that has a largest value among level information whose value is less than a value of
 5 the level information.
   [0211]      Example 3:
   [0212]      The determining the RA-RNTI according to the resource information may
   include:
               determining the RA-RNTI according to the resource information and a
10 third formula, where the third formula may be shown as a formula (7)/formula
   (8)/formula (9)/formula (10):
               RA-RNTI=N+tfid                       formula (7)
               RA-RNTI=N+tid+10*fid'                formula (8)
               RA-RNTI=N+t id'+T*fid                formula (9)
15             RA-RNTI=N+t id'+T*f id'              formula (10)
               where N is a constant positive integer, for example, N is fixed at 61, tid
   represents a sequence number of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the
   random access preamble is located and O<t id<10, f id represents a second PRACH
   index of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble
20 is located and O<f id<6, tfid represents at least one of the time-frequency resource
   index, the resource index, the random access opportunity index, or the PRACH mask
   index, tid' represents the time resource startpoint index or the time resource index,
   f id' represents the frequency resource index or the first PRACH index of the first
   subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located and
25 O<f_id'<n, where n represents a quantity of values of f id' and n>6, and T represents a
   quantity of values of tid'.
   [0213]      The resource information is at least one of tf id, t id', or f id'. For related
   descriptions about tfid, tid', and fid', reference may be made to descriptions in step
   201 in Embodiment 1, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the
30 present invention.
   [0214]      It should be noted that in the third formula, when being sent on multiple
   different random access opportunities, random access preambles corresponding to
                                              61

   same level information have at least one of tfid, tid', or f id' that is different, and
   therefore, RA-RNTIs obtained by calculation are also different.
   [0215]      It should be noted that in Example 3, the resource information is obtained
   by performing index numbering on all random access opportunities used for sending
 5 random access preambles corresponding to all level information. During the
   numbering, level information corresponding to a random access preamble sent on a
   random access opportunity does not need to be determined, and all the random access
   opportunities are numbered. When first level information corresponding to a first
   random access preamble is different from second level information corresponding to a
10 second    random     access preamble,    all values    of first resource   information
   corresponding to the first random access preamble and second resource information
   corresponding to the second random access preamble are different. Therefore, by
   determining the RA-RNTI according to the resource information, calculating the
   scrambling code sequence by using the RA-RNTI, and scrambling the PDCCH, it can
15 be identified that the RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI that is
   carried by the PDCCH is a reply for a random access preamble corresponding to
   which piece of level information or resource information.
   [0216]      It should be noted that values of X, Y, and N in the foregoing formula (2)
   to formula (10) are merely exemplary numeric values, and the values of X, Y, and N
20 are not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0217]      It should be noted that T in the foregoing formula (2) to formula (10)
   represents the quantity of values of tid'. For example, when a quantity of time
   resource startpoint indexes or time resource indexes is 20, T=20, and a value of T is
   not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
25 [0218]      It should be noted that the RA-RNTI determined according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information may still be represented by
   using an existing RA-RNTI, and in this case, a value range of the RA-RNTI needs to
   be expanded. For example, the value range of the RA-RNTI is 0001-abcd, where
   abcd represents a hexadecimal number, and a value of abcd is greater than 003C.
30 Alternatively, a new representation method is defined for the RA-RNTI determined
                                               62

   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information. For
   example, an enhanced RA-RNTI (eRA-RNTI) is used for representation, where a
   value range of the eRA-RNTI is 003D-FFF3, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
 5 [0219]      406. The base station sends the scrambled DCI carried by the PDCCH,
   where the DCI is used for scheduling the PDSCH.
   [0220]      Specifically, after scrambling, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, the CRC of the DCI carried by the PDCCH,
   the base station sends the scrambled DCI carried by the PDCCH, where the DCI is
10 used for scheduling the PDSCH.
   [0221]      407. The base station scrambles, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, an RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0222]      Specifically, after the base station sends the scrambled DCI carried by the
   PDCCH, the base station scrambles, according to the at least one of the level
15 information or the resource information, the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0223]      Specifically, the scrambling, by the base station according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, an RAR carried by the
   PDSCH may specifically include:
               determining an RA-RNTI according to the at least one of the level
20 information or the resource information; and
               determining a scrambling code sequence according to the RA-RNTI, and
   scrambling, by using the scrambling code sequence, the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0224]      For a method for determining the RA-RNTI according to the at least one
   of the level information or the resource information, reference may be made to
25 descriptions in step 405, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of
   the present invention.
   [0225]      408. The base station sends the scrambled RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0226]      Specifically, after scrambling, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, the RAR carried by the PDSCH, the base
30 station further sends the scrambled RAR carried by the PDSCH.
                                                 63

   [0227]       409. The UE receives the DCI carried by the PDCCH.
   [0228]       Specifically, after the base station sends the scrambled DCI carried by the
   PDCCH, the UE receives the DCI carried by the PDCCH.
   [0229]       410. The UE descrambles, according to the at least one of the level
 5 information or the resource information, the CRC of the received DCI carried by the
   PDCCH.
   [0230]       Specifically, after receiving the DCI carried by the PDCCH, the UE
   descrambles, according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information, the CRC of the received DCI carried by the PDCCH, where the
10 descrambling, by the UE according to the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, the CRC of the received DCI carried by the PDCCH may
   specifically include:
                determining an RA-RNTI according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information; and
15              determining a scrambling code sequence according to the RA-RNTI, and
   descrambling, by using the scrambling code sequence, the CRC of the DCI carried by
   the PDCCH.
   [0231]       For a method in which the UE determines the RA-RNTI according to the
   at least one of the level information or the resource information, reference may be
20 made to the method, in step 405, in which the base station determines the RA-RNTI
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, and
   details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0232]       It should be noted that similar to that the base station scrambles, according
   to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, the CRC of the
25 DCI carried by the PDCCH, in this embodiment of the present invention, when
   determining the RA-RNTI, the UE determines the RA-RNTI according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information. Therefore, during PDCCH
   detection, the UE descrambles, by using the scrambling code sequence obtained by
   calculation by using the RA-RNTI, the CRC of the received DCI carried by the
30 PDCCH, and can find, with respect to the random access preamble sent in the
                                                  64

   enhanced manner by the UE, the DCI used for scheduling the PDSCH that carries the
   RAR, so that the UE does not consider a PDCCH at another repetition level as a
   PDCCH of the UE or successfully detect the PDCCH, and does not detect a PDSCH
   scheduled by using DCI carried by the PDCCH to cause RAR missed detection or an
 5 RAR false alarm, thereby reducing power waste of the UE.
   [0233]      It should be noted that there is not necessarily a sequence between steps
   407-408 and steps 409-410. Steps 407-408 are actions subsequently performed on a
   base station side after steps 405-406 are performed, and steps 409-410 are actions
   that may be performed on a UE side after steps 405-406 are performed on the base
10 station side. The sequence between steps 407-408 and steps 409-410 is not
   specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0234]      411. The UE receives, according to scheduling of the DCI, the RAR
   carried by the PDSCH.
   [0235]      Specifically, after the base station sends the scrambled RAR carried by the
15 PDSCH, the UE receives, according to the scheduling of the DCI, the RAR carried by
   the PDSCH.
   [0236]      412. The UE descrambles, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, the received RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0237]      Specifically, after receiving the RAR carried by the PDSCH, the UE
20 descrambles, according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information, the received RAR carried by the PDSCH, where the descrambling, by
   the UE according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information, the received RAR carried by the PDSCH may specifically include:
               determining an RA-RNTI according to the at least one of the level
25 information or the resource information; and
               determining a scrambling code sequence according to the RA-RNTI, and
   descrambling, by using the scrambling code sequence, the RAR carried by the
   PDSCH.
   [0238]      For a method in which the UE determines the RA-RNTI according to the
30 at least one of the level information or the resource information, reference may be
                                                 65

   made to the method, in step 405, in which the base station determines the RA-RNTI
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, and
   details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0239]      It should be noted that in this embodiment of the present invention, the
 5 base station may not perform step 407, and the UE may not include step 412. Instead,
   after sending the scrambled DCI carried by the PDCCH, the base station determines
   the RA-RNTI in a manner described in the formula (1), determines the scrambling
   code sequence according to the RA-RNTI, and scrambles, by using the scrambling
   code sequence, the RAR carried by the PDSCH; after receiving the RAR carried by
10 the PDSCH, the UE determines the RA-RNTI in the manner described in the formula
   (1), determines the scrambling code sequence according to the RA-RNTI, and
   scrambles, by using the scrambling code sequence, the RAR carried by the PDSCH,
   which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0240]      Optionally, an embodiment of the present invention further provides a
15 random access response method. The method is applied to an LTE or LTE-A system,
   and is specifically described by using interaction between a UE and a base station as
   an example. As shown in FIG. 5, the method includes the following steps:
   [0241]      501. The UE determines a random access preamble to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, and determines at least one of level information or resource
20 information corresponding to the random access preamble.
   [0242]      The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
   enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
25 resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
   time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
30 the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
                                               66

   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6.
   [0243]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the UE, the
 5 random access preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at
   least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
   random access preamble, reference may be made to descriptions in step 301 in
   Embodiment 2, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
10 [0244]     502. The UE sends the random access preamble in the enhanced manner.
   [0245]     Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, in a random
   access procedure in the LTE or LTE-A system, after determining the random access
   preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
15 preamble, the UE may send the random access preamble to the base station in the
   enhanced manner by using the PRACH, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0246]     503. The base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
20 [0247]     Specifically, after the UE sends the random access preamble in the
   enhanced manner, the base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0248]     504. The base station determines the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
25 enhanced manner.
   [0249]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the base
   station, the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, reference
   may be made to descriptions in step 202 in Embodiment 1, and details are not
30 described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
                                               67

   [0250]      505. The base station scrambles, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, an RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0251]      Specifically, for a method in which the base station scrambles, according
   to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, the RAR
 5 carried by the PDSCH, reference may be made to descriptions in step 407 in the
   embodiment shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, and details are not described herein in
   this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0252]      506. The base station sends the scrambled RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0253]      507. The UE receives the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
10 [0254]      508. The UE descrambles, according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information, the received RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0255]      Specifically, for a method in which the UE descrambles, according to the
   at least one of the level information or the resource information, the received RAR
   carried by the PDSCH, reference may be made to descriptions in step 412 in the
15 embodiment shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B, and details are not described herein in
   this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0256]      It should be noted that a difference between the embodiment shown in FIG.
   4A and FIG. 4B and the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 lies only in that the PDSCH in
   the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 does not need to be scheduled by using DCI carried
20 by a PDCCH. Instead, information carried by the PDSCH is sent and received by
   using predefined parameters such as a frequency resource and a modulation and
   coding scheme.
   [0257]      It should be noted that in this embodiment of the present invention,
   because the PDSCH does not need to be scheduled by using the DCI carried by the
25 PDCCH, and the UE does not need to detect the PDCCH, a case in which the UE
   cannot identify that the RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using DCI that is
   carried by a PDCCH is a reply for a random access preamble corresponding to which
   piece of level information or resource information is avoided. In addition, in this
   embodiment of the present invention, the base station determines the RA-RNTI
30 according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, and
                                                68

   scrambles the RAR by using the scrambling code sequence obtained by calculation by
   using the RA-RNTI. Therefore, the UE can identify that the RAR is a reply for a
   random access preamble corresponding to which piece of level information or
   resource information. If same random access preambles are sent in the enhanced
 5 manner by using different level information, and the base station sends, in one
   subframe, RARs replied with respect to the random access preambles corresponding
   to different level information, in the method described in this embodiment of the
   present invention, the UE does not consider an RAR replied with respect to a random
   access preamble corresponding to other level information as an RAR for the UE or
10 successfully detect the RAR to cause an RAR false alarm, thereby reducing power
   waste of the UE.
   [0258]      Optionally, an embodiment of the present invention further provides a
   random access response method. The method is applied to an LTE or LTE-A system,
   and is specifically described by using interaction between a UE and a base station as
15 an example. As shown in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, the method includes the following
   steps:
   [0259]      601. The UE determines a random access preamble to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, and determines at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble.
20 [0260]      The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
   enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
25 characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
   time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
30 where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
                                               69

   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6.
   [0261]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the UE, the
   random access preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at
 5 least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
   random access preamble, reference may be made to descriptions in step 301 in
   Embodiment 2, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [0262]     602. The UE sends the random access preamble in the enhanced manner.
10 [0263]     Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, in a random
   access procedure in the LTE or LTE-A system, after determining the random access
   preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the UE may send the random access preamble to the base station in the
15 enhanced manner by using the PRACH, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0264]     603. The base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0265]     Specifically, after the UE sends the random access preamble in the
20 enhanced manner, the base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0266]     604. The base station determines the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
25 [0267]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the base
   station, the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, reference
   may be made to descriptions in step 202 in Embodiment 1, and details are not
   described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
30 [0268]     605. The base station determines a resource of a PDCCH according to the
                                               70

   at least one of the level information or the resource information, where the resource
   includes at least one resource of a time resource or a frequency resource.
   [0269]       Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, after determining
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to
 5 the random access preamble, the base station determines the resource of the PDCCH
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information.
   [0270]       The resource includes the at least one resource of the time resource or the
   frequency resource.
   [0271]       In a possible implementation manner, if the resource includes the time
10 resource, the determining a resource of a PDCCH according to the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information may include:
                determining, according to the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, at least one of a radio frame or a subframe for sending DCI
   carried by the PDCCH.
15 [0272]       In a possible implementation manner, if the resource includes the
   frequency resource, the determining a resource of a PDCCH according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information may include:
                determining at least one of a PDCCH aggregation level, a PDCCH search
   space, or a PDCCH candidate according to the at least one of the level information or
20 the resource information.
   [0273]       It should be noted that when the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information has different values, determined resources of the PDCCH do not
   overlap or are different.
   [0274]       Exemplarily, when the at least one of the level information or the resource
25 information has different values, the determined at least one of the radio frame or the
   subframe for sending the DCI carried by the PDCCH is different. Assuming that a
   first radio frame and a first subframe for sending the DCI carried by the PDCCH are
   determined according to a first value of the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information, and a second radio frame and a second subframe for sending the
30 DCI carried by the PDCCH are determined according to a second value of the at least
                                                71

   one of the level information or the resource information, where the first value and the
   second value are different values, the first radio frame and the second radio frame
   include one or more radio frames, and the first subframe and the second subframe
   include one or more subframes, at least one radio frame included in the first radio
 5 frame is different from a radio frame included in the second radio frame, and/or at
   least one subframe included in the first subframe is different from a subframe
   included in the second subframe.
   [0275]      Exemplarily, when the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information has different values, determined PDCCH aggregation levels are different.
10 Assuming that the at least one of the level information or the resource information is
   the repetition level index corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner, and there are a total of three repetition level indexes, which are 0,
   1, and 2, the base station determines, according to the repetition level indexes 0, 1,
   and 2, that PDCCH aggregation levels are A, B, and C, where A, B, and C are positive
15 integers different from 4 and 8 and are different from each other. Alternatively, when
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information has different
   values, patterns of determined PDCCH aggregation levels are different. A pattern of
   the aggregation levels includes one or more aggregation levels. When the DCI carried
   by the PDCCH is repeatedly sent in multiple subframes, an aggregation level used for
20 each subframe is successively selected according to an aggregation level included in a
   pattern of the aggregation level. For example, when the pattern of the aggregation
   level is 4,8, the aggregation level used for each of the multiple subframes is
   successively 4,8, 4,8 ... For example, the base station determines, according to the
   repetition level indexes 0, 1, and 2, that the patterns of the PDCCH aggregation levels
25 are respectively 4,4, 4,8, and 8,8.
   [0276]      Exemplarily, when the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information has different values, determined PDCCH search spaces are different.
   Optionally, the determined PDCCH search spaces have different startpoints.
   Assuming that the at least one of the level information or the resource information is
30 the repetition level index corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
                                                72

   enhanced manner, and there are a total of three repetition level indexes, which are 0,
   1, and 2, the base station determines, according to the repetition level indexes 0, 1,
   and 2, that a startpoint Yk of the search spaces may be respectively 16, 32, and 48.
   [0277]      Exemplarily, when the at least one of the level information or the resource
 5 information has different values, determined PDCCH candidates are different, or
   patterns of determined PDCCH candidates are different. A pattern of the candidates
   includes one or more PDCCH candidates. When the DCI carried by the PDCCH is
   repeatedly sent in multiple subframes, a PDCCH candidate used for each subframe is
   successively selected according to a PDCCH candidate included in a pattern of the
10 candidate. For example, when the pattern of the PDCCH candidate is 1,2, the PDCCH
   candidate used for each of the multiple subframes for sending the DCI carried by the
   PDCCH is successively 1,2, 1,2 ... For example, the base station determines,
   according to the repetition level indexes 0, 1, and 2, that the patterns of the
   determined PDCCH candidates are respectively 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4.
15 [0278]      It should be noted that, in addition to the time resource and the frequency
   resource that are enumerated above, another time resource and frequency resource
   may further be included, which is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the
   present invention.
   [0279]      606. The base station sends, on the resource, DCI carried by the PDCCH,
20 where the DCI is used for scheduling the PDSCH.
   [0280]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, after determining
   the resource of the PDCCH according to the at least one of the level information or
   the resource information, the base station sends, on the resource, the DCI carried by
   the PDCCH.
25 [0281]      607. The base station sends an RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0282]      Specifically, after sending, on the resource, the DCI carried by the
   PDCCH, the base station sends the RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using
   the DCI.
   [0283]      608. The UE determines the resource of the PDCCH according to the at
30 least one of the level information or the resource information, where the resource
                                                73

   includes the at least one resource of the time resource or the frequency resource.
   [0284]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, after determining
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to
   the random access preamble, the UE determines the resource of the PDCCH
 5 according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, so
   that the UE can receive, on the resource, the DCI carried by the PDCCH. The
   resource includes the at least one resource of the time resource or the frequency
   resource.
   [0285]      Specifically, for related descriptions about the resource of the PDCCH,
10 reference may be made to descriptions in step 605, and details are not described
   herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0286]      It should be noted that when the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information has different values, determined resources of the PDCCH do not
   overlap or are different. For a specific example, reference may be made to step 605,
15 and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0287]      It should be noted that a correspondence between the resource of the
   PDCCH and the at least one of the level information or the resource information of
   the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner may be pre-configured in a
   system, on a network, or in a protocol. The UE stores the correspondence. The UE can
20 determine the resource of the PDCCH according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information and the pre-configured correspondence.
   [0288]      Certainly, alternatively, the base station may notify, by using signaling, the
   UE of a correspondence between the resource of the PDCCH and the at least one of
   the level information or the resource information of the random access preamble sent
25 in the enhanced manner. That is, the base station may perform the following step:
               sending, to the UE, information about the correspondence between the
   resource of the PDCCH and the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information of the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner.
   [0289]      In this case, the UE receives the information about the correspondence,
30 and determines the resource of the PDCCH according to the at least one of the level
                                                74

   information     or the    resource   information    and   the   information   about  the
   correspondence.
   [0290]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a method in which the UE
   determines the resource of the PDCCH according to the at least one of the level
 5 information or the resource information is not specifically limited in this embodiment
   of the present invention.
   [0291]      It should be noted that there is not necessarily a sequence between step
   608 and the foregoing steps 602-607. After determining the random access preamble
   to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the level
10 information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the UE can determine the resource of the PDCCH according to the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information, which is not specifically
   limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0292]      609. The UE receives, on the resource, the DCI carried by the PDCCH.
15 [0293]      Specifically, after the base station sends, on the resource, the DCI carried
   by the PDCCH, the UE receives, on the resource that is of the PDCCH and that is
   determined according to the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information, the DCI carried by the PDCCH.
   [0294]      610. The UE receives, according to scheduling of the DCI, the RAR
20 carried by the PDSCH.
   [0295]      As described above, when the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information has different values, determined resources of the PDCCH do not
   overlap or are different. Therefore, when performing random access response for
   random access preambles corresponding to different level information or resource
25 information, the base station uses different resources of the PDCCH. If the base
   station detects a random access preamble on a PRACH resource included in a
   PRACH resource set, the base station sends, on a resource that is of the PDCCH and
   that is determined according to at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble, DCI carried by the
30 PDCCH; and if the UE sends the random access preamble on the PRACH resource
                                                75

   included in the PRACH resource set, the UE receives, on a corresponding resource
   that is of the PDCCH and that is determined according to at least one of the level
   information    or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the DCI carried by the PDCCH. Therefore, during PDCCH detection, the
 5 UE does not perform detection on a resource that is of the PDCCH and that is
   determined according to at least one of level information or resource information
   corresponding to a random access preamble of another UE, so that the UE does not
   consider a PDCCH at another repetition level as a PDCCH of the UE or successfully
   detect the PDCCH, and does not detect a PDSCH scheduled by using DCI carried by
10 the PDCCH to cause RAR missed detection or an RAR false alarm, thereby reducing
   power waste of the UE.
   [0296]      Optionally, an embodiment of the present invention further provides a
   random access response method. The method is applied to an LTE or LTE-A system,
   and is specifically described by using interaction between a UE and a base station as
15 an example. As shown in FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B, the method includes the following
   steps:
   [0297]      701. The UE determines a random access preamble to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, and determines at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble.
20 [0298]      The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
   enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
25 characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
   time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
30 where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
                                               76

   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater

   [0299]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the UE, the
   random access preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at
 5 least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
   random access preamble, reference may be made to descriptions in step 301 in
   Embodiment 2, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [0300]     702. The UE sends the random access preamble in the enhanced manner.
10 [0301]     Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, in a random
   access procedure in the LTE or LTE-A system, after determining the random access
   preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the UE may send the random access preamble to the base station in the
15 enhanced manner by using the PRACH, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0302]     703. The base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0303]     Specifically, after the UE sends the random access preamble in the
20 enhanced manner, the base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0304]     704. The base station determines the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
25 [0305]     Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the base
   station, the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, reference
   may be made to descriptions in step 202 in Embodiment 1, and details are not
   described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
30 [0306]     705. The base station sends DCI carried by a PDCCH, where the DCI
                                               77

   includes the at least one of the level information or the resource information, and the
   DCI is used for scheduling a PDSCH.
   [0307]      Specifically, the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information may be represented by using a newly added DCI bit or DCI field.
 5 Alternatively, instead of adding a DCI bit or DCI field, an existing DCI bit or DCI
   field carried by the PDCCH is re-defined, so as to be used to represent the at least one
   of the level information or the resource information.
   [0308]      For example, for a DCI format 1A, the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information is represented by using a reserved bit or field in existing
10 DCI, and the at least one of the level information or the resource information may be
   specifically represented by using a bit or field used to represent a quantity of hybrid
   automatic repeat request (HARQ) processes. For another example, the at least one of
   the level information or the resource information may be represented by using a
   partial bit or field that is in existing DCI and that is used for resource allocation. A
15 representation form of the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information included in the DCI is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the
   present invention.
   [0309]      706. The base station sends an RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0310]      707. The UE receives the DCI carried by the PDCCH.
20 [0311]      708. The UE determines whether the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information included in the received DCI is the same as the at least
   one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the random
   access preamble.
   [0312]      709. When the at least one of the level information or the resource
25 information included in the received DCI is the same as the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the UE receives the RAR carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using the
   DCI.
   [0313]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, the base station
30 sends the DCI carried by the PDCCH, where the DCI further includes the at least one
                                               78

   of the level information or the resource information. In this way, when the UE
   performs PDCCH detection, if it is detected that the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information included in the PDCCH is the same as the at
   least one of the level information or the resource information determined by the UE,
 5 the UE continues to detect the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI carried by the
   PDCCH; or if it is detected that the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information included in the PDCCH is different from the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information determined by the UE, the UE continues
   to detect another PDCCH. Therefore, the UE can learn that the RAR carried by the
10 PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI that is carried by the PDCCH is a reply for a
   random access preamble corresponding to which piece of level information or
   resource information, so that the UE does not consider a PDCCH at another repetition
   level as a PDCCH of the UE or successfully detect the PDCCH, and does not detect a
   PDSCH scheduled by using DCI carried by the PDCCH to cause RAR missed
15 detection or an RAR false alarm, thereby reducing power waste of the UE.
   [0314]      Optionally, an embodiment of the present invention further provides a
   random access response method. The method is applied to an LTE or LTE-A system,
   and is specifically described by using interaction between a UE and a base station as
   an example. As shown in FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B, the method includes the following
20 steps:
   [0315]      801. The UE determines a random access preamble to be sent in an
   enhanced manner, and determines at least one of level information or resource
   information corresponding to the random access preamble.
   [0316]      The level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an
25 enhancement level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level
   index, a repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level,
   a resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
   resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
30 time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,
                                               79

   a physical random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint
   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
   the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
 5 PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6.
   [0317]      Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the UE, the
   random access preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at
   least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
10 random access preamble, reference may be made to descriptions in step 301 in
   Embodiment 2, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [0318]      802. The UE sends the random access preamble in the enhanced manner.
   [0319]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, in a random
15 access procedure in the LTE or LTE-A system, after determining the random access
   preamble to be sent in the enhanced manner and determining the at least one of the
   level information or the resource information corresponding to the random access
   preamble, the UE may send the random access preamble to the base station in the
   enhanced manner by using the PRACH, which is not specifically limited in this
20 embodiment of the present invention.
   [0320]      803. The base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0321]      Specifically, after the UE sends the random access preamble in the
   enhanced manner, the base station receives the random access preamble sent in the
25 enhanced manner.
   [0322]      804. The base station determines the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the
   enhanced manner.
   [0323]      Specifically, for related descriptions about the determining, by the base
30 station, the at least one of the level information or the resource information
                                                80

   corresponding to the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, reference
   may be made to descriptions in step 202 in Embodiment 1, and details are not
   described herein in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0324]       805. The base station sends an RAR carried by a PDSCH, and adds the at
 5 least one of the level information or the resource information to the PDSCH.
   [0325]       Specifically, the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information may be represented by using a newly added bit or field in information
   carried by the PDSCH. Alternatively, instead of adding a bit or field, an existing bit or
   field in information carried by the PDSCH is re-defined, and the existing bit or field is
10 used to represent the at least one of the level information or the resource information.
   A representation form of the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information is not specifically limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0326]       Preferably, the adding the at least one of the level information or the
   resource information to the PDSCH may specifically include:
15              representing the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information by using a bit in a backoff indication subheader of a Media Access
   Control MAC protocol data unit PDU carried by the PDSCH that carries the RAR.
   [0327]       806. The UE receives information carried by the PDSCH.
   [0328]       807. The UE determines the at least one of the level information or the
20 resource information included in the information carried by the PDSCH.
   [0329]       808. The UE determines whether the at least one of the level information
   or the resource information included in the information carried by the PDSCH is the
   same as the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   corresponding to the random access preamble.
25 [0330]       809. When the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information included in the information carried by the PDSCH is the same as the at
   least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
   random access preamble, the UE obtains the RAR carried by the PDSCH.
   [0331]       Specifically, when the at least one of the level information or the resource
30 information included in the information carried by the PDSCH is the same as the at
                                                81

   least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to the
   random access preamble, the UE parses the RAR included in the information carried
   by the PDSCH, so as to obtain the RAR.
   [0332]      Specifically, in this embodiment of the present invention, when the
 5 information carried by the PDSCH that carries the RAR includes the at least one of
   the level information or the resource information, the PDSCH does not need to be
   scheduled by using DCI carried by a PDCCH. Instead, the information carried by the
   PDSCH is sent and received by using predefined parameters such as a frequency
   resource and a modulation and coding scheme. When the UE performs PDSCH
10 detection, if it is detected that the at least one of the level information or the resource
   information included in the information carried by the PDSCH is the same as the at
   least one of the level information or the resource information determined by the UE,
   the UE parses the RAR included in the information carried by the PDSCH to obtain
   the RAR; or if it is detected that the at least one of the level information or the
15 resource information included in the information carried by the PDSCH is different
   from the at least one of the level information or the resource information determined
   by the UE, the UE continues to detect another PDSCH. In this way, the UE does not
   need to detect the PDCCH, and a case in which the UE cannot identify that the RAR
   carried by the PDSCH scheduled by using the DCI that is carried by the PDCCH is a
20 reply for a random access preamble corresponding to which piece of level information
   or resource information is avoided. In addition, if same random access preambles are
   sent in the enhanced manner by using different level information, and the base station
   sends, in one subframe, RARs replied with respect to the random access preambles
   corresponding to different level information, in the method described in this
25 embodiment of the present invention, the UE does not consider an RAR replied with
   respect to a random access preamble corresponding to other level information as an
   RAR for the UE or successfully detect the RAR to cause an RAR false alarm, thereby
   reducing power waste of the UE.
   [0333]      The random access response method provided in this embodiment of the
30 present invention includes: determining, by a UE, a random access preamble to be
                                                  82

   sent in an enhanced manner, and determining at least one of level information or
   resource information corresponding to the random access preamble, where the level
   information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an
   enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level index, a repetition count,
 5 a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level, a resource set level index,
   a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency resource set index, a
   preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality characterization
   parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a time-frequency
   resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index, a physical
10 random access channel PRACH mask index, a time resource startpoint index, a time
   resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of the first
   subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located, where a
   quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
15 than 6; sending the random access preamble in the enhanced manner; receiving, by a
   base station, the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner; determining
   the at least one of the level information or the resource information corresponding to
   the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner; sending an RAR of the
   random access preamble according to the at least one of the level information or the
20 resource information, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH; and receiving, by the
   UE, the RAR of the random access preamble according to the at least one of the level
   information or the resource information. Based on the foregoing solutions provided in
   this embodiment of the present invention, after receiving the random access preamble,
   the base station further determines the at least one of the level information or the
25 resource information corresponding to the random access preamble, so as to send,
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information, the
   RAR corresponding to the random access preamble. Therefore, the following problem
   is avoided so that power waste of the UE is reduced: When the base station sends, in
   one subframe, DCI carried by PDCCHs at different repetition levels, and schedules,
30 by using the DCI, a PDSCH that carries an RAR, RAR missed detection or an RAR
                                                83

   false alarm occurs because the UE cannot distinguish the PDCCHs at different
   repetition levels.

   [0334]      This embodiment of the present invention provides a base station 900.

   [0340]       The DCI sending module 9032 is configured to send the DCI that is
10 carried by the PDCCH and that is scrambled by the DCI scrambling module 9031,
   where the DCI is used for scheduling the PDSCH.
   [0341]       The first RAR scrambling module 9033 is configured to scramble the RAR
   carried by the PDSCH.

   information or the resource information, the RAR carried by the PDSCH includes:

   determined by the determining unit 902 has different values, RA-RNTIs determined
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information are
   different.
20 [0350]     Further, that the DCI scrambling module 9031 or the first RAR scrambling

   opportunities of random access preambles corresponding to same level information do
   not overlap.
10 [0354]      Case 2:

               the second formula includes:
               RA-RNTI=M+tfid,
               or the second formula includes:

               or the second formula includes:

25             M is determined according to the level information, t id represents a
   sequence number of the first subframe in which the PRACH carrying the random

30 index, the resource index, the random access opportunity index, or the PRACH mask
   index, tid' represents the time resource startpoint index or the time resource index,

   represents a quantity of values of t_id'.
   [0356]       Particularly, when first level information corresponding to a first random

   random     access preamble,     some or all values of first resource        information
 5 corresponding to the first random access preamble and second resource information
   corresponding to the second random access preamble are the same.
   [0357]       Specifically, that M is determined according to the level information
   includes:
                M=X*L+Y, where

   implemented by using a transmitter, and the determining unit 902 may be specifically
   implemented by using a processor, where the processor, the receiver, and the
15 transmitter can communicate with each other, which is not specifically limited in this
   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0376]      Specifically, for a method in which the base station performs random
   access response, reference may be made to descriptions in Embodiment 1 and
   Embodiment 3, and details are not described herein in this embodiment of the present
20 invention.
   [0377]      The base station provided in this embodiment of the present invention
   includes: a receiving unit, configured to receive a random access preamble sent in an
   enhanced manner; a determining unit, configured to determine at least one of level
   information or resource information corresponding to the random access preamble

   the level information includes at least one of a level, a level index, an enhancement
   level, an enhancement level index, a repetition level, a repetition level index, a
   repetition count, a resource level, a resource level index, a resource set level, a
   resource set level index, a resource set index, a time resource set index, a frequency
30 resource set index, a preamble index, a preamble group index, or a channel quality
                                               91

   characterization parameter, and the resource information includes at least one of a
   time-frequency resource index, a resource index, a random access opportunity index,

   index, a time resource index, a frequency resource index, or a first PRACH index of
 5 the first subframe in which a PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located,
   where a quantity of values of the first PRACH index of the first subframe in which the
   PRACH carrying the random access preamble is located is a positive integer greater
   than 6; and a sending unit, configured to send an RAR of the random access preamble
   according to the at least one of the level information or the resource information
10 determined by the determining unit, where the RAR is carried by a PDSCH. Based on
   the foregoing solutions provided in this embodiment of the present invention, after
   receiving the random access preamble sent in the enhanced manner, the base station
   further determines the at least one of the level information or the resource information
   corresponding to the random access preamble, so as to send, according to the at least
15 one of the level information or the resource information, the RAR corresponding to
   the random access preamble. Therefore, the following problem is avoided so that
   power waste of a UE is reduced: When the base station sends, in one subframe, DCI
   carried by PDCCHs at different repetition levels, and schedules, by using the DCI, a
   PDSCH that carries an RAR, RAR missed detection or an RAR false alarm occurs
20 because the UE cannot distinguish the PDCCHs at different repetition levels.
