   Background of the Invention
            Monoclonal antibodies, their conjugates and derivatives are hugely commercially
   important as therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Non-human antibodies elicit a strong immune
   response in patients, usually following a single low dose injection (Schroff, 1985 Cancer Res
15 45:879-85, Shawler. J Immunol 1985 135:1530-5; Dillman, Cancer Biother 1994 9:17-28).
   Accordingly, several methods for reducing the immunogenicity of murine and other rodent
   antibodies as well as technologies to make fully human antibodies using e.g. transgenic mice
   or phage display were developed. Chimeric antibodies were engineered, which combine rodent
   variable regions with human constant regions (e.g., Boulianne Nature 1984 312:643-6)
20 reduced immunogenicity problems considerably (e.g., LoBuglio, Proc Natl Acad Sci 1989
   86:4220-4; Clark, Immunol Today 2000 21:397-402). Humanized antibodies were also
   engineered, in which the rodent sequence of the variable region itself is engineered to be as
   close to a human sequence as possible while preserving at least the original CDRs, or where
   the CDRs form the rodent antibody were grafted into framework of a human antibody (e.g.,
25 Riechmann, Nature 1988 332:323-7; US5,693,761). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies are widely
   used for biological assays such as ELISAs or Western blots. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies are
   oftentimes favored over polyclonal rodent antibodies because of their usually much higher
   affinity. Furthermore, rabbit oftentimes are able to elecit good antibody responses to antigens
   that are poorly immunogenic in mice and/or which give not rise to good binders when used in
30 phage display. Due to these well-known advantages of rabbit antibodies, they would be ideal
   to be used in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. The reason that this is
   not commonly done is mainly due to technical challenges in the generation of monoclonal
   rabbit antibodies. Since myeloma-like tumors are unkown in rabbits, the conventional
   hybridoma technology to generate monoclonal antibodies

   WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  2
   is not applicable to rabbit antibodies. Pioneering work in providing fusion cell line
   partners for rabbit antibody-expressing cells has been done by Knight and colleagues
   (Spieker-Polet et al., PNAS 1995, 92:9348-52) and an improved fusion partner cell
   line has been described by Pytela et al. in 2005 (see e.g. US patent No. 7429487). This
 5 technology, however, is not widly spread since the corresponding know-how is
   basically controlled by a single research group. Alternative methods for the generation
   of monoclonal antibodies that involve the cloning of antibodies from selected
   antibody-expressing cells via RT-PCR are described in the literature, but have never
   been successfully reported for rabbit antibodies.
10          Rabbit antibodies, like mouse antibodies are expected to elicit strong immune
   responses if used for human therapy, thus, rabbit antibodies need to be humanized
   before they can be used clinically. However, the methods that are used to make
   humanized rodent antibodies cannot easily be extrapolated for rabbit antibodies due to
   structural differences between rabbit and mouse and, respectively, between rabbit and
15 human antibodies. For example, the light chain CDR3 (CDRL3) is often much longer
   than previously known CDRL3s from human or mouse antibodies.
            There are few rabbit antibody humanization approaches described in the prior
   artwhich are, however, no classical grafting approach in which the CDRs of a non
   human donor are transplanted on a human acceptor antibody. WO 04/016740
20 describes a so-called "resurfacing" strategy . The goal of a "resurfacing" strategy is to
   remodel the solvent-accessible residues of the non-human framework such that they
    become more human-like. Similar humanization techniques for rabbit antibodies as
    described in WO 04/016740 are known in the art. Both W008/144757 and
    W005/016950 discloses methods for humanizing a rabbit monoclonal antibody which
25  involve the comparison of amino acid sequences of a parent rabbit antibody to the
    amino acid sequences of a similar human antibody. Subsequently, the amino acid
    sequence of the parent rabbit antibody is altered such that its framework regions are
    more similar in sequence to the equivalent framework regions of the similar human
    antibody. In order to gain good binding capacities, laborious development efforts need
30  to be made for each immunobinder individually.
            A potential problem of the above-described approaches is that not a human
    framework is used, but the rabbit framework is engineered such that it looks more
    human-like. Such approach carries the risk that amino acid stretches that are buried in
    the core of the protein still might comprise immunogenic T cell epitopes.

   WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  3
            To date, the applicants have not identified a rabbit antibody, which was
   humanized by applying state-of-the-art grafting approaches. This might be explained
   by fact that rabbit CDRs may be quite different from human or rodent CDRs. As
   known in the art, many rabbit VH chains have extra paired cysteines relative to the
 5 murine and human counterparts. In addition to the conserved disulfide bridge formed
   between cys22 and cys92, there is also a cys21 -cys79 bridge as well as an interCDR
    S-S bridge formed between the last residue of CDRH1 and the first residue of CDR
   H2 in some rabbit chains. Besides, pairs of cysteine residues are often found in the
   CDR-L3. Moreover, many rabbit antibody CDRs do not belong to any previously
10 known canonical structure. In particular the CDR-L3 is often much longer than the
   CDR-L3 of a human or murine counterpart.
            Hence, the grafting of non-human CDRs antibodies into a human framework
   is a major protein engineering task. The transfer of antigen binding loops from a
   naturally evolved framework to a different artificially selected human framework
15 must be performed so that native loop conformations are retained for antigen binding.
   Often antigen binding affinity is greatly reduced or abolished after loop grafting. The
   use of carefully selected human frameworks in grafting the antigen binding loops
   maximizes the probability of retaining binding affinity in the humanized molecule
   (Roguzka et al 1996). Although the many grafting experiments available in the
20 literature provide a rough guide for CDR grafting, it is not possible to generalize a
   pattern. Typical problems consist in loosing the specificity, stability or producibility
   after grafting the CDR loops.
            Accordingly, there is an urgent need for improved methods for reliably and
   rapidly humanizing rabbit antibodies for use as therapeutic and diagnostic agents.
25 Furthermore, there is a need for human acceptor frameworks for reliably humanizing
   rabbit antibodies, providing functional antibodies and/or antibody fragments with
   drug-like biophysical properties.
   Summary of the Invention
30          It has surprisingly been found that a highly soluble and stable human antibody
   framework identified by a Quality Control (QC) assay (as disclosed in WO 0148017
   and in Auf der Maur et al (2001), FEBS Lett 508, p. 407-412) is particularly suitable
   for accommodating CDRs from other non-human animal species, for example, rabbit
   CDRs. Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention provides the light and heavy chain

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   4
   variable regions of a particular human antibody (the so called, "FW 1.4" antibody)
   which is especially suitable as universal acceptor for CDRs from a variety of
   antibodies, in particular from rabbit antibodies, of different binding specificities,
   independent of whether a disulfide bridge is present in a CDR or not. Furthermore,
 5 the present invention provides two mutant sequences of said particular human
   antibody framework, namely rFW1.4 and rFW1.4(V2), both being frameworks
   particularly suitable as universal acceptor frameworks for the grafting of rabbit CDRs.
   In another aspect, the invention provides a motif of framework residues which renders
   a human framework suitable for accommodating CDRs from other non-human animal
10 species, in particular rabbit CDRs.
            Humanized immunobinders generated by the grafting of rabbit CDRs into
   these highly compatible variable light and heavy chain frameworks consistently and
   reliably retain the spatial orientation of the rabbit antibodies from which the donor
   CDRs are derived. Therefore, no structurally relevant positions of the donor
15 immunobinder need to be introduced into the acceptor framework. Due to these
   advantages, high-throughput humanization of rabbit antibodies with no or little
   optimization of the binding capacities can be achieved.
            Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides methods for grafting
   rabbit and other non-human CDRs, into the soluble and stable light chain and/or
20 heavy chain human antibody framework sequences disclosed herein, thereby
   generating humanized antibodies with superior biophysical properties. In particular,
   immunobinders generated by the methods of the invention exhibit superior functional
   properties such as solubility and stability.

   Definitions
            In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain
   terms will be defined as follows. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the
   detailed description.
30          The term "antibody" refers to whole antibodies and any antigen binding
   fragment. The term "antigen binding polypeptide" and "immunobinder" are used
   simultaneously herein. An "antibody" refers to a protein, optionally glycosylated,
   comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by
   disulfide bonds, or an antigen binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain is comprised

   WO 2009/155726                                                         PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                 6
   of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain
   constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains,
   CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region
   (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant
 5 region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further
   subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining
   regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework
   regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged
   from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FRI, CDR1, FR2,
10 CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain
   a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the
   antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors,
   including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first
   component (Clq) of the classical complement system.
15         The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody (or simply "antibody
   portion") refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to
   specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., TNF). It has been shown that the antigen-binding
   function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody.
   Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen-binding
20 portion" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting
   of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab') 2 fragment, a bivalent fragment
   comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a
   Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of
   the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a single domain or dAb
25 fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain;
   and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) or (vii) a combination
   of two or more isolated CDRs which may optionally be joined by a synthetic linker.
   Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for
   by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic
30 linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH
   regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g.,
   Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad
   Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                    7
    encompassed within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody. These
    antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with
    skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are
    intact antibodies. Antigen-binding portions can be produced by recombinant DNA
 5  techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins.
    Antibodies can be of different isotype, for example, an IgG (e.g., an IgGI, IgG2,
    IgG3, or IgG4 subtype), IgA1, IgA2, IgD, IgE, or IgM antibody.
             The term "immunobinder" refers to a molecule that contains all or a part of the
    antigen binding site of an antibody, e.g. all or part of the heavy and/or light chain
10 variable domain, such that the immunobinder specifically recognizes a target antigen.
   Non-limiting examples of immunobinders include full-length immunoglobulin
   molecules and scFvs, as well as antibody fragments, including but not limited to (i) a
    Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains;
    (ii) a F(ab') 2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a
15  disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fab' fragment, which is essentially a Fab
    with part of the hinge region (see, FUNDAMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY (Paul ed.,
    3.sup.rd ed. 1993); (iv) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (v) a Fv
    fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (vi) a
    single domain antibody such as a Dab fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544
20  546), which consists of a VH or VL domain, a Camelid (see Hamers-Casterman, et al.,
   Nature 363:446-448 (1993), and Dumoulin, et al., Protein Science 11:500-515 (2002))
    or a Shark antibody (e.g., shark Ig-NARs Nanobodies@; and (vii) a nanobody, a
    heavy chain variable region containing a single variable domain and two constant
    domains.
25           The term "single chain antibody", "single chain Fv" or "scFv" is refers to a
    molecule comprising an antibody heavy chain variable domain (or region; VH) and an
    antibody light chain variable domain (or region; VL) connected by a linker. Such
    scFv molecules can have the general structures: NH 2-VL-linker-VH-COOH or NH 2
    VH-linker-VL-COOH. A suitable state of the art linker consists of repeated GGGGS
30  amino acid sequences or variants thereof. In a preferred embodiment of the present
    invention a (GGGGS) 4 linker of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8
    is used, but variants of 1-3 repeats are also possible (Holliger et al. (1993), Proc. Nati.
    Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448). Other linkers that can be used for the present

   WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222

    Immunol.
 5          As used herein, the term "functional property" is a property of a polypeptide
   (e.g., an immunobinder) for which an improvement (e.g., relative to a conventional
   polypeptide) is desirable and/or advantageous to one of skill in the art, e.g., in order to
   improve the manufacturing properties or therapeutic efficacy of the polypeptide. In
   one embodiment, the functional property is stability (e.g., thermal stability). In
10 another embodiment, the functional property is solubility (e.g., under cellular
   conditions). In yet another embodiment, the functional property is aggregation
   behavior. In still another embodiment, the functional property is protein expression
   (e.g., in a prokaryotic cell). In yet another embodiment the functional property is
   refolding behavior following inclusion body solubilization in a manufacturing
15 process. In certain embodiments, the functional property is not an improvement in
   antigen binding affinity. In another preferred embodiment, the improvement of one or
   more functional properties has no substantial effect on the binding affinity of the
   immunobinder.
            The term "CDR" refers to one of the six hypervariable regions within the
20 variable domains of an antibody that mainly contribute to antigen binding. One of the
   most commonly used definitions for the six CDRs was provided by Kabat E.A. et al.,
   (1991) Sequences of proteins of immunological interest. NIH Publication 91-3242).
   As used herein, Kabat's definition of CDRs only apply for CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3
   of the light chain variable domain (CDR LI, CDR L2, CDR L3, or LI, L2, L3), as
25 well as for CDR2 and CDR3 of the heavy chain variable domain (CDR H2, CDR H3,
   or H2, H3). CDR1 of the heavy chain variable domain (CDR HI or HI), however, as
   used herein is defined by the residue positions (Kabat numbering) starting with
   position 26 and ending prior to position 36. This definition is basically a fusion of
   CDR H1 as differently defined by Kabat and Chotia (see also Figure 1 for
30 illustration).
                      The term "antibody framework" as used herein refers to the part of
   the variable domain, either VL or VH, which serves as a scaffold for the antigen
   binding loops (CDRs) of this variable domain. In essence it is the variable domain
   without the CDRs.

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222

            The term "epitope" or "antigenic determinant" refers to a site on an antigen to
   which an immunoglobulin or antibody specifically binds (e.g., a specific site on the
   TNF molecule). An epitope typically includes at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
    13, 14 or 15 consecutive or non-consecutive amino acids in a unique spatial
 5 conformation. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular
   Biology, Vol. 66, G. E. Morris, Ed. (1996).
            The terms "specific binding," "selective binding," "selectively binds," and
   "specifically binds," refer to antibody binding to an epitope on a predetermined
   antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity (KD) of approximately less
10 than 10- 7 M, such as approximately less than 10 -8 M, 10~9 M or 10-10 M or even lower.
           The term "KD" or "Kd" refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a
   particular antibody-antigen interaction. Typically, the antibodies of the invention
   bind to TNF with a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of less than approximately
    10-7 M, such as less than approximately 10~8 M, 10-9 M or 10~10 M or even lower, for
15 example, as determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a
   BIACORE instrument.
            The term "nucleic acid molecule," as used herein refers to DNA molecules and
   RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double-stranded,
   but preferably is double-stranded DNA. A nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is
20 placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance,
   a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the
   transcription of the sequence.
            The term "vector," refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting
   another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. In one embodiment, the vector is a
25 "plasmid," which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional
   DNA segments may be ligated. In another embodiment, the vector is a viral vector,
   wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. The vectors
   disclosed herein can be capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which
   they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and
30 episomal mammalian vectors) or can be can be integrated into the genome of a host
    cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host
    genome (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors).
            The term "host cell" refers to a cell into which and expression vector has been
    introduced. Host cells include bacterial, microbial, plant or animal cells, preferably,

            The term "lagomorphs" refers to members of the taxonomic order
   Lagomorpha, comprising the families Leporidae (e.g. hares and rabbits), and the
 5 Ochotonidae (pikas). In a most preferred embodiment, the lagomorphs is a rabbit. The
   term "rabbit" as used herein refers to an animal belonging to the family of the
   leporidae.
           As used herein, "identity" refers to the sequence matching between two
   polypeptides, molecules or between two nucleic acids. When a position in both of the
10 two compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer
   subunit (for instance, if a position in each of two polypeptides is occupied by a
   lysine), then the respective molecules are identical at that position. The "percentage
   identity" between two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions
   shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of
15 each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
   Generally, a comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum
   identity. Such alignment can be provided using, for instance, the method of the
   Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has
   been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a
20 Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4
   and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

   the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to
   which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent
25 to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present
   invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. In case of conflict, the

    Kabat numbering system as described further in Kabat et al. (Kabat, E. A., et al.
    (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S.
    Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) may be
 5 used. Conversion tables for the two different numbering systems used to identify
   amino acid residue positions in antibody heavy and light chain variable regions are
   provided in A. Honegger, J.Mol.Biol. 309 (2001) 657-670.
             In a first aspect, the present invention provides a universal acceptor framework
10 for the grafting of CDRs from other animal species, for example, from rabbit. It has
   previously been described that antibodies or antibody derivatives comprising the
   human frameworks identified in the so called "Quality Control" screen (WO0148017)
   are characterised by a generally high stability and/or solubility. Although the human
    single-chain framework FWI.4 (a combination of SEQ ID NO: I (named a43 in
15  WO03/097697) and SEQ ID NO: 2 (named KI27 in WO03/097697)) clearly
   underperformed in the Quality Control assay, it was surprisingly found that it has a
   high intrinsic thermodynamic stability and is well producible, also in combination
   with a variety of different CDRs. The stability of this molecule can be attributed
   mostly to its framework regions. It has further been shown that FWI.4 is in essence
20 highly compatible with the antigen-binding sites of rabbit antibodies. Therefore, the
    FWI.4 represents a suitable scaffold to construct stable humanized scFv antibody
    fragments derived from grafting of rabbit loops. Thus, in one aspect, the invention
   provides an immunobinder acceptor framework, comprising a VH sequence having at
    least 90% identity to SEQ ID No. I and/or a VL sequence having at least 85% identity
25 to SEQ ID No. 2, more preferably comprising the sequence of FWI.4 (SEQ ID NO:
    3) for the grafting of rabbit CDRs, or a sequence having at least 60%, more preferably
    at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, identity to SEQ ID NO: 3.
             Moreover, it was found that FWI.4 could be optimized by substituting several
    residue positions in the heavy chain of FWI.4 and/or by substituting I position in the
30  light chain of FW1.4. Thereby, it was surprisingly found that loop conformation of a
    large variety of rabbit CDRs in the VH could be fully maintained, largely independent
    of the sequence of the donor framework. Said residues in the heavy chain as well as
    the I position in the light chain of FWI.4 are conserved in rabbit antibodies. The
    consensus residue for the positions in the heavy chain as well as the one position in

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  12
   the light chain was deduced from the rabbit repertoire and introduced into the
   sequence of the human acceptor framework.
           As a result, the modified framework 1.4 (hereinafter referred to as rFW1.4) is
   compatible with virtually any rabbit CDRs. Moreover, rFW1.4 containing different
 5 rabbit CDRs is well expressed and good produced contrary to the rabbit wild type
   single chains and still almost fully retains the affinity of the original donor rabbit
   antibodies.
           Thus, the present invention provides the variable heavy chain framework of
   SEQ ID No. 1, further comprising one or more amino acid residues that generally
10 support conformation of CDRs derived from a rabbit immunobinder. In particular,
   said residues are present at one or more amino acid positions selected from the group
   consisting of 24H, 25H, 56H, 82H, 84H, 89H and 108H (AHo numbering). These
   positions are prove to affect CDR conformation and are therefore contemplated for
   mutation to accommodate donor CDRs. Preferably, said one or more residues are
15 selected from the group consisting of: Threonine (T) at position 24, Valine (V) at
   position 25, Glycine or Alanine (G or A) at position 56, Lysine (K) at position 82,
   Threonine (T) at position 84, Valine (V) at position 89 and Arginine (R) at position
    108 (AHo numbering). Preferably, at least three, more preferably, four, five, six and
   most preferably all seven residues are present. Surprisingly, it has been found that the
20 presence of the mentioned residues improves the stability of the immunobinder.
           In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an immunobinder acceptor
   framework comprising a VH having at least 50%, more preferably at least 55%, 60%,
   65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and eve more preferably 100% identity to
   SEQ ID No. 4, with the provisio that at least one, more preferably at least three, more
25 preferably, four, five, six and most preferably seven residues of the group consisting
   of threonine (T) at position 24, valine (V) at position 25, alanine (A) or glycine (G) at
   position 56, threonine (T) at position 84, lysine (K) at position 82, valine (V) at
   position 89 and arginine (R) at position 108 (AHo numbering) are present. In a
   preferred embodiment, the immunobinder acceptor framework is an immunobinder
30 acceptor framework for rabbit CDRs.
           In a preferred embodiment, said variable heavy chain framework is or
   comprises SEQ ID No. 4 or SEQ ID No. 6. Both of said variable heavy chain
   frameworks may for example be combined with any suitable light chain framework.

   WO 2009/155726                                                         PCT/CH2009/000222

            Accordingly, the present invention provides an immunobinder acceptor
   framework comprising
            (i) a variable heavy chain framework having at least 70% identity, preferably
   at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, more preferably at least 95% identity, to SEQ ID No.
 5 4; and/or
            (ii) a variable light chain framework having at least 70% identity, preferably at
   least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, more preferably at least 95% identity, to SEQ ID No. 2.
            In a much preferred embodiment, the variable heavy chain framework
   comprises threonine (T) at position 24, glycine (G) at position 56, threonine (T) at
10 position 84, valine (V) at position 89 and arginine (R) at position 108 (AHo
   numbering).
            In a preferred embodiment, the variable light chain comprises Threonine (T) at
   position 87 (AHo numbering).
            In a preferred embodiment, said immunobinder acceptor framework comprises
15          (i) a variable heavy chain framework selected from the group consisting of
   SEQ ID No. 1, SEQ ID No. 4 and SEQ ID No. 6; and/or
            (ii) a variable light chain framework of SEQ ID No. 2 or SEQ ID No. 9.
            In a preferred embodiment, the variable heavy chain framework is linked to a
   variable light chain framework via a linker. The linker may be any suitable linker, for
20 example a linker comprising 1 to 4 repeats of the sequence GGGGS, preferably a
   (GGGGS) 4 peptide (SEQ ID No. 8), or a linker as disclosed in Alfthan et al. (1995)
   Protein Eng. 8:725-731.
            In another preferred embodiment, the immunobinder acceptor framework is a
   sequence having at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% more preferably at least 95%
25 identity, to SEQ ID No. 5, whereas the sequence, preferably, is not SEQ ID No. 3.
   More preferably, the immunobinder acceptor framework comprises or is SEQ ID No.
   5.
            In another preferred embodiment, the immunobinder acceptor framework is a
   sequence having at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, more preferably at least 95%
30  identity, to SEQ ID No. 7, whereas the sequence, preferably, is not SEQ ID No. 3.
   More preferably, the immunobinder acceptor framework comprises or is SEQ ID No.
    7.

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   14
             Moreover, it was surprisingly found that the presence of the above described
    amino acid motif renders a framework, preferably a human framework, particularly
    suitable for the accommodation of CDRs from other non-human animal species, in
    particular rabbit CDRs. Said motif has no negative impact on the stability of an
 5  immunobinder. The CDRs are presented in a conformation similar to their native
    spatial orientation in the rabbit immunobinder; thus, no structurally relevant positions
    need to be grafted onto the acceptor framework. Accordingly, the human or
    humanized immunobinder acceptor framework comprises at least three amino acids,
    preferably four, five, six and more preferably seven amino acids of the group
10  consisting of threonine (T) at position 24, valine (V) at position 25, alanine (A) or
    glycine (G) at position 56, lysine (K) at position 82, threonine (T) at position 84,
    valine (V) at position 89 and arginine (R) at position 108 (AHo numbering).
            The immunobinder acceptor frameworks as described herein may comprise
15  solubility enhancing substitution in the heavy chain framework, preferably at
    positions 12, 103 and 144 (AHo numbering). Preferably, a hydrophobic amino acid is
    substituted by a more hydrophilic amino acid. Hydrophilic amino acids are e.g.
    Arginine (R), Asparagine (N), Aspartic acid (D), Glutamine (Q), Glycine (G),
    Histidine (H), Lysine (K), Serine (S) and Threonine (T). More preferably, the heavy
20  chain framework comprises (a) Serine (S) at position 12; (b) Serine (S) or Threonine
    (T) at position 103 and/or (c) Serine (S) or Threonine (T) at position 144.
            Moreover, stability enhancing amino acids may be present at one or more
    positions 1, 3, 4, 10, 47, 57, 91 and 103 of the variable light chain framework (AHo
    numbering). More preferably, the variable light chain framework comprises glutamic
25  acid (E) at position 1, valine (V) at position 3, leucine (L) at position 4, Serine (S) at
    position 10; Arginine (R) at position 47, Serine (S) at position 57, phenylalanine (F) at
    position 91 and/or Valine (V) at position 103.
            As glutamine (Q) is prone to desamination, in another preferred embodiment,
    the VH comprises at position 141 a glycine (G). This substitution may improve long
30  term storage of the protein.
                       For example, the acceptor frameworks disclosed herein can be used
    to generate a human or humanized antibody which retains the binding properties of
    the non-human antibody from which the non-human CDRs are derived. Accordingly,
    in a preferred embodiment the invention encompasses an immunobinder acceptor

     framework as disclosed herein, further comprising heavy chain CDR1, CDR2 and
     CDR3 and/or light chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 from a donor immunobinder,
     preferably from a mammalian immunobinder, more preferably from a lagomorph
     immunobinder and most preferably from a rabbit. Thus, in one embodiment, the
 5   invention provides an immunobinder specific to a desired antigen comprising
                         (i) variable light chain CDRs of a lagomorph; and
                         (ii) a human variable heavy chain framework having at least 50%,
    more preferably at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and most
    preferably 100% identity to SEQ ID NO. 4.
10                       In one preferred embodiment, there is the provisio that at least one
    amino acid of the group consisting of threonine (T) at position 24, valine (V) at
    position 25, alanine (A) or glycine (G) at position 56, threonine (T) at position 84,
    lysine (K) at position 82, valine (V) at position 89 and arginine (R) at position 108
    (AHo numbering) is present in said human variable heavy chain framework sequence.
15           Preferably, the lagomorph is a rabbit. More preferably, the immunobinder
    comprises heavy chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 and light chain CDR1, CDR2 and
    CDR3 from the donor immunobinder.
            As known in the art, many rabbit VH chains have extra paired cysteines
    relative to the murine and human counterparts. In addition to the conserved disulfide
20  bridge formed between cys22 and cys92, there is also a cys21 -cys79 bridge as well as
    an interCDR S-S bridge formed between the last residue of CDRH1 and the first
    residue of CDR H2 in some rabbit chains. Besides, pairs of cysteine residues in the
    CDR-L3 are often found. Besides, many rabbit antibody CDRs do not belong to any
    previously known canonical structure. In particular the CDR-L3 is often much longer
25  than the CDR-L3 of a human or murine counterpart.
             As stated before, the grafting of the non-human CDRs onto the frameworks
    disclosed herein yields a molecule wherein the CDRs are displayed in a proper
    conformation. If required, the affinity of the immunobinder may be improved by
    grafting antigen interacting framework residues of the non-human donor
30  immunobinder. These positions may e.g. be identified by
             (i) identifying the respective germ line progenitor sequence or, alternatively,
    by using the consensus sequences in case of highly homologous framework
    sequences;

            (ii) generating a sequence alignment of donor variable domain sequences with
   germ line progenitor sequence or consensus sequence of step (i); and
            (iii) identifying differing residues.
            Differing residues on the surface of the molecule were in many cases mutated
 5 during the affinity generation process in vivo, presumably to generate affinity to the
   antigen.
            In another aspect, the present invention provides an immunobinder which
   comprises the immunobinder acceptor framework described herein. Said
10 immunobinder may e.g. be a scFv antibody, a full-length immunoglobulin, a Fab
   fragment, a Dab or a Nanobody.
            In a preferred embodiment, the immunobinder is attached to one or more
   molecules, for example a therapeutic agent such as a cytotoxic agent, a cytokine, a
   chemokine, a growth factor or other signaling molecule, an imaging agent or a second
15 protein such as a transcriptional activator or a DNA-binding domain.
            The immunobinder as disclosed herein may e.g. be used in diagnostic
   applications, therapeutic application, target validation or gene therapy.
            The invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding the
   immunobinder acceptor framework disclosed herein or the immunobinder(s) as
20 disclosed herein.
            In another embodiment, a vector is provided which comprises the nucleic acid
   disclosed herein.
            The nucleic acid or the vector as disclosed herein can e.g. be used in gene
   therapy.
25          The invention further encompasses a host cell comprising the vector and/or the
   nucleic acid disclosed herein.
            Moreover, a composition is provided, comprising the immunobinder acceptor
    framework as disclosed herein, the immunobinder as disclosed herein, the isolated
    nucleic acid as disclosed herein or the vector as disclosed herein.

           In another aspect, the invention provides methods for the humanization of
   non-human antibodies by grafting CDRs of non-human donor antibodies onto stable
15 and soluble antibody frameworks. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the CDRs
   stem from rabbit antibodies and the frameworks are those described above.
           A general method for grafting CDRs into human acceptor frameworks has
   been disclosed by Winter in US Patent No. 5,225,539 and by Queen et al. in
   W09007861Al, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. The
20 general strategy for grafting CDRs from rabbit monoclonal antibodies onto selected
   frameworks is related to that of Winter et al. and Queen et al., but diverges in certain
   key respects. In particular, the methods of the invention diverge from the typical
   Winter and Queen methodology known in the art in that the human antibody
   frameworks as disclosed herein are particularly suitable as universal acceptors for
25 human or non-human donor antibodies. Thus, unlike the general method of Winter
   and Queen, the framework sequence used for the humanization methods of the
   invention is not necessarily the framework sequence which exhibits the greatest
   sequence similarity to the sequence of the non-human (e.g., rabbit) antibody from
   which the donor CDRs are derived. In addition, framework residue grafting from the
30 donor sequence to support CDR conformation is not required. At most, antigen
   binding amino acids located in the framework or other mutations that occurred during
    somatic hypermutation may be introduced.
           Particular details of the grafting methods to generate humanized rabbit-derived
    antibodies with high solubility and stability are described below.

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222

            Accordingly, the invention provides a method of humanizing a rabbit CDR
    donor immunobinder which comprises heavy chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3
    sequences and/or light chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences. The method
    comprises the steps of:
 5          (i) grafting onto the heavy chain at least one, preferably two, more preferably
    three CDRs of the group consisting of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences into a
    human heavy chain acceptor framework having at least 50%, preferably at least 55%,
    60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, more preferably at least 95% identity to SEQ
    ID NO:1; and/or
10          (ii) grafting onto the light chain at least one, preferably two, more preferably
    three CDRs of the group consisting of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences into a
    human light chain acceptor framework, the human light chain framework having at
    least 50%, preferably at least 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, more
   preferably at least 95% identity to SEQ ID NO:2.
15          In a preferred embodiment, the variable chain acceptor framework comprises
   (i) a human heavy chain framework comprising a framework amino acid sequence
    selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:6
   and (ii) a human light chain framework comprising the framework amino acid
   sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9.
20          In a much preferred embodiment, the method comprises the step of (i) grafting
   the heavy chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences into the heavy chain and (ii)
   grafting the light chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences into the light chain of an
    immunobinder having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, more preferably at least 95%
    identity to SEQ ID No. 3, SEQ ID No. 5 or SEQ ID No. 7. More preferably, the
25  immunobinder is or comprises SEQ ID No. 3, SEQ ID No. 5 or SEQ ID No. 7.
            In another embodiment, in order to improve antigen binding, the method may
    further comprise the step of substituting acceptor framework residues by donor
   residues which are involved in antigen binding.
            In exemplary embodiments of the methods of the invention, the amino acid
30  sequence of the CDR donor antibody is first identified and the sequences aligned
    using conventional sequence alignment tools (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and
    Blossum matrices). The introduction of gaps and nomenclature of residue positions
   may be done using a conventional antibody numbering system. For example, the
    AHo numbering system for immunoglobulin variable domains may be used. The

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                    20
    Kabat numbering scheme may also be applied since it is the most widely adopted
    standard for numbering the residues in an antibody. Kabat numbering may e.g. be
    assigned assigned using the SUBIM program. This program analyses variable regions
    of an antibody sequence and numbers the sequence according to the system
 5  established by Kabat and co-workers (Deret et al 1995). The definition of framework
    and CDR regions is generally done following the Kabat definition which is based on
    sequence variability and is the most commonly used. However, for CDR-H 1, the
   designation is preferably a combination of the definitions of Kabat's, mean contact
   data generated by analysis of contacts between antibody and antigen of a subset of 3D
10 complex structures (MacCallum et al., 1996) and Chotia's which is based on the
   location of the structural loop regions (see also Fig. 1). Conversion tables for the two
   different numbering systems used to identify amino acid residue positions in antibody
   heavy and light chain variable regions are provided in A. Honegger, J.Mol.Biol. 309
   (2001) 657-670. The Kabat numbering system is described further in Kabat et al.
15 (Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth
   Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91
   3242). The AHo numbering system is described further in Honegger, A. and
   Pluckthun, A. (2001) J Mol. Biol. 309:657-670).
            The variable domains of the rabbit monoclonal antibodies may e.g. be
20 classified into corresponding human sub-groups using e.g. an EXCEL implementation
   of sequence analysis algorithms and classification methods based on analysis of the
   human antibody repertoire (Knappik et al., 2000, JMol Biol. Feb 11;296(1):57-86).
            CDR conformations may be assigned to the donor antigen binding regions,
   subsequently residue positions required to maintain the different canonical structures
25 can also be identified. The CDR canonical structures for five of the six antibody
   hypervariable regions of rabbit antibodies (LI, L2, L3, HI and H2) are determined
   using Chothia's (1989) definition.
            In a preferred embodiment, the CDRs are generated, identified and isolated
   according to the following method: B-cells, preferably rabbit B-cells, are incubated
30 with (i) target antigens (preferably purified) or (ii) with cells expressing the target
   antigen on their surface.
            In case (ii), said cells expressing the target antigen may e.g. be mammalian
   cells, preferably CHO or HEK293 cells, yeast cells, preferably yeast spheroblasts, or
   bacterial cells which naturally express the target of choice or are transformed to

   WO 2009/155726                                                             PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   21
    express the target protein on their surface. Upon expression, the target antigen may be
    expressed on the cell surface either integrated or attached to the cell membrane. The
    cells may e.g. be cultivated as isolated strains in cell culture or be isolated from their
    natural environment, e.g. a tissue, an organ or an organism.
 5          Providing the target antigen expressed on the surface of cells, i.e. case (ii), is
    especially preferred for transmembrane proteins, even more preferably for multi
    membrane-spanning proteins, such as GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) or ion
    channels or any other protein of which the native conformation is difficult to maintain
   upon recombinant expression and purification. Traditional immunization with the
10 recombinant protein is in these cases inadvisable or impossible due to loss of native
    conformation of integral membrane proteins/complexes during the purification
    process or due to insufficient amounts of pure protein. In a preferred embodiment of
    the invention, a mammal, more preferably a rabbit, is immunized with DNA instead
    of recombinant protein e.g. by a DNA vaccination protocol as disclosed in
15  WO/2004/087216. DNA vaccination induces a rapid immune response against a
    native antigen. Since no recombinant protein is needed, this technology is on one hand
    very cost-effective, on the other hand, and more importantly, this method allows for
    native expression of integral membrane complexes and/or multi-membrane-spanning
    membrane proteins. The B-cells may be isolated from said immunized mammal,
20  preferably of said rabbit, or alternatively be naive B-cells.
             In a subsequent step of said method B-cells, preferably memory B-cells, are
    isolated from lymphatic organs of the immunized animal (such as spleen or lymph
    nodes), preferably of immunized rabbits. The B-cells are incubated in a mixture with
    either cells expressing the antigen on their surface or with fluorescence-labeled
25  soluble antigen. B-cells that express target specific antibodies on their surface and
    consequently bind to the target antigen or to the target antigen expressed on the cell
    surface are isolated. In a much preferred embodiment, the B-cells and/or the target
    cells are stained to allow for isolation via flow cytometry based sorting of B
    cell/target cell or B-cell/antigen complexes. Flow cytometry normally measures the
30  fluorescence emitted by single cells when' they cross a laser beam. However, some
    researchers have already used cytometers to investigate cell-cell interactions, for
     example adhesion mediated by cadherins (Panorchan et al, 2006, J. Cell Science, 119,
     66-74; Leong et Hibma, 2005, J. Immunol. Methods, 302, 116-124) or integrins
     (Gawaz et al, 1991, J. Clin. Invest, 88, 1128-1134). Thus, in case (ii), cells expressing

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   22
    the target of choice are stained with an intracellular fluorescent dye (for example
    calcein). B-cells are stained with fluorescent antibodies binding to cell surface
    specific markers. Thus, bi-color "events" may be selected, consisting in two cells
    adhering to each other through B-cell receptor-target interactions (see Fig. 2).
 5          As IgG have generally a higher affinity as IgMs, preferably, positive B-cells
    expressing IgG but not IgM on their surface (which is characteristic for memory B
   cells) are selected. For said purpose, multicolor staining is preferably used, where
   antibodies specific for IgG and IgM are differentially labeled, e.g. with APC and
   FITC, respectively.
10          In one particular embodiment, a read-out for B-cell sorting can also select for
   the ability of this interaction to functionally block/activate receptor signaling. For
   example, B-cells could be incubated with cells that functionally express a GPCR (G
   protein-coupled receptor). An agonist that signals through a GPCR can be added to
   the mixture to induce GPCR mediated Ca2+ efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum.
15 In case an antibody presented on a B-cell would functionally block agonist signaling,
   Ca2+ efflux would consequently also be blocked by this cell-cell interaction. Ca2+
   efflux can be quantitatively measured by flow-cytometry. Therefore, only B
   cell/target cell conglomerates that either show increase or decrease in Ca2+ efflux
   would be sorted.
20          The selection step is followed by the cultivation of the B-cells under suitable
   conditions so that antibodies are secreted into the culture medium. The produced
   antibodies are monoclonal antibodies. The cultivation may involve the use of a helper
   cell line, such as a thymoma helper cell line (e.g. EL4-B5, see Zubler et al, 1985, J.
   Immunol., 134(6): 3662-3668). Preferably, a validation step is performed testing the
25 generated antibodies for specific binding to the target, e.g. for excluding antibodies
   which are directed against a protein being expressed on the cell surface other than the
   target protein. For example, CELISA, i.e. a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA), where coating step is performed with entire cells, is suitable for said
   purpose. Said method allows for the evaluation of the selectivity and the ability of
30 antibodies to compete with the ligand.
            The antibodies generated in the above mentioned step are then analyzed to
   identify the CDRs of said antibodies. This may involve steps such as purifying the
   antibodies, elucidating their amino acid sequence and/or nucleic acid sequence.

   WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   23
             Finally, the CDRs may then be grafted onto acceptor frameworks e.g. by gene
    synthesis with the oligo extension method, preferably onto the acceptor frameworks
    described above. In one embodiment, the art recognized process of CDR grafting can
    be used to transfer donor CDRs into acceptor frameworks. In most cases, all three
 5  CDRs from the heavy chain are transplanted from the donor antibody to a single
    acceptor framework and all three CDRs from the light chain are transplanted to a
    different acceptor framework. It is expected that it should not always be necessary to
    transplant all the CDRs, as some CDRs may not be involved in binding to antigen,
    and CDRs with different sequences (and the same length) can have the same folding
10  (and therefore contacts from antigen to the main chain contacts could be retained
    despite the different sequences). Indeed single domains (Ward et al, 1989, Nature 341,
    pp.544-546) or even single CDRs (R. Taub et al, 1989, J. Biol Chem 264, pp.259-265)
    can have antigen binding activities alone. However, whether all or only some of the
    CDRs are transplanted, the intention of CDR grafting is to transplant the same, or
15  much the same antigen binding site, from animal to human antibodies (see, e.g., US
    Patent 5,225,539 (Winter)).
             In another embodiment, the CDRs of the donor antibody can be altered prior
    to or after their incorporation into the acceptor framework.
             Alternatively, characterization of the antibodies would be performed only in
20  their final immunobinder format. For this approach, CDR sequences of antibodies
    expressed on sorted B-cells are retrieved by RT-PCR from either the cultured sorted
    B-cells or from single sorted B-cells directly. For said purpose, mulitplication of B
    cells and/or the validation step described above and/or the analyzation step as
    described above may not be necessary. Combination of two pools of partially
25  overlapping oligonucleotides in which one oligonucleotide pool is coding for the
    CDRs and a second pool encodes the framework regions of a suitable immunobinder
    scaffold would allow to generate a humanized immunobinders in a one-step PCR
    procedure. Highthroughput sequencing, cloning and production would allow to
    perform clone selection based on the performance of the purified humanized
30  immunobinders, instead of characterizing secreted IgG in the cell culture supernatant.
    In a preferred embodiment thereof, the immunobinder is a scFv.
             However, grafting of CDRs may result in an impaired affinity of the generated
    immunobinder to the antigen due to framework residues which are in contact with the
    antigen. Such interactions may be a result of somatic hypermutation. Therefore, it

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  24
    may still be required to graft such donor framework amino acids onto the framework
    of the humanized antibody. Amino acid residues from the non-human immunobinder
    involved in antigen binding may be identified by examination of rabbit monoclonal
    antibody variable region sequences and structures. Each residue in the CDR donor
 5  framework that differs from the germline may be considered as relevant. If the closest
    germline cannot be established, the sequence can be compared against the subgroup
    consensus or the consensus of rabbit sequences with a high percentage of similarity.
    Rare framework residues are considered as possible result of somatic hypermutation
    and therefore as playing a role in binding.
10          The antibodies of the invention may be further optimized to show enhanced
    functional properties, e.g., enhanced solubility and/or stability. In certain
   embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are optimized according to the
    "functional consensus" methodology disclosed in PCT Application Serial No.
   PCT/EP2008/001958, entitled "Sequence Based Engineering and Optimization of
15  Single Chain Antibodies", filed on March 12, 2008, which is incorporated herein by
   reference.
             For example, the immunobinders of the invention can be compared with a
    database of functionally-selected scFvs is used to identify amino acid residue
   positions that are either more or less tolerant of variability than the corresponding
20  positions in immunobinder, thereby indicating that such identified residue positions
    may be suitable for engineering to improve functionality such as stability and/or
    solubility.

            In other embodiments, the immunobinders of the invention comprise one or
    more of the stability enhancing mutations described in U.S. Provisional Application
    Serial No. 61/075,692, entitled "Solubility Optimization of Immunobinders", filed on

    solubility enhancing mutation at an amino acid position selected from the group of
    heavy chain amino acid positions consisting of 12, 103 and 144 (AHo Numbering
    convention). In one preferred embodiment, the immunobinder comprises one or more
    substitutions selected from the group consisting of: (a) Serine (S) at heavy chain
25  amino acid position 12; (b) Serine (S) or Threonine (T) at heavy chain amino acid
    position 103; and (c) Serine (S) or Threonine (T) at heavy chain amino acid position

 5          One can use any of a variety of available methods to produce a humanized
    antibody comprising a mutation as described above.
            Accordingly, the present invention provides an immunobinder humanized
    according to the method described herein.
            In certain preferred embodiments, the target antigen of said immunobinder is
10  VEGF or TNFa.
            The polypeptides described in the present invention or generated by a method
   of the present invention can, for example, be synthesized using techniques known in
   the art. Alternatively nucleic acid molecules encoding the desired variable regions
   can be synthesized and the polypeptides produced by recombinant methods.
15          For example, once the sequence of a humanized variable region has been
   decided upon, that variable region or a polypeptide comprising it can be made by
   techniques well known in the art of molecular biology. More specifically,
   recombinant DNA techniques can be used to produce a wide range of polypeptides by
   transforming a host cell with a nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a DNA sequence that
20 encodes the desired variable region (e.g., a modified heavy or light chain; the variable
   domains thereof, or other antigen-binding fragments thereof)).
            In one embodiment, one can prepare an expression vector including a
   promoter that is operably linked to a DNA sequence that encodes at least VH or VL. If
   necessary, or desired, one can prepare a second expression vector including a
25 promoter that is operably linked to a DNA sequence that encodes the complementary
   variable domain (i.e., where the parent expression vector encodes VH, the second
   expression vector encodes VL and vice versa). A cell line (e.g., an immortalized
   mammalian cell line) can then be transformed with one or both of the expression
   vectors and cultured under conditions that permit expression of the chimeric variable
30 domain or chimeric antibody (see, e.g., International Patent Application No.
   PCT/GB85/00392 to Neuberger et. al.).
            In one embodiment, variable regions comprising donor CDRs and acceptor FR
   amino acid sequences can be made and then changes introduced into the nucleic acid
   molecules to effect the CDR amino acid substitution.

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222

            Exemplary art recognized methods for making a nucleic acid molecule
    encoding an amino acid sequence variant of a polypeptide include, but are not limited
   to, preparation by site-directed (or oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis, PCR
   mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared DNA encoding the
 5 polypeptide.
            Site-directed mutagenesis is a preferred method for preparing substitution
   variants. This technique is well known in the art (see, e.g., Carter et al. Nucleic Acids
   Res. 13:4431-4443 (1985) and Kunkel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488
   (1987)). Briefly, in carrying out site-directed mutagenesis of DNA, the parent DNA is
10 altered by first hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a
   single strand of such parent DNA. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to
   synthesize an entire second strand, using the hybridized oligonucleotide as a primer,
   and using the single strand of the parent DNA as a template. Thus, the oligonucleotide
   encoding the desired mutation is incorporated in the resulting double-stranded DNA.
15          PCR mutagenesis is also suitable for making amino acid sequence variants of
   polypeptides. See Higuchi, in PCR Protocols, pp.177-183 (Academic Press, 1990);
   and Vallette et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 17:723-733 (1989). Briefly, when small amounts
   of template DNA are used as starting material in a PCR, primers that differ slightly in
   sequence from the corresponding region in a template DNA can be used to generate
20 relatively large quantities of a specific DNA fragment that differs from the template
   sequence only at the positions where the primers differ from the template.
            Another method for preparing variants, cassette mutagenesis, is based on the
   technique described by Wells et al., Gene 34:315-323 (1985). The starting material is
   the plasmid (or other vector) comprising the DNA to be mutated. The codon(s) in the
25 parent DNA to be mutated are identified. There must be a unique restriction
   endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutation site(s). If no such restriction
   sites exist, they may be generated using the above-described oligonucleotide-mediated
   mutagenesis method to introduce them at appropriate locations in the DNA encoding
   the polypeptide. The plasmid DNA is cut at these sites to linearize it. A double
30 stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction
   sites but containing the desired mutation(s) is synthesized using standard procedures,
   wherein the two strands of the oligonucleotide are synthesized separately and then
   hybridized together using standard techniques. This double-stranded oligonucleotide
   is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 5' and 3' ends that are

   WO 2009/155726                                                             PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   30
   compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly ligated
   to the plasmid. This plasmid now contains the mutated DNA sequence.
            A variable region generated by the methods of the invention can be re
   modeled and further altered to further increase antigen binding. Thus, the steps
 5 described above can be preceded or followed by additional steps, including, e.g.
   affinity maturation. In addition, empirical binding data can be used for further
   optimization.
            It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the polypeptides of
   the invention may further be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence, but
10 not in desired activity. For example, additional nucleotide substitutions leading to
   amino acid substitutions at "non-essential" amino acid residues may be made to the
   protein For example, a nonessential amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin
   polypeptide may be replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side
   chain family. In another embodiment, a string of amino acids can be replaced with a
15 structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family
   members, i.e., a conservative substitution, in which an amino acid residue is replaced
   with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain, may be made.
            Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined
   in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side
20 chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine,
   asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains
   (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine,
   tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and
   aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).
25           Aside from amino acid substitutions, the present invention contemplates other
   modifications, e.g., to Fc region amino acid sequences in order to generate an Fe
   region variant with altered effector function. One may, for example, delete one or
   more amino acid residues of the Fc region in order to reduce or enhance binding to an
   FcR. In one embodiment, one or more of the Fc region residues can be modified in
30 order to generate such an Fc region variant. Generally, no more than one to about ten
   Fe region residues will be deleted according to this embodiment of the invention. The
   Fe region herein comprising one or more amino acid deletions will preferably retain at
    least about 80%, and preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about
    95%, of the starting Fc region or of a native sequence human Fc region.

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   31
           One may also make amino acid insertion Fc region variants, which variants
   have altered effector function. For example, one may introduce at least one amino
   acid residue (e.g. one to two amino acid residues and generally no more than ten
   residues) adjacent to one or more of the Fc region positions identified herein as
 5 impacting FcR binding. By "adjacent" is meant within one to two amino acid residues
   of an Fc region residue identified herein. Such Fc region variants may display
   enhanced or diminished FcRn binding.
           Such Fc region variants will generally comprise at least one amino acid
   modification in the Fc region. In one embodiment amino acid modifications may be
10 combined. For example, the variant Fc region may include two, three, four, five, etc
   substitutions therein, e.g. of the specific Fc region positions identified herein. In
   another embodiment, a polypeptide may have altered binding to FcRn and to another
   Fc receptor.
15         In one embodiment, the polypeptides described in the present invention or
   generated by a method of the present invention, e.g., humanized Ig variable regions
   and/or polypeptides comprising humanized Ig variable regions may be produced by
   recombinant methods. For example, a polynucleotide sequence encoding a
   polypeptide can be inserted in a suitable expression vector for recombinant
20 expression. Where the polypeptide is an antibody, polynucleotides encoding
   additional light and heavy chain variable regions, optionally linked to constant
   regions, may be inserted into the same or different expression vector. An affinity tag
   sequence (e.g. a His(6) tag) may optionally be attached or included within the
   polypeptide sequence to facilitate downstream purification. The DNA segments
25 encoding immunoglobulin chains are the operably linked to control sequences in the
   expression vector(s) that ensure the expression of immunoglobulin polypeptides.
   Expression control sequences include, but are not limited to, promoters (e.g.,
   naturally-associated or heterologous promoters), signal sequences, enhancer elements,
   and transcription termination sequences. Preferably, the expression control sequences
30 are eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable of transforming or transfecting
   eukaryotic host cells. Once the vector has been incorporated into the appropriate host,
   the host is maintained under conditions suitable for high level expression of the
   nucleotide sequences, and the collection and purification of the polypeptide.

             These expression vectors are typically replicable in the host organisms either
    as episomes or as an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA. Commonly,
    expression vectors contain selection markers (e.g., ampicillin-resistance, hygromycin
    resistance, tetracycline resistance or neomycin resistance) to permit detection of those
 5  cells transformed with the desired DNA sequences (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
    No. 4,704,362).
             E. coli is one prokaryotic host particularly useful for cloning the
    polynucleotides (e.g., DNA sequences) of the present invention. Other microbial
    hosts suitable for use include bacilli, such as Bacillus subtilus, and other
10  enterobacteriaceae, such as Salmonella, Serratia,and various Pseudomonasspecies.
             Other microbes, such as yeast, are also useful for expression. Saccharomyces
   and Pichiaare exemplary yeast hosts, with suitable vectors having expression control
   sequences (e.g., promoters), an origin of replication, termination sequences and the
   like as desired. Typical promoters include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and other
15 glycolytic enzymes. Inducible yeast promoters include, among others, promoters
   from alcohol dehydrogenase, isocytochrome C, and enzymes responsible for
   methanol, maltose, and galactose utilization.
            Within the scope of the present invention, E. coli and S. cerevisiae are
   preferred host cells.
20          In addition to microorganisms, mammalian tissue culture may also be used to
   express and produce the polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., polynucleotides
   encoding immunoglobulins or fragments thereof). See Winnacker, From Genes to
   Clones, VCH Publishers, N.Y., N.Y. (1987). Eukaryotic cells are actually preferred,
   because a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting heterologous proteins
25 (e.g., intact immunoglobulins) have been developed in the art, and include CHO cell
   lines, various Cos cell lines, HeLa cells, 293 cells, myeloma cell lines, transformed B
   cells, and hybridomas. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression
   control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, and an enhancer
   (Queen et al., Immunol. Rev. 89:49 (1986)), and necessary processing information
30 sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and
   transcriptional terminator sequences. Preferred expression control sequences are
   promoters derived from immunoglobulin genes, SV40, adenovirus, bovine papilloma
   virus, cytomegalovirus and the like. See Co et al., J. Immunol. 148:1149 (1992).

   WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222

             The vectors containing the polynucleotide sequences of interest (e.g., the
   heavy and light chain encoding sequences and expression control sequences) can be
   transferred into the host cell by well-known methods, which vary depending on the
   type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized
 5 for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment, electroporation,
   lipofection, biolistics or viral-based transfection may be used for other cellular hosts.
   (See generally Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual (Cold
   Spring Harbor Press, 2nd ed., 1989). Other methods used to transform mammalian
   cells include the use of polybrene, protoplast fusion, liposomes, electroporation, and
10 microinjection (see generally, Sambrook et al., supra). For production of transgenic
   animals, transgenes can be microinjected into fertilized oocytes, or can be
   incorporated into the genome of embryonic stem cells, and the nuclei of such cells
   transferred into enucleated oocytes.
            The subject polypeptide can also be incorporated in transgenes for introduction
15 into the genome of a transgenic animal and subsequent expression, e.g., in the milk of
   a transgenic animal (see, e.g., Deboer et al. 5,741,957; Rosen 5,304,489; and Meade
   5,849,992. Suitable transgenes include coding sequences for light and/or heavy
   chains in operable linkage with a promoter and enhancer from a mammary gland
   specific gene, such as casein or beta lactoglobulin.
20         Polypeptides can be expressed using a single vector or two vectors. For
   example, antibody heavy and light chains may be cloned on separate expression
   vectors and co-transfected into cells.
            In one embodiment, signal sequences may be used to facilitate expression of
   polypeptides of the invention.
25          Once expressed, the polypeptides can be purified according to standard
   procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns
   (e.g., protein A or protein G), column chromatography, HPLC purification, gel
   electrophoresis and the like (see generally Scopes, Protein Purification (Springer
   Verlag, N.Y., (1982)).

            Either the humanized Ig variable regions or polypeptides comprising them can
   be expressed by host cells or cell lines in culture. They can also be expressed in cells
    in vivo. The cell line that is transformed (e.g., transfected) to produce the altered
   antibody can be an immortalized mammalian cell line, such as those of lymphoid
 5 origin (e.g., a myeloma, hybridoma, trioma or quadroma cell line). The cell line can
   also include normal lymphoid cells, such as B-cells, that have been immortalized by
   transformation with a virus (e.g., the Epstein-Barr virus).
            Although typically the cell line used to produce the polypeptide is a
   mammalian cell line, cell lines from other sources (such as bacteria and yeast) can
10 also be used. In particular, E. coli-derived bacterial strains can be used, especially,
   e.g., phage display.
            Some immortalized lymphoid cell lines, such as myeloma cell lines, in their
   normal state, secrete isolated Ig light or heavy chains. If such a cell line is
   transformed with a vector that expresses an altered antibody, prepared during the
15 process of the invention, it will not be necessary to carry out the remaining steps of
   the process, provided that the normally secreted chain is complementary to the
   variable domain of the Ig chain encoded by the vector prepared earlier.
            If the immortalized cell line does not secrete or does not secrete a
   complementary chain, it will be necessary to introduce into the cells a vector that
20 encodes the appropriate complementary chain or fragment thereof.
            In the case where the immortalized cell line secretes a complementary light or
   heavy chain, the transformed cell line may be produced for example by transforming a
   suitable bacterial cell with the vector and then fusing the bacterial cell with the
   immortalized cell line (e.g., by spheroplast fusion). Alternatively, the DNA may be
25 directly introduced into the immortalized cell line by electroporation.
            In one embodiment, a humanized Ig variable region as described in the present
   invention or generated by a method of the present invention can be present in an
   antigen-binding fragment of any antibody. The fragments can be recombinantly
   produced and engineered, synthesized, or produced by digesting an antibody with a
30 proteolytic enzyme. For example, the fragment can be a Fab fragment; digestion with
   papain breaks the antibody at the region, before the inter-chain (i.e., VH-VH)
   disulphide bond, that joins the two heavy chains. This results in the formation of two
   identical fragments that contain the light chain and the VH and CHI domains of the
   heavy chain. Alternatively, the fragment can be an F(ab') 2 fragment. These fragments

    WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   35
     can be created by digesting an antibody with pepsin, which cleaves the heavy chain
     after the inter-chain disulfide bond, and results in a fragment that contains both
     antigen-binding sites. Yet another alternative is to use a "single chain" antibody.
     Single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments can be constructed in a variety of ways. For
  5  example, the C-terminus of VH can be linked to the N-terminus of VL. Typically, a
     linker (e.g., (GGGGS) 4) is placed between VH and VL. However, the order in which
     the chains can be linked can be reversed, and tags that facilitate detection or
    purification (e.g., Myc-, His-, or FLAG-tags) can be included (tags such as these can
    be appended to any antibody or antibody fragment of the invention; their use is not
 10 restricted to scFv). Accordingly, and as noted below, tagged antibodies are within the
    scope of the present invention. In alternative embodiments, the antibodies described
    herein, or generated by the methods described herein, can be heavy chain dimers or
    light chain dimers. Still further, an antibody light or heavy chain, or portions thereof,
    for example, a single domain antibody (DAb), can be used.
15                      In another embodiment, a humanized Ig variable region as described
    in the present invention or generated by a method of the present invention is present in
    a single chain antibody (ScFv) or a minibody (see e.g., US Pat No. 5,837,821 or WO
    94/09817A1). Minibodies are dimeric molecules made up of two polypeptide chains
    each comprising an ScFv molecule (a single polypeptide comprising one or more
20  antigen binding sites, e.g., a VL domain linked by a flexible linker to a VH domain
    fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide). ScFv molecules can be constructed
    in a VH-linker-VL orientation or VL-linker-VH orientation. The flexible hinge that
    links the VL and VH domains that make up the antigen binding site preferably
    comprises from about 10 to about 50 amino acid residues. An exemplary connecting
25  peptide for this purpose is (Gly4Ser)3 (Huston et al.. (1988). PNAS, 85:5879). Other
    connecting peptides are known in the art.
                        Methods of making single chain antibodies are well known in the
    art, e.g., Ho et al. (1989), Gene, 77:5 1; Bird et al. (1988), Science 242:423;
    Pantoliano et al. (1991), Biochemistry 30:10117; Milenic et al. (1991), Cancer
30  Research, 51:6363; Takkinen et al. (1991), ProteinEngineering 4:837. Minibodies
    can be made by constructing an ScFv component and connecting peptide-CH
                                                                                     3
    component using methods described in the art (see, e.g., US patent 5,837,821 or WO
    94/09817A1). These components can be isolated from separate plasmids as
    restriction fragments and then ligated and recloned into an appropriate vector.

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                    36
   Appropriate assembly can be verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequence
   analysis. In one embodiment, a minibody of the invention comprises a connecting
   peptide. In one embodiment, the connecting peptide comprises a Gly/Ser linker, e.g.,
   GGGSSGGGSGG.
 5                      In another embodiment, a tetravalent minibody can be constructed.
   Tetravalent minibodies can be constructed in the same manner as minibodies, except
   that two ScFv molecules are linked using a flexible linker, e.g., having an amino acid
   sequence (G4 S)4G3AS.
                        In another embodiment, a humanized variable region as described in
10 the present invention or generated by a method of the present invention can be present
   in a diabody. Diabodies are similar to scFv molecules, but usually have a short (less
   than 10 and preferably 1-5) amino acid residue linker connecting both variable
   domains, such that the VL and VH domains on the same polypeptide chain can not
   interact. Instead, the VL and VH domain of one polypeptide chain interact with the VH
15 and VL domain (respectively) on a second polypeptide chain (WO 02/02781).
                        In another embodiment, a humanized variable region of the
   invention can be present in an immunoreactive fragment or portion of an antibody
   (e.g. an scFv molecule, a minibody, a tetravalent minibody, or a diabody) operably
   linked to an FcR binding portion. In an exemplary embodiment, the FcR binding
20 portion is a complete Fc region.
            Preferably, the humanization methods described herein result in Ig variable
   regions in which the affinity for antigen is not substantially changed compared to the
   donor antibody.
            In one embodiment, polypeptides comprising the variable domains of the
25  instant invention bind to antigens with a binding affinity greater than (or equal to) an
    association constant Ka of about 105 M~r, 106 M-1, 107 M1, 108 M-1, 101 M-1, 1010 M ~1,
    10"  MW, or 1012 M-1, (including affinities intermediate of these values).
             Affinity, avidity, and/or specificity can be measured in a variety of ways.
    Generally, and regardless of the precise manner in which affinity is defined or
30  measured, the methods of the invention improve antibody affinity when they generate
    an antibody that is superior in any aspect of its clinical application to the antibody (or
    antibodies) from which it was made (for example, the methods of the invention are
    considered effective or successful when a modified antibody can be administered at a

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   37
    lower dose or less frequently or by a more convenient route of administration than an
    antibody (or antibodies) from which it was made).
            More specifically, the affinity between an antibody and an antigen to which it
   binds can be measured by various assays, including, e.g., an ELISA assay, a BiaCore
 5 assay or the KinExATM 3000 assay (available from Sapidyne Instruments (Boise, ID)).
   Briefly, sepharose beads are coated with antigen (the antigen used in the methods of
   the invention can be any antigen of interest (e.g., a cancer antigen; a cell surface
   protein or secreted protein; an antigen of a pathogen (e.g., a bacterial or viral antigen
   (e.g., an HIV antigen, an influenza antigen, or a hepatitis antigen)), or an allergen) by
10 covalent attachment. Dilutions of antibody to be tested are prepared and each dilution
   is added to the designated wells on a plate. A detection antibody (e.g. goat anti
   human IgG -HRP conjugate) is then added to each well followed by a chromagenic
   substrate (, e.g. HRP). The plate is then read in ELISA plate reader at 450 nM, and
   EC50 values are calculated. (It is understood, however, that the methods described
15 here are generally applicable; they are not limited to the production of antibodies that
   bind any particular antigen or class of antigens.)
            Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that determining affinity is not
   always as simple as looking at a single figure. Since antibodies have two arms, their
   apparent affinity is usually much higher than the intrinsic affinity between the
20 variable region and the antigen (this is believed to be due to avidity). Intrinsic affinity
   can be measured using scFv or Fab fragments.
                       In another aspect, the present invention features bispecific
   molecules comprising a humanized rabbit antibody, or a fragment thereof, of the
25  invention. An antibody of the invention, or antigen-binding portions thereof, can be
    derivatized or linked to another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein
    (e.g., another antibody or ligand for a receptor) to generate a bispecific molecule that
    binds to at least two different binding sites or target molecules. The antibody of the
    invention may be derivatized or linked to more than one other functional molecule to
30  generate multispecific molecules that bind to more than two different binding sites
    and/or target molecules; such multispecific molecules are also intended to be
    encompassed by the term "bispecific molecule" as used herein. To create a bispecific
    molecule of the invention, an antibody of the invention can be functionally linked
    (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to

   WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   38
   one or more other binding molecules, such as another antibody, antibody fragment,
   tumor specific or pathogen specific antigens, peptide or binding mimetic, such that a
   bispecific molecule results. Accordingly, the present invention includes bispecific
   molecules comprising at least one first binding molecule having specificity for a first
 5 target and a second binding molecule having specificity for one or more additional
   target epitope.
            In one embodiment, the bispecific molecules of the invention comprise as a
   binding specificity at least one antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof, including,
   e.g., an Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 , Fv, or a single chain Fv. The antibody may also be a light
10 chain or heavy chain dimer, or any minimal fragment thereof such as a Fv or a single
   chain construct as described in Ladner et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778, the contents
   of which is expressly incorporated by reference.
           While human monoclonal antibodies are preferred, other antibodies which can
   be employed in the bispecific molecules of the invention are murine, chimeric and
15 humanized monoclonal antibodies.
           The bispecific molecules of the present invention can be prepared by
   conjugating the constituent binding specificities using methods known in the art. For
   example, each binding specificity of the bispecific molecule can be generated
   separately and then conjugated to one another. When the binding specificities are
20 proteins or peptides, a variety of coupling or cross-linking agents can be used for
   covalent conjugation. Examples of cross-linking agents include protein A,
   carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5'-dithiobis(2
   nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3-(2
   pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)
25 cyclohaxane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al. (1984) J. Exp.
   Med. 160:1686; Liu, MA et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 82:8648). Other
   methods include those described in Paulus (1985) Behring Ins. Mitt. No. 78, 118-132;
   Brennan et al. (1985) Science 229:81-83), and Glennie et al. (1987) J Immunol. 139:
   2367-2375). Preferred conjugating agents are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both available
30 from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL).
            When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated via
   sulfhydryl bonding of the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  39
   particularly preferred embodiment, the hinge region is modified to contain an odd
   number of sulfhydryl residues, preferably one, prior to conjugation.
            Alternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and
   expressed and assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful
 5 where the bispecific molecule is a mAb x mAb, mAb x Fab, Fab x F(ab') 2 or ligand x
   Fab fusion protein. A bispecific molecule of the invention can be a single chain
   molecule comprising one single chain antibody and a binding determinant, or a single
   chain bispecific molecule comprising two binding determinants. Bispecific molecules
   may comprise at least two single chain molecules. Methods for preparing bispecific
10 molecules are described for example in U.S. Patent Number 5,260,203; U.S. Patent
   Number 5,455,030; U.S. Patent Number 4,881,175; U.S. Patent Number 5,132,405;
   U.S. Patent Number 5,091,513; U.S. Patent Number 5,476,786; U.S. Patent Number
   5,013,653; U.S. Patent Number 5,258,498; and U.S. Patent Number 5,482,858.
            Binding of the bispecific molecules to their specific targets can be confirmed
15 by, for example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay
   (RIA), flow cytometry based single cell sorting (e.g. FACS analysis), bioassay (e.g.,
   growth inhibition), or Western Blot assay. Each of these assays generally detects the
   presence of protein-antibody complexes of particular interest by employing a labeled
   reagent (e.g., an antibody) specific for the complex of interest. For example, the
20 antibody complexes can be detected using e.g., an enzyme-linked antibody or
   antibody fragment which recognizes and specifically binds to the antibody-VEGF
   complexes. Alternatively, the complexes can be detected using any of a variety of
   other immunoassays. For example, the antibody can be radioactively labeled and
   used in a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (see, for example, Weintraub, B., Principles of
25 Radioimmunoassays, Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques,
   The Endocrine Society, March, 1986, which is incorporated by reference herein). The
   radioactive isotope can be detected by such means as the use of a y counter or a
   scintillation counter or by autoradiography.
30          In another aspect, the present invention features a humanized rabbit antibody,
   or a fragment thereof, conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, such as a cytotoxin, a drug
   (e.g., an immunosuppressant) or a radiotoxin. Such conjugates are referred to herein
   as "immunoconjugates". Immunoconjugates that include one or more cytotoxins are

    WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   40
     referred to as "immunotoxins." A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that
     is detrimental to (e.g., kills) cells. Examples include taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin
     D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine,
     vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione,
  5  mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, I -dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids,
     procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs
     thereof. Therapeutic agents also include, for example, antimetabolites (e.g.,
     methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil
    decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil,
10  melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan,
    dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II)
    (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and
    doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin,
    mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and
15  vinblastine).
             Other preferred examples of therapeutic cytotoxins that can be conjugated to
    an antibody of the invention include duocarmycins, calicheamicins, maytansines and
    auristatins, and derivatives thereof. An example of a calicheamicin antibody
    conjugate is commercially available (MylotargTM; Wyeth-Ayerst).
20           Cytoxins can be conjugated to antibodies of the invention using linker
    technology available in the art. Examples of linker types that have been used to
    conjugate a cytotoxin to an antibody include, but are not limited to, hydrazones,
    thioethers, esters, disulfides and peptide-containing linkers. A linker can be chosen
    that is, for example, susceptible to cleavage by low pH within the lysosomal
25  compartment or susceptible to cleavage by proteases, such as proteases preferentially
    expressed in tumor tissue such as cathepsins (e.g., cathepsins B, C, D).

            Antibodies of the present invention also can be conjugated to a radioactive
   isotope to generate cytotoxic radiopharmaceuticals, also referred to as
   radioimmunoconjugates. Examples of radioactive isotopes that can be conjugated to
   antibodies for use diagnostically or therapeutically include, but are not limited to,
 5 iodine,     indium"', yttrium 90 and lutetium' 77 . Method for preparing
   radioimmunconjugates are established in the art. Examples of
   radioimmunoconjugates are commercially available, including ZevalinTM (IDEC
   Pharmaceuticals) and BexxarTM (Corixa Pharmaceuticals), and similar methods can be
   used to prepare radioimmunoconjugates using the antibodies of the invention.
10          The antibody conjugates of the invention can be used to modify a given
   biological response, and the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical
   chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or
   polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for
   example, an enzymatically active toxin, or active fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin
15 A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor
   or interferon-y; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines,
   interleukin- 1 ("IL-I"), interleukin-2 ("IL-2"), interleukin-6 ("IL-6"), granulocyte
   macrophage colony stimulating factor ("GM-CSF"), granulocyte colony stimulating
   factor ("G-CSF"), or other growth factors.
20          Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well
   known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of
   Drugs In Cancer Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld

                       In one aspect the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations
   comprising humanized rabbit antibodies for the treatment disease. The term
   "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to preparations which are in such form as to
   permit the biological actvity of the antibody or antibody derivative to be
 5 unequivocally effective, and which contain no additional components which are toxic
   to the subjects to which the formulation would be administered. "Pharmaceutically
   acceptable" excipients (vehicles, additives) are those which can reasonably be
   administered to a subject mammal to provide an effective dose of the active ingredient
   employed.
10          A "stable" formulation is one in which the antibody or antibody derivative
   therein essentially retains its physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or
   biological activity upon storage. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein
   stability are available in the art and are reviewed in Peptide and Protein Drug

   Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time period.
   Preferably, the formulation is stable at room temperature (about 30" C) or at 400 C for
   at least 1 month and/or stable at about 2-80 C for at least 1 year for at least 2 years.
   Furthermore, the formulation is preferably stable following freezing (to, e.g., -70 C)
20 and thawing of the formulation.
            An antibody or antibody derivative "retains its physical stability" in a
   pharmaceutical formulation if it shows no signs of aggregation, precipitation and/or
   denaturation upon visual examination of color and/or clarity, or as measured by UV
   light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.
25          An antibody or antibody derivative "retains its chemical stability" in a
   pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the
   protein is considered to still retain its biological activity as defined below. Chemical
   stability can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the
   protein. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g. clipping) which can
30 be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and/or matrix-assisted
   laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS), for
   example. Other types of chemical alteration include charge alteration (e.g. occurring
   as a result of deamidation) which can be evaluated by ion-exchange chromatography,
   for example.

   WO 2009/155726                                                            PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   43
           An antibody or antibody derivative "retains its biological activity" in a
   pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the antibody at a given time is
   within about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at
   the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined in an antigen
 5 binding assay, for example. Other "biological activity" assays for antibodies are
   elaborated herein below.
           By "isotonic" is meant that the formulation of interest has essentially the same
   osmotic pressure as human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an
   osmotic pressure from about 250 to 350 mOsm. Isotonicity can be measured using a
10 vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer, for example.
           A "polyol" is a substance with multiple hydroxyl groups, and includes sugars
   (reducing and non-reducing sugars), sugar alcohols and sugar acids. Preferred polyols
   herein have a molecular weight which is less than about 600 kD (e.g. in the range
   from about 120 to about 400 kD). A "reducing sugar" is one which contains a
15 hemiacetal group that can reduce metal ions or react covalently with lysine and other
   amino groups in proteins and a "non-reducing sugar" is one which does not have these
   properties of a reducing sugar. Examples of reducing sugars are fructose, mannose,
   maltose, lactose, arabinose, xylose, ribose, rhamnose, galactose and glucose. Non
   reducing sugars include sucrose, trehalose, sorbose, melezitose and raffinose.
20 Mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, threitol, sorbitol and glycerol are examples of sugar
   alcohols. As to sugar acids, these include L-gluconate and metallic salts thereof.
   Where it is desired that the formulation is freeze-thaw stable, the polyol is preferably
   one which does not crystallize at freezing temperatures (e.g. -20 C) such that it
   destabilizes the antibody in the formulation. Non-reducing sugars such as sucrose and
25 trehalose are the preferred polyols herein, with trehalose being preferred over sucrose,
   because of the superior solution stability of trehalose.
           As used herein, "buffer" refers to a buffered solution that resists changes in pH
   by the action of its acid-base conjugate components. The buffer of this invention has a
   pH in the range from about 4.5 to about 6.0; preferably from about 4.8 to about 5.5;
30 and most preferably has a pH of about 5.0. Examples of buffers that will control the
   pH in this range include acetate (e.g. sodium acetate), succinate (such as sodium
    succinate), gluconate, histidine, citrate and other organic acid buffers. Where a freeze
   thaw stable formulation is desired, the buffer is preferably not phosphate.

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  44
            In a pharmacological sense, in the context of the present invention, a
   "therapeutically effective amount" of an antibody or antibody derivative refers to an
   amount effective in the prevention or treatment of a disorder for the treatment of
   which the antibody or antibody derivative is effective. A "disease/disorder" is any
 5 condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody or antibody derivative.
   This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological
   conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question.
            A "preservative" is a compound which can be included in the formulation to
   essentially reduce bacterial action therein, thus facilitating the production of a multi
10 use formulation, for example. Examples of potential preservatives include
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium chloride,
   benzalkonium chloride (a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides in
   which the alkyl groups are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other
   types of preservatives include aromatic alcohols such as phenol, butyl and benzyl
15 alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, catechol, resorcinol,
   cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m-cresol. The most preferred preservative herein is
   benzyl alcohol.
            The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising
   one or more antibodies or antibody derivative compounds, together with at least one
20 physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient. Pharmaceutical compositions may
   comprise, for example, one or more of water, buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or
   phosphate buffered saline), ethanol, mineral oil, vegetable oil, dimethylsulfoxide,
   carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins,
   adjuvants, polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine, antioxidants, chelating agents
25 such as EDTA or glutathione and/or preservatives. As noted above, other active
   ingredients may (but need not) be included in the pharmaceutical compositions
   provided herein.
             A carrier is a substance that may be associated with an antibody or antibody
   derivative prior to administration to a patient, often for the purpose of controlling
30  stability or bioavailability of the compound. Carriers for use within such formulations
    are generally biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable. Carriers include, for
    example, monovalent or multivalent molecules such as serum albumin (e.g., human or
    bovine), egg albumin, peptides, polylysine and polysaccharides such as aminodextran
    and polyamidoamines. Carriers also include solid support materials such as beads and

   WO 2009/155726                                                             PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   45
   microparticles comprising, for example, polylactate polyglycolate, poly(lactide-co
   glycolide), polyacrylate, latex, starch, cellulose or dextran. A carrier may bear the
   compounds in a variety of ways, including covalent bonding (either directly or via a
   linker group), noncovalent interaction or admixture.
 5          Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for any appropriate manner
   of administration, including, for example, topical, oral, nasal, rectal or parenteral
   administration. In certain embodiments, compositions in a form suitable for oral use
   are preferred. Such forms include, for example, pills, tablets, troches, lozenges,
   aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft
10 capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Within yet other embodiments, compositions provided
   herein may be formulated as a lyophilizate. The term parenteral as used herein
   includes subcutaneous, intradermal, intravascular (e.g., intravenous), intramuscular,
   spinal, intracranial, intrathecal and intraperitoneal injection, as well as any similar
   injection or infusion technique.
15          Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method
   known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and may contain
   one or more agents, such as sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agent, and
   preserving agents in order to provide appealing and palatable preparations. Tablets
   contain the active ingredient in admixture with physiologically acceptable excipients
20 that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. Such excipients include, for example,
   inert diluents (e.g., calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate
   or sodium phosphate), granulating and disintegrating agents (e.g., corn starch or
   alginic acid), binding agents (e.g., starch, gelatin or acacia) and lubricating agents
   (e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc). The tablets may be uncoated or they
25 may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the
   gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For
   example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monosterate or glyceryl distearate
   may be employed.
            Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules
30 wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent (e.g., calcium
   carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin), or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active
   ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium (e.g., peanut oil, liquid paraffin or
   olive oil). Aqueous suspensions contain the antibody or antibody derivative in
   admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such

   WO 2009/155726                                                              PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   46
   excipients include suspending agents (e.g., sodium carboxymethylcellulose,
   methylcellulose, hydropropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
   gum tragacanth and gum acacia); and dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., naturally
   occurring phosphatides such as lecithin, condensation products of an alkylene oxide
 5 with fatty acids such as polyoxyethylene stearate, condensation products of ethylene
   oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols such as heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol,
   condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids
   and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products
   of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides
10 such as polyethylene sorbitan monooleate). Aqueous suspensions may also comprise
   one or more preservatives, for example ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or
   more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening
   agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with
   sweetening agents, such as glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, or sucrose. Such
15 formulations may also comprise one or more demulcents, preservatives, flavoring
   agents, and/or coloring agents.
           Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a
   vegetable oil (e.g., arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil
   such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent such as
20 beeswax, hard paraffin, or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth
   above, and/or flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations.
   Such suspensions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as
   ascorbic acid.
           Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous
25 suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a
   dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable
   dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already
   mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and
   coloring agents, may also be present.
30         Pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of oil-in-water
   emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil (e.g., olive oil or arachis oil), a
   mineral oil (e.g., liquid paraffin), or a mixture thereof. Suitable emulsifying agents
   include naturally-occurring gums (e.g., gum acacia or gum tragacanth), naturally
   occurring phosphatides (e.g., soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived

   WO 2009/155726                                                             PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   47
   from fatty acids and hexitol), anhydrides (e.g., sorbitan monooleate), and
   condensation products of partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol with
   ethylene oxide (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate). An emulsion may also
   comprise one or more sweetening and/or flavoring agents.
 5          The pharmaceutical composition may be prepared as a sterile injectible
   aqueous or oleaginous suspension in which the modulator, depending on the vehicle
   and concentration used, is either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Such a
   composition may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing,
   wetting agents and/or suspending agents such as those mentioned above. Among the
10 acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, 1,3-butanediol,
   Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils
   may be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland
   fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition,
   fatty acids such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectible
15 compositions, and adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and/or buffering
   agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.
            Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as sustained release
   formulations (i.e., a formulation such as a capsule that effects a slow release of
   modulator following administration). Such formulations may generally be prepared
20 using well known technology and administered by, for example, oral, rectal, or
   subcutaneous implantation, or by implantation at the desired target site. Carriers for
   use within such formulations are biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable;
   preferably the formulation provides a relatively constant level of modulator release.
   The amount of an antibody or antibody derivative contained within a sustained release
25 formulation depends upon, for example, the site of implantation, the rate and expected
   duration of release and the nature of the disease/disorder to be treated or prevented.
            Antibody or antibody derivatives provided herein are generally administered
   in an amount that achieves a concentration in a body fluid (e.g., blood, plasma, serum,
   CSF, synovial fluid, lymph, cellular interstitial fluid, tears or urine) that is sufficient to
30  detectably bind to a target such as e.g. VEGF and prevent or inhibit such target
    mediated diseases/disorders, e.g. VEGF-mediated diseases/disorders. A dose is
    considered to be effective if it results in a discernible patient benefit as described
    herein. Preferred systemic doses range from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per
    kilogram of body weight per day (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day), with

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  48
    oral doses generally being about 5-20 fold higher than intravenous doses. The amount
    of antibody or antibody derivative that may be combined with the carrier materials to
   produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the
   particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between
 5 from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient.
            Pharmaceutical compositions may be packaged for treating conditions
   responsive to an antibody or antibody derivative directed e.g. to VEGF. Packaged
   pharmaceutical compositions may include a container holding a effective amount of
   at least one antibody or antibody derivative as described herein and instructions (e.g.,
10 labeling) indicating that the contained composition is to be used for treating a
   disease/disorder responsive to one antibody or antibody derivative following
   administration in the patient.
            The antibodies or antibody derivatives of the present invention can also be
   chemically modified. Preferred modifying groups are polymers, for example an
15 optionally substituted straight or branched chain polyalkene, polyalkenylene, or
   polyoxyalkylene polymer or a branched or unbranched polysaccharide. Such effector
   group may increase the half-live of the antibody in vivo. Particular examples of
   synthetic polymers include optionally substituted straight or branched chain
   poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG), poly(propyleneglycol), poly(vinylalcohol) or derivatives
20 thereof. Particular naturally occurring polymers include lactose, amylose, dextran,
   glycogen or derivatives thereof. The size of the polymer may be varied as desired, but
   will generally be in an average molecular weight range from 500 Da to 50000 Da. For
   local application where the antibody is designed to penetrate tissue, a preferred
   molecular weight of the polymer is around 5000 Da. The polymer molecule can be
25 attached to the antibody, in particular to the C-terminal end of the Fab fragment heavy
   chain via a covalently linked hinge peptide as described in W00194585. Regarding
   the attachment of PEG moieties, reference is made to "Poly(ethyleneglycol)
   Chemistry, Biotechnological and Biomedical Applications", 1992, J. Milton Harris
   (ed), Plenum Press, New York and "Bioconjugation Protein Coupling Techniques for
30 the Biomedical Sciences", 1998, M. Aslam and A. Dent, Grove Publishers, New
   York.
            After preparation of the antibody or antibody derivative of interest as
   described above, the pharmaceutical formulation comprising it is prepared. The
   antibody to be formulated has not been subjected to prior lyophilization and the

     WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  49
     formulation of interest herein is an aqueous formulation. Preferably the antibody or
     antibody derivative in the formulation is an antibody fragment, such as an scFv. The
     therapeutically effective amount of antibody present in the formulation is determined
     by taking into account the desired dose volumes and mode(s) of administration, for
  5  example. From about 0.1 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml, preferably from about 0.5 mg/ml
    to about 25 mg/ml and most preferably from about 2 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml is an
    exemplary antibody concentration in the formulation.
             An aqueous formulation is prepared comprising the antibody or antibody
    derivative in a pH-buffered solution. The buffer of this invention has a pH in the
10  range from about 4.5 to about 6.0, preferably from about 4.8 to about 5.5, and most
    preferably has a pH of about 5.0. Examples of buffers that will control the pH within
    this range include acetate (e.g. sodium acetate), succinate (such as sodium succinate),
    gluconate, histidine, citrate and other organic acid buffers. The buffer concentration
    can be from about 1 mM to about 50 mM, preferably from about 5 mM to about 30
15  mM, depending, for example, on the buffer and the desired isotonicity of the
    formulation. The preferred buffer is sodium acetate (about 10 mM), pH 5.0.
            A polyol, which acts as a tonicifier and may stabilize the antibody, is included
    in the formulation. In preferred embodiments, the formulation does not contain a
    tonicifying amount of a salt such as sodium chloride, as this may cause the antibody
20  or antibody derivative to precipitate and/or may result in oxidation at low pH. In
    preferred embodiments, the polyol is a non-reducing sugar, such as sucrose or
    trehalose. The polyol is added to the formulation in an amount which may vary with
    respect to the desired isotonicity of the formulation. Preferably the aqueous
    formulation is isotonic, in which case suitable concentrations of the polyol in the
25  formulation are in the range from about 1% to about 15% w/v, preferably in the range
    from about 2% to about 10% why, for example. However, hypertonic or hypotonic
    formulations may also be suitable. The amount of polyol added may also alter with
    respect to the molecular weight of the polyol. For example, a lower amount of a
    monosaccharide (e.g. mannitol) may be added, compared to a disaccharide (such as
30  trehalose).
            A surfactant is also added to the antibody or antibody derivative formulation.
    Exemplary surfactants include nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates (e.g.
    polysorbates 20, 80 etc) or poloxamers (e.g. poloxamer 188). The amount of
    surfactant added is such that it reduces aggregation of the formulated

    WO 2009/155726                                                             PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   50
    antibody/antibody derivative and/or minimizes the formation of particulates in the
    formulation and/or reduces adsorption. For example, the surfactant may be present in
    the formulation in an amount from about 0.001% to about 0.5%, preferably from
    about 0.005% to about 0.2% and most preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.1%.
 5         In one embodiment, the formulation contains the above-identified agents (i.e.
    antibody or antibody derivative, buffer, polyol and surfactant) and is essentially free
   of one or more preservatives, such as benzyl alcohol, phenol, m-cresol, chlorobutanol
   and benzethonium Cl. In another embodiment, a preservative may be included in the
   formulation, particularly where the formulation is a multidose formulation. The
10 concentration of preservative may be in the range from about 0.1% to about 2%, most
   preferably from about 0.5% to about 1%. One or more other pharmaceutically
   acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers such as those described in Remington's
   Pharmaceutical Sciences 21st edition, Osol, A. Ed. (2006) may be included in the
   formulation provided that they do not adversely affect the desired characteristics of
15 the formulation. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are non-toxic to
   recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include; additional
   buffering agents; co-solvents; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine;
   chelating agents such as EDTA; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes);
   biodegradable polymers such as polyesters; and/or salt-forming counterions such as
20 sodium.
           The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is
   readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to, or
   following, preparation of the formulation.
           The formulation is administered to a mammal in need of treatment with the
25 antibody, preferably a human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous
   administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by
   intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular,
   intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. In preferred embodiments,
   the formulation is administered to the mammal by intravenous administration. For
30 such purposes, the formulation may be injected using a syringe or via an IV line, for
   example.
           The appropriate dosage ("therapeutically effective amount") of the antibody
   will depend, for example, on the condition to be treated, the severity and course of the
   condition, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic

    WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   51
    purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody,
    the type of antibody used, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody
    or antibody derivative is suitably administered to the patent at one time or over a
    series of treatments and may be administered to the patent at any time from diagnosis
 5  onwards. The antibody or antibody derivative may be administered as the sole
    treatment or in conjunction with other drugs or therapies useful in treating the
    condition in question.
            As a general proposition, the therapeutically effective amount of the antibody
    or antibody derivative administered will be in the range of about 0.1 to about 50
10 mg/kg of patent body weight whether by one or more administrations, with the typical
   range of antibody used being about 0.3 to about 20 mg/kg, more preferably about 0.3
   to about 15 mg/kg, administered daily, for example. However, other dosage regimens
   may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional

     Materials andMethods
              In general, the practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise
  5  indicated, conventional techniques of chemistry, molecular biology, recombinant
     DNA technology, immunology (especially, e.g., antibody technology), and standard
    techniques of polypeptide preparation. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis,

    and other non-human monoclonal antibodies onto selected human antibody
15  frameworks is described in detail above. Examples of such grafting experiments are
    set forth below.
              For purposes of better understanding, grafts denominated "min" are those
    where CDRs were grafted onto framework 1.4 or a variable domain thereof, whereas
    grafts named "max" are those where CDRs were grafted onto framework 1.4 or a
20  variable domain thereof and wherein the framework further comprises donor
    framework residues which interact with the antigen.
    Example 1: Design of rFW1.4
         1.1.        Primary sequence analysis and database searching
25            1.1.1. Collection of Rabbit Immunoglobulin Sequences
                     Sequences of variable domains of rabbit mature antibodies and
    germlines were collected from different open source databases (e.g. Kabat database
    and IMGT) and entered into a customized database as one letter code amino acid
    sequences. For the entire analysis we used only the amino acid portion corresponding
30  to the V (variable) region. Sequences in the KDB database less than 70% complete or
    containing multiple undetermined residues in the framework regions were discarded.
    Sequences with more than 95% identity to any other sequence within the database
    were also excluded to avoid random noise in the analysis.
              1.1.2. Alignments and numbering of Rabbit Sequences

     WO 2009/155726                                                         PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                  53
                    Rabbit antibody sequences were aligned using conventional sequence
     alignment tools based on the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and Blossum matrices.
     The introduction of gaps and nomenclature of residue positions were done following
     AHo's numbering system for immunoglobulin variable domains (Honegger and
  5  Pluckthun, 2001). The Kabat numbering scheme was also applied in parallel since it is
    the most widely adopted standard for numbering the residues in an antibody. Kabat
    numbering was assigned using the SUBIM program. This program analyses variable
    regions of an antibody sequence and numbers the sequence according to the system
    established by Kabat and co-workers (Deret et al 1995).
10                  The definition of framework and CDR regions was done following the
    Kabat definition which is based on sequence variability and is the most commonly
    used. Nevertheless, CDR-H1 designation was a compromise between different
    definitions including, AbM's, kabat's, mean contact data generated by analysis of
    contacts between antibody and antigen of a subset of 3D complex structures
15  (MacCallum et al., 1996) and Chotia's which is based on the location of the structural
    loop regions (described above and shown in Fig. 1).
             1.1.3. Frequency and Conservation of residue positions
                    Amino acid sequence diversity was analyzed using a set of 423 rabbit
    sequences from the kabat database. The residue frequency, f(r), for each position, i, in
20  the mature rabbit sequences was calculated by the number of times that particular
    residue is observed within the data set divided by the total number of sequences. The
    degree of conservation for each position, i, was calculated using the Simpson's index,
    which takes into account the number of different amino acids present, as well as the
    relative abundance of each residue.

    where: N Total number of amino acids, r is the number of different amino acids
    present at each position and n is the number of residues of a particular amino acid
    type.
             1.1.4. Lineage Analysis of the rabbit V region
30                  Phylogeny analysis tools were used to study the rabbit repertoire.
    Amino acids sequences of the V region were clustered using both cluster and
    topological algorithms. The distance matrix was calculated for the whole array and

   WO 2009/155726                                                             PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                    54
   used as indication of the germline usage. Consensus sequence of each cluster was
   calculated and the nearest rabbit germline sequence counterpart identified. Also the
   overall consensus sequence was derived for the whole set of sequences.
               1.1.5. Assignment of human subgroup.
 5                    For each rabbit representative sequence of the different clusters, the
   most homologous human sub-group was identified using an EXCEL implementation
   of sequence analysis algorithms and classification methods based on analysis of the
   human antibody repertoire (Knappik et al., 2000).
          1.2.        Design of the human acceptor framework
10                    With the blueprint of the rabbit repertoire from the sequence analysis
   described above, residues in the framework generally involved in the positioning of
   rabbit CDRs were identified. Among the frameworks having high homology relative
   to the rabbit repertoire and the respective clusters, one having good biophysical
   properties was selected from a pool of fully human sequences. The selected
15 framework to serve as acceptor framework belongs to variable light chain subgroup
   kappa I and heavy variable chain subgroup III with the ESBATech's ID KI 27, a43
   correspondingly. This stable and soluble antibody framework has been identified by
   screening of a human spleen scFv library using a yeast-based screening method
   named "Quality Control" system (Auf der Maur et al., 2004) and was designated
20 "FW1.4". Although the stable and soluble framework sequence FW1.4 exhibits high
   homology, it was not the most homologous sequence available. The identified
   residues were incorporated in said acceptor framework to generate rFW1.4.
                      With the information for amino acid sequence diversity, germline
   usage and the structural features of the rabbit antibodies, we analyzed the FWI.4 for
25 compatibility of residue positions required to preserve the CDR conformation in the
   new human framework. We examined the variable regions of FWI.4 for compatibility
   of the following characteristics:
       i.             Residues that are part of the canonical sequences for loop structures.
      ii.             Framework residues located at the VL/VH interface.
30  iii.              The platform of residues directly underneath the CDRs
     iv.              Upper and lower core residues
      v.              Framework residues defining the subtype
          1.3.        Grafting of Rabbit CDRs

    WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   55
                      Grafts were generated by simply combining the CDR sequences
     (according above definition) from one antibody with the framework sequence of
     FWI.4 or the rFW1.4. Residues potentially involved in binding were identified.
     For each rabbit variable domain sequence, the nearest rabbit germline counterpart was
  5  identified. If the closest germline could not be established, the sequence was
    compared against the subgroup consensus or the consensus of rabbit sequences with a
    high percentage of similarity. Rare framework residues were considered as possible
    result of somatic hypermutation and therefore playing a role in binding. Consequently,
    such residues were grafted onto the acceptor framework.
10       1.4          Results
                      By analyzing the rabbit antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino
    acid sequence diversity and germline usage, 5 residue positions in the light chain of
    FWI.4 were found which were modified to maintain loop conformation of rabbit
    CDRs. These positions are highly conserved in rabbit antibodies. The consensus
15  residue for these 5 positions was deduced from the rabbit repertoire and introduced
    into the human acceptor framework 1.4. With the modification of these conserved
    positions, said framework became virtually compatible with all six complementarity
    determining regions (CDRs) of any rabbit CDRs. The master rFW1.4 containing
    different rabbit CDRs is well expressed and good produced contrary to the wild type
20  single chains. 16 members derived from the combination of this framework and
    rabbit CDRs were created detailed characterization showed functionality.
    Example 2: B cell screening system
    A FACS (flow cytometry based single cell sorting)-based screening system has been
25  established at ESBATech in order to select B cells that bind to a target of interest via
    their B cell receptors (BCR). One target was for example a soluble protein, namely a
    single-chain antibody (ESBA903) labeled with a fluorescent dye (PE and PerCP).
    Lymphocyte suspension was prepared from the spleen of rabbits immunized with the
    recombinant target. Cells were then incubated with PE and PerCP labeled ESBA903
30  as well as with antibodies specific for IgG (APC-labeled) or IgM (FITC labeled).
    ESBA903 positive B-cells that express IgG but not IgM on their surface were sorted
    in 96-well plates (Figure 3; table 2). By means of a thymoma helper cell line (EL4
    B5: see Zubler et al, 1985, J. Immunol, 134(6): 3662-3668), selected B cells
    proliferated, differentiated into plasma cells and secreted antibodies. The affinity of

  these IgGs for the target was verified by ELISA and Biacore measurements. Kinetic
  parameters are depicted in table 1 for seven selected clones. These clones, from a pool
  of-200 sorted cells, show binding affinities in the low nanomolar to picomolar range.
  Finally, mRNA was isolated from 6 clones of interest and CDRs were grafted on the
5 single-chain framework FW1.4.

   Example 3: Detection of the interaction between beads coated with anti
15 TNFalpha antibody and CHO cells expressing membrane-bound TNFalpha.
   In order to evaluate whether or not the high pressure in flow-cytometry stream breaks
   non covalent binding between two cells, the following experiment was performed.
   CHO cells stably transfected with membrane-bound TNFalpha (B-220 cells) were
   incubated with beads coated with a PE-labeled anti-TNFalpha antibody. In this set-up
20 the beads mimic memory B cells (they have more or less the same size). As negative
   controls, non-transfected CHO cells were used, as well as beads coated with an APC
   labeled unrelated antibody (anti-CD 19). After 2 hours incubation at 4*C with
   agitation, the cell-bead suspension was analyzed by FACS (using a 130 urn nozzle).
   Figure 4 shows that a specific binding between anti-TNFalpha beads and TNFalpha
25 transfected CHO cells is clearly detectable with FACS. Indeed, in this sample (upper
   panel) about two thirds of the beads are bound to cells (585 bound against 267

   WO 2009/155726                                                           PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   58
   unbound). In contrast, in the control samples (middle and lower panels), almost no
   bead binds to CHO cells. Further, both bead populations (anti-TNFalpha-PE and anti
   CD19-APC) were mixed together with TNFalpha-transfected CHO cells. Figure 5 and
   table 4 shows that about half of the anti-TNFalpha beads bind to CHO cells, whereas
 5 the vast majority of the anti-CD19 beads stay unbound. The percentage of beads
   binding to the cell in each sample is detailed in table 5. Thus, the demonstration is
   made that the specific selection of single B cells that bind to an integral membrane
   target protein through their B cell receptor is possible using flow-cytometry.

   Example 4: CDR Grafting and Functional Humanization of anti-TNFa Rabbit
   Donor Antibodies
10         Four anti-TNFa rabbit antibodies "Rabmabs" (EPI-1, EPI-15, EP-34, EP-35
   and EP-42) were selected for CDR grafting. The general experimental scheme for the
   CDR grafting, humanization, and preliminary characterization of humanized rabbit
   donor antibodies was done as outlined in the description. Unlike traditional
   humanization methods which employ the human antibody acceptor framework that
15 shares the greatest sequence homology with the non-human donor antibody, the rabbit
   CDRs were grafted into a human framework (FW 1.4) that was preselected for
   desirable functional properties (solubility and stability) using a Quality Control assay
   (WO0148017). These stable and soluble framework sequence exhibited high
   homology with the RabMabs.
20         CDR grafts were generated for each of the RabMabs using the methodology
   described herein. In "Min" grafts, only the rabbit CDRs were transplanted from the
   VL and VH domains of the rabbit donor antibody to the human acceptor framework
   FW1.4. "Max" grafts refer to the grafting of the rabbit CDRs to rFW1.4.

    WO 2009/155726                                                          PCT/CH2009/000222
                                                   60
             The scFvs described and characterized herein were produced as follows. The
     humanized VL sequences were connected to humanized VH sequences via the linker
     of SEQ ID NO:8 to yield an scFv of the following orientation: NH 2 -VL-linker-VH
     COOH. In many cases DNA sequences encoding for the various scFvs were de novo
  5  synthesized at the service provider Entelechon GmbH (www.entelechon.com). The
     resulting DNA inserts were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGMP002 via
    NcoI and HindIl restriction sites introduced at the 5' and 3' end of the scFv DNA
     sequence, respectively. Between the DNA sequence of theVL domain and the VH
    domain, a BamHI restriction site is located. In some cases the scFv encoding DNA
 10 was not de novo synthesized, but the scFv expressing constructs were cloned by
    domain shuffling. Accordingly, the VL domains were excised and introduced into the
    new constructs via NcoI and BamHI restriction sites, the VH domains via BamHI and
    HindIl restriction sites. In other cases, point mutations were introduced into the VH
    and/or VL domain using state of the art assembling PCR methods. The cloning of
15  GMP002 is described in Example 1 of W02008006235. The production of the scFvs
    was done analogue as for ESBA 105 as described in Example 1 of W0200800623 5.
             Table 3 depicts a summary of the detailed characterization data for the four
    rabbit monoclonals (EP6, EP19, EP34, EP35 and EP43) and their CDR grafted
    variants. Although the CDR grafts exhibited a broad range of activities in BIACore
20  binding assays and L929, TNFa-mediated cytotoxocity assays, 3 of the 4 maximal
    ("max") grafts exhibited therapeutically relevant activities. EP43max exhibited the
    most favorable binding affinity (Kd of 0.25 nM) and an excellent EC50 in the
    cytotoxicity assay. This data show that FW1.4 (SEQ ID No: 1 and 2) is an exemplary
    soluble and stable human acceptor framework region for grafting rabbit CDRs.
25  Potency assay
             The neutralizing activity of anti-TNFa binders was assessed in a L929 TNFa
    mediated cytotoxicity assay. Toxicity of Mouse L929 fibroblast cells treated with
    Actinomycin was induced with recombinant human TNF (hTNF). 90% of maximal
    hTNF-induced cytoxicity was determined to be at a TNF concentration of 1000 pg/ml.
30  All L929 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with phenolred, with L-Glutamine
    medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% v/v). The neutralizing activity of
    anti-TNFa binders was assessed in RPMI 1640 without phenolred and 5% fetal calf
    serum. Different concentrations (0 - 374 ng/mL) of anti-TNF binders are added to
    L929 cells in presence of 1000 pg/ml hTNF in order to determine the concentration at

    which the antagonistic effect reaches half-maximal inhibition (EC50%) The dose
    response curve was fitted with nonlinear sigmoidal regression with variable slope and
    the EC50 was calculated.
 5  Biacore binding analysis of anti-TNFscFvs
           For binding affinity measurements, surface Plasmon resonance measurements
   with BIAcoreTM-T 100 were employed using a NTA sensor chip and His-tagged TNF
   (produced at ESBATech). The surface of the NTA sensor chip consists of a
   carboxymethylated dextran matrix pre-immobilized with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)
10 for capture of histidine tagged molecules via Ni2+NTA chelation. Human TNFa N-his
   trimers (5 nM) are captured by the nickel via their N-terminal his-tags and ESBA105
   (analyte) is injected at several concentrations ranging from 30 nM to 0.014nM in 3
   fold serial dilution steps. At the regeneration step, the complex formed by nickel,
   ligand and analyte is washed away. This allows the use of the same regeneration
15 conditions for different samples. The response signal is generated by surface Plasmon
   resonance (SPR) technology and measured in resonance units (RU). All the
   measurements are performed at 25'C. Sensorgrams were generated for each anti-TNF
   scFv sample after in-line reference cell correction followed by buffer sample
   subtraction. The apparent dissociation rate constant (kd), the apparent association rate
20 constant (ka) and the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) were calculated
   using one-to-one Langmuir binding model with BlAcore T100 evaluation Software
   version 1.1.

    Example 5: CDR Grafting and Functional Humanization of anti-VEGF Rabbit
    Donor Antibodies
                      Eight anti-VEGF Rabmabs (375, 435, 509, 511, 534, 567, 578 and 610)
    were selected for CDR grafting. Unlike traditional humanization methods which employ
 5 the human antibody acceptor framework that shares the greatest sequence homology with
   the non-human donor antibody, the rabbit CDRs were grafted into a human acceptor
   framework FW 1.4 (SEQ ID No: 1 and 2) that was preselected for desirable functional
   properties (solubility and stability) using a Quality Control assay (WO0148017).
           A number of CDR grafts were generated for each of the RabMabs (rabbit
10 antibodies) using the methodology described herein (see Example 4). "Min" grafts
   comprised a minimal graft wherein only the rabbit CDRs were transplanted from the VL
   and VH domains of the rabbit donor antibody to the human acceptor framework FW1.4
   (SEQ ID No: 1). "Max" grafts comprised not only the rabbit CDRs for the VL and VH,
   but also some additional framework residues from the rabbit donor that were predicted to
15 be important for antigen binding. In the case of 578max, the heavy chain variable
   domain framework region of FW1.4 has additional amino acid alterations at Kabat
   positions 23H, 49H, 73H, 78H, and 94H.
           Table 4 shows a summary of the detailed characterization data for the "Min" and
   "Max" CDR grafted variants. Their potency as VEGF inhibitors, which is measured
20 using VEGFR competition ELISA and/or HUVEC assay are described. This data shows
   that FW1.4 (SEQ ID No: I and 2) is an exemplary soluble and stable human acceptor
   framework region for grafting rabbit CDRs.

25         The Biacore-binding ability of scFvs was tested and the binding affinity was
   measured using the exemplary surface plasmon resonance method with BIAcorem-T 100.
   The VEGF proteins, tested for binding by these scFv candidates, in this example and later
   examples include purified Escherichiacoli-expressed recombinant human VEGF165
   (PeproTech EC Ltd.), recombinant human VEGF 121 (PeproTech EC Ltd.), recombinant

     experiment, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM4, GE Healthcare) were
    activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N
    hydroxysuccinimide according to the supplier's instructions. Each of the 6 different
  5 VEGF forms, as exemplified above, was coupled to I of the 4 different flow cells on a
    CM4 sensor chip using a standard amine-coupling procedure. The range of responses
    obtained with these immobilized VEGF molecules after coupling and blocking were
    -250-500 response units (RU) for hVEGF16 5 , -200 RU for hVEGF 110, hVEGF 12 1, murine
    VEGFi6 4, rat VEGFi6 4 and rabbit VEGF110 and -400 RU for PLGF. The 4th flow cell of
10  each chip was treated similarly except no proteins were immobilized prior to blocking,
    and the flow cell was used as in-line reference. Various concentrations of anti-VEGF
    scFvs (e.g., 90 nM, 30 nM, 10 nM, 3.33 nM, 1.11 nM, 0.37 nM, 0.12 nM and 0.04 nM) in
    HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant
    P20) were injected into the flow cells at a flow rate of 30 pl/min for 5 min. Dissociation
15  of the anti-VEGF scFv from the VEGF on the CM4 chip was allowed to proceed for 10
    min at 25 'C. Sensorgrams were generated for each anti-VEGF scFv sample after in-line
    reference cell correction followed by buffer sample subtraction. The apparent
    dissociation rate constant (kd), the apparent association rate constant (ka) and the apparent
    dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) were calculated using one-to-one Langmuir
20  binding model with BlAcore T100 evaluation Software version 1.1.

25          Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Promocell), pooled from
    several donors, were used at passage 2 to passage 14. Cells were seeded at 1000
    cells/well in 50 p] complete endothelial cell growth medium (ECGM) (Promocell), that
    contained 0.4% ECGS/H, 2% Fetal Calf Serum, 0.1 ng/ml Epidermal Growth Factor, I

    150 nM) and one of the following -recombinant human VEGF165 (0.08 nM), recombinant
   mouse VEGF164 (0.08 nM), or recombinant rat VEGF164 (0.3 nM)-were prepared in
   starving medium and preincubated for 30-60 min at room temperature. The different
 5 concentrations of VEGFs were used to compensate for their different relative biological
   activities. Concentrations that stimulate submaximal VEGF induced proliferation (EC 90)
   were used. 100 pl of the mixtures were added to the 96-well tissue-culture plates
   containing the HUVEC suspension and incubated for 4 days in a 37 *C/5% CO 2 humified
   incubator. Proliferation of HUVECs was assessed by measuring absorbance at 450 nm
10 (620 nm used as reference wavelength) after addition of 20 pl/well WST-1 cell
   proliferation reagent (Roche) using a Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan). Data were
   analyzed using a 4-parameter logistic curve-fit, and the concentration of anti-VEGF
   scFvs required to inhibit HUVEC proliferation by 50% (EC5 0 ) was derived from
   inhibition curves.
