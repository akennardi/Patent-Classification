   lights by the light guide column, which change the direction and distribution of the
   lights, instead of the traditional LED headlights which arrange the LED lamp bead
   on the side of the heat sinkor the heat pipe to light directly from its side, so as to
   achieve the same luminous position and light uniform distribution in 36 0 *without
 5 the blind area and dark area as a conventional halogen lamp, wherein the lights
   can be seen from any angle. Secondly, it achieves better heat dissipation to
   arrange the LED lamp bead and the base plate on the one end surface of the
   heat sink which means the LED heat source and the heat sink fit together without
   distance, thereby relieving the design bottleneck of the heat conduction and heat
10 dissipation of the LED headlight. So that the lights of the headlights after refitting
   meet the regulation more, wherein the service life and the heat dissipation are
   safer and more reliable. Furthermore, the structure of the LED headlights
   according to the present utility application is simple and its volume is small,
   wherein the passing rate of loading the LED headlight on the car is high, thereby
15 popularizing easily.
             One skilled in the art will understand that the embodiment of the present
   utility application as shown in the drawings and described above is exemplary
   only and not intended to be limiting.
              It will thus be seen that the objects of the present utility application have
20 been fully and effectively accomplished. The embodiments have been shown and
   described for the purposes of illustrating the functional and structural principles of
   the present utility application and is subject to change without departure from
   such principles. Therefore, this utility applicationincludes all modifications
   encompassed within the spirit and scope of the following claims.
