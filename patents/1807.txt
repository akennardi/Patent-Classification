PATENT APPLICATION: OVERVIEW
We have developed an aggregated marketing analytics platform (cloud software) that combines the
following platform analytic data;
     " Search & Display
     * Social Media
     * Email Marketing
     * Social publishing
Our unique algorithm mines this analytic data to provide additional data such as a marketing
campaigns true cost per sale (CPA). In addition, our unique platform is designed to give marketers a
single dashboard view of all their key data from the multiple channels listed above. The platform is
designed so each marketer does not have to login and out of each third-party platform and the
unique attribute such as our algorithm aggregates individual data channels to provide additional
unique analytics that cannot be provided via each individual third-party platform.
PATENT APPLICATION: THE PRODUCT
We have developed a software product that is Cloud based and aggregates data for digital marketers
to provide a single dashboard view using unique algorithms to calculate unique data sets such as:
     *  Cost per Sale (CPA) across all campaign platforms, e.g. search +display + social + email
        marketing.
     *  Cost Per conversion across all campaign platforms, e.g. search + display + social + email
        marketing.
     *  Cost per lead across all platforms, e.g. search + display + social + email marketing.
APPLICATION USE
The application/platform software will be used for marketers across small to medium and enterprise
businesses.
PATENT APPLICATION: THE SOFTWARE AND OUR PROGRAMMATIC PROCESS
The application/software is designed to work in the Cloud.
The programmed sequence:

1. Connect to data sources through API: a customer ("the marketer") connects all their marketing
    channels to our aggregated marketing platform.
2. The datasets from all their different marketing channels are then put through our algorithm to
    provide a unified set of data that shows each marketer how their campaigns are performing
    across all their different marketing channels and what is the:
         a. Cost per Sale (CPA) across all campaign platforms, e.g. search + display + social + email
             marketing.
         b. Cost Per conversion across all campaign platforms, e.g. search + display + social + email
             marketing.
         c. Cost per lead across all platforms, e.g. search + display + social + email marketing.
3. This is provided via our unified, online analytic dashboard so each marketer (brand) can view
    how effective all their marketing campaigns are performing in real-time.

Does not cover:
1. The individual third-party platforms that our platform pulls data from. This also includes the data
     provided to our platform.
2. Any hardware that maybe used to deliver our platform.
Does cover:
3. Software and usage rights.
4. Usage rights: For marketers (marketing and sales professionals and business managers/owners)
     across small, medium and large enterprises.
5. Software: A cloud-based platform that provides marketers and business managers access to an
     aggregated process to measure multi-channel campaigns across all these combined marketing
     channels:
         a. Search & Display
         b. Social Media
         c. Email Marketing
         d. Social publishing
6. Specifically, the algorithm that mines each dataset to provide valuable aggregated analytics that
     each individual platform cannot provide.
SOFTWARE & USAGE
The software application that we developed works in the cloud. The application uses an aggregation
and unique algorithm (as outlined in Patent Claim - point 5 and 6) to provide an easy solution to view
vital analytics that will help them manage their multi-channel campaigns easily.
MULTI-CHANNEL ANALYTICS (definition)
Modern marketing works across multiple channels, e.g. you can run a campaign across display, social
and then re-target enquiries through email marketing. Traditional marketing would only provide
analytics results from each individual campaign such as social only. What our platform does, is allow
marketers, managers and business owners to view all this data in one aggregated dashboard view.
Furthermore, using our unique algorithm delivers specific aggregated analytic data from all their
combined marketing channels and cannot be provided through each individual marketing channel.
