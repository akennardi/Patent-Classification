        ABSTRACT
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system includes a split magnet system having a pair of
MRI magnet housings separated by gap. A pair of main MRI magnets are disposed within
respective MRI magnet housings. A plurality of buttress assemblies are attached to the MRI
magnet housings. Some or all of the buttress assemblies are provided with removable
connections to the MRI magnet housings. This allows for partial disassembly of the MRI system
for improved transport and manoeuvrability for relocating the MRI system. The MRI system can
include a gantry in the gap for supporting a radiation therapy system. Also, the removably
buttress assemblies can be used for housing conduits, such as electrical and fluid conduits,
between the pair of MRI magnet housings.

            SPLIT MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SYSTEM
                             RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/307,665,
filed February 24, 2010, titled "Split MRI System," which is hereby incorporated by

                                   BACKGROUND
1. Technical Field
[0002] The present application relates to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems,
particularly MRI systems that include a split main magnet.
2. Related Art
[0003] Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
(NMRI), is primarily a medical imaging technique most commonly used in radiology to
visualize the internal structure and function of the body. MRI is described, for example, by
E. MARK HAACKE ET AL., MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES AND
SEQUENCE DESIGN     (Wiley-Liss 1999), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
[0004] A variety of MRI systems are known and are in wide use today. However, such
systems typically include large components, making them difficult to move and install,
especially in an existing space where access points such as available doors and hallways
provide for limited maneuverability.

                                               2
[0005] As will therefore be appreciated, there exists advantages to improving MRI systems
so as to make such systems easier to move and install, without sacrificing the quality of the
MRI system's functionality.
                                      SUMMARY
[0006] Disclosed herein is an MRI system having a split MRI configuration that can more
easily be relocated and installed compared to prior split MRI systems. The disclosed MRI
system is preferrably constructed so that it can be disassembled, moved, and then installed
into existing facilities and shielded vaults.
[0007] Aspects of the present disclosure include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
system comprising first and second MRI magnet housings separated by an MRI magnet
gap, with a first main MRI magnet disposed within the first MRI magnet housing and a
second main MRI magnet disposed within the second MRI magnet housing. A plurality of
buttress assemblies and/or their sub-assemblies are attached to the first and second MRI
magnet housings. At least one of the plurality of buttress assemblies and/or sub-assemblies
is removably attached to at least one of the first and second MRI magnet housings.
[0008] In some embodiments, at least one of the plurality of buttress assemblies can be
removably attached to both the first and second MRI magnet housings.
[0009] In some embodiments, at least one of the plurality of buttress assemblies can
include a first buttress sub-assembly that is attached to the first MRI magnet housing, and a
second buttress sub-assembly that is attached to the second MRI magnet housing. In such
embodiments, the buttress assembly can further include a central buttress connector that is

                                             3
removably connected to first and second buttress sub-assemblies. Also, in such
embodiments the first buttress sub-assembly can extend radially from an outer surface of
the first MRI magnet housing when attached thereto, and the second buttress sub-assembly
can extend radially from an outer surface of the second MRI magnet housing when
attached thereto.
[0010] In some embodiments, the MRI system can further comprise a gantry positioned in
the MRI magnet gap. A radiation therapy device or other interventional therapeutic device
can be supported by the gantry.
[0011] In some embodiments, the MRI system can further comprise a cooling system,
which can include fluid conduit for carrying coolant for cooling the first and second main
MRI magnets. The fluid conduit can extend from within the first MRI magnet housing to
within the second MRI magnet housing via at least one of the removably attached buttress
assemblies.
[0012] In some embodiments, the MRI system can further comprise a power system,
which can include electrical conduit for providing electrical power to the first and second
main MRI magnets. The electrical conduit can extend from within the first MRI magnet
housing to within the second MRI magnet housing via at least one of the removably
attached buttress assemblies.
[0013] The first and second MRI magnet housings can be substantially cylindrical,
allowing for accommodating a patient bed within the MRI system for supporting a patient
undergoing MRI imaging and/or other medical treatment involving the MRI system.

                   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0014] Features, aspects, and embodiments of the inventions are described in conjunction
with the attached drawings, in which:
[0015] Figures 1A-IC show perspective views of a first embodiment of a split-magnet
MRI system;
[0016] Figures 2A-2C show perspective views of a second embodiment of a split-magnet
MRI system; and
[0017] Figure 3 shows a simplified block diagram of the split-magnet MRI systems
disclosed herein.
                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0018] Figures 1A through IC show perspective views of a split-magnet MRI system 100.
Figures 1A shows a fully assembled view of the MRI system 100, Figure 1B shows a
partially exploded view of the MRI system 100, and Figure IC shows a further exploded
view of the MRI system 100.
[0019] The MRI system 100 has a split MRI configuration that can more easily be
relocated and installed compared to prior MRI systems. The disclosed MRI system 100 is
preferrably constructed so that it can be disassembled, moved, and then installed into
existing facilities and shielded vaults. The MRI system 100 includes first and second
cylindrical main MRI magnet housings 102a and 102b for housing respective cylindrical
superconducting MRI main magnets 101a and 101b, respectively (shown in Figure 3). The

                                             5
MRI main magnets 101a and 101b can be operated to produce a uniform magnetic field in
a Field-of-View (FOV) for imaging that is generally centered in a gap 104 between the two
magnet housings 102a and 102b for imaging a patient positioned on patient bed 103.
[0020] The MRI main magnet housings 102a and 102b are supported and connected to
each other by buttress assemblies 105a-105c. According to various embodiments, the
buttress assemblies 105a-105c can connect the MRI main magnets 101a and 101b
mechanically, thermally, and/or electronically to improve the performance of the MRI
main magnets 101a and 10 1b and withstand the forces between the main magnets 102a and
102b.
[0021] Buttress assemblies 105a-105c include buttress sub-assemblies 106a-106f, which
extend radially out from the magnet housings 102a and 102b, and buttress connectors
108a-108c, which connect respective pairs of the buttress sub-assemblies 106a-106f. More
specifically, buttress assembly 105a includes buttress sub-assemblies 106a and 106b
connected by buttress connector 108a; buttress assembly 105b includes buttress sub
assemblies 106c and 106d connected by buttress connector 108b; and buttress assembly
105c includes buttress sub-assemblies 106e and 106f connected by buttress connector
108c.
[0022] As best shown in Figures lB and IC, the buttress sub-assemblies 106a-106d of
buttress assemblies 105a and 105b are removable from the magnet housings 102a and
102b, while buttress sub-assemblies 106e and 106f are permanently attached to magnet
housings 102a and 102b. However, all three of the buttress connectors 108a-108c are
removable from respective buttress sub-assemblies 106a-106f.

                                             6
[0023] The buttress sub-assemblies 106a-106d are removably connected to magnet
housings 102a and 102b using known removable connection devices, such as known
connection hardware that can include, for example, screws and/or nuts and bolts. In
contrast, the buttress sub-assemblies 106e and 106f are permanently attached to the magnet
housings 102a and 10b, respectively. For example, the buttress sub-assemblies 106e and
106f can be welded to the respective magnet housings 102a and 102b, or alternatively
attached using adhesives or other permanent attachment means.
[0024] The buttress connectors 108a-108c are removably connected to respective pairs of
buttress sub-assemblies 106a-106f using known removable connection devices, such as
known connection hardware that can include, for example, screws or nuts and bolts.
[0025] While the illustrated embodiment includes three buttress assemblies 105, of which
two include pairs of removable buttress sub-assemblies 106, this is merely one of many
possible embodiments. Alternative embodiments can include n buttress assemblies 105,
where n can be any integer greater than or equal to 2, and where any number from 2 to n of
the buttress assemblies 105 can include at least one removable buttress sub-assembly 106.
In other words, alternative embodiments can include any number of buttress assemblies
105, some or all of which can include at least one removable buttress sub-assembly 106.
[0026] The determination as to whether to construct the buttress sub-assemblies 106 to be
removably attached to a housing 102 or permanently attached to a housing 102 can be
based on achieving a balance among such factors as portability and ease of installation. By
making buttress sub-assemblies 106 removable, the MRI system 100 can be disassembled
into components that are more portable than the fully assembled MRI system 100. On the

                                                7
other hand, removable assemblies can add to the steps required for final assembly, so it
may be desirable to permanently attach at least some buttress sub-assemblies, such as
buttress sub-assemblies 106e and 106f, while making the remaining buttress sub
assemblies 106a-106d removable for improved portability.
[0027] For example, removing laterally-extending buttress sub-assemblies 106a and 106c
may allow for the MRI housing 102a and the remaining upwardly-extending buttress sub
assembly 106e to be more easily moved through hallways and doorways of existing
structures.
[0028] Referring now also to Figures 2A-2C, an alternative MRI system is shown as MRI
system 200. MRI system 200 can include elements similar to those described in connection
with MRI system 100, so like elements have retained like element numbers.
[0029] The MRI system 200 further includes a gantry 202 positioned in the gap 104. The
gantry 202 can be used for supporting a radiation therapy device 204. The MRI system 200
can include, for example, a system that is capable of locating the anatomy of interest,
imaging to develop a radiation treatment plan, and imaging during radiation treatment to
correct the treatment application for patient motion. For example, the MRI system 200 can
include a radiation source, such as a Co 60 radiation sources or linear electron accelerators
(LINAC), supported by a gantry 202 as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication
2005/0197564 to Dempsey, titled "System for Delivering Conformal Radiation Therapy
While Simultaneously Imaging Soft Tissue," which is hereby incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety, and/or as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication
2011/0012593 to Shvartsman et al., titled "Method and Apparatus for Shielding a Linear

                                                8
Accelerator and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Device From Each Other," which is
hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0030] Thus, in some embodiments, the gantry 202 can be used for supporting a radiation
therapy device 204 in the gap between the pair of MRI main magnets. A radiation therapy
device 204 positioned in the gap can deliver radiation beams to a radiation therapy
isocenter inside the imaging FOV without significant attenuation by the MRI magnets. The
buttress assemblies 105a-105c can extend around the outside of the radiotherapy unit,
clearing it so that there is no interference or obstruction of the radiotherapy beams.
[0031] The gantry 202, MRI main magnet housings 102a and 102b, and buttress
assemblies 105a-105c of the MRI system can be constructed to be capable of being
disassembled for ease of installation into existing linear accelerator or cobalt therapy vaults
designed for radiation therapy. In some embodiments, some or all of the buttress
assemblies, or parts thereof, can be removable as described above in connection with
Figures 1A-IC. For example, there can be n buttress assemblies, where n can be an integer
greater than or equal to 2.
[0032] The buttress assemblies can have a cold connection or a room temperature
separation support with axial suspension straps 206 to a cryostat. The cryostat can be
slightly larger in diameter to include this suspension.
[0033] The source of radiation of the radiation therapy device 204 can be, for example,
from an accelerator such as a LINAC or from a radioactive source such as Cobalt-60
(60Co). The radiation can be delivered in uniform beams or modulated to tailor the
radiation as required by the plan. This can include directing the beam, filtering the beam,

                                                9
turning the beam on and off, and shaping the beam with collimators. The imaging can take
place simultaneously to the radiation delivery to allow for gating the beam on and off to
prevent delivery during motion that would compromise the quality of delivery and to
volumetrically record the delivery of the radiation dose to the patient's anatomy.
[0034] It is desirable to direct the radiation to the patient without having interfering non
uniform radiation attenuating structures such as a magnet or gradient coils between the
source and the patient. Prior MRI units with a central gap have not included a radiation
treatment device and the support between their magnet halves was close to the imaging
volume. One of the advantageous features of the disclosed MRI system is a
superconducting MRI magnet with a central gap 104 to allow for radiation treatment.
There have been proposals to pass the radiation beam through a magnet, but this is less
desirable than a clear path from source to patient.
[0035] Referring to Figure 3, the disclosed MRI systems 100 and 200 can be configured in
various embodiments where various conduits are routed through one or more of the
buttress assemblies 105. For example, as shown in Figure 3, the removable buttress
assembly 105a can be used to house electrical and/or fluid conduit that extends between
the first and second MRI magnet housings 102a and 102b. Various electrical and/or fluid
conduits can additionally and/or alternatively be routed through buttress assembly 105b
and/or 105c. It should be noted that while Figure 3 shows MRI system 200, the description
of Figure 3 can apply equally to MRI system 100.
[0036] In some embodiments, the MRI system 200 can include a cooling system 302,
which may include, for example, a cryostat. The cooling system 302 can include fluid

                                              10
conduit 304 that carries coolant for cooling the main MRI magnets 101a and 101b. The
fluid conduit 304 can include a series of connectors 306, which can include any of a
variety of known fluid-conduit connectors, at various locations at or near disassembly
points of the buttress assembly 105a. This allows the fluid conduit 304 to be disconnected
during the removal and disassembly of the buttress assembly 105a, and then later re
connected during the re-assembly of the buttress assembly 105a and re-connection of the
buttress assembly 105a to the main MRI magnet housings 102a and 102b.
[0037] The MRI system 200 can also include a power/control system 310 that can
encompass a variety of electrical and/or control systems, such as controlling the supply of
electrical power to the main MRI magnets 101a and 101b during ramp up and ramp down
of the MRI magnets 101a and 101 b and/or communicating various other operational
control signals with the main MRI magnets 101a and 10 1b. The power supply system 310
can include electrical conduit 314 that carries electricity and/or various control signals for
powering and/or controlling the operation of the main MRI magnets 101a and 10 1b. The
electrical conduit 314 can include a series of connectors 316, which can include any of a
variety of known electrical connectors, at various locations at or near disassembly points of
the buttress assembly 105a. This allows the conduit 314 to be disconnected during the
removal and disassembly of the buttress assembly 105a, and then later re-connected during
the re-assembly of the buttress assembly 105a and re-connection of the buttress assembly
105a to the main MRI magnet housings 102a and 102b.
[0038] In some embodiments, the power/control system 310 can include a single power
supply that can be operated to provide electrical operating power to both of the main MRI

                                              11
magnets 101a and 10 1b. For example, the power/control system 310 can include a single
power supply that can be operated to provide electrical power during ramp up and ramp
down of the operations of the main MRI magnets 101a and 101b.
[0039] In prior systems, each MRI magnet receives electrical power from a respective
power supply. During power-up, electrical power is ramped up to each of the MRI magnets
most preferrably in a simultaneous manner. However, often inhomogeneity in the main
magnetic field of the MRI system is caused by differences in electric current to the
respective main MRI magnets. Ideally, the electric current should be the same, or very
close to the same, in the MRI magnets, so shimming is performed using shim coils that
produce magnetic fields for correcting the inhomogeneity in the main magnetic field.
[0040] In contrast, since the present MRI system provides electrical power to both MRI
magnets 101a and 101b from a single power supply 310, the differences in electrical
current to the two MRI magnets 101a and 101b is greatly reduced, thereby reducing the
inhomogeneity in the main magnetic field of the MRI system as compared to prior MRI
systems that separately powered each of the MRI magnets. As a result, the present MRI
system can be more easily shimmed.
[0041] Embodiments of the MRI systems 100 and 200 can also include various
configurations of RF and gradient coils, shown generally as coils 320. Specific examples
and descriptions of coils 320 are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application serial number
12/951,976 to Shvartsman et al., titled "Self-Shielded Gradient Coil," which is hereby
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, the coils 320 can include
gradient coils that include a gap aligned with gap 104 and gantry 202 for preventing

                                               12
attenuation of radiotherapy beams. The gradient coils also have a gap in the electronics to
prevent attenuating the radiotherapy beam by conducting wires, but have a thin uniformly
attenuating former to mechanically support the coils. The gradient coils also can have a
gap in the electronics of the shield coils, but not the primary coils, to limit attenuating the
radiotherapy beam by conducting wires, but can have a compensating material to produce
uniform attenuation. The gradient coils can also have a gap in the electronics of the shield
coils, but not the primary coils to limit attenuating the radiotherapy beam by conducting
wires, but can have a compensating material to produce uniform attenuation and a
conductor with a lower atomic number, such as Aluminum, to limit attenuation.
[0042] Preferrably, the inside diameters of the main MRI magnets 101a and 101b allows
for a radiation source of radiation therapy device 204 to be supported on the gantry 202 at
a nominal radius of Im, which is the preferred distance for present radiation therapy
treatment systems. The main MRI magnets 101a and 101b can be configured such that the
radiotherapy beams emitted by the radiation therapy device 204 do not impinge on the
main MRI magnets 101a and 10 1b on entrance to the MRI system, thereby preventing
attenuation and degradation of the radiotherapy beam by scattering on the MRI coils 320.
In some embodiments, the main MRI magnets 101a and 101b and the gradient coils 320
can be configured such that radiotherapy beams emitted by the radiation therapy device
204 do not impinge on the main MRI magnets 101a and 101b or the gradient coils 320 on
entrance to the MRI system, preventing attenuation and degradation of the radiotherapy
beam by scattering on the MRI coils 320 or the gradient system.
