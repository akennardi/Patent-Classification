                                      ABSTRACT
Provided herein are compositions and methods for preventing, ameliorating, and/or
reducing tissue ischemia and/or tissue damage due to ischemia, increasing blood
vessel diameter, blood flow and tissue perfusion in the presence of vascular disease
including peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerotic vascular disease, coronary
artery disease, stroke and influencing other conditions, by suppressing CD47 and/or
blocking TSP1 and/or CD47 activity or interaction. Influencing the interaction of
CD47-TSP1 in blood vessels allows for control of blood vessel diameter and blood
flow, and permits modification of blood pressure and cardiac function. Under
conditions of decreased blood flow, for instance through injury or atherosclerosis,
blocking TSP1-CD47 interaction allows blood vessels to dilate and increases blood
flow, tissue perfusion and tissue survival. This in turn reduces or prevents tissue
necrosis and death. The therapeutics identified herein allow for precise regulation of
blood flow to tissues and organs which need it, while substantially avoiding systemic
complications. Methods and compositions described herein can be used to increase
tissue survival under conditions of trauma and surgery, as well as conditions of
chronic vascular disease. Also disclosed are methods for the treatment of elderly
subjects using agents that affect TSP1        and CD47 and thereby affect tissue
perfusion.   Additionally,   provided  herein are compositions     and  methods for
influencing blood coagulation, allowing for controlled increased or decreased blood
clotting. Additionally, provided herein are compositions and methods for decreasing
blood flow, as in the case of cancer through mimicking the effects of TSP1 and CD47
on blood vessel diameter and blood flow.

                                                   FIELD
              This application relates to the field of ischemia and blood flow. More specifically,
    this application relates to acute reversal and/or prevention of tissue ischemia, and related
20   and associated tissue and cell damage, as well as compositions and methods for such.
                                             BACKGROUND
              The body depends upon adequate blood flow. At the level of organs and tissue,
    blood flow is controlled by vascular smooth muscle cells. These cells line every blood
25  vessel of the body. The contraction of these cells determines the amount of blood that flow
    through a certain vessel and on to organs and tissues. The contraction (and relaxation) of
    vascular smooth muscle cells is in turn controlled by the bioactive gas nitric oxide (NO)
    which is constantly produced by blood vessels. NO causes blood vessels to dilate and
    increases blood flow to tissues and organs. Disruption of this process leads to significant
30   diseases, morbidity and mortality including peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart
     disease, stroke and diabetes. Additionally, lack of blood flow causes tissue death and
    wound healing problems both during and after surgery.
              Resolution of acute and chronic ischemia, be it in soft tissue flaps or skin grafts,
    requires restoration of tissue perfusion and blood flow. Treatments to address these factors
35  including hyperbaric oxygen, intravenous thrombolytics, anti-inflammatory agents, and
                                                          1

     limited success.
                                          BRIEF SUMMARY
 5            The inventors have made the revolutionary discovery that a matrix protein
    thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) blocks effects of NO in the vascular system, and prevents NO
     from dilating blood vessels and increasing blood flow to organs and tissues. Further, the
    inventors also discovered that TSP1 acts through the cell receptor CD47 to block the effects
     of NO on blood vessels. Relief of this inhibition in genetically altered (knockout) mice
10   lacking either TSP1 or CD47 results in dramatically improved blood flow and increased
    tissue oxygenation. Further, by using reagents such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and
    peptides that block the TSP1-CD47 interaction, or agents (such as antisense
     oligonucleotides or morpholinos) that reduce the level of CD47 or TSP1, blood flow can be
     dramatically increased to ischemic tissues.
15            Decreasing CD47 expression using antisense oligonucleotides significantly
    increases blood flow and tissue perfusion under conditions of acute or chronic ischemia.
    Under conditions of acute loss of blood flow and ischemia as found in surgery and skin
    grafting, blocking TSP1 or suppressing CD47 dramatically increases blood flow and tissue
     survival. Equally startling and unexpected was the discovery that in models of chronic
20  vascular pathology similar to those occurring in patients with atherosclerotic vascular
     disease targeting TSP1 or CD47 significantly improves tissue blood flow and survival.
    Finally, it was discovered that blocking TSP1 or CD47 can alter platelet function and
    prevent platelets from forming clots. The implications of these discoveries and the
    therapeutics based on the same are tremendous and would extend to almost every disease
25  process afflicting our aging population, including people who suffer from diabetes,
     atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, scleroderma, Reynaud's disease, coronary artery
     disease and myocardial infarction, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, dementia of old age and
    macular degeneration. The therapeutics described herein can also be employed to limit or
    reverse endothelial dysfunction (NO insufficiency) and suppress inflammatory activation of
30  the endothelium thus having application in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, Crohn's
     disease, and so forth. Further, the therapeutics identified herein can be applied to improve
    tissue survival and wound healing during surgery and to burn victims before and after
    undergoing skin grafting. The therapeutic agents herein identified may also be applied to
    patients with bleeding disorders to increase or decrease the clotting process.

               The extent of the described discoveries and inventions based thereon goes beyond
    the ability to regulate blood vessel and vascular cell responses. Nitric oxide is one of the
    central regulators, via cGMP, of mammalian physiology. A majority of cell types in the
    body utilize NO and cGMP to control vital cell signaling functions. Discoveries presented
 5  herein represent a novel method of controlling NO signaling through cGMP and hence will
    have an impact on almost every cell in the body. The discovery that thrombospondin- 1 via
     CD47 blocks NO-driven signaling in mammalian cells permits for the first time harnessing
    beneficial effects of NO.
               Provided herein are methods and compositions useful in exploiting the discoveries
10  that TSP1 and CD47 influence and control tissue survival in response to ischemia. Included
     are the use of therapeutic compounds and compositions that block TSP1 and thereby
    increase tissue survival to ischemia, as well as use of therapeutic compounds and
    compositions that block CD47 and thereby increase tissue survival to ischemia. Also
    included are compositions (including for instance nucleic acid and protein/peptide
15  compositions) useful in such methods. Specific example compounds useful as therapeutics
    include anti-CD47 antibodies (such as Ab 301, discussed herein) and anti-TSP1 antibodies
    that have similar effect on the interaction between CD47 and TSP 1, as well as morpholinos
     (e.g., CD47 or TSP1 morpholinos), and peptides derived from CD47 or TSP1 and other
    known TSP family members, TSP2-TSP5 inclusive, and additional CD47 ligands including
20  members of the family of Signal Inhibitory Receptor Proteins (SIRPa,           3, y).
               Particular contemplated methods include tissue preservation following surgery, and
     as part of surgery, such as reconstructive surgery and reattachment of severed body parts
     (e.g., fingers, toes, hands, feet, ears, limbs and soft tissue units; increased tissue survival in
    the treatment of bums, both through decreasing tissue loss secondary to the burn injury and
25  increasing skin graft survival and take; increased tissue survival in peripheral vascular
    interruption or disease secondary to amputation, clot and thrombosis and stroke; and
    restoration of blood flow in diseases of chronic vascular obstruction secondary to diabetes,
    hypertension and primary peripheral vascular disease.
               Particular contemplated methods also include modulation of blood clotting through
30  targeting of TSP1 and CD47 on the cell surface of platelets, for instance with antibodies or
    peptides or small molecule inhibitors, thus increasing or decreasing the tendency of platelets
    to form aggregates and thrombotic clots. Such therapeutics are useful in minimizing
    complications from excessive clotting such as occurs in stroke and coronary artery disease.
    They may also play a role in helping to restore clotting in cases of bleeding disorders, such
35   as hemophilia, injuries, surgeries and so forth.

              Yet further embodiments are provided herein, and we claim all methods and

              The foregoing and other features and advantages will become more apparent from
    the following detailed description of several embodiments, which proceeds with reference to
 5  the accompanying figures.
                             BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
              Figure 1. Regulation of NO signaling by TSP1 via CD36 and CD47. Endogenous
    NO synthesis is stimulated via Akt-mediated phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide
10   synthase (eNOS) downstream of VEGF receptor (Dimmeler et al, FEBS Lett, 477:258-262,
    2000). Ligation of either CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit activation of soluble
    guanylyl cyclase (sGC) mediated by endogenous or exogenous NO. CD47 is downstream
     of CD36 because ligation on CD36 can not inhibit signaling in the absence of CD47. The
    requirement for CD47 is consistent with lateral interactions with CD36 or with CD36
15   signaling requiring a convergent CD47 signal at some point upstream of sGC. The
    mechanism by which CD47 ligation regulates sGC is not known. TSP1 also inhibits NO
     signaling downstream of cGMP (Isenberg et al, PNAS, 102:13141-13146, 2005), at the level
     of cGMP protein kinase (PKG) (Isenberg et al, Blood, Epub September 21, 2007).
              Figure 2. NO-stimulated vascular cell out growth is modulated by ligation of
20   several TSP1 receptors. (Fig. 2A) Wild type and TSP1 -/- muscle biopsies were explanted in
    three dimensional collagen matrices and incubated in growth medium in the presence of
     exogenous NO (10 pM) and cell migration measured at day 7. Explants were treated with
    TSP1-derived peptides specific for heparin sulfate proteoglycans (peptide 246, 10 IM),
     CD36 (peptide 245, 10 pM), CD47 (peptide 7N3, 10 pM), or NoC1 (0.1 ptg/ml), which
25  binds to several p 1 integrins. Results are representative of three experiments with those
     differing from the respective controls with p<0.05 indicated by *. (Fig. 2B) Origins of the
    recombinant proteins and peptides. Amino acid residues differing from the native TSP1
     sequence are underlined. Shown are p907 (SEQ ID NO: 19), p2 4 6 (SEQ ID NO: 8), p4N1
     1 (SEQ ID NO: 14), p4N1G (SEQ ID NO: 15), p2 4 5 (SEQ ID NO: 9), p9 0 6 (SEQ ID NO:

              Figure 12. Regulation of NO signaling by TSP1 via CD36 and CD47. Endogenous
    NO synthesis is stimulated via Akt-mediated phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide
     synthase (eNOS) downstream of VEGF receptor (Dimmeler et al, FEBS Lett, 477:258-262,
    2000). Ligation of either CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit activation of soluble

    guanylyl cyclase (sGC) mediated by endogenous or exogenous NO. CD47 is downstream
     of CD36 because ligation on CD36 can not inhibit signaling in the absence of CD47. The
    requirement for CD47 is consistent with lateral interactions with CD36 or with CD36
     signaling requiring a convergent CD47 signal at some point upstream of sGC. The
 5  mechanism by which CD47 ligation regulates sGC is not known. TSP1 also inhibits NO
     signaling downstream of cGMP (Isenberg et al, PNAS, 102:13141-13146, 2005), but the
    receptors mediating this second signal have not been defined.

             Figure 42. Proposed mechanism for TSP1 antagonism of NO/cGMP signaling in
    platelets. Using recombinant domains and peptides of TSP1, we show that ligation of CD36
     or CD47 is sufficient to block an NO-mediated delay in platelet aggregation. TSP1 blocks a
     delay mediated by either exogenous NO or NO synthesized by endogenous eNOS using Arg
20   as substrate. The ability of TSP1 to prevent cGMP synthesis stimulated by exogenous NO
    identifies sGC as one target of TSP1 signaling. The ability of TSP1 to inhibit cGK-I
    mediated phosphorylation of VASP and a cGK-I-selective peptide (RKRSRAE; SEQ ID
    NO: 17) stimulated by a cell-permeable cGMP analog (8Br-cGMP) identifies cGK-I as a
     second target of TSP1 signaling in platelets. VASP is required for NO/cGMP-mediated
25  inhibition of agonist-induced platelet aggregation as well as platelet adhesion. TSP1
    prevents cGK-I-mediated phosphorylation of VASP at Ser239. NO also stimulates
    phosphorylation of the cGK-I target Rap1GAP2, so TSP1 inhibition of sGC and cGK-I also
    controls GTP loading of Rap 1, which is required for thrombin-stimulated activation of the
     adhesion receptor acIb/P3

    II        Terms
              Unless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage.
    Definitions of common terms in molecular biology may be found in Benjamin Lewin, Genes
     V, published by Oxford University Press, 1994 (ISBN 0-19-854287-9); Kendrew et al.
 5   (eds.), The Encyclopedia of MolecularBiology, published by Blackwell Science Ltd., 1994
     (ISBN 0-632-02182-9); and Robert A. Meyers (ed.), MolecularBiology and Biotechnology:
    a Comprehensive Desk Reference, published by VCH Publishers, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 1-56081
     569-8).
              In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of the invention, the
10   following explanations of specific terms are provided:
             Animal: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes, for
     example, mammals and birds. The term mammal includes both human and non-human
    mammals. Similarly, the term subject includes both human and veterinary subjects, for
15   example, humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats, horses, and cows.
              Angiogenesis: Biological process leading to the generation of new blood vessels
    through sprouting or growth from pre-existing blood vessels. The process involves the
    migration and proliferation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells from
    preexisting vessels. Angiogenesis occurs during pre-natal development, post-natal
20   development, and in the adult. In the adult, angiogenesis occurs during the normal cycle of
    the female reproductive system, wound healing, and during pathological processes such as
    cancer (for a review see Battegay, J. Molec. Med. 73(7): 333-346, 1995).
              Administration: Administration of an active compound or composition can be by
     any route known to one of skill in the art. Administration can be local or systemic.
25  Examples of local administration include, but are not limited to, topical administration,
     subcutaneous administration, intramuscular administration, intrathecal administration,
    intrapericardial administration, intra-ocular administration, topical ophthalmic
     administration, or administration to the nasal mucosa or lungs by inhalational
     administration. In addition, local administration includes routes of administration typically
30  used for systemic administration, for example by directing intravascular administration to
    the arterial supply for a particular organ. Thus, in particular embodiments, local
     administration includes intra-arterial administration and intravenous administration when
     such administration is targeted to the vasculature supplying a particular organ. Local
     administration also includes the incorporation of active compounds and agents into
35  implantable devices or constructs, such as vascular stents or other reservoirs, which release
                                                         23

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    the active agents and compounds over extended time intervals for sustained treatment
     effects.
              Systemic administration includes any route of administration designed to distribute
     an active compound or composition widely throughout the body via the circulatory system.
 5  Thus, systemic administration includes, but is not limited to intra-arterial and intravenous
     administration. Systemic administration also includes, but is not limited to, topical
     administration, subcutaneous administration, intramuscular administration, or administration
    by inhalation, when such administration is directed at absorption and distribution throughout
    the body by the circulatory system.
10            Altered expression: Expression of a biological molecule (for example, mRNA or
    protein) in a subject or biological sample from a subject that deviates from expression if the
     same biological molecule in a subject or biological sample from a subject having normal or
    unaltered characteristics for the biological condition associated with the molecule. Normal
     expression can be found in a control, a standard for a population, etc. Altered expression of
15   a biological molecule may be associated with a disease. The term associated with includes
     an increased risk of developing the disease as well as the disease itself. Expression may be
     altered in such a manner as to be increased or decreased. The directed alteration in
     expression of mRNA or protein may be associated with therapeutic benefits.
              Altered protein expression refers to expression of a protein that is in some manner
20   different from expression of the protein in a normal (wild type) situation. This includes but
    is not necessarily limited to: (1) a mutation in the protein such that one or more of the
     amino acid residues is different; (2) a short deletion or addition of one or a few amino acid
    residues to the sequence of the protein; (3) a longer deletion or addition of amino acid
    residues, such that an entire protein domain or sub-domain is removed or added; (4)
25   expression of an increased amount of the protein, compared to a control or standard amount;
     (5) expression of an decreased amount of the protein, compared to a control or standard
     amount; (6) alteration of the subcellular localization or targeting of the protein; (7) alteration
     of the temporally regulated expression of the protein (such that the protein is expressed
    when it normally would not be, or alternatively is not expressed when it normally would
30  be); and (8) alteration of the localized (for example, organ or tissue specific) expression of
    the protein (such that the protein is not expressed where it would normally be expressed or
    is expressed where it normally would not be expressed), each compared to a control or
     standard.
              Controls or standards appropriate for comparison to a sample, for the determination
35   of altered expression, include samples believed to express normally as well as laboratory
                                                        24

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    values, even though possibly arbitrarily set, keeping in mind that such values may vary from
     laboratory to laboratory. Laboratory standards and values may be set based on a known or
     determined population value and may be supplied in the format of a graph or table that
    permits easy comparison of measured, experimentally determined values.
 5            Analog, derivative or mimetic: An analog is a molecule that differs in chemical
     structure from a parent compound, for example a homolog (differing by an increment in the
    chemical structure, such as a difference in the length of an alkyl chain), a molecular
     fragment, a structure that differs by one or more functional groups, a change in ionization.
     Structural analogs are often found using quantitative structure activity relationships
10   (QSAR), with techniques such as those disclosed in Remington (The Science and Practiceof
    Pharmacology,19th Edition (1995), chapter 28). A derivative is a biologically active
    molecule derived from the base structure. A mimetic is a molecule that mimics the activity
     of another molecule, such as a biologically active molecule. Biologically active molecules
    can include chemical structures that mimic the biological activities of a compound. It is
15   acknowledged that these terms may overlap in some circumstances.
              Antibody: A protein (or protein complex) that includes one or more polypeptides
     substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes.
    The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta,
     epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable
20  region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are
    classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin
    classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.
              The basic immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is generally a tetramer. Each
    tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one light
25   (about 25 kD) and one heavy chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines
     a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen
    recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer,
    respectively, to these light and heavy chains.
              As used herein, the term antibody includes intact immunoglobulins as well as a
30  number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases, or
    genetically engineered artificial antibodies. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody
    below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)' 2, a dimer of Fab which
    itself is a light chain joined to VH-CH 1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)' 2 may be reduced
    under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting
35  the F(ab)' 2 dimer into an Fab' monomer. The Fab' monomer is essentially a Fab with part
                                                       25

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
     of the hinge region (see, FundamentalImmunology, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y.,
     1993). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact
     antibody, it will be appreciated that Fab' fragments may be synthesized de novo either
    chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody as used
 5  herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole
     antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies.
               Antibodies for use in the methods, compositions, and systems of this disclosure can
    be monoclonal or polyclonal. Merely by way of example, monoclonal antibodies can be
    prepared from murine hybridomas according to the classical method of Kohler and Milstein
10   (Nature256:495-497, 1975) or derivative methods thereof. Detailed procedures for
    monoclonal antibody production are described in Harlow and Lane (Antibodies,A
    LaboratoryManual, CSHL, New York, 1988).
               The terms bind specifically and specific binding refer to the ability of a specific
    binding agent (such as, an antibody) to bind to a target molecular species in preference to
15  binding to other molecular species with which the specific binding agent and target
    molecular species are admixed. A specific binding agent is said specifically to recognize a
    target molecular species when it can bind specifically to that target.
               A single-chain antibody (scFv) is a genetically engineered molecule containing the
    VH and VL domains of one or more antibody(ies) linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a
20  genetically fused single chain molecule (see, for example, Bird et al., Science, 242:423-426,
     1988; Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85:5879-5883, 1988). Diabodies are bivalent,
    bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide
    chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on
    the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another
25  chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see, for example, Holliger et al., Proc.Nat.
    Acad. Sci., 90:6444-6448, 1993; Poljak et al., Structure, 2:1121-1123, 1994). One or more
     CDRs may be incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make the
    resultant molecule an immunoadhesin. An immunoadhesin may incorporate the CDR(s) as
    part of a larger polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide
30  chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the immunoadhesin
    to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest. A chimeric antibody is an antibody
    that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or
    more other antibodies.
               An antibody may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding
35   site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For instance, a
                                                        26

WO 2008/060785                                                                  PCT/US2007/080647
    naturally-occurring immunoglobulin has two identical binding sites, a single-chain antibody
     or Fab fragment has one binding site, while a bispecific or bifunctional antibody has two
     different binding sites.
              A neutralizing antibody or an inhibitory antibody is an antibody that inhibits at least
 5   one activity of a target -- usually a polypeptide -- such as by blocking the binding of the
    polypeptide to a ligand to which it normally binds, or by disrupting or otherwise interfering
    with a protein-protein interaction of the polypeptide with a second polypeptide. An
     activating antibody is an antibody that increases an activity of a polypeptide. Antibodies
    may function as mimics of a target protein activity, or as blockers of the target protein
10   activity, with therapeutic effect derived therein.
              Antigen: A compound, composition, or substance that can stimulate the production
     of antibodies or a T-cell response in an animal, including compositions that are injected or
     absorbed into an animal. An antigen reacts with the products of specific humoral or cellular
    immunity, including those induced by heterologous immunogens.
15            Antisense, Sense, and Antigene: Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) has two strands,
     a 5' -> 3' strand, referred to as the plus strand, and a 3' -> 5' strand (the reverse
    compliment), referred to as the minus strand. Because RNA polymerase adds nucleic acids
    in a 5' -> 3' direction, the minus strand of the DNA serves as the template for the RNA
     during transcription. Thus, the RNA formed will have a sequence complementary to the
20  minus strand and identical to the plus strand (except that U is substituted for T).
              Antisense molecules are molecules that are specifically hybridizable or specifically
    complementary to either RNA or plus strand DNA. Sense molecules are molecules that are
     specifically hybridizable or specifically complementary to the minus strand of DNA.
    Antigene molecules are either antisense or sense molecules complimentary to a dsDNA
25  target. In one embodiment, an antisense molecule specifically hybridizes to a target mRNA
     and inhibits transcription of the target mRNA.
              Aptamer: A single-stranded nucleic acid molecule (such as DNA or RNA) that
     assumes a specific, sequence-dependent shape and binds to a target protein with high
     affinity and specificity. Aptamers generally comprise fewer than 100 nucleotides, fewer
30  than 75 nucleotides, or fewer than 50 nucleotides. Mirror-image aptamer(s) (also called
     SpiegelmersTM) are high-affinity L-enantiomeric nucleic acids (for example, L-ribose or L
    2'-deoxyribose units) that display high resistance to enzymatic degradation compared with
    D-oligonucleotides (such as aptamers). The target binding properties of mirror-image
     aptamers are designed by an in vitro-selection process starting from a random pool of
35   oligonucleotides, as described for example, in Wlotzka et al., Proc.Nat. A cad. Sci.

     99(13):8898-8902, 2002. Applying this method, high affinity mirror-image aptamers
     specific for a polypeptide can be generated.
              Arthritis: Arthritis is an inflammatory disease that affects the synovial membranes
     of one or more joints in the body. It is the most common type of joint disease, and it is
 5  characterized by the inflammation of the joint. The disease is usually oligoarticular (affects
     few joints), but may be generalized. The joints commonly involved include the hips, knees,
     lower lumbar and cervical vertebrae, proximal and distal interphangeal joints of the fingers,
     first carpometacarpal joints, and first tarsometatarsal joints of the feet.
              Atherosclerosis: The progressive narrowing and hardening of a blood vessel over
10  time. Atherosclerosis is a common form of arteriosclerosis in which deposits of yellowish
    plaques (atheromas) containing cholesterol, lipoid material and lipophages are formed
    within the intima and inner media of large and medium-sized arteries. Treatment of
     atherosclerosis includes reversing or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis, for example
     as measured by the presence of atherosclerotic lesions and/or functional signs of the disease,
15   such as improvement in cardiovascular function as measured by signs (such as peripheral
    capillary refill), symptoms (such as chest pain and intermittent claudication), or laboratory
     evidence (such as that obtained by EKG, angiography, or other imaging techniques).
              Binding affinity: A term that refers to the strength of binding of one molecule to
     another at a site on the molecule. If a particular molecule will bind to or specifically
20   associate with another particular molecule, these two molecules are said to exhibit binding
     affinity for each other. Binding affinity is related to the association constant and
     dissociation constant for a pair of molecules, but it is not critical to the methods herein that
    these constants be measured or determined. Rather, affinities as used herein to describe
    interactions between molecules of the described methods are generally apparent affinities
25   (unless otherwise specified) observed in empirical studies, which can be used to compare
    the relative strength with which one molecule (e.g., an antibody or other specific binding
    partner) will bind two other molecules (e.g., two versions or variants of a peptide). The
    concepts of binding affinity, association constant, and dissociation constant are well known.
              Binding domain: The molecular structure associated with that portion of a receptor
30  that binds ligand. More particularly, the binding domain may refer to a polypeptide, natural
     or synthetic, or nucleic acid encoding such a polypeptide, the amino acid sequence of which
    represents a specific region (binding domain) of a protein, which either alone or in
    combination with other domains, exhibits binding characteristics. Neither the specific
     sequences nor the specific boundaries of such domains are critical, so long as binding
35   activity is exhibited. Likewise, used in this context, binding characteristics necessarily
                                                        28

    includes a range of affinities, avidities and specificities, and combinations thereof, so long
     as binding activity is exhibited.
              Binding partner: Any molecule or composition capable of recognizing and binding
    to a specific structural aspect of another molecule or composition. Examples of such
 5  binding partners and corresponding molecule or composition include antigen/antibody,
    hapten/antibody, lectin/carbohydrate, apoprotein/cofactor and biotin/(strept)avidin.
               cDNA (complementary DNA): A piece of DNA lacking internal, non-coding
     segments (introns) and transcriptional regulatory sequences. cDNA can also contain
    untranslated regions (UTRs) that are responsible for translational control in the
10  corresponding RNA molecule. cDNA is synthesized in the laboratory by reverse
    transcription from messenger RNA extracted from cells.
               Cerebral ischemia or ischemic stroke: A condition that occurs when an artery to
    the brain is partially or completely blocked such that the oxygen demand of the tissue
     exceeds the oxygen supplied. Deprived of oxygen and other nutrients following an ischemic
15   stroke, the brain suffers damage and cell death as a result of the stroke.
              Ischemic stroke can be caused by several different kinds of diseases. The most
    common problem is narrowing of the arteries in the neck or head. This is most often caused
    by atherosclerosis, or gradual cholesterol deposition. If the arteries become too narrow,
    blood cells may collect in them and form blood clots (thrombi). These blood clots can block
20  the artery where they are formed (thrombosis), or can dislodge and become trapped in
     arteries closer to the brain (embolism). Also cerebral stroke can occur when atherosclerotic
    plaque separates away partially from the vessel wall and occludes the flow of blood through
    the blood vessel.
              Another cause of stroke is blood clots in the heart, which can occur as a result of
25  irregular heartbeat (for example, atrial fibrillation), heart attack, prior mural clot formation
    within a heart chamber and abnormalities of the heart valves such as occurs from rheumatic
     fever. While these are the most common causes of ischemic stroke, there are many other
    possible causes. Examples include use of street drugs, traumatic injury to the blood vessels
     of the neck, or disorders of blood clotting.
30            Ischemic stroke is by far the most common kind of stroke, accounting for about
     80% of all strokes. Stroke can affect people of all ages, including children. Many people
    with ischemic strokes are older (60 or more years old, or 65 years or older), and the risk of
     stroke increases with older ages. At each age, stroke is more common in men than women,
     and it is more common among African-Americans than white Americans. Many people
35  with stroke have other problems or conditions which put them at higher risk for stroke, such
                                                        29

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     as high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease, smoking, or diabetes. Subjects with
    cerebral ischemia can benefit from angiogenic therapy and therapies which prevents or
    reduces atherosclerotic plaque in the major arteries of the body.
             Coronary Artery Disease: In coronary artery disease, the coronary arteries
 5  become narrowed (stenosed) or blocked (occluded) by a gradual build-up of fat (cholesterol)
    within or on the artery wall, which reduces blood flow to the heart muscle. This build-up is
    called atherosclerotic plaque or simply plaque.
             If plaque narrows the lumen or channel of the artery, it may make it difficult for
     adequate quantities of blood to flow to the heart muscle. If the build-up reduces flow only
10  mildly, there may be no noticeable symptoms at rest, but symptoms such as chest pressure
    may occur with increased activity or stress. Other symptoms include heartburn, nausea,
    vomiting, shortness of breath and heavy sweating.
             When flow is significantly reduced and the heart muscle does not receive enough
    blood flow to meet its needs (cardiac ischemia), severe symptoms such as chest pain (angina
15  pectoris), heart attack (myocardial infarction), or rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) may
     occur. A heart attack usually is the result of a completely blocked artery, which may
     damage the heart muscle.
             There are three conventional ways to treat atherosclerotic disease: medication,
     surgery, and minimally invasive interventional procedures such as stent implantation,
20  percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), intravascular radiotherapy,
     atherectomy and excimer laser. The purpose of these treatments is to eliminate or reduce
     atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary blood vessels and hence eliminate or reduce
     symptoms, and in the case of coronary artery disease, decrease the risk of heart attack.
             DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid): A long chain polymer that comprises the genetic
25  material of most living organisms (some viruses have genes comprising ribonucleic acid
     (RNA)). The repeating units in DNA polymers are four different nucleotides, each of which
    comprises one of the four bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine bound to a
     deoxyribose sugar to which a phosphate group is attached. Triplets of nucleotides (referred
    to as codons) code for each amino acid in a polypeptide. The term codon is also used for the
30  corresponding (and complementary) sequences of three nucleotides in the mRNA into
    which the DNA sequence is transcribed.
             Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a DNA molecule is intended to include
    the reverse complement of that DNA molecule. Except where single-strandedness is
    required by the text herein, DNA molecules, though written to depict only a single strand,
35   encompass both strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule. Thus, a reference to the
                                                        30

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    nucleic acid molecule that encodes a specific protein, or a fragment thereof, encompasses
    both the sense strand and its reverse complement. Thus, for instance, it is appropriate to
    generate probes or primers from the reverse complement sequence of the disclosed nucleic
     acid molecules.
 5            Deletion: The removal of a sequence of DNA (which may be as short as a single
    nucleotide), the regions on either side being joined together.
              Effective amount of a compound: A quantity of compound sufficient to achieve a
     desired effect in a subject being treated. An effective amount of a compound can be
     administered in a single dose, or in several doses, for example daily, during a course of
10  treatment. However, the effective amount of the compound will be dependent on the
    compound applied, the subject being treated, the severity and type of the affliction, and the
    manner of administration of the compound.
              Elderly: An aged subject, who has passed middle age. In one embodiment, an
     elderly mammalian subject is a subject that has survived more than two-thirds of the normal
15   lifespan for that mammalian species. In a further embodiment, for humans, an aged or
     elderly subject is more than 65 years of age, such as a subject of more than 70, more than 75,
    more than 80 years of age. In yet another embodiment, for mice, an elderly mouse is from
     about 14 to about 18 months of age.
              Encode: A polynucleotide is said to encode a polypeptide if, in its native state or
20  when manipulated by methods well known to those skilled in the art, it can be transcribed
     and/or translated to produce the mRNA for and/or the polypeptide or a fragment thereof.
              Epitope: An antigenic determinant. These are particular chemical groups or
    peptide sequences on a molecule that are antigenic, for instance, that elicit a specific
    immune response. An antibody binds a particular antigenic epitope, based on a 3-D
25   structure of the antibody and the matching or cognate epitope. Epitopes can be formed both
     from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of
     a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure
    to denaturing solvents whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on
    treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more
30  usually, at least 5, about 9, or 8 to 10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.
    Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes include, for example, x-ray
    crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g., "Epitope
    Mapping Protocols" in Methods in MolecularBiology, Vol. 66, Glenn E. Morris, Ed (1996).
    In one embodiment, an epitope binds an MHC molecule, such an HLA molecule or a DR
                                                       31

WO 2008/060785                                                                  PCT/US2007/080647
    molecule. These molecules bind polypeptides having the correct anchor amino acids
     separated by about eight to about ten amino acids, such as nine amino acids.
              Functionally equivalent sequence variant: Sequence alterations that yield the
     same results as described herein. Such sequence alterations can include, but are not limited
 5  to, deletions, base modifications, mutations, labeling, and insertions.
              Fusion protein: A protein comprising two amino acid sequences that are not found
    joined together in nature.
              Gene expression: The process by which the coded information of a nucleic acid
    transcriptional unit (including, for example, genomic DNA or cDNA) is converted into an
10   operational, non-operational, or structural part of a cell, often including the synthesis of a
    protein. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals; for instance, exposure of a
     subject to an agent that inhibits gene expression. Expression of a gene also may be
    regulated anywhere in the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation of gene
     expression occurs, for instance, through controls acting on transcription, translation, RNA
15  transport and processing, degradation of intermediary molecules such as mRNA, or through
     activation, inactivation, compartmentalization or degradation of specific protein molecules
     after they have been made, or by combinations thereof. Gene expression may be measured
     at the RNA level or the protein level and by any method known in the art, including
    Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, or in vitro, in situ, or in vivo protein activity assay(s).
20            The expression of a nucleic acid may be modulated compared to a control state,
     such as at a control time (for example, prior to administration of a substance or agent that
     affects regulation of the nucleic acid under observation) or in a control cell or subject, or as
    compared to another nucleic acid. Such modulation includes but is not necessarily limited
    to overexpression, underexpression, or suppression of expression. In addition, it is
25  understood that modulation of nucleic acid expression may be associated with, and in fact
    may result in, a modulation in the expression of an encoded protein or even a protein that is
    not encoded by that nucleic acid.
              Interfering with or inhibiting gene expression refers to the ability of an agent to
    measurably reduce the expression of a target gene. Expression of a target gene may be
30  measured by any method known to those of skill in the art, including for example measuring
    mRNA or protein levels. It is understood that interfering with or inhibiting gene expression
    is relative, and does not require absolute suppression of the gene. Thus, in certain
     embodiments, interfering with or inhibiting gene expression of a target gene requires that,
     following application of an agent, the gene is expressed at least 5% less than prior to
35   application, at least 10% less, at least 15% less, at least 20% less, at least 25% less, or even
                                                        32

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    more reduced. Thus, in some particular embodiments, application of an agent reduces
     expression of the target gene by about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, or more. In
     specific examples, where the agent is particularly effective, expression is reduced by 70%,
     80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or even more. Gene expression is substantially eliminated when
 5   expression of the gene is reduced by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or even 100%.
              Graft: Material, especially living tissue or an organ, surgically attached to or
    inserted into a bodily part to replace a damaged part or compensate for a defect. Particular
     examples of grafts include organ grafts and skin grafts. Grafts can also include composite
    units of tissue composed of more than one tissue type, and may or may not be possessed of a
10   dominant vascular supply. Such grafts may be applied to wounds and receive blood flow
    through angiogenesis or through immediate re-vascularization by microsurgical techniques.
     Grafts also may comprise a combination of living and a-cellular nonliving substrates that
     support a living cellular component, and may be artificially engineered in vitro for eventual
     in vivo implantation. Grafts may also be engineered to be capable of release of
15  therapeutically active agents and compounds. For instance, grafts can include non-living
    tissue which may contain drugs and/or reagents for sustained release locally and/or
     systemically.
              Heterologous: A type of sequence that is not normally (for example, in the wild
    type sequence) found adjacent to a second sequence. In one embodiment, the sequence is
20   from a different genetic source, such as a virus or other organism, than the second sequence.
              Hybridization: Oligonucleotides and their analogs hybridize by hydrogen bonding,
    which includes Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding,
    between complementary bases. Generally, nucleic acid consists of nitrogenous bases that
     are either pyrimidines (cytosine (C), uracil (U), and thymine (T)) or purines (adenine (A)
25   and guanine (G)). These nitrogenous bases form hydrogen bonds between a pyrimidine and
     a purine, and the bonding of the pyrimidine to the purine is referred to as base pairing.
    More specifically, A will hydrogen bond to T or U, and G will bond to C. Complementary
    refers to the base pairing that occurs between to distinct nucleic acid sequences or two
     distinct regions of the same nucleic acid sequence.
30            Hypoxia: Deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching body tissues. Hypoxia
    may occur concurrently with ischemia (lack of blood flow) due to loss of circulation to a
     specific tissue, organ or complete circulatory collapse; or without ischemia, as when
     secondary to a problem in ventilation alone.
              Inflammation: A localized protective response elicited by injury to tissue that
35   serves to sequester the inflammatory agent. Inflammation is characterized by the
                                                       33

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
     appearance in or migration into any tissue space, unit or region of any class of leukocyte in
    numbers that exceed the number of such cells found within such region of tissue under
    normal (healthy) circumstances. Inflammation is orchestrated by a complex biological
    response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or
 5  irritants. It is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli as well as
    initiate the healing process for the tissue. An inflammatory response is an accumulation of
    white blood cells, either systemically or locally at the site of inflammation. The
    inflammatory response may be measured by many methods well known in the art, such as
    the number of white blood cells, the number of polymorphonuclear neutophils (PIN), a
10  measure of the degree of PMN activation, such as luminal enhanced-chemiluminescence, or
     a measure of the amount of cytokines present. Inflammation can lead to a host of
    inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
    Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial
    response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of
15  plasma and leukocytes from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical
     events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular
     system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged
    inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of
    cells which are present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous
20   destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process.
              Inhibiting protein activity: To decrease, limit, or block an action, function or
     expression of a protein. The phrase inhibit protein activity is not intended to be an absolute
    term. Instead, the phrase is intended to convey a wide-range of inhibitory effects that
    various agents may have on the normal (for example, uninhibited or control) protein
25   activity. Inhibition of protein activity may, but need not, result in an increase in the level or
     activity of an indicator of the protein's activity. By way of example, this can happen when
    the protein of interest is acting as an inhibitor or suppressor of a downstream indicator.
    Thus, protein activity may be inhibited when the level or activity of any direct or indirect
    indicator of the protein's activity is changed (for example, increased or decreased) by at
30   least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 100% or at least
    250% or more as compared to control measurements of the same indicator.
              Inhibition of protein activity may also be effected, for example, by inhibiting
     expression of the gene encoding the protein or by decreasing the half-life of the mRNA
     encoding the protein.

              Injectable composition: A pharmaceutically acceptable fluid composition
    comprising at least one active ingredient, for example, a protein, peptide, or antibody. The
     active ingredient is usually dissolved or suspended in a physiologically acceptable carrier,
     and the composition can additionally comprise minor amounts of one or more non-toxic
 5   auxiliary substances, such as emulsifying agents, preservatives, pH buffering agents and the
     like. Such injectable compositions that are useful for use with the compositions of this
     disclosure are conventional; appropriate formulations are well known in the art.
              Ischemia: A vascular phenomenon in which a decrease in the blood supply to a
    bodily organ, tissue, or part is caused, for instance, by constriction or obstruction of one or
10  more blood vessels. Ischemia sometimes results from vasoconstriction or thrombosis or
     embolism. Ischemia can lead to direct ischemic injury, tissue damage due to cell death
    caused by reduced oxygen supply. Ischemia can occur acutely, as during surgery, or from
    trauma to tissue incurred in accidents, injuries and war settings, for instance. It can also
     occur sub-acutely, as found in atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, where progressive
15  narrowing of blood vessels leads to inadequate blood flow to tissues and organs.
              Ischemia/reperfusion injury: In addition to the immediate injury that occurs
     during deprivation of blood flow, ischemic/reperfusion injury involves tissue injury that
     occurs after blood flow is restored. Current understanding is that much of this injury is
    caused by chemical products and free radicals released into the ischemic tissues.
20            When a tissue is subjected to ischemia, a sequence of chemical events is initiated
    that may ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction and necrosis. If ischemia is ended by the
    restoration of blood flow, a second series of injurious events ensue, producing additional
    injury. Thus, whenever there is a transient decrease or interruption of blood flow in a
     subject, the resultant injury involves two components - the direct injury occurring during the
25  ischemic interval and the indirect or reperfusion injury that follows. When there is a long
     duration of ischemia, the direct ischemic damage, resulting from hypoxia, is predominant.
    For relatively short duration ischemia, the indirect or reperfusion mediated damage becomes
    increasingly important. In some instances, the injury produced by reperfusion can be more
     severe than the injury induced by ischemia per se. This pattern of relative contribution of
30  injury from direct and indirect mechanisms has been shown to occur in all organs.
              Isolated: An isolated biological component (such as a nucleic acid, peptide or
    protein) has been substantially separated, produced apart from, or purified away from other
    biological components in the cell of the organism in which the component naturally occurs,
     for instance, other chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA and RNA, and proteins.
35  Nucleic acids, peptides and proteins that have been isolated thus include nucleic acids and
                                                        35

    proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces nucleic acids,
    peptides and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as
    chemically synthesized nucleic acids. The terms isolated and purified do not require
     absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative term. Thus, for example, an isolated
 5  peptide preparation is one in which the peptide or protein is more enriched than the peptide
     or protein is in its natural environment within a cell. Preferably, a preparation is purified
     such that the protein or peptide represents at least 50% of the total peptide or protein content
     of the preparation.
              Label: A detectable compound or composition that is conjugated directly or
10  indirectly to another molecule to facilitate detection of that molecule. Specific, non-limiting
     examples of labels include fluorescent tags, enzymatic linkages, and radioactive isotopes.
              Mammal: This term includes both human and non-human mammals. Similarly,
    the term subject includes both human and veterinary subjects, for example, humans, non
    human primates, mice, rats, dogs, cats, horses, and cows.
15            Modulator: An agent that increases or decreases (modulates) the activity of a
    protein or other bio-active compound, as measured by the change in an experimental
    biological parameter. A modulator can be essentially any compound or mixture (for
     example, two or more proteins), such as a NO donor, a polypeptide, a hormone, a nucleic
     acid, a sugar, a lipid and the like.
20            Morpholino: A morpholino oligo is structurally different from natural nucleic
     acids, with morpholino rings replacing the ribose or deoxyribose sugar moieties and non
    ionic phosphorodiamidate linkages replacing the anionic phosphates of DNA and RNA.
    Each morpholino ring suitably positions one of the standard bases (A, G, C, T/U), so that a
    25-base morpholino oligo strongly and specifically binds to its complementary 25-base
25  target site in a strand of RNA via Watson-Crick pairing. Because the backbone of the
    morpholino oligo is not recognized by cellular enzymes of signaling proteins, it is stable to
    nucleases and does not trigger an innate immune response through the toll-like receptors.
    This avoids loss of oligo, inflammation or interferon induction. Morpholinos can be
     delivered by a number of techniques, including direct injection to tissues or via infusion
30  pump and intravenous bolus.
              Mutation: Any change of DNA sequence, for instance within a gene or
    chromosome. In some instances, a mutation will alter a characteristic or trait (phenotype),
    but this is not always the case. Types of mutations include base substitution point mutations
     (for example, transitions or transversions), deletions, and insertions. Missense mutations are
35  those that introduce a different amino acid into the sequence of the encoded protein;
                                                          36

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    nonsense mutations are those that introduce a new stop codon. In the case of insertions or
     deletions, mutations can be in-frame (not changing the frame of the overall sequence) or
     frame shift mutations, which may result in the misreading of a large number of codons (and
     often leads to abnormal termination of the encoded product due to the presence of a stop
 5  codon in the alternative frame).
              This term specifically encompasses variations that arise through somatic mutation,
     for instance those that are found only in disease cells, but not constitutionally, in a given
    individual. Examples of such somatically-acquired variations include the point mutations
    that frequently result in altered function of various genes that are involved in development
10   of cancers. This term also encompasses DNA alterations that are present constitutionally,
    that alter the function of the encoded protein in a readily demonstrable manner, and that can
    be inherited by the children of an affected individual. In this respect, the term overlaps with
    polymorphism, as defined below, but generally refers to the subset of constitutional
     alterations that have arisen within the past few generations in kindred and that are not
15  widely disseminated in a population group. In particular embodiments, the term is directed
    to those constitutional alterations that have major impact on the health of affected
    individuals.
              Neurodegenerative disorder: An abnormality in the nervous system of a subject,
     such as a mammal, in which neuronal integrity is threatened. Without being bound by
20  theory, neuronal integrity can be threatened when neuronal cells display decreased survival
     or when the neurons can no longer propagate a signal. Specific, non-limiting examples of a
    neurodegenerative disorder are Alzheimer's disease, Pantothenate kinase associated
    neurodegeneration, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease (Dexter et al., Brain
     114:1953-1975, 1991), HIV encephalopathy (Miszkziel et al., Magnetic Res. Imag.
25   15:1113-1119, 1997), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
              Alzheimer's disease manifests itself as pre-senile dementia. The disease is
    characterized by confusion, memory failure, disorientation, restlessness, speech
     disturbances, and hallucination in mammals (Medical,Nursing, andAllied Health
    Dictionary, 4th Ed., 1994, Editors: Anderson, Anderson, Glanze, St. Louis, Mosby).
30            Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive, degenerative, neurologic disorder
    characterized by resting tremor, loss of postural reflexes, and muscle rigidity and weakness
     (Medical,Nursing, andAllied Health Dictionary, 4th Ed., 1994, Editors: Anderson,
    Anderson, Glanze, St. Louis, Mosby).
              Nitric Oxide synthase: An enzyme that catalyzes conversion of 1-arginine,
35  NADPH and oxygen to citrulline, nitric oxide and NADP+. Nitric oxide synthase catalyzes
                                                       37

    nitric oxide synthesis in the inner lining cells of blood vessels, as well as in macrophages
     and nerve cells. The generic nomenclature includes all three known isoforms of NOS
     designated in the literature as eNOS, iNOS and nNOS and alternatively as NOS-, NOSII
     and NOS-IIL
 5             Nucleic acid molecule: A polymeric form of nucleotides, which may include both
     sense and anti-sense strands of RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic forms and mixed
    polymers thereof. A nucleotide refers to a ribonucleotide, deoxynucleotide or a modified
     form of either type of nucleotide. A nucleic acid molecule as used herein is synonymous
    with nucleic acid and polynucleotide. A nucleic acid molecule is usually at least 10 bases in
10   length, unless otherwise specified. The term includes single- and double-stranded forms. A
    polynucleotide may include either or both naturally occurring and modified nucleotides
     linked together by naturally occurring and/or non-naturally occurring nucleotide linkages.
               Nucleic acid molecules may be modified chemically or biochemically or may
    contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases, as will be readily appreciated by those
15   of skill in the art. Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation, substitution
     of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide
    modifications, such as uncharged linkages (for example, methyl phosphonates,
    phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, etc.), charged linkages (for example,
    phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), pendent moieties (for example, polypeptides),
20  intercalators (for example, acridine, psoralen, etc.), chelators, alkylators, and modified
     linkages (for example, alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.). The term nucleic acid molecule
     also includes any topological conformation, including single-stranded, double-stranded,
    partially duplexed, triplexed, hairpinned, circular and padlocked conformations. Also
    included are synthetic molecules that mimic polynucleotides in their ability to bind to a
25   designated sequence via hydrogen bonding and other chemical interactions. Such molecules
     are known in the art and include, for example, those in which peptide linkages substitute for
    phosphate linkages in the backbone of the molecule.
               Unless specified otherwise, the left hand end of a polynucleotide sequence written
    in the sense orientation is the 5' end and the right hand end of the sequence is the 3' end. In
30   addition, the left hand direction of a polynucleotide sequence written in the sense orientation
    is referred to as the 5' direction, while the right hand direction of the polynucleotide
     sequence is referred to as the 3' direction. Further, unless otherwise indicated, each
    nucleotide sequence is set forth herein as a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides. It is
    intended, however, that the given sequence be interpreted as would be appropriate to the
                                                         38

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    polynucleotide composition: for example, if the isolated nucleic acid is composed of RNA,
    the given sequence intends ribonucleotides, with uridine substituted for thymidine.
              An anti-sense nucleic acid is a nucleic acid (such as, an RNA or DNA
     oligonucleotide) that has a sequence complementary to a second nucleic acid molecule (for
 5   example, an mRNA molecule). An anti-sense nucleic acid will specifically bind with high
     affinity to the second nucleic acid sequence. If the second nucleic acid sequence is an
    mRNA molecule, for example, the specific binding of an anti-sense nucleic acid to the
    mRNA molecule can prevent or reduce translation of the mRNA into the encoded protein or
     decrease the half life of the mRNA, and thereby inhibit the expression of the encoded
10  protein.
               Oligonucleotide: A plurality of joined nucleotides joined by native phosphodiester
    bonds, between about 6 and about 300 nucleotides in length. An oligonucleotide analog
    refers to moieties that function similarly to oligonucleotides but have non-naturally
     occurring portions. For example, oligonucleotide analogs can contain non-naturally
15   occurring portions, such as altered sugar moieties or inter-sugar linkages, such as a
    phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide. Functional analogs of naturally occurring
    polynucleotides can bind to RNA or DNA, and include peptide nucleic acid (PNA)
    molecules and morpholinos.
              Particular oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs can include linear
20   sequences up to about 200 nucleotides in length, for example a sequence (such as DNA or
    RNA) that is at least 6 bases, for example at least 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100 or
     even 200 bases long, or from about 6 to about 50 bases, for example about 10-25 bases, such
     as 12, 15 or 20 bases.
               Operably linked: A first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second
25  nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional
    relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably
     linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the
    coding sequence. Generally, operably linked DNA sequences are contiguous and, where
    necessary to join two protein-coding regions, in the same reading frame.
30             Open reading frame: A series of nucleotide triplets (codons) coding for amino
     acids without any internal termination codons. These sequences are usually translatable into
     a peptide.
               Ortholog: Two nucleic acid or amino acid sequences are orthologs of each other if
    they share a common ancestral sequence and diverged when a species carrying that ancestral
35   sequence split into two species. Orthologous sequences are also homologous sequences.
                                                       39

              Parenteral: Administered outside of the intestine, for example, not via the
     alimentary tract. Generally, parenteral formulations are those that will be administered
    through any possible mode except ingestion. This term especially refers to injections,
    whether administered intravenously, intrathecally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or
 5   subcutaneously, and various surface applications including intranasal, intradermal, and
    topical application, for instance.
              Periodontal disease: An inflammatory disease affecting the tissues that surround
     and support the teeth. Periodontitis is an inflammation of the periodontium, or one of the
     four tissues that support the teeth in the mouth, such as the gingival (gum tissue), cementum
10   (outer layer of the roots of teeth), alveolar bone (bone sockets into which the teeth are
     anchored), and the periodontal ligaments (connective tissue fibres that connect the
    cementum and the gingiva to the alveolar bone). Periodontitis involves progressive loss of
    bone around teeth which may lead to loosening and eventual loss of teeth.
              Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): A condition in which the arteries and/or
15  veins that carry blood to and from the arms, legs, soft tissues and vital organs of the body,
    including the heart and brain, become narrowed or occluded. This interferes with the
    normal flow of blood, sometimes causing pain but often causing no readily detectable
     symptoms. With progression of PVD, significant loss of blood flow to tissue and organs
    can lead to tissue death, necrosis and organ death.
20            The most common cause of PVD is atherosclerosis, a gradual process in which
    cholesterol and scar tissue build up, forming plaques that occlude the blood vessels. In
     some cases, PVD may be caused by blood clots that lodge in the arteries and restrict blood
     flow.
              PVD affects about one in 20 people over the age of 50, or 8 million people in the
25  United States. More than half the people with PVD experience leg pain, numbness or other
     symptoms, but many people dismiss these signs as a normal part of aging and do not seek
    medical help.
              The most common symptom of PVD is painful cramping in the leg or hip,
    particularly when walking. This symptom, also known as claudication, occurs when there is
30  not enough blood flowing to the leg muscles during exercise, such that ischemia occurs.
    The pain typically goes away when the muscles are rested.
              Other symptoms may include numbness, tingling or weakness in the leg. In severe
    cases, people with PVD may experience a burning or aching pain in an extremity such as the
     foot or toes while resting, or may develop a sore on the leg or foot that does not heal.
35  People with PVD also may experience a cooling or color change in the skin of the legs or
                                                        40

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
     feet, or loss of hair on the legs. In extreme cases, untreated PVD can lead to gangrene, a
     serious condition that may require amputation of a leg, foot or toes. People with PVD are
     also at higher risk for heart disease and stroke.
              Typically most symptomatic PVD is ascribed to peripheral artery disease (PAD)
 5   denoting the above described pathology predominantly in arteries. The term PVD includes
    this symptomology and pathology in all classes of blood vessels.
              Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
    useful in this disclosure are conventional. Remington 's PharmaceuticalSciences, by E. W.
    Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and
10   formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of the compounds herein disclosed.
              In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of
     administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise
    injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as
    water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as
15   a vehicle. For solid compositions (for example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms),
    conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of
    mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers,
    pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic
     auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering
20   agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.
              Pharmaceutical agent: A chemical compound or composition capable of inducing
     a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect when properly administered to a subject or a
    cell. Incubating includes exposing a target to an agent for a sufficient period of time for the
     agent to interact with a cell. Contacting includes incubating an agent in solid or in liquid
25   form with a cell.
              Polypeptide: A polymer in which the monomers are amino acid residues that are
    joined together through amide bonds. When the amino acids are alpha-amino acids, either
    the L-optical isomer or the D-optical isomer can be used, the L-isomers being preferred.
    The term polypeptide or protein as used herein encompasses any amino acid sequence and
30  includes modified sequences such as glycoproteins. The term polypeptide is specifically
    intended to cover naturally occurring proteins, as well as those that are recombinantly or
     synthetically produced.
              The term polypeptide fragment refers to a portion of a polypeptide that exhibits at
     least one useful epitope. The phrase "functional fragment(s) of a polypeptide" refers to all
35   fragments of a polypeptide that retain an activity, or a measurable portion of an activity, of
                                                         41

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
    the polypeptide from which the fragment is derived. Fragments, for example, can vary in
     size from a polypeptide fragment as small as an epitope capable of binding an antibody
    molecule to a large polypeptide capable of participating in the characteristic induction or
    programming of phenotypic changes within a cell. An epitope is a region of a polypeptide
 5  capable of binding an immunoglobulin generated in response to contact with an antigen.
    Thus, smaller peptides containing the biological activity of insulin, or conservative variants
     of the insulin, are thus included as being of use.
              Conservative amino acid substitution tables providing functionally similar amino
     acids are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The following six groups are
10   examples of amino acids that are considered to be conservative substitutions for one
     another:
              1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T);
              2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);
              3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);
15            4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);
              5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and
              6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W).
              In some circumstances, variations in the cDNA sequence that result in amino acid
20  changes, whether conservative or not, are minimized in order to preserve the functional and
    immunologic identity of the encoded protein. The immunologic identity of the protein may
    be assessed by determining whether it is recognized by an antibody; a variant that is
    recognized by such an antibody is immunologically conserved. Any cDNA sequence
    variant will preferably introduce no more than twenty, and preferably fewer than ten amino
25   acid substitutions into the encoded polypeptide. Variant amino acid sequences may, for
     example, be 80%, 90%, or even 95% or 98% identical to the native amino acid sequence.
    Programs and algorithms for determining percentage identity can be found at the NCBI
    website.
              Preventing or treating a disease: Preventing a disease refers to inhibiting the full
30   development of a disease, for example inhibiting the development of myocardial infarction
    in a person who has coronary artery disease or inhibiting the progression or metastasis of a
    tumor in a subject with a neoplasm. Treatment refers to a therapeutic intervention that
     ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition after it has begun to
     develop.

              Purified: In a more pure form than is found in nature. The term purified does not
    require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative term. Thus, for example, a purified
    protein preparation is one in which the protein referred to is more pure than the protein in its
    natural environment within a cell.
 5            The term substantially purified as used herein refers to a molecule (for example, a
    nucleic acid, polypeptide, oligonucleotide, etc.) that is substantially free of other proteins,
     lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally associated. In one
     embodiment, a substantially purified molecule is a polypeptide that is at least 50% free of
     other proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally associated.
10  In another embodiment, the polypeptide is at least at least 80% free of other proteins, lipids,
    carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally associated. In yet other
     embodiments, the polypeptide is at least 90% or at least 95% free of other proteins, lipids,
    carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally associated.
              Recombinant: A nucleic acid that has a sequence that is not naturally occurring or
15  has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated
     segments of sequence. This artificial combination can be accomplished by chemical
     synthesis or, more commonly, by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic
     acids, for example, by genetic engineering techniques.
              Reperfusion: Restoration of blood supply to tissue that is ischemic, due to
20   decrease in blood supply. Reperfusion is a procedure for treating infarction or other
    ischemia, by enabling viable ischemic tissue to recover, thus limiting further necrosis.
    However, reperfusion can itself further damage the ischemic tissue, causing reperfusion
    injury.
              Rheumatoid arthritis: A chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease that affects the
25   synovial membranes of multiple joints in the body. Because the disease is systemic, there
     are many extra-articular features of the disease as well. For example, neuropathy, scleritis,
     lymphadenopathy, pericarditis, splenomegaly, arteritis, and rheumatoid nodules are frequent
    components of the disease. In most cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the subject has remissions
     and exacerbations of the symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is considered an autoimmune
30   disease that is acquired and in which genetic factors appear to play a role.
              Ribozyme: RNA molecules with enzyme-like properties, which can be designed to
    cleave specific RNA sequences. Ribozymes are also known as RNA enzymes or catalytic
    RNAs.
              RNA interference (RNA silencing; RNAi): A gene-silencing mechanism whereby
35   specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) trigger the degradation of homologous mRNA (also
                                                        43

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    called target RNA). Double-stranded RNA is processed into small interfering RNAs
     (siRNA), which serve as a guide for cleavage of the homologous mRNA in the
    RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The remnants of the target RNA may then also
     act as siRNA; thus resulting in a cascade effect.
 5            Senescence: The biological process(es) of aging and showing the effects of
    increased age. In one embodiment, a senescent cell does not divide and/or has a reduced
    capacity to divide.
              Sequence identity: The similarity between two nucleic acid sequences, or two
     amino acid sequences, is expressed in terms of the similarity between the sequences,
10   otherwise referred to as sequence identity. Sequence identity is frequently measured in
    terms of percentage identity (or similarity or homology); the higher the percentage, the more
     similar the two sequences are.
              Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art.
    Various programs and alignment algorithms are described in: Smith and Waterman (A dv.
15  AppL. Math. 2: 482, 1981); Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443, 1970); Pearson

20  presents a detailed consideration of sequence alignment methods and homology
    calculations.
              The alignment tools ALIGN (Myers and Miller, CABIOS 4:11-17, 1989) or
    LFASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) may be used to perform sequence comparisons
     (Internet Program 0 1996, W. R. Pearson and the University of Virginia, fasta20u63 version
25  2.0u63, release date December 1996). ALIGN compares entire sequences against one
     another, while LFASTA compares regions of local similarity. These alignment tools and
    their respective tutorials are available on the Internet at the NCSA Website. Alternatively,
     for comparisons of amino acid sequences of greater than about 30 amino acids, the Blast 2
     sequences function can be employed using the default BLOSUM62 matrix set to default
30  parameters, (gap existence cost of 11, and a per residue gap cost of 1). When aligning short
    peptides (fewer than around 30 amino acids), the alignment should be performed using the
    Blast 2 sequences function, employing the PAM30 matrix set to default parameters (open
    gap 9, extension gap 1 penalties). The BLAST sequence comparison system is available,
     for instance, from the NCBI web site; see also Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410,

              Orthologs of proteins are typically characterized by possession of greater than 75%
     sequence identity counted over the full-length alignment with the amino acid sequence of
 5   specific protein using ALIGN set to default parameters. Proteins with even greater
     similarity to a reference sequence will show increasing percentage identities when assessed
    by this method, such as at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 95%,
     or at least 98% sequence identity. In addition, sequence identity can be compared over the
     full length of particular domains of the disclosed peptides.
10            When significantly less than the entire sequence is being compared for sequence
    identity, homologous sequences will typically possess at least 80% sequence identity over
     short windows of 10-20 amino acids, and may possess sequence identities of at least 85%, at
     least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% depending on their similarity to the reference
     sequence. Sequence identity over such short windows can be determined using LFASTA;
15  methods are described at the NCSA Website. One of skill in the art will appreciate that
    these sequence identity ranges are provided for guidance only; it is entirely possible that
     strongly significant homologs could be obtained that fall outside of the ranges provided.
              An alternative indication that two nucleic acid molecules are closely related is that
    the two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. Stringent conditions
20   are sequence-dependent and are different under different environmental parameters.
     Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5C to 20'C lower than the thermal
    melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is
    the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence
    hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Conditions for nucleic acid hybridization and
25  calculation of stringencies can be found in Sambrook et al. (In Molecular Cloning: A
    LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989) and Tijssen (Laboratory
     Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PartI, Ch. 2, Elsevier, New York,
     1993).
              Hybridization conditions resulting in particular degrees of stringency will vary
30   depending upon the nature of the hybridization method of choice and the composition and
     length of the hybridizing nucleic acid sequences. Generally, the temperature of
    hybridization and the ionic strength (especially the Na+ concentration) of the hybridization
    buffer will determine the stringency of hybridization, though waste times also influence
     stringency. Calculations regarding hybridization conditions required for attaining particular
35   degrees of stringency are discussed by Sambrook et al. (ed.), Molecular Cloning:A

    Harbor, NY, 1989, chapters 9 and 11, herein incorporated by reference. The following is an
     exemplary set of hybridization conditions:
     Very High Stringency (detects sequences that share 90% identity)
 5      Hybridization:         5x SSC at 65'C for 16 hours
        Wash twice:            2x SSC at room temperature (RT) for 15 minutes each
        Wash twice:            0.5x SSC at 65'C for 20 minutes each
    High Stringency (detects sequences that share 80% identity or greater)
10      Hybridization:         5x-6x SSC at 65 0 C-70'C for 16-20 hours
        Wash twice:            2x SSC at RT for 5-20 minutes each
        Wash twice:            1x SSC at 55 0 C-70'C for 30 minutes each
    Low Stringency (detects sequences that share greaterthan 50% identity)
15      Hybridization:         6x SSC at RT to 55 0 C for 16-20 hours
        Wash at least twice: 2x-3x SSC at RT to 55 0 C for 20-30 minutes each.
              Nucleic acid sequences that do not show a high degree of identity may nevertheless
     encode similar amino acid sequences, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. It is
20  understood that changes in nucleic acid sequence can be made using this degeneracy to
    produce multiple nucleic acid sequences that each encode substantially the same protein.
              Specifically hybridizable and specifically complementary are terms that indicate a
     sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between
    the oligonucleotide (or its analog) and the DNA or RNA target. The oligonucleotide or
25   oligonucleotide analog need not be 100% complementary to its target sequence to be
     specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide or analog is specifically hybridizable when
    binding of the oligonucleotide or analog to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with
    the normal function of the target DNA or RNA, and there is a sufficient degree of
    complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide or analog to non
30  target sequences under conditions where specific binding is desired, for example under
    physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or systems. Such binding is referred to
     as specific hybridization.
              Small interfering RNAs: Synthetic or naturally-produced small double stranded
    RNAs (dsRNAs) that can induce gene-specific inhibition of expression in invertebrate and
35  vertebrate species are provided. These RNAs are suitable for interference or inhibition of
     expression of a target gene and comprise double stranded RNAs of about 15 to about 40
    nucleotides containing a 3' and/or 5' overhang on each strand having a length of 0- to about

     5-nucleotides, wherein the sequence of the double stranded RNAs is essentially identical to
     a portion of a coding region of the target gene for which interference or inhibition of
     expression is desired. The double stranded RNAs can be formed from complementary
     ssRNAs or from a single stranded RNA that forms a hairpin or from expression from a DNA
 5  vector.
              Small molecule inhibitor: A molecule, typically with a molecular weight less than
     1000, or in some embodiments, less than about 500 Daltons, wherein the molecule is
    capable of inhibiting, to some measurable extent, an activity of some target molecule.
              Subject: Living multi-cellular organisms, including vertebrate organisms, a
10  category that includes both human and non-human mammals.
              Target sequence: A target sequence is a portion of ssDNA, dsDNA, or RNA that,
    upon hybridization to a therapeutically effective oligonucleotide or oligonucleotide analog
     (e.g., a morpholino), results in the inhibition of expression of the target. Either an antisense
     or a sense molecule can be used to target a portion of dsDNA, as both will interfere with the
15   expression of that portion of the dsDNA. The antisense molecule can bind to the plus
     strand, and the sense molecule can bind to the minus strand. Thus, target sequences can be
     ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA.
              Test compound: A compound used in a test or screen, and which can be
     essentially any compound, such as a small molecule, a chemotherapeutic, a polypeptide, a
20  hormone, a nucleic acid, a modified nucleic acid, a sugar, a lipid and the like. Test
    compounds are used, for example, when screening for compounds that block the activity of
    TSP1 and/or CD47, or for compounds that affect TSP1 binding to CD47, and alternatively
    that mimic the activity of TSP 1. Test compound may also function to suppress TSP1 and/or
     CD47 expression and/or production. They may also interfere in the action of nitric oxide
25   (NO) on cells and tissues, both by blocking NO-driven stimulation of sGC and by blocking
    targets of NO downstream of sGC.
              Therapeutic: A generic term that includes both diagnosis and treatment.
              Therapeutically effective amount: A quantity of compound sufficient to achieve
     a desired effect in a subject being treated.
30            An effective amount of a compound may be administered in a single dose, or in
     several doses, for example daily, during a course of treatment. However, the effective
     amount will be dependent on the compound applied, the subject being treated, the severity
     and type of the affliction, and the manner of administration of the compound. For example,
     a therapeutically effective amount of an active ingredient can be measured as the
35  concentration (moles per liter or molar-M) of the active ingredient (such as a small
                                                         47

    molecule, peptide, protein, or antibody) in blood (in vivo) or a buffer (in vitro) that produces
     an effect.
               Therapeutically effective dosages of morpholino are generally in the range of 1
     10 jM concentrations. By way of example, as used herein total delivered morpholino to 1
 5  x 2 cm flaps or hind limbs was approximately I to 10 jig of morpholino oligonucleotide.
    Antibodies to TSP1 or CD47 were therapeutically efficacious at 40 jig per flap diluted to a
    concentration of approximately 0.4 ig/ tl. Exact dosage amounts will vary by the size of
    the subject being treated, the duration of the treatment, the mode of administration, and so
     forth.
10             Treating a disease: Includes inhibiting or preventing the partial or full
     development or progression of a disease, for example in a person who is known to have a
    predisposition to a disease. Furthermore, treating a disease refers to a therapeutic
    intervention that ameliorates at least one sign or symptom of a disease or pathological
    condition, or interferes with a pathophysiological process, after the disease or pathological
15  condition has begun to develop.
               Under conditions sufficient for: A phrase that is used to describe any environment
    that permits the desired activity. In one example, includes administering a therapeutically
     effective amount of a composition that includes a peptide, antibody, or oligonucleotide (e.g.,
    morpholino), sufficient to enable the desired activity.
20             Vasculopathy: A disease of the blood vessels. An "age-related vasculopathy" is a
     disease of the blood vessels that is associated with advanced age. One specific, non-limiting
    vasculopathy is atherosclerosis. Other vasculopathies include, but are not limited to,
     diabetic associated vasculopathy, hypertension associated vasculopathy, Burger's disease
     associated vasculopathy and scleroderma associated vasculopathy. It is understood that
25  "endothelial dysfunction" typically refers to an insufficiency in the production or response
    to nitric oxide.
               Vasoconstriction. The diminution of the caliber or cross-sectional area of a blood
    vessel, for instance constriction of arterioles leading to decreased blood flow to a body part.
    This can be caused by a specific vasoconstrictor, an agent (for instance a chemical or
30  biochemical compound) that causes, directly or indirectly, constriction of blood vessels.
     Such an agent can also be referred to as a vasohypertonic agent, and is said to have
    vasoconstrictive activity. A representative category of vasoconstrictors is the vasopressor
     (from the term pressor, tending to increase blood pressure), which term is generally used to
    refer to an agent that stimulates contraction of the muscular tissue of the capillaries and
35   arteries.

               Vasoconstriction also can be due to vasospasm, inadequate vasodilatation,
    thickening of the vessel wall, or the accumulation of flow-restricting materials on the
    internal wall surfaces or within the wall itself. Vasoconstriction is a major presumptive or
    proven factor in aging and in various clinical conditions including progressive generalized
 5   atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, macular degeneration,
    migraine, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, among others.
               Vasodilation. A state of increased caliber of the blood vessels, or the act of dilation
     of a blood vessel, for instance dilation of arterioles leading to increased blood flow to a
    body part. This can be caused by a specific vasodilator, an agent (for instance, a chemical
10   or biochemical compound) that causes, directly or indirectly, dilation of blood vessels. Such
     an agent can also be referred to as a vasohypotonic agent, and is said to have vasodilative
     activity.
               Unless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the
15   same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
    invention belongs.
               The singular terms a, an, and the include plural referents unless context clearly
    indicates otherwise. Similarly, the word or is intended to include and unless the context
    clearly indicates otherwise. Hence comprising A or B means including A, or B, or A and B.

     or molecular mass values, given for nucleic acids or polypeptides are approximate, and are
    provided for description. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
     described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable
    methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents,

30    I.       Thrombospondin and CD47
               Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) is an extracellular protein that is involved in a myriad of
    cellular processes, including platelet aggregation, neurite outgrowth, and cellular
    proliferation. Among TSP1's best-characterized functions is inhibition of angiogenesis.
    Angiogenesis ameliorates the poor oxygenation of damaged tissue that is a limiting factor
35   for patient recovery in a variety of clinical settings, including surgery, burn wound healing,

     organ transplantation and recovery, amputation, peripheral vascular disease and myocardial
    infarction. Because it is desirable to promote angiogenesis within these contexts,
     antagonizing TSP1's activity has been a valuable research objective. Additionally, tumors
    require vascularization for growth. Agents that mimic the ability of TSP 1 to inhibit
 5   angiogenesis are therefore considered possible therapies for cancer. In vitro studies have
     shown the ability of this agent to block tumor driven angiogenesis. In vivo results in
     animals have also been encouraging and have led to clinical trials in people. See Rusk et
    al., Clin CancerRes 12:7456-7464, 2006; Markovic et al., Am J Clin Oncol 30:303-309,
    2007.
10            TSP1 contains three type 1 repeat structural domains and a carboxy-terminal
     domain that were identified as the loci of the full-length protein's anti-angiogenic
     functionality (Lawler, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 12(5): 634-640, 2000). Overexpression of
    TSP1 has been observed in ischemic tissue, and is proposed to regulate angiogenesis within
    ischemic tissue (Favier et al., JPathol.207(3): 358-366, 2005), since TSP1 preferentially
15  interferes with wound healing-associated angiogenesis (Streit et al., EMBO J. 19(13): 3272
     3282, 2000) and limits revascularization in a model of hind limb ischemia similar to that
     employed by the current inventors (Kopp et al., J. Clin. Invest. 116(12): 3277-3291, 2006).
    Peptides derived from the type 1 repeats inhibit angiogenesis (Shafiee et al., IOVS 41(8):
    2378-2388, 2000; Yee et al., Am J. Pathol. 165(2): 541-552, 2004; Tolsma et al., J. Cell
20  Biol. 122: 497-511, 1993; Armstrong and Bornstein, Mat. Biol. 22(1): 63-71, 2003; Guo et
    al., CancerRes. 58(14): 3154-3162, 1998). Additional TSP1 peptides (e.g., 4N1 and 7N3
    classes) have previously been described; see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,399,667; 5,627,265;
     and 6,469,138.
              TSP1 acts through several cellular receptors, including CD36 and integrin
25   associated protein (IAP)/CD47. It was originally thought that TSP1 exerted its anti
     angiogenic effects by acting through CD36 (Quesada et al., Cell Death andDiff 12: 649
     658, 2005; Jim6nez et al., Nat Med. 6(1): 41-48, 2000; de Fraipon et al., Trends Mol. Med.
     7(9): 401-407, 2001). Some evidence had indicated that CD36 was not solely responsible
     for the action of TSP1. For example, short peptides comprised of the TSP1 type 1 repeat
30  can inhibit VEGF-induced migration of human endothelial cells that lack CD36 (Short et
    al., J Cell Biol. 168(4): 643-653, 2005). A sequence in the carboxy-terminal domain of
    TSP1 was hypothesized to mediate at least part of the protein's anti-angiogenic effects
    through an interaction with CD47 (Bornstein, J Clin. Inv. 107(8): 929-934, 2001). In
    contrast with the results from TSP1 -derived peptides, the use of oligonucleotides to inhibit
                                                        50

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    production of TSP1 suggested a contributory role of TSP1 in optimal wound healing
     (DiPietro et al., Am J. Pathol. 148(6): 1851-1860, 1996).
              CD47 is an atypical member of the immunoglobulin and the G protein-coupled
    receptor superfamilies. It consists of an N-terminal extracellular IgV set domain, 5
 5  transmembrane segments and an alternatively spliced cytoplasmic tail (Brown and Frazier,
     Trends Cell Biol. 11(3): 130-135, 2001). Although identified earlier as "integrin associated
    protein (IAP), CD47 was discovered to be a receptor for the C-terminal domain of TSP1 in
     1996 (Gao et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271: 21-24, 1996). Two members of the signal inhibitory
    receptor protein family, SIRPa (also known as BIT, SHPS-1 and p84) and SIRPy are cell
10  bound counter receptors for CD47 (van Beek et al., J. Immunol. 175:7781-87, 2005). CD47
    is expressed on many or not all normal cells, and signals primarily through coupling to G
    proteins of the Gi heterotrimeric class (Frazier et al., J. Biol Chem. 274:8554-8560, 1999).
              It was recently discovered that TSP1 exerts anti-vasorelaxive effects on smooth
    muscle by antagonizing the ability of nitric oxide (NO) to stimulate cGMP synthesis
15   (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102(37): 13141-13146, 2005; E-pub September
     6, 2005). This pathway can proceed through either of two receptors, CD36 or CD47; but
    recent work demonstrated that only CD47 is necessary (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem.
    281(36):26069-26080, 2006; E-pub July 11, 2006).
              The structure and function of CD47 has been explored using anti-CD47 antibodies
20   and peptide ligands of the receptor. Anti-CD47 and TSP1-derived CD47 ligands initiate cell
     death in breast cancer cell lines (Manna and Frazier, CancerRes. 64: 1026-1036, 2004) and
    Jurkat T cells (Manna and Frazier, JImmunol. 170(7): 3544-3553, 2003). These, and
     similar experiments, led to the hypothesis that CD47 is necessary for FAS-mediated
     apoptosis of Jurkat T cells (Manna et al., JBiol. Chem. 280(33): 29637-29644, 2005).
25   Synthetic peptides derived from the full-length sequence of CD47 have been used to probe
    its structure (Rebres et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276(37): 34607-34616, 2001). Ligation of CD47
    induces actin polymerization (Rebres et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276(10): 7672-7680, 2001); and
    its ligation by peptides derived from the carboxy-terminus of TSP1 stimulates the adhesion
     of melanoma cells to specific substrates (Barazi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277(45): 42859-42866,
30  2002; Gao et al., J. Cell Biol. 135(2): 533-544, 1996).
              Fundamental to all mammalian life is the ability to regulate blood flow. Acute and
    chronic responses to injury require precise control of blood flow. Lack of adequate
    regulation of blood flow is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Blood flow
    can be regulated in the short term by alterations in vascular resistance which is determined
35  by controlling the diameter of blood vessels. To increase flow, blood vessels dilate and
                                                       51

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    increase in diameter. To decrease flow, the same vessels constrict and decrease their
     diameter. The control of vessel diameter is found within the vascular smooth muscle cells
     (VSMC) which make up the wall of all blood vessels other than capillaries. VSMC have the
     ability to lengthen (relax) or shorten (constrict) in response to various stimuli.
 5             Over the long term blood flow can be regulated by increasing the total number of
    blood vessels in a particular tissue, a process called angiogenesis. One of the primary means
    by which blood vessel diameter is regulated is through the bioactive gas nitric oxide (NO).
    All vascular cells produce NO. Once formed NO signals the blood vessel to relax by
    uncoupling the contractile mechanism within vascular smooth muscle cells.
10            The inherent ability of NO to dilate and relax blood vessels is altered with age. A
    majority of elderly people (> 65 years of age) show decreased ability to relax their blood
    vessels. Varying degrees of pathology in blood vessels at the histologic level and in
    response to stress can be found in a majority of older people in Western countries.
              Described herein are means of maximizing the ability of NO to dilate blood vessels
15   and increase blood flow in response to traumatic interruption of the same and, more
    importantly for elderly individuals, to increase blood flow in the face of peripheral vascular
     disease associated with aging. This allows for enhance blood flow around acute and chronic
    points of flow obstruction. Our identified therapeutics can be delivered precisely and will
     allow for the selective alteration in regional blood flow to vital organs as required and will
20   avoid systemic side effects which have rendered other methods of limited use to date.
    IV.       Nitric Oxide, Ischemia, and Thrombospondin
              Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in angiogenesis both through its direct activity
     on cells and tissue and through functioning as a mediator of signaling by vascular
25   endothelial growth factor and other angiogenic factors. The pro-angiogenic activity of NO
    is mediated by activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), leading to cGMP accumulation
     and activation of its target kinases and ion channels. New research has identified this
    pathway as the primary target of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1
     (TSP1) and shown that circulating levels of thrombospondin-1 are sufficient to limit
30  multiple activities of nitric oxide including NO-driven angiogenic responses and NO
     stimulated effects on blood vessel diameter and blood flow. By blocking the ability of TSP1
    to inhibit NO activity it is possible to selectively increase angiogenesis and/or blood flow
     and tissue/organ perfusion. This provides new insights into the significance of the
    widespread loss of thrombospondin- 1 expression during malignant progression and the
35  increased expression of TSP1 in peripheral vascular disease and atherosclerosis.

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
              Mammalian cells express three isoforms of NOS that are regulated by different
    molecular mechanisms. These isoforms differ in their quantitative and temporal
    contributions to NO profiles associated with pro- or anti-angiogenic processes. Under
    physiological conditions, eNOS generates short bursts of NO (10-30 nM), causing
 5  relaxation of smooth muscle cells. Phosphorylation of eNOS at shrine 1179 leads to
     sustained low fluxes of NO (estimated to be 1-10 nM) that stimulate pro-survival responses
    in endothelial cells and relaxation of VSMC.
              TSP1 is a potent endogenous inhibitor of both physiologic and pathologic
     angiogenesis. TSP 1 is a large trimeric glycoprotein that interacts with extracellular matrix
10  components and with several cell surface receptors. Normally found at low concentrations
    in the circulation and soft tissues, TSP1 expression increases significantly following
    wounding, and its expression is altered in a number of pathologic diseases. In cancer, TSP1
     expression generally decreases with malignant progression, resulting from regulation of its
     expression by a number of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products, although stromal
15  TSP1 expression in some cases masks this decrease. While some tumor cells produce large
     amounts of TSP 1, these tumors accomplish angiogenesis by producing overwhelming levels
     of pro-angiogenic factors. Experimental tumors with decreased TSP1 expression show
     significantly increased growth and metastasis. In contrast TSP1 over-expressing tumors
    typically grow slower, exhibit less angiogenesis, and have fewer metastases. Recently, we
20  reported that TSP1 blocks NO-driven pro-angiogenic responses in both endothelial and
    vascular smooth muscle cells by inhibiting NO-driven stimulation of sGC. Inhibition of NO
     signaling is mediated through TSP1 interactions with its receptors CD36 and CD47. More
    importantly, in the presence of physiologic levels of NO, vascular cells become
    hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of TSP1. Under these conditions concentrations of
25  TSP1 a thousand-fold less than normally effective completely block pro-angiogenic
    responses in vascular cells. These results suggest that low doses of NO donors could
     synergize with anti-angiogenic therapies utilizing TSP1 or drugs targeting its CD36
    receptor.
              The dramatic enhancement of the potency of TSP1 as an angiogenesis inhibitor in
30  the presence of NO suggests that a major role of TSP1 is to antagonize the NO/cGMP
    pathway. Targeting downstream from eNOS may confer advantages for blocking
     angiogenesis in that endothelial cell signaling due to NO produced by other cells, such as
    iNOS from leukocytes, can also be blocked by TSP1. Furthermore, unlike Avastin and
    Lucentis, TSP1 can inhibit downstream signals resulting from angiogenic factors other than
35  VEGF.
                                                       53

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
              TSP1 is a major component of platelet a-granules and is released from platelets
    upon activation, where it modulates platelet adhesion and the properties of fibrin clots
     formed following acute vascular injury. TSP1 released from platelets or produced locally in
    response to cytokines and growth factors also plays an important role in recruitment of
 5  mononuclear cells during the early phases of wound repair, and the absence of TSP 1 delays
     excisional wound repair in mice.
              TSP1 also accumulates in the neointima of atherosclerotic lesions, where it may
     stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration by enhancing
    responsiveness to platelet-derived growth factor. Antibody blocking of TSP1 can reverse
10  this response and enhance the re-endothelialization of an injured artery. An N700S coding
     sequence polymorphism in TSP1 that alters its conformation is associated with increased
    risk of premature familial myocardial infarction.
              TSP1 is also a potent modulator of angiogenesis. The N-terminal domain of TSP1
     stimulates angiogenesis through its interactions with a3J3i and a43i integrins, but the central
15  type 1 repeats contain sequences that potently inhibit angiogenesis via CD36 and/or heparin
     sulfate proteoglycan receptors. Under most circumstances, the net activity of intact TSP1 is
     anti-angiogenic. Thus, the absence of TSP1 enhances experimental and tumor-induced
     angiogenic responses.
              Vascular effects of TSP1 are mediated by its binding to receptors on both
20   endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Endothelial cells express at least
     eight TSP1 receptors, and several of these are shared on VSMC. Based on the activity of
     CD36 antibody FA6-152 to block the inhibitory effect of TSP1 on FGF2-induced
    microvascular endothelial cell motility and the failure of TSP1 to inhibit corneal
     angiogenesis induced by FGF2 in CD36 -/- mice, CD36 is considered to be the primary
25  TSP1 receptor that mediates this anti-angiogenic activity. Some evidence indicates that
    TSP1 also inhibits angiogenesis through    p 1 integrins, CD47, LRP/calreticulin, and heparin
     sulfate proteoglycans, but the necessity of these receptors for TSP1 to inhibit angiogenesis
    has not been confirmed in the respective receptor null mice. To develop effective
     angiogenesis inhibitors based on TSP 1, it is important to establish whether additional
30   signaling pathways may allow TSP1 to inhibit angiogenesis in a CD36-independent manner.
              Discoveries by the current inventors have also proven that the inhibitory activity of
    TSP1 on NO-driven angiogenesis and blood flow requires the cell surface receptor CD47.
    Targeting either TSP1 or CD47 allows for dramatic increases in tissue/organ blood flow and
    perfusion, and prevents tissue loss and necrosis from ischemia secondary (but not limited) to
35  peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerosis, stroke, coronary artery disease, trauma, surgery

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     and burn injury. Under conditions of both acute and chronic decrease in blood flow
    targeting TSP1-CD47 greatly increases blood flow through maximizing NO-stimulated
    vaso-relaxation. Even more stunning aged 18 month old TSP1-null mice demonstrate more
     dynamic blood flow increases to vasodilators than young 10 week old wild type mice. Then
 5  blocking TSP1 signaling renders the aged vasculature hyper-dynamic. Under a vaso-active
    challenge such a vasculature out performs the young vasculature. Therapeutic agents
    targeting TSP1-CD47 has the potential of ameliorating the deleterious effects of aging on
    blood flow. This will have profound impact since 85% of individuals over the age of 65
    have varying degrees of peripheral vascular disease.

     V.       Overview of Several Embodiments
              This disclosure demonstrates that CD47 ligation by TSP1 represents the means by
    which endogenous TSP1 tempers vascular responses to NO and in so doing alters tissue
     oxygen in the face of both ischemia and NO challenge. Findings reported herein suggest
15  that TSP1 is a global regulator of tissue perfusion and blood flow through a CD47
     dependent pathway, and suggests therapeutic modalities for tissue preservation in the
    presence of ischemia. These therapeutic modalities are described herein.

    purposes. Such compounds and compositions thereby increase tissue survival to ischemia,
     as well as use of therapeutic compounds and compositions that block CD47 and thereby
25  increase tissue survival to ischemia. Also included are compositions (including for instance

             Yet another embodiment is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antisense
     oligonucleotide of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides complementary to human CD47
    mRNA, and a suitable delivery vehicle, which composition limits tissue expression of
     CD47. By way of example, the antisense oligonucleotide in some cases is a morpholino.

    comprises an antisense oligonucleotide to CD47 having the sequence
     CGTCACAGGCAGGACCCACTGCCCA (SEQ ID NO: 21), or another sequence from
     CD47 or a sequence from TSP1. Other representative sequences are described.

              Additional methods include a method to increase skin graft survival, which
    comprises decreasing CD47 expression in the graft and/or inhibiting ligand binding to CD47
    in the tissue. There are also provides in various embodiments methods of use of antibodies
     and peptides, for instance antibodies (such as monoclonal antibodies, and humanized
 5   antibodies) to CD47 and peptides derived from CD47. For instance, there is provided use of
     an antibody to CD47 or a peptide derived from CD47 to prevent or reduce tissue necrosis
     and/or to increase skin graft survival and/or improve organ transplant success. Also
    provided is use of an isolated CD47 molecule, or molecule that binds thereto, to influence
    blood vessel flow and alter tissue perfusion.
10            Additionally, included is a method or methods to increase tissue and skin graft
     survival through blocking of the action of TSP1 directly with monoclonal antibodies, such
     as clone A6.1, and other antibodies which block the action of TSP1 on CD47 and thus
    increase tissue blood vessel diameter, blood flow and tissue perfusion.
              Yet another embodiment is a method comprising selective application to a subject

    myocardial ischemia in the subject; improves blood flow in the subject; improves transplant
     organ or tissue survival in the subject; and/or improves skin graft survive in the subject.
    Without limitation, the subject to which such a method is applied may be a subject suffering
20   from one or more diseases or conditions that have as a component or side effect a defect in
    circulation or vascular regulation or ischemia. For instance, in some examples the subject
    has diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerotic vascular disease and/or other
    chronic vascular pathology (e.g., associated with macular degeneration), or is undergoing
    tissue or organ grafting or transplantation, or has suffered an injury or stroke or other event
25  resulting in ischemia.
              Another embodiment is a method to inhibit blood flow (for instance, to tumors) by
     application of an agent that mimics TSP-i and binds to CD47. For instance, the agent in
     some cases is a CD47 antibody, such as a monoclonal antibody or humanized antibody, or a
     derivative molecule that maintains the ability to bind to an epitope. In other examples, the
30   agent is a peptide, such as for instance a peptide comprising the amino acid IGWKDFTAYR
     (SEQ ID NO: 1), or another peptide that can bind or block the binding between TSP-i and
     CD47.
              Further, described herein are methods of increasing tissue perfusion in an elderly
     subject, examples of which include selecting an elderly subject in need of increased tissue
35  perfusion; and administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent

    that inhibits the interaction of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and CD47, thereby increasing
    tissue perfusion in the elderly subject. By way of example, in some embodiments, the
     subject is a human, for instance a human of about 65 years of age or more.
              In various embodiments, a surgical procedure has been (or is being, or will be)
 5  performed on the subject; the subject has a myocardial infarction, and wherein the tissue is
    the heart; and/or the subject has atherosclerosis.
              Also contemplated herein are methods of treating tissue necrosis resulting from
    ischemia in an elderly subject with atherosclerotic vascular disease or age-related
    vasculopathy, which methods involve selecting an elderly subject with necrosis in a tissue,
10  wherein the subject has atherosclerotic disease or age-related vasculopathy; and
     administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that inhibits the
    interaction of TSP1 and CD47, thereby treating the tissue necrosis. In specific examples of
     such methods, the age-related vasculopathy is peripheral vascular disease. By way of
     example, in some embodiments the subject is a human, for instance a human of about 65
15  years of age or more.
              In various embodiments, a surgical procedure has been (or is being, or will be)
    performed on the subject, or specifically the tissue being treated in the method; the subject
    has a myocardial infarction, and wherein the tissue is the heart; and/or the subject has
     atherosclerosis. In other embodiments, the subject has diabetes, such as adult onset
20   diabetes.
              Additional embodiments provide use of an agent that decreases the expression of
     CD47, a CD47 antagonist, an antibody that specifically binds TSP-i, or an antibody that
     specifically binds CD47 for the treatment of an elderly subject with ischemia resulting from
     atherosclerosis or a vasculopathy.

    the expression of CD47, a CD47 antagonist, an antibody that specifically binds TSP-i, or an
     antibody that specifically binds CD47 for use in the treatment of ischemia in an elderly
     subject with atherosclerosis or a vasculopathy.
              Yet another embodiment provides methods to improve tissue survival in an elderly
30   subject in need thereof, the method comprising one or more of decreasing CD47 expression
    in the tissue; and inhibiting ligand binding to CD47 in the tissue, thereby improving tissue
     survival in the elderly subject. Optionally, the elderly subject has atherosclerosis, has
    PVD/PAD, has a graft; has had a myocardial infarction; has a vasculopathy, and/or has
    Alzheimer's or dementia, or a combination of any two or more thereof.

              Still another embodiment provides methods for enhancing blood clotting and
    preventing bleeding. Data from peptides including C6d, C6b and other peptides described
    herein teaches that they agents enhance platelet aggregation and hence would be useful in
     applications to minimize, reduce, or slow bleeding. Such agents are therapeutically
 5  beneficial at controlling bleeding from many sources including trauma, elective and required
     surgery, and acquired or congenital bleeding disorders.
     VI.      Therapeutic Uses
              Methods are disclosed herein for promoting blood flow in an area in a subject who
10  has or is at risk for developing ischemia, for instance during or following surgery, burn
    injury, a graft, peripheral vascular disease, amputation, coronary artery disease, stroke,
    thrombosis, a clot, chronic vascular obstruction or vasculopathy (e.g., secondary to diabetes,
    hypertension, or peripheral vascular disease), cerebral ischemia, a wound, and so forth.
    Provided methods are useful in the treatment of various diseases and conditions, including
15  but not limited to treatment of donor organs before and after transplantation; reattachment of
     severed extremities, body parts or soft tissues; pulmonary hypertension (adult or neonate);
     sickle cell disease; neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis (following angioplasty or stenting);
    primary burn care (before skin grafting); kidney disease (for instance, to increase kidney
    circulation); pre-eclampsia; erectile dysfunction; asthma or adult respiratory distress
20   syndrome; Alzheimer's and other dementias secondary to compromised cranial blood flow.
    Methods are also disclosed herein for promoting blood flow and increasing tissue perfusion
    in a tissue, such as in an elderly subject with a degenerative disorder, such as in the brain of
     an elderly subject with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The methods include introducing a
    therapeutically effective amount of a CD47 or TSP1 peptide, antibody, oligonucleotide, or
25   other agent (such as those described herein) to the area being treated, thereby promoting
    blood flow in the subject. In some embodiments, the agent is administered as naked DNA
     encoding an inhibitory peptide, for instance using for instance protocols used for delivering
    VEGF to ischemic tissues (see, for example, Isner, et al., J. Vasc. Surg., 1998; 28:964-975;
    Losardo et al., Circulation, 1998; 98:2800-2804). In other embodiments, the inhibitory
30   oligonucleotide (e.g., a CD47-targeted or TSP1-targeted morpholino) is administered.
              In some embodiments, a therapeutic antibody or antibody fragment, nucleic acid, or
    inhibitory oligonucleotide (e.g., morpholino), is administered locally to the affected area, for
     example by direct topical administration to a wound or other lesion in which
    neovascularization is desired, or is incorporated in to a vascular stent or other implant
35   device and placed directly in a diseased blood vessel, or is placed directly in a blood vessel,
                                                        59

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
     or is parenterally directed to an affected area, such as an ischemic extremity. For subjects
    with peripheral vascular disease, administration is, for example, by direct topical
     administration to a wound, or by intra-arterial, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular
    injection into the affected limb. Efficacy of the treatment is shown, for example, by a
 5  regression of symptoms, for example, a lessening of cramping in the leg or arm, or a
     lessening of claudication, numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain, or healing of skin ulcers on
    the limb. An improvement in vascular function is also demonstrated, for example, by
    increased skin temperature or a color change in the skin of the limbs.
              Also contemplated are uses of provided therapeutic compounds and compositions in
10   ameliorating reperfusion injury following cardiac ischemia (MI/heart attack), or
     extracorporeal oxygenation (bypass) during heart surgery, heart transplant lung or heart
     lung transplants.
              For subjects with cerebral ischemia, administration is, for example, by intra-arterial
     or intrathecal injection, or by direct injection of ischemic brain areas. Intra-arterial injection
15  can be directed to ischemic regions, for example, by injection into the basilar artery to
     administer the agent to the occipital cortex. In some embodiments, administration is by
    intravenous or intra-arterial injection following osmotic disruption of the blood brain barrier
     (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,124,146). In some embodiments, administration is, for
     example, by injection into the basilar, carotid, or cerebral arteries. A therapeutic agent can
20   also be administered by intra-ventricular injection for degenerative disease of the brain, such
     as to an elderly subject with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Efficacy of the treatment is
    indicated, for example, by an abatement of symptoms, for example, a lessening of numbness
     or weakness of the face, arm or leg, lessening of confusion, improvement in speaking, visual
    improvement, or improvement in walking, balance, or coordination.
25            Additionally, in some embodiments the therapeutic agents may be incorporated in
    implantable devices, such as vascular stents placed directly in diseased blood vessels in the
    coronary, cerebral or peripheral circulation, for instance to provide slow release of the
    compound, thereby providing regional sustained release of the therapeutic agents.
              For subjects with peripheral artery disease (and other systemic and arterial
30   diseases), administration is, for example, by intra-arterial (particularly intracoronary), or
    intrapericardial injection. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is administered
     systemically, such as by intravenous injection. Additionally, in some embodiments the
    therapeutic agents may be incorporated into or on an implantable device, such as vascular
     stents placed directly in diseased blood vessels in the coronary or cerebral circulation, and
35  undergo slow release providing regional sustained release of the therapeutic agents.
                                                          60

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    Efficacy of treatment is demonstrated, for example, by a regression of symptoms, for
     example chest pressure or pain.
              For subjects with a wound such as a burn or a graft, administration is, for example,
    by subcutaneous or intravenous injection, by direct injection of the wound or burn or graft
 5  bed, or by topical application. Efficacy of the treatment is determined, for example, by an
    improvement in wound healing.
              Administration may begin whenever a subject has developed, or is at risk for
     developing ischemia, when a wound, burn, graft, transplant or the like has occurred, or
    when symptoms of reduced blood flow to the brain, heart, or one or more limbs are present,
10   such as chest or limb pain, or neurological symptoms, such as dizziness, confusion, loss of
     speech, or loss of mobility.
              Combinations of blood flow enhancing factors are also of use. For example, a
    therapeutic peptide, peptide-encoding DNA, oligonucleotide, or other therapeutic agent is
     administered in conjunction with a nitric oxide (NO) donor or precursor, such as isosorbide
15   dinitrate, Bidil or L-arginine, or NO generating topical agents. Such therapeutic agents also
    may be administered in conjunction with agents that act upon soluble guanylyl cyclase to
     activate the enzyme and with agents that act to inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
     (Viagra@, Levitra@, Cialis@, for instance).
              An effective amount of a therapeutic TSP 1 or CD47 inhibitor peptide, inhibitor
20  peptide-encoding DNA, or oligonucleotide (e.g., morpholino) can be administered in a
     single dose, or in multiple doses, for example daily, weekly, every two weeks, or monthly
     during a course of treatment. Additionally, the therapeutic agents may be incorporated into
     or on implantable constructs or devices, such as vascular stents, for sustained regional or
     local release.
25            Alternatively, peptides, antibodies or morpholinos targeting TSP1 and CD47 can be
     administered directly at the time of surgery and or wound reconstruction, for instance in the
     form of topical applied liquids or creams or via direct injection into tissues. Additionally,
     such agents can be incorporated into the irrigation fluid such as that routinely used to wash
    wound beds prior to closure. In this form, the therapeutic agents would be placed
30   specifically were needed to maximize blood flow, angiogenesis and wound healing. The
     direct application of a TSP1 and CD47 blocking agent would also provide therapeutic
    benefit for burn patients undergoing skin grafts, by insuring improved blood flow to the
    healing graft.
                                                       61

WO 2008/060785                                                                  PCT/US2007/080647
               The therapeutic agents described herein can also play a role in decreasing the
     overall size of the burn wound. Direct injection into the margins of the burn wound would
     encourage blood flow to the ischemic wound areas and maximize tissue survival.
               In the case of surgery where controlling bleeding is of concern, agents which mimic
 5  TSP1 and TSP1 actions through CD47, including antibodies, peptides or small molecules
     (rather than those which block it), could be applied in irrigation liquids or other delivery
    vehicle and applied directly to the bleeding tissue surface to promote blood clot formation.
               In the case of skin grafts and burn wounds, controlled release of any of the
     described compounds over extended periods of time may be of significant benefit in healing.
10             Methods are provided herein for increasing tissue perfusion in elderly subjects.
    Thus, the disclosed methods are of use in any subject, such as a mammalian subject, who
    has passed middle age. In one embodiment, an elderly mammalian subject is a subject that
    has survived more than two-thirds of the normal lifespan for that mammalian species. In a
     further embodiment, for humans, an aged or elderly subject is more than about 65 years of
15   age, such as a subject of more than about 70 years of age, more than about 75 years of age,
     or more than about 80 years of age. In yet another embodiment, for mice, the disclosed
    methods are of use in animals that are from about 14 to about 18 months of age. One of
     skill in the art can readily distinguish the elderly subject for a specific mammalian species,
    based on the average lifespan for that species.
20             By way of example, mice mature rapidly (reaching puberty by 6 weeks) and loose
    breeding capabilities by one year or age. Current strains of mice employed in biomedical
    research have average life expectancies of from I to 2 years. Hence mice beyond 1 year of
     age are past middle age and can be considered elderly. Mice over 14 - 16 months are then
    reasonably considered senescent (Wordern, The Care and Management of Laboratory
25  Animals, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 1947).
               It will be recognized that methods disclosed herein will also be effective in
    increasing blood flow secondary to tissue trauma or vascular disease regardless of the age of
    the subject.
               Methods also are provided for the use of TSP1-based peptides such as C6d, C6b and
30   other peptides described herein, or antibodies and small molecules having similar effect (in
    that they block or reduce the ability of NO to prevent platelet aggregation and blood
    clotting). Such agents can be used to treat subjects with bleeding, including bleeding
     disorders of diverse cause. These peptides and agents can be applied directly to bleeding
    wounds, both internal and external, and as such will function as topical hemostatic therapies.
35  They may be incorporated into dressings and bandages, or combined with other available
                                                         62

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
    hemostatic agents. Representative immediate application for these treatments is in treating
    battle field wounds, accident trauma, and other injuries, where minimizing bleeding saves
     lives.
 5   V.       Combination Therapies
              In several embodiments, providing a nitric oxide source at the same time one
     eliminates or reduces effects of TSP1 can enhance tissue survival to ischemia. The
    therapeutic application of combination therapy employing an exogenous source of nitric
     oxide (such as isosorbide dinitrate) and TSP1 or CD47 blockade or suppression (e.g., with
10   antibody or morpholino or small molecule inhibitors) can be used to enhance blood flow and
     angiogenesis to ischemic tissue and increase blood flow, tissue survival and blood flow.
              Generally, it is believed that NO donors (or enhancers of nitric oxide availability or
     action, such as L-arginine) are effective when combined with administration of an agent that
    blocks or suppresses CD47 or TSP1, or the interaction between these proteins. For instance,
15  in tissue flap models of ischemia, NO donors are shown to increase tissue survival. In
     experiments described herein, the use of one such agent (isosorbide dinitrate) dramatically
    increased tissue survival alone. When TSP1 was removed from the tissue, as in the null
     animals, these results were further improved.
              Alternatively, the agent that blocks or suppresses CD47 or TSP1, or the interaction
20  between these proteins, may be used in combinations with drugs and agents that limit the
     elimination rate of nitric oxide, or augment the action of nitric oxide. This combination
    could serve to increase the strength of responses to administered compounds for influencing
    blood flow.
              Furthermore, the therapeutic agents that blocks or suppresses CD47 or TSP 1, or the
25  interaction between these proteins (e.g., peptides and oligos, such as morpholinos), may also
    be used in combination with other therapeutic agents, for example, pain relievers, anti
    inflammatory agents, antihistamines, and the like, whether for the conditions described or
     some other condition. By way of example, the additional agent is one or more selected from
    the list consisting of an antibiotic (e.g., penicillin), hydroxyurea, butyrate, clotrimazole,
30   arginine, or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (such as sildenafil). The therapeutic agents that
     suppress CD47 or TSP-i, or the interactions between these proteins, can be used in
    combination with any pharmaceutical composition of use to treat a disorder.
              Other specific combinations of therapeutic treatments are discussed herein.

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     VIII.    Production ofAntibodies
              Optimally, antibodies raised against a target protein (such as TSP1 or CD47) would
     specifically detect that peptide/protein, and optimally would inhibit the interaction between
    TSP1 and CD47. Antibodies that specifically detect a target protein would recognize and
 5  bind that protein (and peptides derived therefrom) and would not substantially recognize or
    bind to other proteins or peptides found in a biological sample. The determination that an
     antibody specifically detects its target protein is made by any one of a number of standard
    immunoassay methods; for instance, the Western blotting technique (Sambrook et al., In
    Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, CSHL, New York, 1989).
10            To determine by Western blotting that a given antibody preparation (such as one
    produced in a mouse or rabbit) specifically detects the target peptide, the peptide of interest
    is synthesized and transferred to a membrane (for example, nitrocellulose) by Western
    blotting, and the test antibody preparation is incubated with the membrane. After washing
    the membrane to remove non-specifically bound antibodies, the presence of specifically
15  bound antibodies is detected by the use of an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated
    to an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase.
              Application of an alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
    phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium results in the production of a dense blue compound by
    immunolocalized alkaline phosphatase. Antibodies that specifically detect the target peptide
20  will, by this technique, be shown to bind to the target peptide band (which will be localized
     at a given position on the gel determined by its molecular weight). Non-specific binding of
    the antibody to other proteins may occur and may be detectable as a weak signal on the
    Western blot. The non-specific nature of this binding will be recognized by one skilled in
    the art by the weak signal obtained on the Western blot relative to the strong primary signal
25   arising from the specific antibody-target peptide binding.
              The determination that an antibody inhibits the association between TSP1 and
     CD47, or the ability of TSP1 or CD47 to modulate tissue survival in ischemia or blood clot
     formation, may be made, for example, using any one of the assays described herein,
    including for instance the flap model. For instance, the determination that an antibody
30  inhibits TSP1 binding to purified or recombinant CD47 can be made by comparing the
    binding activity alone with the binding activity in the presence of the antibody using a solid
    phase ligand binding assay. An antibody that inhibits the activity of TSP1 to signal through
     CD47 on cells will reduce the activity of a cGMP-dependent reporter in a suitable
    transfected cell assay by a certain amount, for example, by 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%,
     7
35     0%, 80%, 90%, or even by 100%.

              A. Monoclonal Antibody Production by Hybridoma Fusion
              Monoclonal antibody to epitopes of a target peptide (e.g., from TSP1 or CD47) can
    be prepared from murine hybridomas according to the classical method of Kohler and
 5  Milstein (Nature 256:495, 1975) or derivative methods thereof. Briefly, a mouse is
    repetitively inoculated with a few micrograms of the selected protein over a period of a few
    weeks. The mouse is then sacrificed, and the antibody-producing cells of the spleen are
    isolated. The spleen cells are fused by means of polyethylene glycol with mouse myeloma
    cells, and the excess un-fused cells destroyed by growth of the system on selective media
10  comprising aminopterin (HAT media). The successfully fused cells are diluted and aliquots
     of the dilution placed in wells of a microtiter plate where growth of the culture is continued.
    Antibody-producing clones are identified by detection of antibody in the supernatant fluid of
    the wells by immunoassay procedures, such as ELISA, as originally described by Engvall
     (Enzymol. 70:419, 1980), and derivative methods thereof. Selected positive clones can be
15   expanded and their monoclonal antibody product harvested for use. Detailed procedures for
    monoclonal antibody production are described in Harlow and Lane (Antibodies,A
    LaboratoryManual, CSHL, New York, 1988).
              B. PolyclonalAntibody Production by Immunization
              Polyclonal antiserum containing antibodies to heterogeneous epitopes of a single
20  protein can be prepared by immunizing suitable animals with the expressed protein, which
    can be unmodified or modified to enhance immunogenicity. Effective polyclonal antibody
    production is affected by many factors related both to the antigen and the host species. For
     example, small molecules tend to be less immunogenic than others and may require the use
     of carriers and adjuvant. Also, host animals vary in response to site of inoculations and dose,
25  with either inadequate or excessive doses of antigen resulting in low titer antisera. Small
     doses (ng level) of antigen administered at multiple intradermal sites appear to be most
    reliable. An effective immunization protocol for rabbits can be found in Vaitukaitis et al. (J.
     Clin. Endocrinol.Metab. 33:988-991, 1971).
              Booster injections can be given at regular intervals, and antiserum harvested when
30   antibody titer thereof, as determined semi-quantitatively, for example, by double
    immunodiffusion in agar against known concentrations of the antigen, begins to fall. See,
     for example, Ouchterlony et al. (In Handbook ofExperimental Immunology, Wier, D. (ed.)
    chapter 19. Blackwell, 1973). Plateau concentration of antibody is usually in the range of
     about 0.1 to 0.2 mg/ml of serum (about 12 gM). Affinity of the antisera for the antigen is
                                                        65

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
     determined by preparing competitive binding curves, as described, for example, by Fisher
     (Manualof ClinicalImmunology, Ch. 42, 1980).
             C. Antibodies Raised againstSynthetic Peptides
             A third approach to raising antibodies against a target peptide is to use synthetic
 5  peptides synthesized on a commercially available peptide synthesizer based upon the amino
     acid sequence of the native protein (e.g., TSP1 or CD47).
             By way of example only, polyclonal antibodies to a CD47 or TSP1 peptide can be
    generated through well-known techniques by injecting rabbits with chemically synthesized
    peptide.
10           D. Antibodies Raised by Injection of a Peptide-EncodingSequence
             Antibodies may be raised against a target peptide by subcutaneous injection of a
    DNA vector that expresses that peptide into laboratory animals, such as mice. Delivery of
    the recombinant vector into the animals may be achieved using a hand-held form of the
    Biolistic system (Sanford et al., ParticulateSci. Technol. 5:27-37, 1987) as described by
15  Tang et al. (Nature 356:152-154, 1992). Expression vectors suitable for this purpose may
    include those that express the desired peptide-encoding sequence under the transcriptional
    control of either the human P-actin promoter or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.
             E. Humanized Antibodies
             Also contemplated are humanized antibodies, for instance humanized equivalents of
20  the described murine monoclonal antibodies. A "humanized" immunoglobulin is an
    immunoglobulin including a human framework region and one or more CDRs from a non
    human (for example a mouse, rat, or synthetic) immunoglobulin. The non-human
    immunoglobulin providing the CDRs is termed a "donor," and the human immunoglobulin
    providing the framework is termed an "acceptor." In one embodiment, all the CDRs are
25   from the donor immunoglobulin in a humanized immunoglobulin. Constant regions need
    not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human
    immunoglobulin constant regions, such as at least about    8 5 -9 0 %, such as about 95% or
    more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the
     CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin
30   sequences. A "humanized antibody" is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and
     a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. A humanized antibody binds to the same
     antigen as the donor antibody that provides the CDRs. The acceptor framework of a
    humanized immunoglobulin or antibody may have a limited number of substitutions by
     amino acids taken from the donor framework. Humanized or other monoclonal antibodies
35  can have additional conservative amino acid substitutions which have substantially no effect
                                                      66

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
     on antigen binding or other immunoglobulin functions. Humanized immunoglobulins can
    be constructed by means of genetic engineering (see for example, U.S. Patent No.
     5,585,089).
              The use of antibody components derived from humanized monoclonal antibodies
 5   obviates potential problems associated with the immunogenicity of the constant regions of
    the donor antibody. Techniques for producing humanized monoclonal antibodies are
     described, for example, by Jones et al., Nature 321:522, 1986; Riechmann et al., Nature
     332:323, 1988; Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534, 1988; Carter et al., Proc.Nat. Acad.
    Sci. U.S.A. 89:4285, 1992; Sandhu, Crit.Rev. Biotech.12:437, 1992; and Singer et al., J.
10  Immunol. 150:2844, 1993. The antibody may be of any isotype, but in several embodiments
    the antibody is an IgM or an IgG, including but not limited to, IgG 1, IgG 2 , IgG 3 and IgG4 .
              Humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by transferring donor
    complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from heavy and light variable chains of the
     donor mouse (or other animal) immunoglobulin. The production of chimeric antibodies,
15  which include a framework region from one antibody and the CDRs from a different
     antibody, is well known in the art. For example, humanized antibodies can be routinely
    produced. The antibody or antibody fragment can be a humanized immunoglobulin having
    complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a donor monoclonal antibody that binds
     a cell surface antigen of pancreatic cells (such as endocrine, exocrine or ductal cells) and
20  immunoglobulin and heavy and light chain variable region frameworks from human
     acceptor immunoglobulin heavy and light chain frameworks. Generally, the humanized
    immunoglobulin specifically binds to the cell surface antigen (or cells expressing the
     antigen) with an affinity constant of at least 107 M-1, such as at least 108 M-1 at least 5 X 108
    M-1 or at least 109 M-1.
25            In one embodiment, the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain
    variable region framework can be at least about 65% identical to the sequence of the donor
    immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Thus, the sequence of the
    humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework can be at least about
     75%, at least about 85%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% identical to the sequence
30   of the donor murine immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Human
     framework regions, and mutations that can be made in a humanized antibody framework
    regions, are known in the art (see, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089, which is
    incorporated herein by reference). One of skill in the art can readily select a human
     framework region of use.

               Also contemplated are fully human antibodies. Mice have been generated that
     express only human immunoglobulin genes, instead of mouse genes. These mice are
    immunized with the antigen, such as TSP 1 or CD47, and resultant antibodies that are raised
     are selected for the activity desired. In the current instance, it is contemplated that this
 5  technique can be used to generate antibodies (including monoclonal antibodies) useful for
    blocking TSP-CD47 interactions. These procedures are substantially similar just those used
    to select a mouse anti-human Ab, but result in a fully human antibody since the mouse only
    has human Ig genes.
10  IX.        Peptides and Peptide Variants
               The peptides disclosed herein can be chemically synthesized by standard methods,
     or can be produced recombinantly. The synthesis of the presently disclosed compounds can
    be accomplished using standard chemical reactions known to be useful for preparing a
    variety of analogous compounds. Indeed, exemplary techniques known to those of ordinary
15   skill in the art of peptide synthesis are taught by Bodanszky & Bodanszky (The Practice of
    Peptide Synthesis; Springer Verlag, New York, 1994) and by Jones (Amino Acid and
    Peptide Synthesis; 2nd ed.; Oxford University Press, 2002), both of which are incorporated
    herein by reference. The Bodanszky and Jones references detail the parameters and
    techniques for activating and coupling amino acids and amino acid derivatives. Moreover,
20  the references teach how to select, use and remove various useful protecting groups. An
     exemplary specific process for (poly)peptide production is described in Lu et al. (Fed.
    Europ Biochem Societies Lett. 429:31-35, 1998).
               Polynucleotides encoding the peptides disclosed herein are also provided. These
    polynucleotides include DNA, cDNA and RNA sequences that encode the peptide of
25  interest. Silent mutations in the coding sequence result from the degeneracy (i.e.,
    redundancy) of the genetic code, whereby more than one codon can encode the same amino
     acid residue. Thus, for example, leucine can be encoded by CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG, TTA, or
    TTG; serine can be encoded by TCT, TCC, TCA, TCG, AGT, or AGC; asparagine can be
     encoded by AAT or AAC; aspartic acid can be encoded by GAT or GAC; cysteine can be
30   encoded by TGT or TGC; alanine can be encoded by GCT, GCC, GCA, or GCG; glutamine
    can be encoded by CAA or CAG; tyrosine can be encoded by TAT or TAC; and isoleucine
    can be encoded by ATT, ATC, or ATA. Tables showing the standard genetic code can be
     found in various sources (e.g., L. Stryer, 1988, Biochemistry,    3 rd Edition, W.H. 5 Freeman
     and Co., NY).
                                                         68

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
              A nucleic acid encoding a peptide can be cloned or amplified by in vitro methods,
     such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the ligase chain reaction (LCR), the
    transcription-based amplification system (TAS), the self-sustained sequence replication
     system (3SR) and the   QP replicase  amplification system (QB). For example, a
 5  polynucleotide encoding the peptide (or a longer polypeptide, such as an expression fusion
    polypeptide, containing the peptide) can be isolated by polymerase chain reaction of cDNA
    using primers based on the DNA sequence of the molecule. A wide variety of cloning and
     in vitro amplification methodologies are well known to persons skilled in the art. PCR
    methods are described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,683,195; Mullis et al., Cold Spring
10  HarborSymp. Quant.Biol. 51:263, 1987; and Erlich, ed., PCR Technology, (Stockton Press,
    NY, 1989). Polynucleotides also can be isolated by screening genomic or cDNA libraries
    with probes selected from the sequences of the desired polynucleotide under stringent
    hybridization conditions.
              The polynucleotides encoding a peptide (e.g., a peptide from or derived from TSP1
15   or CD47) include a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector into an
     autonomously replicating plasmid or virus or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or
     eukaryote, or which exists as a separate molecule (such as a cDNA) independent of other
     sequences. The nucleotides of the invention can be ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides,
     or modified forms of either nucleotide. The term includes single and double forms of DNA.
20            In one embodiment, vectors are used for expression in yeast such as S. cerevisiae or
    Kluyveromyces lactis. Several promoters are known to be of use in yeast expression
     systems such as the constitutive promoters plasma membrane H-ATPase (PMA 1),
    glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), phosphoglycerate kinase- 1 (PGK1),
     alcohol dehydrogenase-1 (ADH1), and pleiotropic drug-resistant pump (PDR5). In addition,
25  may inducible promoters are of use, such as GAL1-10 (induced by galactose), PHO5
     (induced by low extracellular inorganic phosphate), and tandem heat shock HSE elements
     (induced by temperature elevation to 37C). Promoters that direct variable expression in
    response to a titratable inducer include the methionine-responsive MET3 and MET25
    promoters and copper-dependent CUP] promoters. Any of these promoters may be cloned
30  into multicopy (2)    or single copy (CEN) plasmids to give an additional level of control in
     expression level. The plasmids can include nutritional markers (such as URA3, ADE3,
    HIS], and others) for selection in yeast and antibiotic resistance (AMP) for propagation in
    bacteria. Plasmids for expression on K lactis are known, such as pKLAC 1. Thus, in one
     example, after amplification in bacteria, plasmids can be introduced into the corresponding
35  yeast auxotrophs by methods similar to bacterial transformation.

              The peptides can be expressed in a variety of yeast strains. For example, seven
    pleiotropic drug-resistant transporters, YOR1, SNQ2, PDR5, YCF1, PDR1O, PDR11, and
    PDR15, together with their activating transcription factors, PDR1 and PDR3, have been
     simultaneously deleted in yeast host cells, rendering the resultant strain sensitive to drugs.
 5  Yeast strains with altered lipid composition of the plasma membrane, such as the erg6
    mutant defective in ergosterol biosynthesis, can also be utilized. Proteins that are highly
     sensitive to proteolysis can be expressed in a yeast lacking the master vacuolar
     endopeptidase Pep4, which controls the activation of other vacuolar hydrolases.
    Heterologous expression in strains carrying temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles of genes can be
10   employed if the corresponding null mutant is inviable.
              Viral vectors can also be prepared encoding the peptides disclosed herein. Myriad
    viral vectors have been constructed and are known to those of skill in the art, including but
    not limited to polyoma, SV40 (Madzak et al., J. Gen. Virol. 73:153311536, 1992),

    Sequence Variants
              Based on their activities for modulating vascular cell adhesion, platelet aggregation,
     and cellular cGMP levels, several residues in SEQ ID NO: 3 (C6d) are believed to influence
     or govern biological activity. At position 1, substituting Ile with Ala decreased activity at
 5   least 10-fold, indicating that a hydrophobic side chain is required. It is believed that
    conservative substitutions with other nonpolar amino acids would be tolerated. The Gly at
    position 2 might function to permit rotation about the phi and psi bonds, but other short
    chain residues such as Ala may be tolerated at this position as well. At position 3,
     substituting Trp with Tyr preserves activity; other nonpolar residues at this position could
10  potentially also preserve activity.
              Based on the inactivity of Ala and His substitutions at position 4, it is currently
    believed that Lys is required at this position. Similarly, Asp appears to be required at
    position 5, although substitution with Glu at this position preserved partial activity and is
     less preferred. At position 6, substituting the Phe with Tyr preserves activity, which leads
15  us to predict that any aromatic amino acid can be present at this position, although other
    nonpolar residues also may be tolerated.
              At position 7, substituting the Thr with Ala decreased activity approximately 100
     fold indicating that the Thr is required. Position 8 was not substituted, so any aliphatic
     amino acid may be tolerated.
20            Substituting the Tyr at position 9 with Ala decreased activity approximately 100
     fold, indicting that this residue is required, although conservative substitutions with other
     aromatic or nonpolar residues may be tolerated. At position 10 conservative substitution of
    the Arg with Lys abolished all activity. Therefore, the Arg is required.
              The requirements for specific residues at positions 1 and 10 combined, with
25   diminished or lack of activity for truncated peptides, appear to indicate that 10 residues is a
    minimal length for preferred peptide activities.

              The characteristics of the peptides disclosed herein lie not in their precise and entire
     amino acid sequence, but rather in the three-dimensional structure inherent in the amino acid
     sequences encoded by the DNA sequences. It is possible to recreate the binding
    characteristics of any of these peptides, for instance the binding characteristics of any one of
10  the specific peptides described herein, by recreating the three-dimensional structure, without
    necessarily recreating the exact amino acid sequence. Production of variations is enabled
    particularly in view of the guidance provided for the tolerance of variations at various
    positions within the core peptide. Such modifications and variations can be achieved for
    instance by designing a nucleic acid sequence that encodes for the three-dimensional
15   structure, but which differs, for instance by reason of the redundancy of the genetic code or
    the substitution of one or more specific amino acids. Similarly, the DNA sequence may also
    be varied, while still producing a functional peptide.
              Variant therapeutic peptides include peptides that differ in amino acid sequence
     from the disclosed sequence, but that share structurally significant sequence homology with
20   any of the provided peptides. Such variants may be produced by manipulating the
    nucleotide sequence of the encoding sequence, using standard procedures, including site
     directed mutagenesis or PCR. The simplest modifications involve the substitution of one or
                                                        72

    more amino acids for amino acids having similar biochemical properties. These so-called
    conservative substitutions are likely to have minimal impact on the activity of the resultant
    peptide, especially when made outside of the binding site of the peptide. One of ordinary
     skill in the art will be able to predict or empirically determine (particularly in view of the
 5  provided teachings) amino acids that may be substituted for an original amino acid in a
    peptide.
               More substantial changes in peptide structure may be obtained by selecting amino
     acid substitutions that are less conservative than those listed in the above table. Such
    changes include changing residues that differ more significantly in their effect on
10  maintaining polypeptide backbone structure (for example, sheet or helical conformation)
    near the substitution, charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or bulk of a
     specific side chain. The following substitutions are generally expected to produce the
    greatest changes in protein properties: (a) a hydrophilic residue (for example, seryl or
    threonyl) is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue (for example, leucyl, isoleucyl,
15  phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl); (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other
    residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain (for example, lysyl, arginyl, or
    histadyl) is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue (for example, glutamyl or
     aspartyl); or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain (for example, phenylalanine) is
     substituted for (or by) one lacking a side chain (for example, glycine).
20             Variant peptide-encoding sequences may be produced by standard DNA
    mutagenesis techniques, for example, M13 primer mutagenesis. Details of these techniques
     are provided in Sambrook (In Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring
    Harbor, New York, 1989), Ch. 15. By the use of such techniques, variants may be created
    which differ in minor ways from the angiogenic and anti-angiogenic-encoding sequences
25   disclosed. DNA molecules and nucleotide sequences which are derivatives of those
     specifically disclosed herein and that differ from those disclosed by the deletion, addition, or
     substitution of nucleotides while still encoding a peptide that promotes or inhibits
     angiogenesis, are comprehended by this disclosure. In their most simple form, such variants
    may differ from the disclosed sequences by alteration of the coding region to fit the codon
30  usage bias of the particular organism into which the molecule is to be introduced.
               Alternatively, the coding region may be altered by taking advantage of the
     degeneracy of the genetic code to alter the coding sequence such that, while the nucleotide
     sequence is substantially altered, it nevertheless encodes a peptide having an amino acid
     sequence substantially similar to the disclosed peptide sequences. For example, one
35  nucleotide codon triplet GCT encodes alanine. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic
                                                          73

    code, three other nucleotide codon triplets - (GCG, GCC and GCA) - also code for alanine.
    Thus, a nucleotide sequence containing GCT for alanine could be changed at the same
    position to any of the three alternative codons without affecting the amino acid composition
     or characteristics of the encoded peptide. Based upon the degeneracy of the genetic code,
 5  variant DNA molecules may be derived from the cDNA and gene sequences disclosed
    herein using standard DNA mutagenesis techniques as described above, or by synthesis of
    DNA sequences. Thus, this disclosure also encompasses nucleic acid sequences which
     encode the subject peptides, but which vary from the disclosed nucleic acid sequences by
    virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code.

     of these peptides that specifically bind TSP1 or CD47, or that block the interaction there
    between. Each peptide of the disclosure is comprised of a sequence of amino acids, which
    may be either L- and/or D- amino acids, naturally occurring and otherwise.
20            Peptides may be modified by a variety of chemical techniques to produce
     derivatives having essentially the same activity as the unmodified peptides, and optionally
    having other desirable properties. For example, carboxylic acid groups of the peptides,
    whether carboxyl-terminal or side chain, may be provided in the form of a salt of a
    pharmaceutically-acceptable cation or esterified to form a CI-CI6 ester, or converted to an
25   amide of formula NRIR 2 wherein R, and R 2 are each independently H or CI-CI6 alkyl, or
    combined to form a heterocyclic ring, such as a 5- or 6- membered ring. Amino groups of
    the peptides, whether amino-terminal or side chain, may be in the form of a
    pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salt, such as the HCl, HBr, acetic, benzoic,
    toluene sulfonic, maleic, tartaric and other organic salts, or may be modified to Ci-CI6 alkyl
30   or dialkyl amino or further converted to an amide.
              Hydroxyl groups of the peptide side chains may be converted to Ci-C 16 alkoxy or to
     a CI-CI6 ester using well-recognized techniques. Phenyl and phenolic rings of the peptide
     side chains may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine,
    bromine or iodine, or with CI-C 16 alkyl, CI-C 16 alkoxy, carboxylic acids and esters thereof,
35   or amides of such carboxylic acids. Methylene groups of the peptide side chains can be
                                                       74

     extended to homologous C2 -C4 alkylenes. Thiols can be protected with any one of a number
     of well-recognized protecting groups, such as acetamide groups. Those skilled in the art
    will also recognize methods for introducing cyclic structures into the peptides of this
     disclosure to select and provide conformational constraints to the structure that result in
 5   enhanced stability.
              Peptidomimetic and organomimetic embodiments are also within the scope of the
    present disclosure, whereby the three-dimensional arrangement of the chemical constituents
     of such peptido- and organomimetics mimic the three-dimensional arrangement of the
    peptide backbone and component amino acid side chains in the described inhibitor peptides,
10  resulting in such peptido- and organomimetics of the peptides of this disclosure having
    measurable or enhanced angiogenic or anti-angiogenic activity. For computer modeling
     applications, a pharmacophore is an idealized, three-dimensional definition of the structural
    requirements for biological activity. Peptido- and organomimetics can be designed to fit
     each pharmacophore with current computer modeling software (using computer assisted
15   drug design or CADD). See Walters, Computer-Assisted Modeling of Drugs, in Klegerman
     & Groves, eds., 1993, PharmaceuticalBiotechnology, Interpharm Press: Buffalo Grove, IL,
    pp. 165-174 and Principlesof PharmacologyMunson (ed.) 1995, Ch. 102, for descriptions
     of techniques used in CADD. Also included within the scope of the disclosure are mimetics
    prepared using such techniques that produce angiogenic or anti-angiogenic peptides.

    D. AdditionalPeptides
              SIRP-alpha (Signal Inhibitory Regulatory Protein Alpha; SIRPa) and the closely
    related SIRP-gamma (SIRP7 formerly called SIRP-beta) are two ligands of CD47. They
    consist of an N-terminal IgV set domain and variable numbers of Ig domains followed by a
25  transmembrane segment and variously spliced cytoplasmic tails, some of which contain
    phosphorylatable tyrosines that constitute docking sites for tyrosine phosphatases such as
     SHP- 1 and SHP-2. The IgV domain of SIRP-alpha and -gamma are high affinity ligands of
     CD47 with species specificity thought to allow self vs. non-self discrimination by
    phagocytes. The binding of the IgV domain of SIRPa to the IgV domain of CD47 can be
30  measured in a simple ELISA assay using recombinant versions of each protein. For this
    purpose we have employed Fc-fusions of SIRP IgV domain and alkaline phosphatase
     fusions of the CD47 IgV domain. The Fc-IgV protein is adsorbed to well plates coated with
    protein A to which the Fc binds. Potential inhibitors are added and the binding of alkaline
    phosphatase-conjugated CD47 IgV domain is measured by routine procedures. Using this
35   assay we have obtained data indicating that TSP1 Gi domain-derived peptides such as SEQ
                                                      75

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    ID NO: 20 (IGWKDYTAYR), can inhibit the binding of the SIRP IgV domain to CD47.
     Conversely this suggests that the much larger Gi domain and the SIRP IgV domain should
    be mutually competitive for binding to CD47. Results with the ECaG1 construct suggest
    that this is the case.
 5            Kato et al. (J Thrombosis Haemostasis 3:763-774, 2005) reported that an Fc-SIRP
     (also called SHPS-1) fusion binds to human platelets in a CD47-dependent manner. The
     SIRP IgV construct inhibits the aggregation of human platelets stimulated with submaximal
     doses of ADP, collagen and thrombin, and inhibits platelet spreading on immobilized
     fibrinogen, These effects are all precisely opposite to the effects of TSP1 and its CD47
10   ligand peptides, suggesting that the SIRPa IgV domain is blocking the action of endogenous
    TSP1 in this context. Further results include inhibition by the IgV domain of ADP
     stimulated aIIbb3 integrin activation and surface expression of P-selecting (CD62P) and
    tyrosine phosphorylation of several platelet proteins was blocked in the presence of the
     SIRP IgV domain. All of these results are consistent with the idea that the SIRP IgV domain
15  binds to platelet CD47 and thus prevents endogenous TSP1 from acting via CD47 to relieve
    NO inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation.
              The binding of the IgV domains of CD47 and SIRPa to one another is well
     described in Liu et al., J. Mol. Biol. 365:680-693. They also describe mutants of the SIRPa
    IgV domain that modify the binding to CD47.

    X         PharmaceuticalCompositions
              The therapeutic compounds described herein may be formulated in a variety of
    ways depending on the location and type of disease to be treated or prevented in the subject.
    Pharmaceutical compositions are thus provided for both local use at or near an affected area
25   and for systemic use (in which the agent is administered in a manner that is widely
     disseminated via the cardiovascular system). This disclosure includes within its scope
    pharmaceutical compositions including at least one peptide (for example, peptides
    IGWKDETAYRWRLS (SEQ ID NO: 6), biotin-IGWKDFTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 3),
    IGWKNFTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 4), IGWKDYTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 20), IGWKDFAAYR
30   (SEQ ID NO: 5), Ac-WKDFTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 2)), or another inhibitor of TSP1 or CD47
     action or interaction (e.g., ab 301 or a CD47-directed morpholino), formulated for use in
    human or veterinary medicine. While the peptides and inhibitors typically will be used to
    treat human subjects, they may also be used to treat similar or identical diseases in other
    vertebrates, such other primates, dogs, cats, horses, and cows.
                                                       76

WO 2008/060785                                                                  PCT/US2007/080647
              Pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one peptide or other inhibitor or
    therapeutic compound as described herein as an active ingredient, or that include both a
    therapeutic peptide or inhibitor/blockade agent and an additional agent as active ingredients,
     or that include both an ischemia-influencing peptide or inhibitor and an additional
 5  therapeutic agent, may be formulated with an appropriate solid or liquid carrier, depending
    upon the particular mode of administration chosen. Additional active ingredients include,
     for example, nitric oxide donors, nitrovasodilators, activators of the enzyme soluble
    guanylylcyclase, or cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
              A suitable administration format may best be determined by a medical practitioner
10   for each subject individually. Various pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their
     formulation are described in standard formulation treatises, for example, Remington 's
    PharmaceuticalSciences by E. W. Martin. See also Wang and Hanson, J. ParenteralSci.
     Technol., Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42: 2S, 1988.
              The dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition will be determined by the mode
15   of administration chosen. For instance, in addition to injectable fluids, inhalational, topical,
     opthalmic, peritoneal, and oral formulations can be employed. Inhalational preparations can
    include aerosols, particulates, and the like. In general, the goal for particle size for
    inhalation is about 1 m or less in order that the pharmaceutical reach the alveolar region of
    the lung for absorption. Oral formulations may be liquid (for example, syrups, solutions, or
20   suspensions), or solid (for example, powders, pills, tablets, or capsules). For solid
    compositions, conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include pharmaceutical grades of
    mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. Actual methods of preparing such dosage
     forms are known, or will be apparent, to those of ordinary skill in the art.
              The compositions or pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by any
25  route, including parenteral administration, for example, intravenous, intramuscular,
    intraperitoneal, intrasternal, or intra-articular injection or infusion, or by sublingual, oral,
    topical, intra-nasal, ophthalmic, or transmucosal administration, or by pulmonary inhalation.
    When the active compounds are provided as parenteral compositions, for example, for
    injection or infusion, they are generally suspended in an aqueous carrier, for example, in an
30  isotonic buffer solution at a pH of about 3.0 to about 8.0, preferably at a pH of about 3.5 to
     about 7.4, 3.5 to 6.0, or 3.5 to about 5.0. Useful buffers include sodium citrate-citric acid
     and sodium phosphate-phosphoric acid, and sodium acetate/acetic acid buffers. A form of
    repository or depot slow release preparation may be used so that therapeutically effective
     amounts of the preparation are delivered into the bloodstream over many hours or days
35   following transdermal injection or delivery.
                                                          77

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
              Active compounds (e.g., peptides, proteins, oligos, and so forth) are also suitably
     administered by sustained-release systems. Suitable examples of sustained-release
     formulations include suitable polymeric materials (such as, for example, semi-permeable
    polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, for example, films, or mirocapsules),
 5   suitable hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion
     exchange resins, and sparingly soluble derivatives (such as, for example, a sparingly soluble
     salt). Sustained-release compounds may be administered by intravascular, intravenous,
    intra-arterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra-pericardial, or intra-coronary injection.
    Administration can also be oral, rectal, parenteral, intracisternal, intravaginal,
10  intraperitoneal, topical (as by powders, ointments, gels, drops or transdermal patch), buccal,
     or as an oral or nasal spray.
              Preparations for administration can be suitably formulated to give controlled release
     of the therapeutic agent(s) (e.g., peptides, antibodies, oligonucleotides or other compounds
    that block CD47 and/or TSP1 activity or interaction). For example, the pharmaceutical
15  compositions may be in the form of particles comprising a biodegradable polymer and/or a
    polysaccharide jellifying and/or bioadhesive polymer, an amphiphilic polymer, an agent
    modifying the interface properties of the particles and a pharmacologically active substance.
    These compositions exhibit certain biocompatibility features that allow a controlled release
     of the active substance. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,700,486.
20            In some embodiments, therapeutic agent(s) are delivered by way of a pump (see
     Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201, 1987; Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507, 1980;
     Saudek et al., N. Engl.J. Med. 321:574, 1989) or by continuous subcutaneous infusions, for
     example, using a mini-pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The key
     factor in selecting an appropriate dose is the result obtained, as measured by increases or
25   decreases in angiogenesis, or by other criteria for measuring control or prevention of
     disease, as are deemed appropriate by the practitioner. Other controlled release systems are
     discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527-1533, 1990).
              In another aspect of the disclosure, therapeutic agent(s) are delivered by way of an
    implanted pump, described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,436,091; U.S. Patent No.
30   5,939,380; and U.S. Patent No. 5,993,414. Implantable drug infusion devices are used to
    provide subjects with a constant and long term dosage or infusion of a drug or any other
    therapeutic agent. Essentially, such device may be categorized as either active or passive.
              Active drug or programmable infusion devices feature a pump or a metering system
    to deliver the drug into the patient's system. An example of such an active drug infusion
35   device currently available is the Medtronic SynchroMedTM programmable pump. Such
                                                        78

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    pumps typically include a drug reservoir, a peristaltic pump to pump the drug out from the
    reservoir, and a catheter port to transport the pumped out drug from the reservoir via the
    pump to a patient's anatomy. Such devices also typically include a battery to power the
    pump, as well as an electronic module to control the flow rate of the pump. The Medtronic
 5   SynchroMedTM pump further includes an antenna to permit the remote programming of the
    pump.
              Passive drug infusion devices, in contrast, do not feature a pump, but rather rely
    upon a pressurized drug reservoir to deliver the drug. Thus, such devices tend to be both
     smaller as well as cheaper as compared to active devices. An example of such a device
10  includes the Medtronic IsoMedTM. This device delivers the drug into the patient through the
     force provided by a pressurized reservoir applied across a flow control unit.
              The implanted pump can be completely implanted under the skin of a subject,
    thereby negating the need for a percutaneous catheter. These implanted pumps can provide
    the patient with therapeutic agent(s) at a constant or a programmed delivery rate. Constant
15  rate or programmable rate pumps are based on either phase-change or peristaltic technology.
    When a constant, unchanging delivery rate is required, a constant-rate pump is well suited
     for long-term implanted drug delivery. If changes to the infusion rate are expected, a
    programmable pump may be used in place of the constant rate pump system. Osmotic
    pumps may be much smaller than other constant rate or programmable pumps, because their
20  infusion rate can be very low. An example of such a pump is described listed in U.S. Patent
    No. 5,728,396.
              The therapeutic agents may also be delivered passively and in sustained fashion as
    part of and incorporated into implantable devices, such as vascular stents which can be
    placed directly into diseased blood vessels through several standard approaches, including
25   direct surgical insertion or percutaneoulsy with angiographic control.
              For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of, for
     example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically
     acceptable excipients such as binding agents (for example, pregelatinised maize starch,
    polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (for example, lactose,
30  microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (for example,
    magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium
     starch glycolate); or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets can
    be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration can
    take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they can be presented as a
35   dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid
                                                       79

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable
     additives such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or
    hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (for example, lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous
    vehicles (for example, almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils);
 5   and preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The
    preparations can also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as
     appropriate.
              For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present
     disclosure are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from
10  pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, for example,
     dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide
     or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit can be determined
    by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an
    inhaler or insufflator can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a
15   suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
              For topical administration, the compounds can be, for example, mixed with a liquid
     delivery agent for administration locally. The agents used therapeutically (such as peptides,
     antibodies and morpholinos) are readily soluble or suspendable in water and saline, and as
     such these would be useful for delivery since water or saline do not cause adverse biological
20  tissue effects. This allows sufficiently high doses to be administered locally or systemically,
    without secondary toxicity from the delivery vehicle.
              By way of example, in the treatment of bums agents can be given by direct injection
    into the wound bed or topically dissolved in saline as a spray to the bum area, to skin grafts
     and/or to graft wound beds. They may also be mixed directly into antibiotic creams used to
25  treat bums, such as bacitracin or silver sulfadine, or incorporated in a manner allowing
    release into dressing and bandaging materials applied to wounds, grafts or bums.
              Pharmaceutical compositions that comprise at least one therapeutic agent as
     described herein as an active ingredient will normally be formulated with an appropriate
     solid or liquid carrier, depending upon the particular mode of administration chosen. The
30  pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients useful in this disclosure are
    conventional. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that
     are pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluid vehicles such as water,
    physiological saline, other balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like.
    Excipients that can be included are, for instance, proteins, such as human serum albumin or
35  plasma preparations. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may
                                                        80

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
     also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or
     emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium
     acetate or sorbitan monolaurate. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are
    known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in the art.
 5            For example, for parenteral administration, therapeutic agent(s) can be formulated
    generally by mixing them at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form
     (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for instance,
     one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is
    compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
10  is a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation
     auxiliary of any type.
              Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the therapeutic agent(s) each
    uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then,
    if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Optionally, the carrier is a
15  parenteral carrier, and in some embodiments it is a solution that is isotonic with the blood of
    the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, and
     dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful
    herein, as well as liposomes.
              The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise at least one therapeutic agent, in
20   some embodiments, will be formulated in unit dosage form, suitable for individual
     administration of precise dosages. The amount of active compound(s) administered will be
     dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, and the manner of
     administration, and is best left to the judgment of the prescribing clinician. Within these
    bounds, the formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of the active
25  component(s) in amounts effective to achieve the desired effect in the subject being treated.
              The therapeutically effective amount of therapeutic agent, such as a peptide,
     antibody, or oligonucleotide (e.g., morpholino or other antisense molecule) will be
     dependent on the peptide or inhibitor utilized, the subject being treated, the severity and type
     of the affliction, and the manner of administration. The exact dose is readily determined by
30   one of skill in the art based on the potency of the specific compound, the age, weight, sex
     and physiological condition of the subject.
              The peptides/proteins of the present disclosure (for example, CD47 or TSP1
    peptides, or a peptide that inhibits or alters binding between TSP1 and CD47) also can be
     administered as naked DNA encoding the peptide. To simplify the manipulation and
35  handling of the nucleic acid encoding the peptide, the nucleic acid is generally inserted into
                                                         81

     a cassette, where it is operably linked to a promoter. Preferably, the promoter is capable of
     driving expression of the protein in cells of the desired target tissue. The selection of
     appropriate promoters can readily be accomplished. Preferably, the promoter is a high
     expression promoter, for example the 763-base-pair cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, the
 5  Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter (Davis, et al., Hum. Gene. Ther. 4:151, 1993), or the
    MMT promoter.
              Other elements that enhance expression also can be included, such as an enhancer or
     a system that results in high levels of expression, such as a tat gene or tar element. This
    cassette is inserted into a vector, for example, a plasmid vector such as pUCi 18, pBR322, or
10   other known plasmid vector, that includes, for example, an E. coli origin of replication. See,

    Laboratory Press (1989). The plasmid vector may also include a selectable marker such as
    the B-lactamase gene for ampicillin resistance, provided that the marker polypeptide does
    not adversely affect the metabolism of the organism being treated. The cassette also can be
15  bound to a nucleic acid binding moiety in a synthetic delivery system, such as the system
     disclosed in PCT publication WO 95/22618.
              Optionally, the DNA may be used with a microdelivery vehicle such as cationic
     liposomes and adenoviral vectors. (For a review of the procedures for liposome preparation,
    targeting and delivery of contents, see Mannino and Gould-Fogerite, BioTechniques, 6:682,
20   1988); Feigner and Holm, Bethesda Res. Lab. Focus, 11(2):21, 1989); and Maurer, Bethesda
    Res. Lab. Focus, 11(2):25, 1989). Replication-defective recombinant adenoviral vectors can
    be produced in accordance with known techniques. (See Quantin, et al., Proc.Natl. Acad.
    Sci. USA, 89:2581-2584, 1992; Stratford-Perricadet, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 90:626-630,1992;
     and Rosenfeld, et al., Cell, 68:143-155, 1992).
25            The effective dose of the nucleic acid will be a function of the particular expressed
    protein, the target tissue, the subject, and his or her clinical condition. Effective amounts of
    DNA are between about 1 and 4000 jig, or about 1000 and 2000, or between about 2000 and
    4000. In certain situations, it is desirable to use nucleic acids encoding two or more
     different proteins in order to optimize the therapeutic outcome. For example, DNA
30   encoding a therapeutic peptide, such as a CD47 or TSP1 peptide (e.g., peptides
    IGWKDETAYRWRLS (SEQ ID NO: 6), biotin-IGWKDFTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 3),
    IGWKNFTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 4), IGWKDYTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 20), IGWKDFAAYR
     (SEQ ID NO: 5), Ac-WKDFTAYR (SEQ ID NO: 2)), can be used. Alternatively, DNA
     encoding a CD47 or TSP1 peptide can be combined with other genes or their encoded gene
35  products to enhance the activity of targeted cells.

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
              In order to facilitate injection, the nucleic acid is formulated with a
    pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of suitable carriers include, but are not
     limited to, saline, albumin, dextrose and sterile water. The nucleic acid is injected into the
    ischemic tissue using standard injection techniques by use of, for example, a hypodermic
 5  needle, for example a hypodermic needle size between No. 29 and No. 16. The nucleic acid
     also may be injected by an externally applied local injection apparatus, such as that used to
    inject antigens for allergy testing; or a transcutaneous patch capable of delivery to
     subcutaneous muscle. The nucleic acid is injected at one site, or at multiple sites throughout
    the ischemic tissue.
10            Once injected, the nucleic acid capable of expressing the desired angiogenic protein
    is taken up and expressed by the cells of the tissue. Because the vectors containing the
    nucleic acid of interest are not normally incorporated into the genome of the cells,
     expression of the protein of interest takes place for only a limited time. Typically, the
     angiogenic protein is only expressed in therapeutic levels for about two days to several
15  weeks, preferably for about one to two weeks. Reinjection of the DNA can be utilized to
    provide additional periods of expression of the angiogenic protein. If desired, use of a
    retrovirus vector to incorporate the heterologous DNA into the genome of the cells will
    increase the length of time during which the therapeutic polypeptide is expressed, from
     several weeks to indefinitely.
20            The therapeutic agents can also be administered directly as part of a surgical
    procedure, or at the bedside by a treating physician. Drug quality product (e.g., peptide,
     antibody or morpholino) can be diluted for instance in sterile saline and given by injection
    using sterile 1 cc syringes and small bore needles (25 gauge and less) to ischemic soft tissue
    units. Alternatively, a wound bed can be irrigated for instance with a saline or other
25  therapeutically effective solution containing a known concentration (dosage) of drug or
    compound, or a combination thereof. Precise control and localization of therapeutic effects
    can thus be obtained.
              Controlled release parenteral formulations can be made as implants, oily injections,
     or as particulate systems. For a broad overview of protein delivery systems, see Banga,
30   Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins:Formulation,Processing,and Delivery Systems,
    Technomic Publishing Company, Inc., Lancaster, PA, 1995. Particulate systems include
    microspheres, microparticles, microcapsules, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and nanoparticles.
    Microcapsules contain the therapeutic peptide as a central core. In microspheres, the
    therapeutic agent is dispersed throughout the particle. Particles, microspheres, and
35  microcapsules smaller than about 1 pum are generally referred to as nanoparticles,

    nanospheres, and nanocapsules, respectively. Capillaries have a diameter of approximately
     5 pim so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically
     around 100 pim in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly (see
    Kreuter, ColloidalDrug Delivery Systems, J. Kreuter, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York,
 5  NY, pp. 219-342, 1994; Tice & Tabibi, Treatise on ControlledDrug Delivery, A.
    Kydonieus, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York, NY, pp. 315-339, 1992).
             Also contemplated is the use of nanoparticles as delivery agents, which can be
    targeted to specific cells, tissues or organ for instance by incorporation on their surface
     ligands of receptors specific in their expression to the targeted cells, tissues or organs, The
10  targeting entity can be the same or different than the therapeutically active agent carried by
    the nanoparticle. Further, distribution of nanoparticles to certain tissues spaces (e.g. the
    blood versus the central nervous system protected by the blood-brain barrier) can be
     determined by altering the size of the nanoparticles thereby allowing or preventing their
    transit of such barriers between tissue compartments.
15           Polymers can be used for ion-controlled release. Various degradable and
    nondegradable polymeric matrices for use in controlled drug delivery are known in the art
     (Langer,Accounts Chem. Res. 26:537, 1993). For example, the block copolymer,
    polaxamer 407 exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a
     semisolid gel at body temperature. It has shown to be an effective vehicle for formulation
20   and sustained delivery of recombinant interleukin-2 and urease (Johnston et al., Pharm.Res.
     9:425, 1992; Pec, J. Parent.Sci. Tech. 44(2):58, 1990). Alternatively, hydroxyapatite has
    been used as a microcarrier for controlled release of proteins (Ijntema et al., Int. J. Pharm.
     112:215, 1994). In yet another aspect, liposomes are used for controlled release as well as
     drug targeting of lipid-capsulated compounds (Betageri et al., Liposome Drug Delivery
25  Systems, Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, PA, 1993). Numerous additional
     systems for controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins are known (e.g., U.S. Patent No.
     5,055,303; U.S. Patent No. 5,188,837; U.S. Patent No. 4,235,871; U.S. Patent No.

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    XI.       Suppression of Protein Expression
              In some embodiments, it is desirable to reduce or suppress TSP1 or CD47 protein
     expression, for example in various experimental conditions or in the treatment of an
    ischemic condition such as those exemplified herein.
 5            Although the exact mechanism by which antisense RNA molecules interfere with
    gene expression has not been elucidated, it is believed that antisense RNA molecules bind to
    the endogenous mRNA molecules and thereby inhibit translation of the endogenous mRNA.
    A reduction of protein expression in a cell may be obtained by introducing into cells an
     antisense construct based on the TSP1 (or CD47) encoding sequence, including the human
10   TSP] cDNA or human CD47 cDNA or gene sequence or flanking regions thereof. For
     antisense suppression, a nucleotide sequence from a TSP 1-encoding sequence, for example
     all or a portion of the TSP] cDNA or gene, is arranged in reverse orientation relative to the
    promoter sequence in the transformation vector. One of ordinary skill in the art will
    understand how other aspects of the vector may be chosen.
15            The introduced sequence need not be the full length the cDNA or gene, or reverse
    complement thereof, and need not be exactly homologous to the equivalent sequence found
    in the cell type to be transformed. Generally, however, where the introduced sequence is of
     shorter length, a higher degree of homology to the native target sequence will be needed for
     effective antisense suppression. The introduced antisense sequence in the vector may be at
20   least 20 nucleotides in length, and improved antisense suppression will typically be
     observed as the length of the antisense sequence increases. The length of the antisense
     sequence in the vector advantageously may be greater than about 30 nucleotides, or great
    than about 100 nucleotides. For suppression of the TSP] gene itself, transcription of an
     antisense construct results in the production of RNA molecules that are the reverse
25  complement of mRNA molecules transcribed from the endogenous TSP] gene in the cell.
               Suppression of endogenous TSP1 or CD47 expression can also be achieved using
    ribozymes. Ribozymes are synthetic molecules that possess highly specific
     endoribonuclease activity. The production and use of ribozymes are disclosed in U.S.
    Patent No. 4,987,071 and U.S. Patent No. 5,543,508. The inclusion of ribozyme sequences
30  within antisense RNAs may be used to confer RNA cleaving activity on the antisense RNA,
     such that endogenous mRNA molecules that bind to the antisense RNA are cleaved, which
    in turn leads to an enhanced antisense inhibition of endogenous gene expression.
               Suppression can also be achieved using RNA interference, using known and
    previously disclosed methods. Several models have been put forward to explain RNAi, in
35  particular the mechanisms by which the cleavage derived small dsRNAs or siRNAs interact
                                                       85

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    with the target mRNA and thus facilitate its degradation (Hamilton et al., Science 286, 950,
     1999; Zamore et al., Cell 101, 25, 2000; Hammond et al., Nature 404, 293, 2000; Yang et
    al., Curr.Biol. 10, 1191, 2000; Elbashir et al., Genes Dev. 15, 188, 2001; Bass Cell 101,
    235, 2000). It has been proposed that the cleavage derived small dsRNAs or siRNAs act as
 5   a guide for the enzymatic complex required for the sequence specific cleavage of the target
    mRNA. Evidence for this includes cleavage of the target mRNA at regular intervals of ~21
    23 nts in the region corresponding to the input dsRNA (Zamore et al., Cell 101, 25, 2000),
    with the exact cleavage sites corresponding to the middle of sequences covered by
    individual 21- or 22 nt small dsRNAS or siRNAs (Elbashir et al., Genes Dev. 15, 188,
10  2001). Although mammals and lower organisms appear to share dsRNA-triggered
    responses that involve a related intermediate (small dsRNAs), it is likely that there will be
     differences as well as similarities in the underlying mechanism. dsRNAs can be formed
     from RNA oligomers produced synthetically (for technical details see material from the
    companies Xeragon and Dharmacon, both available on the internet). Small dsRNAs and
15   siRNAs can also be manufactured using standard methods of in vitro RNA production. In
     addition, the SilencerTM siRNA Construction kit (and components thereof) available from
    Ambion (Catalog # 1620; Austin, TX), which employs a T7 promoter and other well known
    genetic engineering techniques to produce dsRNAs. Double stranded RNA triggers could
     also be expressed from DNA based vector systems.
20           Inhibition also can be accomplished using morpholino oligonucleotides, as
     described herein. The herein described discoveries and therapeutics find immediate
     application through implanted devices in the management and treatment, for instance, of
    coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease. Implantation of vascular stents is routine in
    the treatment of peripheral vascular and coronary arterial disease. Morpholinos targeting
25   CD47 or TSP1 can be incorporated into (or onto) such implanted stents for sustained local
    release directly to enhance vascular blood flow and prevent tissue death and heart attack.
    The therapeutic agents (morpholino, TSP 1 antibody) could be then targeted specifically to
     areas of maximum benefit throughout the body including the carotid vascular network, the
    heart and other peripheral arterial networks. In more general applications, various
30  implantable scaffolds or synthetics can serve the same means by allowing for controlled and
     extended release of the therapeutic agent. The agents could be incorporated into engineered
    tissue constructs and as such stimulate the growth of blood vessels into the construct and at
    the same time maximize blood flow to the same. The therapeutics would enhance blood
     flow and tissue healing in both the young and elderly and may greatly increase chronic
35  wound healing. To this end the therapeutics can be incorporated directly into wound
                                                        86

     dressing and gels and applied directly to the wound surface. In localizing the therapeutic to
    the area needed we will essentially eliminate and potential negative side effects derived
     from the other non-specific roles TSP1 and CD47 have.
 5  XH.       Screeningfor Agents that Affect TSPJ/CD47Activity and/or Interaction
              In various embodiments, it may be useful to treat a subject with an ischemic or
    clotting condition with an agent that mimics or augments TSP1 or CD47 activity, or with an
     agent that inhibits a TSP1 or CD47 activity. Examples of such methods are described
    herein, along with example compounds and compositions useful in such methods.
10  However, equivalents of the specifically described compounds are also useful in these
    methods. Thus, here described are methods for identifying agents with TSP1 or CD47
    inhibitory activity, methods of identifying agents that interfere with an interaction between a
    TSP1 polypeptide and a CD47 polypeptide, and methods for the identification of agents that
    mimic TSP1's CD47-binding activity.
15            The compounds which may be screened in accordance with this disclosure include,
    but are not limited to peptides, antibodies and fragments thereof, and other organic
    compounds (for example, peptidomimetics, small molecules) that inhibit TSP1 and/or CD47
     activity as described herein or interfere with an interaction between TSP 1 and CD47. Such
    compounds may include, but are not limited to, peptides such as, for example, soluble
20  peptides, including but not limited to members of random peptide libraries; (see, for
     example, Lam et al., Nature, 354:82-84, 1991; Houghten et al., Nature, 354:84-86, 1991),
     and combinatorial chemistry-derived molecular library made of D- and/or L-configuration
     amino acids, phosphopeptides (including, but not limited to, members of random or partially
     degenerate, directed phosphopeptide libraries; see, for example, Songyang et al., Cell,
25   72:767-778, 1993), antibodies (including, but not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal,
    humanized, anti-idiotypic, chimeric or single chain antibodies, and Fab, F(ab') 2 and Fab
     expression library fragments, and epitope-binding fragments thereof), and small organic or
    inorganic molecules.
              Other compounds which can be screened in accordance with this disclosure include
30  but are not limited to small organic molecules that are able to gain entry into an appropriate
    cell and affect the expression of TSP] gene or some other gene involved in a
    TSP1 -mediated pathway (for example, by interacting with the regulatory region or
    transcription factors involved in TSP] gene expression); or such compounds that affect an
     activity of a TSP1 isoform or the activity of some other intracellular factor involved in a
35  TSP1-mediated pathway, such as CD47.

              Computer modeling and searching technologies permit identification of compounds,
     or the improvement of already identified compounds that can modulate expression or
     activity of TSP1. Examples of molecular modeling systems are the CHARMM (Chemistry
     at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) and QUANTA programs (Polygen Corporation,
 5  Waltham, Mass.). CHARMM performs the energy minimization and molecular dynamics
     functions. QUANTA performs the construction, graphic modeling and analysis of
    molecular structure. QUANTA allows interactive construction, modification, visualization,
     and analysis of the behavior of molecules with each other.
              A number of articles review computer modeling of drugs interactive with specific
10  proteins, such as Rotivinen et al., Acta PharmaceuticalFennica 97:159-166, 1988; Ripka,
    New Scientist 54-57, 1988; McKinaly and Rossmann, Annu Rev PharmacolToxicol 29:111
     122, 1989; Perry and Davies, OSAR: QuantitativeStructure-Activity Relationships in Drug
    Design pp. 189-193, 1989, (Alan R. Liss, Inc.); Lewis and Dean, Proc R Soc Lond 236:125
     140 and 141-162, 1989; and, with respect to a model receptor for nucleic acid components,
15  Askew et al., JAm Chem Soc 111:1082-1090, 1989. Other computer programs that screen
     and graphically depict chemicals are available from companies such as BioDesign, Inc.
     (Pasadena, Calif.), Allelix, Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and Hypercube, Inc.
     (Cambridge, Ontario). Although these are primarily designed for application to drugs
     specific to particular proteins, they can be adapted to design of drugs specific to regions of
20  DNA or RNA, once that region is identified.
    Screeningfor TSP] (or CD47) InhibitoryAgents
              Disclosed herein are methods of identifying agents with potential for inhibition of
    TSP1 or CD47, and particularly the activity of either of these proteins in influencing tissue
25   survival to ischemia, platelet function, or tissue response to aging. Any agent capable of
    inhibiting (to a measurable degree) at least one biological activity of TSP1 or CD47 is
    contemplated. In some embodiments, a TSP1 (or CD47) inhibitory agent interferes with an
    interaction between TSP1 and CD47, which is discussed below.
              Screening assays may be conducted in a variety of ways. For example, one method
30  would involve transiently transfecting CD47-expressing cells with expression vector
     encoding sGC and a suitable cGMP-inducible reporter plasmid and screening for, inhibitory
     agents that either directly regulate reporter activity in the absence or presence of nitric oxide
     or prevent exogenous TSP1 from inhibiting a nitric oxide signal. Any eukaryotic cells or
    cell line may be used for transfections, such as 293T, NIH373, Wehi 7.2, 293F, or Cos7 cell
35   lines. In one embodiment, vascular cells may be transfected with an the two expression
                                                         88

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    vectors and an EGFP vector, in which case transfectants could be identified by EGFP
     fluorescence and, optionally, could be separated or analyzed by fluorescence activated cell
     sorting (FACS; also called flow cytometry). Test compounds would be applied to the
    transfected cells and cGMP-dependent reporter activity evaluated using an assay. TSP1
 5  inhibitory compounds would be identified by a decrease in cGMP-dependent reporter
     activity, as compared to control. Animal models, for instance based on transgenic animals
     such as transgenic mice, are also contemplated.
    Screeningfor Compounds that affect TSPJ/CD47Interaction
10            In vitro systems may be designed to identify compounds capable of affecting an
    interaction between TSP1 and CD47. Compounds identified may be useful, for example, in
    modulating an activity of TSP 1 or CD47, or increasing or decreasing a binding affinity
    between TSP1 and CD47, thereby treating an ischemic or other described condition.
              Representative assays used to identify compounds that affect an interaction between
15  TSP1 and CD47 involves preparing a reaction mixture of a TSP1 polypeptide, fragment, or
     functional variant and a CD47 polypeptide, fragment, or functional variant under conditions
     and for a time sufficient to allow the two components to interact and form a complex.
    Thereafter, a test compound is added to the reaction mixture and various means are used to
     determine if the TSP1/CD47 complex is affected by the test compound. Alternatively, the
20  two components are brought into contact in the presence of as test compound, and the
    impact of that compound is determined compared to a mixture without the test compound.
              Screening assays can be conducted in a variety of ways. For example, one method
    to conduct such an assay would involve anchoring a TSP1 polypeptide, peptide, or fusion
    protein onto a solid surface or a soluble support, adding a CD47 polypeptide, peptide, or
25   fusion protein to the reaction vessel, and adding the test substance and detecting
    TSP1/CD47 complexes anchored on the solid phase or soluble support at the end of the
    reaction. In one embodiment of such a method, TSP1 may be anchored onto a solid surface,
     and the CD47 component, which is not anchored, may be labeled, either directly or
    indirectly. It will be clear that the reverse system (anchored CD47, free and labeled TSP1)
30  is also contemplated.
              In practice, microtiter plates may conveniently be utilized as the solid phase. The
     anchored component may be immobilized by non-covalent or covalent attachments.
    Non-covalent attachment may be accomplished by simply coating the solid surface with a
     solution of the protein and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody, preferably a

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    be used to anchor the protein to the solid surface. The surfaces may be prepared in advance
     and stored.
              In order to conduct the assay, the non-immobilized component and test compound
     are added to the coated surface containing the anchored component. After the reaction is
 5  complete, unreacted components are removed (for example, by washing) under conditions
     such that any TSP1/CD47 complexes formed (or a substantial portion thereof) will remain
    immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface
    can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the previously non-immobilized
    component is pre-labeled, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that
10  complexes were formed. Where the previously non-immobilized component is not pre
     labeled, an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface; for
     example, using a labeled antibody specific for the previously non-immobilized component
     (the antibody, in turn, may be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with a labeled anti-Ig
     antibody).
15            Alternatively, the solid phase can be a bead composed of a material such as latex
     (either fluorescent or not), such that beads coated with a component of TSP1 or CD47 can
    be interacted with cells expressing either CD47 components or cell anchored TSP1
    components. Such interaction is conveniently assayed by flow cytometric (FACS) analysis.
              Alternatively, a screening reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase, the reaction
20  products separated from unreacted components, and complexes detected; for example, using
     an immobilized antibody specific for a TSP1 protein, polypeptide, peptide, or fusion protein
     or a CD47 protein, polypeptide, peptide, or fusion protein to anchor any complexes formed
    in solution, and a labeled antibody specific for the other component of the possible complex
    to detect anchored complexes.

    Screeningfor Mimics or EnhancingAgents
              Other methods contemplated herein include identifying agents that mimic or
     enhance TSP1 ( or CD47) activity, for example to increase its activity in altering survival in
    ischemia, or influencing platelet function and/or blood clotting.
30            Agents that mimic or enhance activity can include, for example, agents that induce
     or increase TSP1 expression (or CD47 expression) in one or more cells; or agents that
    interact with TSP1 (or CD47) and enhance its activity; or TSP1 (or CD47) peptides having a
     desired activity; or molecules designed to have a TSP1 (or CD47) structure that mediates a
    particular activity.
                                                        90

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
              In some embodiments, agents that induce or increase TSP1 or CD47 expression in
     one or more cells may be identified by contacting a biological system (such as a cell) that
     expresses or is capable of expressing that protein with an agent. Protein expression or
     activity in the biological system (e.g., expression or activity of TSP1 or CD47, or both) may
 5  be measured in response to contact with the agent by methods well known in the art. For
    instance, trans-acting coactivators of the TSP1 gene regulatory region may be expected to
    increase TSP1 activity. In other embodiments, agents may increase the half-life of the TSP1
    protein or its mRNA and thereby increase TSP1 activity.
              In other embodiments, agents that interact with TSP1 (or CD47) and enhance its
10   activity in at least one of the described systems are contemplated. These agents may be
    identified, for example, by first identifying agents that interact with TSP1 or CD47.
    Biophysical methods of accomplishing this step are well known in the art and include, for
     example, co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid system, and GST pulldown assay,
    cross-linking of small molecules to the target protein, among other methods. Agents that
15  interact with TSP1 (or CD47) are then screened for enhancement of the desired biological or
    biochemical activity. In some embodiments, TSP 1 activity may be increased by agents that
     enhance an interaction between TSP1 and CD47.
              In other embodiments, molecules can be designed to have a TSP1-like or CD47-like
     structure that mediates a particular activity using modeling analyses. Candidate agents
20   designed, for example in silico, to assume a selected structure may then be screened for
     desired biological activity, for example binding to TSP1 (or CD47, respectively), or
    increasing activity in a biological system. Agents with such activity may then be used to
    influence ischemia, alter blood clotting, or otherwise influence one or more of the systems
     described herein.

    XIII.     IncreasingBlood Flow and Tissue Healing in the Elderly
              Also provided herein are methods for the treatment of elderly subjects using agents
    that affect TSP1 and/or CD47.
              People over the age of 65 represent the fastest growing segment of the United States
30  population and are estimated to comprise 20% of the country's population by 2030.
     Complications from peripheral vascular disease including coronary artery disease and
    myocardial infarction, stroke and ischemic vascular disease affect some 80% of people over
    the age of 65. Age is a recognized risk factor for complications following surgical
    procedures, including delayed and incomplete wound healing and tissue loss, and accounts
35   for significant morbidity and mortality in this group (Gohel et al., Eur J Vasc Endovasc
                                                        91

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    Surg. 29(1):74-77, 2005; Gosain et al., World JSurg.28(3):321-326, 2004; Brem et al. Surg
     Technol Int. 11:161-167, 2003; Crooks J Wound Care. 14(5):222-223, 2005). The elderly
    have significant alterations in vascular anatomy including loss of vascular networks and
    capillary loops (Lamah et al., Int JMicrocirc Clin Exp. 16(5):271-276, 1996) and alterations
 5  in vascular response to injury (Ryan, Micron. 35(3):161-171, 2004). Animal studies have
    confirmed the impact of ageing upon wound healing (Ashcroft et al., Biogerontology.
     3(6):337-345, 2002). Blood flow and wound healing are delayed from 20 to 60% in aged
     animals compared to young animals (Ashcroft et al., JAnat. 187 (Pt 1):1-26, 1995;
    Kivirikko et al., Med Biol. 54(3):159-186, 1976). Capillary growth rates decline in older
10   animals. These changes have been associated with altered levels of growth factors
    production in response to injury in older animals (Wagatsuma, Exp Gerontol. 41(1):49-54,
    2006). Stimulated macrophages from old animals produce less vascular endothelial growth
     factor (VEGF), and VEGF treatment in aged animals has less impact on tissue perfusion
     (Yu et al., Faseb J. 20(3):479-48, 2006).The body depends upon adequate blood flow. At
15  the same time, vascular response to growth factors is muted in aged animals. Additionally,
     aged animals demonstrate alterations in immune responses (Brown, J Wound Care.
     13(3):94-96, 2004) and the ability of vessels to respond to stress is decreased.
              Tissue perfusion is regulated through the control of blood vessel diameter, which
    itself level of organs and tissue, blood flow is controlled by the contractile state of vascular
20   smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Though a number of factors can impact VSMC contractility
     and vessel size, nitric oxide (NO) is a primary and ubiquitous dilator of blood vessels
     (Ignarro,JPhysiolPharmacol.53(4 Pt 1):503-514, 2002). Nitric oxide is constitutively
    produced by blood vessels by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). NO
     activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) leading to cGMP production and GMP-dependent
25  protein kinas activation, which ultimately prevents phosphorylation of the contractile
    protein myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) in VMSC, preventing cell contraction (Murad, Adv
    Pharmacol.26:1-5, 1994). In aged vascular cells (Bernardini et al., Biochim Biophys Acta.
     1745:265-272, 2005), animals and people, both eNOS expression (Woodman et al., JAppl
    Physiol. 95(5):2164-2170, 2003) and NO production (Qian et al., J CardiovascPharmacol.
30  47(4):587-593, 2006) are decreased.. These cells line every blood vessel of the body. The
    contraction of these cells determines the amount of blood that flow through a certain vessel
     and on to organs and tissues. The contraction (and relaxation) of vascular smooth muscle
    cells is in turn controlled by the bioactive gas nitric oxide (NO) which is constantly
    produced by blood vessels. NO causes blood vessels to dilate and increases blood flow to
35  tissues and organs. Disruption of this process leads to significant diseases, morbidity and
                                                        92

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    mortality including peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes.
    Additionally, lack of blood flow causes tissue death and wound healing problems both
     during and after surgery.
              There are many complications that occur in elderly subjects resulting from
 5   decreased tissue perfusion. Acute loss of blood flow can occur secondary to accidental or
     elective trauma (surgery), as a consequence of acute vascular obstruction and clotting both
     alone and in combination with diffuse peripheral vascular disease or as the end results of
    progressive but chronic vascular disease. Thus, there is a need for methods to increase tissue
    perfusion for treatment of ischemia, atherosclerosis, wound healing and other conditions
10  relating to reduced blood flow in these subjects. The therapeutic benefits obtained by the
     discoveries described herein will have multiple applications in the elderly for both acute and
    chronic alterations in blood flow. Immediate benefits under conditions of acute blood loss
    would be both local/regional and systemic.
              The elderly are particularly vulnerable to stress and have decreased reserve
15  capacity. Hence, what might be a small area of tissue loss associated with decreased blood
     flow in a young person can lead to tremendous tissue/organ death in the elderly. Any agent
    that minimizes or prevents blood loss will have substantial benefit acutely. Long term
    benefits of maximizing NO-effects on blood vessel health and blood flow will include a
     decrease in chronic tissue ischemia associated with peripheral vascular disease, tissue
20  preservation, enhanced energy and exercise capacity and increased responses of other vital
     organs.
              Provided herein are methods for the treatment of elderly subjects using agents that
     affect TSP1 and CD47, in order to affect tissue perfusion. Included are the use of
    therapeutic compounds and compositions that block TSP1 action via CD47 either
25   exclusively or in combination with other identified or yet to be identified receptors for TSP1
    that may augment and/or focus the effect of TSP1 in certain tissues or to certain purposes.
     Such compounds and compositions thereby increase tissue survival to ischemia in the
     elderly subject. Specific examples of compounds of use in these methods include anti
     CD47 antibodies (or binding fragments thereof), including but not limited to the following:

    Antigens 45:203, 1995) (all mouse anti-human CD47); and additional anti-CD47 or anti
    TSP1 antibodies that have similar effect on the interaction between CD47 and TSP1, as well
 5   as morpholinos (e.g., CD47 or TSP1 morpholinos), and peptides derived from CD47 or
    TSP1.
             Also of use in the disclosed methods is a peptide comprising the amino acid
     sequence HIGWKDFTAYRWRLS (SEQ ID NO: 7), or comprising at least the amino acid
     sequence IGWKDFTAYR contained therein (SEQ ID NO: 1), or comprising an amino acid
10   sequence derived therefrom that inhibits ligand binding to CD47, or another peptide recited
    herein, or an equivalent thereof. Also of use in the disclosed methods are pharmaceutical
    compositions that contain such peptides or one or more derivatives thereof formulated to
    improve stability and/or bioavailability of the peptide.
             Also of use in the disclosed methods are oligonucleotides comprising at least about
15  20 contiguous nucleotides that hybridize to the mRNA of CD47 (e.g., accession number NM
     001777 Homo sapiens CD47 mRNA) under high stringency conditions. In certain
     embodiments, the oligonucleotide is a morpholino. Yet another embodiment is the use of a
    pharmaceutical composition comprising an antisense oligonucleotide of at least 20
    contiguous nucleotides complementary to human CD47 mRNA, and a suitable delivery
20  vehicle, which composition limits tissue expression of CD47. By way of example, the
     antisense oligonucleotide in some cases is a morpholino. For instance, in some
     embodiments, the methods include the use of a morpholino comprising an antisense
     oligonucleotide to CD47 having the sequence CGTCACAGGCAGGACCCACTGCCCA
     (SEQ ID NO: 21), or another sequence from CD47 or a sequence from TSP1. Other
25   oligonucleotides are also of use in the disclosed methods.
             Also provided is a method to improve tissue survival during integument and soft
    tissue and composite tissue surgery in an elderly subject, the method comprising one or
    more of: decreasing CD47 expression in the tissue; inhibiting ligand binding to CD47 in the
    tissue using a peptide or small molecule inhibitor, or decreasing ligand binding to CD47 in
30  tissue using an antibody that specifically binds CD47. Another provided method is a
    method to prevent or reduce ischemic tissue damage or necrosis in an elderly subject, which
    method comprises any one or more of: decreasing CD47 expression in the tissue; inhibiting
     ligand binding to CD47 in the tissue using a peptide or small molecule inhibitor of CD47;
     and inhibiting ligand binding to CD47 in tissue using an antibody that specifically binds
35   CD47. Additional methods include a method to increase skin graft survival in an elderly
                                                       94

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     subject, which comprises decreasing CD47 expression in the graft and/or inhibiting ligand
    binding to CD47 in the tissue. There are also provides in various embodiments methods of
    use of antibodies and peptides, for instance antibodies (such as monoclonal antibodies, and
    humanized antibodies) to CD47 and peptides derived from CD47. For instance, there is
 5  provided use of an antibody to CD47 or a peptide derived from CD47 to prevent or reduce
    tissue necrosis and/or to increase skin graft survival and/or improve organ transplant success
    in elderly subjects. Also provided is use of an isolated CD47 molecule, or molecule that
    binds thereto, to influence blood vessel flow and alter tissue perfusion in the elderly subject.
              Additionally, included the use of agents that block the action of TSP 1 directly, such
10   as with monoclonal antibodies, for example clone A6.1, and other antibodies which block
    the action of TSP1 on CD47 and thus increase tissue blood vessel diameter, blood flow and
    tissue perfusion.
              Yet another embodiment is a method comprising selective application to an elderly
     subject of one or more agents that inhibit function or expression of CD47, which method:
15  improves tissue or organ survival in the elderly subject; treats or ameliorates peripheral
    vascular disease or myocardial ischemia in the elderly subject; improves blood flow in the
     elderly subject; improves transplant organ or tissue survival in the elderly subject; and/or
    improves skin graft survival in the elderly subject. Without limitation, the elderly subject to
    whom such a method is applied may be a subject suffering from one or more diseases or
20  conditions that have as a component or side effect a defect in circulation or vascular
    regulation or ischemia. For instance, in some examples the subject has diabetes, a
    vasculopathy, peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerotic vascular disease and/or other
    chronic vascular pathology (e.g., associated with macular degeneration), or is undergoing
    tissue or organ grafting or transplantation, or has suffered an injury, cardiac arrest or stroke
25   or other event resulting in ischemia. The subject can also have a condition associated with
     advanced age, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, a stroke, or another condition wherein
    increased tissue perfusion would result in alleviating a symptom of the condition.
    XIV. Influencing Blood Clotting
30            Results presented herein demonstrate that peptides based on the sequences of C6d,
    including C6b (SEQ ID NO: 7) and other peptides described herein, can promote platelet
     aggregation and blood clotting. These peptides and similar peptides can be used to stop
    bleeding from congenital bleeding disorders and acquired bleeding disorders. The will also
    be effective as topically applied hemostatic agents and may be used directly or incorporated
35  into wound dressings and bandages for use in emergency situations and in treating victims
                                                       95

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     of trauma. They can be used in the operating room to achieve bleeding control from large
    wound surfaces such as found during burn or liver surgery. The provided compositions also
     are useful in the control or modulation of thrombocytopenia and congenital bleeding
     disorders.
 5            Being amenable to direct topical application these agents function as topical
    hemostatic therapies. As such they avoid systemic side effects and maximize therapeutic
    benefits. Such agents can be applied as sprays, ointments or in sustained release forms that
     are part of the dressings and bandages placed on the bleeding wound or tissue site. They
    would especially beneficial under emergency conditions both civilian and military. They
10  would also be useful for individuals with congenital or acquired bleeding disorders. Local
     applications may also reduce blood loss during elective surgical procedures in which
    hemorrhage is usually extensive.
              Such therapeutics also are useful beyond trauma wounds, for instance in cases in
    which a subject has been extensively anti-coagulated as immediately after a heart attack, and
15  then must undergo a surgical procedure such as an angioplasty, bypass surgery, or perhaps
     other surgery unrelated to the heart attack, as a victim of trauma (car accident, etc) that has a
    heart attack coincident with the trauma. To prevent excessive bleeding, the patient can be
    treated with a coagulant peptide or its analogs locally or systemically to promote clotting
    thus avoiding life threatening hemorrhage.

              The following examples are provided to illustrate certain particular features and/or
     embodiments. These examples should not be construed to limit the invention to the
    particular features or embodiments described.
25                                            EXAMPLES
       Example 1: CD47 is necessary in inhibition of nitric oxide-stimulated vascular cell
                                   responses by Thrombospondin-1
              The anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 is dramatically potentiated in the presence of
     low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) donors. This activity is mediated at least in part
30  through inhibition by TSP1 of cGMP signaling via NO-mediated activation of soluble
    guanylyl cyclase in both endothelial cells and VSMC. Moreover, TSP1 null vascular cells
     exhibit elevated basal cGMP levels and enhanced cGMP and phenotypic responses to
     exogenous NO. The inhibitory activity of TSP1 on NO signaling was replicated by an
     agonist CD36 antibody and by a recombinant CD36-binding region of TSP1. This example
35   demonstrates that a second TSP1 receptor, CD47, plays the primary role in mediating the
                                                        96

    inhibitory activities of TSP1 for vascular cells. Remarkably, CD47 is also necessary for
    inhibition of NO signaling by CD36 ligands. At least portions of this example were
    published in Isenberg et al., J. Biol. Chem. 281(36):26069-26080, 2006.
 5  Materials and Methods
              Cells and Reagents - Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cambrex,
    Walkersville, MD) were maintained in endothelial cell growth medium (Cambrex) with 5%
    FCS in 5% CO 2 at 370 C. Cells were utilized at passages 4-8. Purity of cultures was
    monitored by immunochemical staining with monoclonal human anti-CD31 antibody and
10  monoclonal anti-a smooth muscle actin from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Human aortic smooth
    muscle cells (HASMC) (Cambrex) were maintained in smooth muscle cell growth medium
    with the manufacturer's additives (SM-GM, Clonetics) and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in 5%
     CO 2 at 370 C. Cells utilized were within passages 4 through 9. Purity of primary cultures
    was monitored by immunochemical staining with monoclonal human anti-CD31 antibody
15   and a smooth muscle actin (Sigma). DEA/NO and DETA/NO were kindly provided by Dr.
    Larry Keefer (National Cancer Institute, Frederick). TSP1 was prepared from human
    platelets obtained from the NIH blood bank as previously described (Roberts et al., J Tissue
     Cult Methods 16:217-222, 1994). Recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells containing
    the N-terminal domains (NoCi), type 1 repeats (3TSR), or C-terminal regions of TSP1
20   (E3CaG1) were generously provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin) and
    Dr. Jack Lawler, Harvard Medical School (Misenheimer et al., JBiol Chem 275:40938
    40945, 2000; Tan et al., J Cell Biol 159:373-382, 2002). The recombinant C-terminal cell
    binding domain (CBD) was prepared as previously described (McDonald et al.,

 5            Murine Cell Cultures - Murine ASMC were obtained from aortic segments
    harvested sterilely from C57B1/6 CD47 null or CD36 null mice as described (Ray et al.,
    Methods Cell Sci 23:185-188, 2001) and cultured in SM-GM (Cambrex) + 20% FCS. In the

    Wild type C57B1/6 ASMC cultures were prepared as previously described (Isenberg et al.,
10  Matrix Biol 24:110-123, 2005). Cell culture purity was determined by
    immunohistochemistry staining for a-smooth muscle actin. Cells were used within passage
     1 to 4 to minimize overgrowth of other cell types.
              Animals - C57B1/6 WT and TSP1 null (Lawler et al., J Clin Invest 101:982-992,
     1998) CD47 null (Lindberg et al., Science 274:795-798, 1996) and CD36 null mice (Moore
15  et al., JBiol Chem 277:47373-47379, 2002) were all extensively backcrossed on the

20            Explant Invasion Assay - Muscle biopsies from the pectoralis major muscle of 8 to
     12 week old wild type or transgenic mice were harvested and explanted into 100 p1 of type I
    collagen gel in 96-well tissue culture plates as described (Isenberg et al., Matrix Biol
    24:110-123, 2005). Following gelation, the embedded explants were overlayed with 75 p1

              CellAdhesion Assay - Cell adhesion was carried out in 96-well culture plates. After
    pre-coating wells with type I collagen (3 pig/ml in DPBS) harvested cells were plated at a
 5   density of 1 x 104 cells/well in medium plus 0.1% BSA and treatment agents and incubated

    Peptide ligands of three TSP] receptors inhibit explant angiogenic responses
25            As previously reported (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U SA 102:13141-13146,
    2005), sustained exposure to exogenous NO released by the donor DETA/NO stimulated
    vascular outgrowth from muscle explants in 3D collagen cultures to a greater extent in those
     from TSP1 null when compared to WT mice (Fig. 2A controls). Consistent with their
    reported affects on endothelial cells in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (Iruela-Arispe et al.,
30   Circulation 100:1423-1431, 1999; Kanda et al., Exp Cell Res 252:262-272, 1999), a CD36
    binding peptide from the third type 1 repeat of TSP1 (p245, VTCGGGVQKRSRL; SEQ ID
    NO: 9), a CD47 binding peptide from the C-terminal module of TSP1 (p7N3,
    FIRVVMYEGKK; SEQ ID NO: 10), and to a lesser extent a heparin- and TGFP -binding
    peptide from the second type 1 repeat (p246, KRFKQDGGWSHWSPWSS; SEQ ID NO: 8)

    NO (Fig. 2). Conversely, the described pro-angiogenic activities of the N-terminal region of
    TSP1 (Calzada et al., Circ Res 94:462-470, 2004; Chandrasekaran et al., Mol Biol Cell
     11:2885-2900, 2000) were reflected by enhanced vascular outgrowth from explants in the
    presence of recombinant NoC 1. Assuming that these peptides act as agonists of their
 5  respective receptors, this indicates that ligating CD36, heparin sulfate proteoglycans, or
     CD47 is sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated vascular outgrowth, whereas ligating    pi1
    integrins or other TSP1 N-module receptors enhances vascular outgrowth under the same
    conditions.
     CD47 but not CD36 is necessaryfor inhibitionby TSP] of explant angiogenicresponses
10           Although the former data show that ligating CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit
     explant angiogenesis stimulated by NO, they do not prove that the respective receptors are
    necessary for activities of the peptide ligands or of intact TSP1. Furthermore, although
    these peptides clearly bind to the indicated receptors, structural studies have raised concerns
    that VVM peptides may not represent the true CD47 binding site in the C-terminal domain
15   of TSP1 (Kvansakul et al., Embo J23:1223-1233, 2004). To directly address the roles of
     CD36 and CD47 in the inhibitory activity of TSP1, muscle explants from mice lacking the
    respective receptors were placed into 3D collagen cultures (Fig. 3). Similar to wild type
     explants, NO dose-dependently stimulated vascular outgrowth in CD36- or CD47-null
     explants. Remarkably, the ability of exogenous TSP1 to antagonize this response was
20  preserved in CD36-null explants (Fig. 3B) but lost in CD47-null explants (Fig. 3A). Thus,
     CD47 is necessary for the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 in this assay, but CD36 is not.
    This result was unexpected given that a recombinant CD36-binding domain of TSP1 (3TSR)
     and a CD36 antibody (SMD) described to be an agonist based on its ability to mimic TSP1
     (Dawson et al., J Cell Biol 138:707-717, 1997)) were shown previously to inhibit
25   endothelial cell adhesion on type I collagen stimulated by acute NO exposure (Isenberg et
    al., ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 102:13141-13146, 2005). This prompted us to reexamine the
    role of CD36 in this activity of TSP1.
     CD36 ligation is sufficient but not necessaryfor inhibition of NO responses by TSP]
             A CD36-binding peptide derived from the third type 1 repeat (p906,
30  VTAGGGVQKRSRL; SEQ ID NO: 18) and a derivative of the second type 1 repeat with
     enhanced CD36-binding and anti-angiogenic activity (p907, GDGV(D-I)TRIR; SEQ ID
    NO: 19; Dawson et al., MolPharmacol55:332-338, 1999) similarly inhibited NO
     stimulated endothelial cell adhesion (Fig. 4A). As previously reported, the CD36 agonist
     antibody SM(D inhibited NO-stimulated cell adhesion, whereas a control IgM was inactive
35   (Fig. 4C). However, two CD36 antibodies that were reported to antagonize inhibition by
                                                        100

    TSP1, FA6-152 (Dawson et al., J Cell Biol 138:707-717, 1997) and 185-1G2 (Short et al., J
     Cell Biol 168:643-653, 2005) also inhibited NO-stimulated adhesion (Fig. 4B and 4D).
    Isotype-matched control antibodies did not inhibit NO stimulated cell adhesion,
     demonstrating the specificity of these CD36 antibodies for blocking an NO response. Thus,
 5  various CD36 ligands are sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated endothelial cell responses, but
    their mechanism of action may differ from the previously described TSP 1 responses that
    were antagonized by the CD36 antibody FA6-152 (Dawson et al., J Cell Biol 138:707-717,
     1997).
             Antagonism of NO signaling by TSP1 is conserved in VSMC (Isenberg et al.,
10   CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006). Consistent with the data for endothelial cells in Fig.
    4, the CD36 antagonist antibodies FA6-152 and 185-1G2 but not isotype-matched control
     antibodies were dose-dependent inhibitors of NO-stimulated HASMC adhesion (Fig. 5A).
    The FA6-152 antibody also prevented NO-induced accumulation of cGMP in HASMC (Fig.
     5B), consistent with its effects on NO-stimulated adhesion but not with its reported activity
15   as a TSP1 antagonist (Dawson et al., J Cell Biol 138:707-717, 1997; Jimenez et al., Nat
    Med 6:41-48, 2000). Therefore, inhibition of NO signaling by CD36 ligation is conserved in
    both types of vascular cells but is independent of the ability of CD36 ligands to mimic or
    inhibit TSP 1 activity in other angiogenesis assays.
             To clarify the role of CD36 in inhibition by TSP1 of NO-stimulated responses, we
20  used MASMC derived from WT and CD36 null mice (Fig. 6). Low dose NO significantly
     stimulated adhesion of WT MASMC on type I collagen, and TSP1 at 22 pM inhibited this
    response to control levels (Fig. 6A). Higher doses of TSP1 further inhibited adhesion below
    baseline. Remarkably, 22 pM TSP1 inhibited NO-stimulated adhesion of CD36 null
    MASMC to the same extent as in WT cells. Although higher concentrations of TSP1
25   further suppressed NO-induced adhesion of WT cells to levels below the basal level of the
    untreated controls, in the CD36 null cells further inhibition by TSP1 was only seen at
    22 nM.
             These data established that CD36 is not necessary for picomolar concentrations of
    TSP1 to inhibit an NO-stimulated response, although a secondary inhibitory response at
30  nanomolar concentrations of TSP1 does require CD36. We have shown that picomolar
    concentrations of TSP1 inhibit NO signaling at the level of cGMP (Isenberg et al., Proc
    Natl Acad Sci USA 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785
     793, 2006). To establish whether inhibition by TSP1 of NO signaling through cGMP
    requires CD36, cGMP levels were analyzed in the WT and CD36 null MASMC (Fig. 6B).
35  As shown previously (Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006), NO-stimulated
                                                      101

    cGMP levels in WT cells were inhibited by exogenous TSP1. This activity of TSP1 does not
    require CD36, however, because the cGMP response was also completely inhibited by TSP1
    in CD36 null MASMC (Fig. 6B). Notably, basal cGMP levels were similar in WT and
     CD36 null cells, suggesting that the previously reported effects of endogenous TSP1 on
 5  basal cGMP levels in vascular cells (Isenberg et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 102:13141
     13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006) do not require CD36.
     CD47 ligation inhibits NO responses
             The explant data in Fig. 3 suggested that CD47 could mediate the CD36
    independent regulation of NO signaling by TSP1. To further examine the role of CD47, we
10  tested two CD47-binding sequences identified in the C-terminal domain (CBD) of TSP1
     (Gao et al., JBiol Chem 271:21-24, 1996). Peptides containing the first (4N1-1, Fig. 7A) or
     second VVM motifs from this domain (7N3, Fig. 7B) inhibited NO-stimulated endothelial
    cell adhesion on type I collagen. Inhibition by peptide 7N3 was dose dependent and
    maximal at 10 piM. Specificity was confirmed using a control peptide in which the first
15  VVM motif was substituted by GGM (p4N1G, RFYGGMWK; SEQ ID NO: 15), which at
     10 piM did not significantly inhibit NO-stimulated adhesion.
             Although the VVM peptides clearly bind to CD47 (Gao et al., JBiol Chem 271:21
    24, 1996; Frazier et al., JBiol Chem 274:8554-8560, 1999), crystal structures of
    recombinant C-terminal regions of TSP1 and TSP2 have raised doubts about the exposure of
20  the VVM motifs in native TSP1 (Kvansakul et al., Embo J23:1223-1233, 2004; Carlson et
    al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 12:910-914, 2005). Based on a crystal structure for this domain of
    the paralog TSP2 (Carlson et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 12:910-914, 2005), the third type 2
    repeat, the Ca-binding repeats, and the G module fold together to form the C-terminal
    globular domain of TSP1. A recombinant construct containing these elements of TSP1
25   (E3CaG1, Fig. 2B) at > 0.4 nM inhibited NO-driven but not basal HASMC adhesion to
    collagen (Fig 8A). Recombinant G module (CBD), which is also documented to interact
    with CD47 and to signal through that receptor (McDonald et al., Biochemistry 42:1000 1
     10011, 2003), was slightly less active but also dose-dependently inhibited NO-stimulated
    HASMC adhesion on type I collagen but not basal adhesion on the same substrate (Fig. 8A).
30   CBD also inhibited NO-stimulated HASMC proliferation, but required much higher
    concentrations to reach basal levels (Fig. 8B). Consistent with their effects on NO
     stimulated adhesion, CBD and E3CaG1 were equipotent dose-dependent inhibitors of NO
     stimulated cGMP levels in HASMC (Fig. 8C, 8D). E3CaG1 also potently inhibited NO
     driven cGMP production in HUVEC, demonstrating that this function of CD47 is conserved
35  in both endothelial and VSMC (Fig. 8E)

              Because E3CaG1 also contains an integrin binding site, we used two CD47
     antibodies to independently verify that CD47 ligation is sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated
    responses (Fig. 9). B6H12 inhibits CD47-dependent endothelial and T cell chemotaxis, avJ 3
    integrin activation, and calcium mobilization (Gao et al., JBiol Chem 271:21-24, 1996; Gao

    but stimulates CD47-dependent activation of a40 1 integrin (Barazi et al., JBiol Chem
    277:42859-42866, 2002). B6H12 was a dose-dependent inhibitor of NO-stimulated
    HUVEC adhesion on type I collagen (Fig. 9A). B6H12 also prevented stimulation of
10  HUVEC proliferation by sustained exposure to NO (Fig. 9B). CIKml is a nonblocking
     CD47 antibody for integrin function (Barazi et al., JBiol Chem 277:42859-42866, 2002)
     and an activating antibody for T cell receptor signaling (Li et al., JImmunol 166:2427-2436,
    2001). CIKml treatment also inhibited HUVEC adhesion and proliferation (Fig. 9C, 9D).
    Non-specific isotype-matched antibodies did not block the NO-driven increase in cell
15   adhesion or proliferation (Fig. 9A - 9D). The activities of these antibodies confirm that
     CD47 ligation is sufficient to inhibit NO signaling.
     CD47 is necessaryfor inhibition of NO responses by TSP] in vascular cells.
              In contrast to CD36, CD47 is required for inhibition of NO-stimulated MASMC
    responses by exogenous TSP1 (Fig. 10). Exogenous TSP1 had no effect on NO-stimulated
20   adhesion of CD47 null MASMC at concentrations up to 2.2 nM and only moderately
    inhibited the response at 22 nM (Fig. 10A). Similarly, TSP1 did not inhibit NO-stimulated
    proliferation in CD47 null MASMC (Fig. lOB). Remarkably, recombinant type 1 repeats of
    TSP1 that bind to CD36 also failed to inhibit NO-stimulated proliferation in CD47 null cells
     (Fig. 10C), and a CD36-binding peptide analog derived from the second type 1 repeat failed
25  to inhibit NO-stimulated adhesion in CD47 null cells (Fig. 1OD).
              The inability of CD47 null cells to respond to exogenous TSP1 extended to NO
     stimulated cGMP signaling. As reported previously for TSP1 null endothelial cells and
    MASMC (Isenberg et al., Proc NatlAcad Sci USA 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al.,
     CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006), basal cGMP levels were significantly higher in CD47
30  null MASMC (Fig. 10E). Addition of NO elevated these levels, but exogenous TSP1 did
    not significantly inhibit the basal or NO-stimulated cGMP levels in the CD47 null MASMC
     (Fig. 10E). Similar results were obtained using recombinant type 1 repeats and peptide 907,
    which bind to CD36 and inhibited NO-stimulated cGMP responses in WT but not in CD47
    null MASMC (Fig. 1OF, lOG). NO-stimulated cGMP was slightly inhibited by a CD36
35  binding peptide from the 3 type 1 repeat (p907, Fig. bOG).

              To further define the roles of CD36 and CD47, we compared cGMP responses of
    VSMC from the respective null mice to peptide and recombinant protein ligands (Fig. 11).
    Two CD47 ligands (CBD and peptide 7N3) and a CD36 ligand (peptide 907) did not
     significantly inhibit NO-stimulated cGMP accumulation in CD47 null MASMC (Fig. 11 A).
 5  In contrast, CBD and its derived peptide 7N3 completely inhibited NO-stimulated cGMP in
     CD36 null MASMC (Fig. 1IB). Therefore, CD47 is necessary for inhibition of cGMP
     signaling and downstream SMC responses to NO by either CD36 or CD47 ligands, but
     CD36 is not necessary for inhibition by a CD47 ligand. Remarkably, peptide 907, a
    reported CD36 ligand (Dawson et al., Mol Pharmacol55:332-338, 1999), partially inhibited
10  NO-stimulated cGMP in CD36 null cells (Fig. 1IB). The mechanism by which peptide 907
    inhibits NO-induced cGMP formation in the CD36 null cells is unknown, but possibilities
    include binding to another member of the class B scavenger receptor family expressed on
    these cells (Crombie and Silverstein, JBiol Chem 273:4855-4863, 1998) or interaction of
    peptide 907 with CD47.
15            Although the inability of TSP1 to inhibit angiogenesis in corneas of CD36 null mice
    is strong evidence that CD36 is a necessary TSP1 receptor in the context of FGF2-driven
    corneal angiogenesis (Jimenez et al., Nat Med 6:41-48, 2000), ligation of several other
    TSP1 receptors is sufficient to inhibit angiogenic responses in vitro and in vivo. TSP1
     derived peptides or recombinant regions of TSP 1 that bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans
20   (Iruela-Arispe et al., Circulation 100:1423-1431, 1999; Vogel et al., J Cell Biochem 53:74
     84, 1993) or CD47 (Kanda et al., Exp Cell Res 252:262-272, 1999) each have such
     activities. However, these previous studies did not determine whether the respective
    receptors are necessary for the activity of native TSP1. The present data provides genetic
     evidence that CD47 but not CD36 is essential the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 in the
25  context of NO, a key mediator of signaling for several major angiogenic factors (Ziche et
    al., J Clin Invest 99:2625-2634, 1997; Fukumura et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:2604
    2609, 2001; Namkoong et al., Exp Mol Med 37:588-600, 2005; Cooke, Atheroscler Suppl
    4:53-60, 2003). CD47-binding recombinant domains of TSP1 lacking its CD36 binding sites
     are sufficient to inhibit cGMP signaling downstream of NO. Although CD36 is not
30  necessary and, therefore, does not mediate this activity of TSP1, we found that various
     CD36 ligands are sufficient to inhibit the same NO-stimulated responses, provided that
     CD47 is expressed. This activity, however, is independent of the ability of a given CD36
     ligand to block TSP1 interaction with CD36.
              The CD36-binding type 1 repeats of TSP1 were previously shown to inhibit NO
35   signaling, but we now demonstrate that this activity also requires CD47. This should not be
                                                       104

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    interpreted to show that CD47 is a receptor for the type 1 repeat sequences, although that
    can not be excluded. Our data indicates that, in the context of NO-stimulation, CD47 is the
     essential inhibitory receptor for TSP 1, and CD36 ligation is sufficient to mediate a
     secondary inhibitory response that also requires CD47 (Fig. 12). Basal cGMP levels are
 5   elevated in CD47 null and in TSP1 null vascular cells, but this is not observed in CD36 null
    MASMC. Therefore, the ability of endogenous TSP1 to suppress basal cGMP levels also
    requires CD47 but not CD36.
              In vitro studies have shown that CD36 mediates only a subset of endothelial cell
    interactions with TSP1 (Magnetto et al., Cell Biochem Funct 16:211-221, 1998; Calzada et
10  al., JBiol Chem 279:41734-41743, 2004), and CD36 now appears to be necessary only for a
     subset of the anti-angiogenic activities of TSP1. Antibody blockade of CD36 prevented the
    inhibitory effects of TSP1 and peptides derived from its type 1 repeats on FGF2-driven
     endothelial cell migration (Dawson et al., J Cell Biol 138:707-717, 1997), and exogenous
    TSP1 could not inhibit FGF2-driven angiogenesis in the mouse cornea in the absence of
15   CD36 (Jimenez et al., Nat Med 6:41-48, 2000). However, we now show that CD36
     antibodies that block TSP1 inhibition in the cornea can themselves inhibit angiogenic
    responses stimulated by NO. The basis for a differential requirement of CD36 in FGF2
    versus NO-dependent angiogenic responses remains to be determined. However, it is
    notable that NO signaling is required for angiogenic responses to VEGF but not to FGF2
20   (Fukumura et al.,    ProcNatl Acad Sci U S A 98:2604-2609, 2001; Shizukuda et al.,    Circ Res
     85:247-256, 1999; Papapetropoulos et al., J Clin Invest 100:3131-3139, 1997).
              Low to moderate concentrations of NO (<1 to 30 nM) elicit pro-survival and pro
     angiogenic responses from vascular cells (Isenberg et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci USA
     102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al.,    CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006; Cooke,
25  AtherosclerSuppl 4:53-60, 2003). Bi-directional crosstalk with TSP1 potently regulates this
     angiogenic activity of NO (Isenberg et al.,  ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 102:13141-13146,
    2005; Ridnour et al., ProcNati Acad Sci US A 102:13147-13152, 2005). Consistent with
    previous publications, we find that CD36 ligation is sufficient to block pro-angiogenic
    responses, but only if CD47 is also expressed. As with exogenous TSP1, CD36 antibodies
30   effectively block several NO-stimulated vascular cell responses including cell proliferation,
     adhesion, migration, and cGMP accumulation. However, agonist (SMCD) and antagonist
     antibody (FA6 152 and 185 1G2) ligation of CD36 equally inhibited NO signaling. These
    results contrast with previous reports that have classified these CD36 antibodies on the basis
     of their abilities to mimic or block the inhibitory activity of TSP1. Therefore, we propose
                                                        105

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
    that both agonist and antagonist antibodies elicit signaling through CD36 that is independent
     of TSP1.
             Activation of CD47 has been described to inhibit (Wang et al., J Cell Biol 147:389
    400, 1999) or stimulate ERK phosphorylation (Wilson et al., JImmunol 163:3621-3628,
 5   1999). We found that NO-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in endothelial cells was
    inhibited by exogenous TSP1 (Ridnour et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 102:13147-13152,
    2005), consistent with the evidence that CD47 mediates inhibition of angiogenic responses
    by TSP1. This was supported by the ability of CD47 antibodies, peptide ligands, and two
     forms of the C-terminal CD47-binding domain of TSP1 to inhibit NO-stimulated vascular
10  cell responses. Moreover, neither NO-stimulated VSMC adhesion on collagen nor NO
     stimulated cGMP levels could be blocked by pretreatment with TSP1 in CD47 null cells.
    Taken together these results demonstrate that either CD36 or CD47 ligation is sufficient to
    mimic TSP1 inhibition of NO-driven pro-angiogenic cell responses, but only CD47
     expression is absolutely required for TSP1 inhibition of these angiogenic responses.
15            Given that CD47 is necessary for some responses to both CD36 and CD47 ligands,
    we must reconsider the roles of these two receptors in vascular cell responses to TSP1. It
    has been generally assumed that if TSP1 binds to a receptor and genetic evidence shows that
    receptor to be necessary for a specific response, one can infer that TSP1 binds to the same
    receptor to mediate that response. This may not be valid logic for a protein such as TSP1
20  that engages multiple receptors on vascular cells. Convergent signaling downstream of
     CD36 and CD47 may mediate a single response even if TSP1 binds only to CD47.
    Alternatively, the cross talk between CD36 and CD47 may occur at the plasma membrane
     (Fig. 12). CD36 and CD47 both associate with lipid rafts and with certain integrins that
    themselves bind TSP1 (Barazi et al., JBiol Chem 277:42859-42866, 2002; McDonald et al.,
25  JBiol Chem 279:17301-17311, 2004; Zeng et al., JBiol Chem 278:45931-45936, 2003).
    The physical proximity of CD47, its associated integrins, or one of its cytoplasmic binding
    partners may be necessary for signal transduction through CD36. Such cooperative
     signaling by a CD36/0 1 integrin/CD47 complex has been proposed for another CD36 ligand,
     P-amyloid (Bamberger et al., JNeurosci 23:2665-2674, 2003) and may explain the recent
30   evidence that p 1integrins are also necessary for some inhibitory responses of vascular cell
    to TSP1 (Short et al., J Cell Biol 168:643-653, 2005).
             Together, these considerations suggest that multiprotein complexes containing two
     or more TSP1 receptors could mediate its actions on vascular cells. Further, since other TSP
     family members bind to different subsets of these receptors, the potential exists for finely
                                                       106

        Example 2: Thrombospondin-1 limits ischemic tissue survival by inhibiting nitric
 5                       oxide-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation
              NO is a key signaling molecule in ischemia. NO stimulates vascular smooth muscle
    cell (VSMC) relaxation to increase blood flow and tissue perfusion. Low dose NO also has
    pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. Consistent with these activities, elevating
    NO levels increases tissue survival in situations of ischemic insult.
10            This example demonstrates that TSP1 antagonizes NO signals to regulate the
     actin/myosin cytoskeleton and contraction of VSMC in vitro. Endogenous TSP1 modulates
     acute effects of NO in vivo on tissue perfusion and blood oxygen levels in healthy muscle
     and in ischemic tissues following surgery. Furthermore, soft tissue survival in ischemic
    myocutaneous flaps is increased in the absence of endogenous TSP1, and this negative
15   effect of endogenous TSP1 upon tissue survival is NO dependent. At least portions of this
     example were also published in Isenberg et al., Blood First Edition Paper, prepublished
     online November 2, 2006; DOI 10.11 82/blood-2006-08-041368 (Blood, 109(5):1945-1952,

20  Methods
              Animals: C57/B16 wild type (WT) and TSP1 null mice were housed in a pathogen
     free environment and had ad libitum access to filtered water and standard rat chow.
    Handling and care of animals was in compliance with the guidelines established by the
    Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes
25   of Health.
              Cells and Reagents: Aortic-derived VSMCs were isolated from WT and TSP1 null
    mice as previously described (Napoli et al., Proc NatlAcad Sci USA 102:17202-17206,
    2005) and cultured in smooth muscle growth medium. HAVSMC (Cambrex, Walkersville,
    MD) were maintained in smooth muscle cell growth medium supplemented with the
30  manufacturer's additives (SM-GM, Cambrex) and 2% FCS in 5% CO 2 at 370 C. Cells were
    utilized within passages 4-9. Monomeric type I collagen was obtained from Inamed
     (Fremont, CA). L-NAME and ISDN were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). LiPc
    crystals were prepared as previously described (Krishna et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
     99:2216-2221, 2002; Hammond et al., PlastReconstr Surg 91:316-321, 1993). DEA/NO
35   and DETA/NO were kindly provided by Dr. Larry Keefer (National Cancer Institute,
                                                      107

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    Frederick). TSP1 was prepared from human platelets obtained from the NIH blood bank as
    previously described (Knox et al., Microsurgery 17:425-427, 1996).
                Actin Cytoskeleton Staining: VSMC were grown on glass well slides (Lab-Tek,
    Nunc) under standard growth conditions. Cells were incubated at 37'C for 1 hour in serum
 5   and additive deficient growth medium and the indicated treatment agents, after which the
    media was removed and the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4,
    Fisher Scientific) for 15 minutes at room temperature. After washing with DPBS, cells were
    permeabilized for 5 minutes in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then blocked in M199E/2%
    BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were stained for F-actin with 1 unit/200 p1
10  medium/1% BSA of Oregon Green 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Slides were imaged
    using an Olympus IX70 microscope and photographed at constant exposure and gain. In
     other experiments VSMC were plated on 24-well culture plates (Nunc, Denmark) in smooth
    muscle growth medium (50,000 cells/well) and weaned from serum and additives over 24
    hours. Cell treatment was performed with the indicated agents in plain medium with 0.1%
15  BSA for 5 minutes. Wells were processed as described above. Following staining with
    phalloidin cells were incubated in methanol for 30 minutes, samples aliquoted to 96-well
    black plates and fluorescence read at 520 nm (excitation 495 nm). Data was normalized to
    total protein. Results represent the mean ± SD of at least three separate experiments.
                3D Matrix ContractionAssay: Type I collagen gel (3 mg/ml) with loX M199
20   (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) at a 10:1 ratio of collagen to medium was prepared, pH balanced
    with NaOH and seeded with either HAVSMC or VSMC harvested from aortic segments
     from C57B16 WT or TSP1 null mice (50,000 cells in 75 l of gel/well) and aliquoted to 96
    well plates (Nunc, Denmark). Plates were incubated for 12 h 370 C and 5% CO 2 allowing
     for gelation and cell spreading, gently released from the well walls and incubated in serum
25   and additive deficient growth medium with 0. 1% BSA in the presence of the indicated
    treatment agents for 10 h. Contraction was determined by measuring the diameter in
    perpendicular planes (x, y) of each disk, an average obtained and surface area calculated as
     (d/2) 2ir. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results represent the mean ± SD of at
     least three separate experiments.
30              Myosin light chainphosphorylation:VSMC were plated at 90% confluence and
    grown in smooth muscle growth media containing 2% FBS overnight. To stimulate MLC
    phosphorylation, sphingosine-1 -phosphate (SIP; Biomol International, Plymouth, PA) was
     added at a final concentration of 100 nM. The nitric oxide donor DEA/NO was added at a
     final concentration of 10 tM. For TSP1 pretreatment, cells were incubated with 2.2 nM
35  TSP1 before addition of SIP or DEA/NO. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS

     and lysed immediately in IX SDS sample buffer containing 10 pig/mL leupeptin, 10 pig/mL
     aprotinin, 1 mM Na3 VO 4 , and 40 mM NaF. Lysates prepared in the SDS sample buffer
     described above were electrophoresed in 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE gels and transferred to
    PVDF membranes prior to immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against myosin
 5   light chain-2 (MLC) and phospho-MLC2 (Ti 8/S 19, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
    MA).
              FlapModel: WT and TSP1 null mice were matched for sex and age. Under
    isoflurane inhalation anesthesia 1x2 cm random myocutaneous flaps were raised. Where
    indicated, animals received either L-NAME (0.5 mg/ml) or ISDN (1 mg/ml) ad libitum in
10   drinking water during the post-operative period. On postoperative day 7, the animals were
     again anesthetized with inhalation isoflurane and flaps evaluated. Viable and necrotic areas
     of the flaps were determined by color, refill, eschar, and the pin-prick test. Outlines of
    viable and nonviable areas were traced using transparent film and the area of flap necrosis
    versus total flap area determined as described (Yu et al., ProcNatlAcad Sci USA
15   102:10999-11004, 2005).
              Histology. Sections of excised wounds were cut parallel to the long axis of each flap
    including the entire length of the tissue sample, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde,
    paraffin embedded and sectioned at a thickness of 5 min.     Sections were then stained with
    hematoxylin and eosin (H + E) according to standard procedures. Review of each slide was
20  performed by an independent pathologist blinded to the origin of each tissue slide.
              Immunohistochemistry: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on 5 Dim
    thick paraffin-embedded tissues sections from flaps harvested at 4 and 72 hrs. Sections
    were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohol (100%, 95 % and 70%).
     Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval solution in a pressure cooker containing 1.5
25   liters of antigen retrieval solution, pH 6.1 (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) for 10 min.,
    cooled down in the same solution for 20 minutes at room temperature, and then washed with
    PBS IX. Block activity of endogenous peroxidase and secondary antibody were performed
    using EnVision plus System-HRP (DAB) anti-mouse (Dako Corporation), 5 and 30 minutes
    respectively at room temperature. A blocking step was performed using Protein Block
30   Serum-Free (Dako Corporation) for 10 minutes. The TSP1 primary antibody (clone A6.1,
    NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) was applied for 1 hr at room temperature and the working
     dilution was 1:25. The peroxidase reaction was developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine
    chromogen solution (Dako Corporation) for 5 min. As negative control we used slides that
     excluded the primary antibody. Only cytoplasmic and extracellular matrix

    immunoreactivity was considered positive for TSP1. Inflammatory cells were considered as
     an internal positive control.
               Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI Imaging: MRI images were acquired
    using a Bruker Biospin 4.7 T scanner and isoflurane anesthesia. Muscle tissue scanned was
 5   at rest, so alterations in oxygenation reflected changes in perfusion rather than in oxygen
    consumption (Krishna et al., Ilar J42:209-218, 2001; Watterson et al., Cell Signal 17:289
    298, 2005). MR measurements were started after the mouse's body temperature reached 37
      C. Prior to the experiments, gradient echo based T, sequence was used to determine the
    target slice location. A series of T2* weighted gradient echo blood oxygenation level
10   dependent (BOLD) image data sets at transverse to the midpoint of the femur were
    repeatedly acquired for 30 min to monitor temporal changes in blood oxygenation and blood
     flow. DEA/NO (100 nmol/g body weight) was injected with saline via the rectal cannula 5.0
    min after starting the scan. Imaging parameters used were: TR = 450 ms, Flip angle = 45,
    Nex = 1, slice thickness = 2 mm, matrix size = 64 x 64, total imaging time for the series was
15  29 min.
               Implantationof LiPc crystals: WT or TSP1 null mice matched for age and sex were
     anesthetized by administering 1.5-2% isoflurane in medical air (flow rate was 700 mL/min).
    The fur of the back was removed by shaving and depilatory cream. A portion of LiPc
    crystals (5-10 mg) was suspended with an appropriate volume (10-20 gL) of corn oil and
20  kneaded until a slurry paste was obtained (Hammond et al., PlastReconstr Surg 91:316
     321, 1993). Then, the LiPc slurry was placed in the 2-3 mm tip of a 20-gauge injection
    needle. The needle was injected into the desired region of the animal, and the LiPc crystals
    were pushed out using a smooth-fitting piston. The average weight of the LiPc injected was
     0.8 mg. Implantation of LiPc crystal slurry was done to the following three locations on the
25  back of the mouse - to the distal and proximal regions of the flap and to an area 1 cm from
    the flap base.
               EPR measurement of tissue oxygen in vivo: Dorsal modified McFarlane flaps
    bearing LiPc crystals implanted 7 days prior were created as described above and EPR
    measurements carried out at 3, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hr post-surgical procedure. Again mice
30  were anesthetized with 1.5-2% isoflurane in medical air flow (700 mL/min) and placed in a
     special mouse holder. The surface coil (7.3 mm i.d.) was placed on the region where the
    LiPc crystal was implanted. The EPR signal was measured by CW EPR at 700 MHz using a
     single loop surface coil resonator (7.3 mm i.d.). The 300 MHz CW EPR system, which was
    previously described (Hammond et al., PlastReconstr Surg 91:316-321, 1993; Sorbera and
35  Bayes, Drugs of the Future 30:1081-1086, 2005), was equipped with a 700 MHz bridge and

     scan rate = 0.5 Gauss/sec, and time constant = 0.003 sec, field modulation frequency = 13.5
    kHz. The microwave power (0.08-0.3 mW) and field modulation width (0.01-0.2 Gauss)
 5  were adjusted to avoid saturation and line broadening. The core body temperature (sampled
    continuously from the rectum) was monitored by a nonmagnetic probe (FISO technologies
    Inc., Quebec, CANADA), and was kept at 37 ± 0.5'C using a hot air heater during EPR
    measurements. Tissue pO2 values were calculated from a calibration curve obtained
    previously for each batch of LiPc crystals used in the experiment.
10            Statistics: All experiments were replicated at least three times. Results are presented

     TSP] inhibits NO-induced actin disassembly in VSMC
              Actin cytoskeletal reorganization and actin-myosin interactions control the
    contractile state of VSMC (Isenberg et al., Matrix Biol 24:110-123, 2005). Treatment of
    human aortic VSMC (HAVSMC) with exogenous NO resulted in dissolution of organized
20   actin bundles and decreased total cellular F-actin (Fig. 13A, 13B, 13E). Based on inhibition
     of actin disassembly by NO in the presence of 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one,
    this activity of NO requires soluble guanylyl cyclase. TSP1 blocks NO-induced changes in
     actin organization in endothelial cells (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:13141
     13146, 2005). Similarly, addition of TSP1 alone to VSMC slightly increased F-actin levels
25   (Fig. 13C, 13E) and completely prevented actin disassembly by NO (Fig. 13D, 13E).
     Sphingosine 1-phosphate (SIP), a lipid known to regulate VSMC contractility (reviewed in
    Afeworki et al., Free Radic Biol Med 25:72-78, 1998), also increased F-actin, which was
     disassembled upon addition of NO (Fig. 13E and Fig. 19E-19F). Addition of TSP1 further
    increased F-actin in the presence of SIP. However, disassembly of SIP-induced F actin by
30  NO was attenuated in the presence of TSP1 (Fig. 13E and Fig. 19G-19H).
    Myosin light chain-2 (MLC) dephosphorylation induced by NO is blocked by TSP]
              MLC phosphorylation is a critical step in VSMC contraction (Isenberg et al., Matrix
    Biol 24:110-123, 2005). SIP inhibits MLC phosphatase via Rho and thereby increases
    phosphorylation of MLC (Matsumoto et al., Magn Reson Med 54:1530-1535, 2005). This

    response to SIP was reversed by exogenous NO (Fig. 13F). Concurrent treatment with
     exogenous TSP1 prevented this activity of NO and partially restored MLC phosphorylation.
    Exogenous and endogenous TSP] inhibit NO-stimulated VSMC relaxation
              Blood flow is controlled by vascular resistance, which depends upon blood vessel
 5   diameter regulated by contraction and relaxation of VSMC. The effects of TSP1 on NO
    mediated changes in F actin and MLC phosphorylation suggested that TSP1 may regulate
    VSMC contraction. Using a well characterized assay of VSMC contraction in 3D type I
    collagen gels (Roberts et al., J Tissue Cult Methods 16:217-222, 1994), HAVSMC
     demonstrated significant contraction in response to either 10% FCS or 100 nM SiP, a
10  component of serum and stimulator of VSMC contraction (Li S et al., J Vasc Res 40:378
     388, 2003) (Fig. 14A-14B). Treatment with a slow releasing NO donor (DETA/NO)
    inhibited gel contraction by both agonists, but addition of 2.2 nM TSP1 completely
     abrogated this inhibitory activity of NO (Fig. 14A-14B). Conversely, aortic-derived TSP1
    null murine VSMC demonstrated reduced contraction to SIP compared to WT cells,
15   although both were relaxed by NO (Fig. 14C). A positive effect of TSP1 on the contractile
    response to SIP was confirmed by adding exogenous TSP1, which increased the contractile
    response of TSP1 null cells to SIP (Fig. 14D). A more modest enhancement of SIP-induced
    contraction was observed for WT cells. The direct effect of TSP1 on SIP-induced
    contraction may result from cGMP-dependent activation of the MLC phosphatase
20   (Matsumoto et al., Magn Reson Med 54:1530-1535, 2005), which should be higher in TSP1
    null cells due to their elevated basal cGMP levels (Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes
     71(4):785-793, 2006).
    Endogenous TSP] limits NO-stimulated soft tissueperfusion
              A major physiological function of NO is to control tissue perfusion by regulating
25  vascular smooth muscle tone (Ignarro, JPhysiolPharmacol53:503-514, 2002). To
    investigate whether endogenous TSP1 regulates this vascular response to exogenous NO, we
    used BOLD MRI (Ueda et al., JSurg Res 10:200-204, 1998; Krishna et al., IlarJ42:209
    218, 2001) for real-time imaging of blood oxygenation in WT and TSP1 null C57B16 mice
     (Fig. 15). Intrarectal injection of the rapidly releasing NO donor diethylamine NONOate
30   (DEA/NO,    t 1 /2 ~2 minutes) induced rapid focal increases in the BOLD MRI signal in lateral
    thigh sections of both TSPI null and WT mice (Fig. 15A, B). Notably, the magnitude of this
     signal in areas showing a positive response to NO was significantly greater in TSPI null
    mice (25%) than in WT mice (15%, Fig. 15C, p <0.05). Furthermore, the rate of signal
    change was greater in the null animals versus WT. In contrast, areas with decreased BOLD
                                                         112

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     signal did not differ significantly (TSP null -14%, WT -11%). Therefore, endogenous TSP1
     significantly limits the acute vasodilator response to NO in skeletal muscle tissue.
     Endogenous TSP] Limits Random Myocutaneous Flap Survival
              Tissue survival following a fixed ischemic insult requires restoration of regional
 5   perfusion and blood flow. We used a well characterized model of soft tissue ischemic
     responses (Noseworthy et al., Semin MusculoskeletRadiol 7:307-315, 2003) to assess the
     role of endogenous TSP1 in tissue survival under ischemic stress. WT and TSP1 null mice
     matched for sex and age underwent random dorsal modified McFarlane flap elevation and
     suturing under inhalation anesthesia (supplemental Fig. 14). Changes in flap perfusion and
10   viability were noticeable immediately after surgical elevation in WT animals, with the distal
     aspects of flaps appearing pale and hypo-perfused. On post-operative day 7, flaps in WT
     animals demonstrated 38% less tissue survival compared to flaps in TSP1 null animals (59
     6% versus 96 ± 2%, p < 0.05, Fig. 16A, D). Flap survival was not gender dependent. Older
     WT mice (> 6 months) tended to experience greater tissue loss compared to younger
15   animals (10 - 16 weeks), but this difference was not statistically significant.
     Post-operativeinhibition of nitricoxide synthase (NOS) increasestissue necrosis
              To address the role of NO signaling in random soft tissue flap survival, WT and
     TSP1 null mice were given ad libitum access to drinking water containing L-NAME (0.5
     mg/ml) during the post-operative period. In WT animals, NOS inhibition by L-NAME
20   significantly decreased mean flap survival (46 ± 2%) compared to flaps in animals that did
     not receive L-NAME (Fig. 16B, D, p <0.05). In contrast, NOS inhibition by L-NAME
     moderately increased tissue necrosis in TSP1 null animals (82 ± 4% survival) but did not
     reach statistical significance.
     An NO donor decreases tissue necrosis in random soft tissueflaps in WT mice
25            To increase tissue NO levels, animals were provided isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, 1
     mg/ml) in their drinking water during the post-operative period. Flap survival was increased
     significantly in the treated WT animals compared to untreated WT animals (79 ± 4% vs. 59
     ± 6%, p <0.05, Fig. 16C, 16D). ISDN treatment resulted in essentially complete flap
     survival in TSP1 null animals compared to untreated animals, but the increase was not
30   significant (100 ± 3% vs. 97 ± 2%). Therefore, exogenous NO can partially overcome the
     inhibitory effect of endogenous TSP 1 on ischemic tissue survival.
    TSP] nullflaps exhibit increasedgranulationtissue
              Histologic examination of excised flaps demonstrated that granulation tissue
     formation at the necrotic tissue sites and the interface between viable and necrotic tissue was
35   significantly higher in the flaps of time-matched TSP1 null versus WT mice (Fig. 17A,
                                                        113

WO 2008/060785                                                                  PCT/US2007/080647
     17B). Consistent with the known anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1, the granulation tissue in
    the TSP1 null flaps contained a larger number of newly formed capillaries when compared
    to that of the WT mice (Fig. 17C, 17D).
              Immunohistochemical staining with a TSP1 antibody of sections from wild type
 5  McFarlane flaps at 4 hours post-operatively showed diffuse TSP1 staining including the
     epidermis, subcutaneous blood vessels, extracellular matrix, striated muscle and
    inflammatory cells (Fig. 17E). By 72 hours, TSP1 staining had localized to the margins of
    the striated muscle cell component of the flap and surrounding extracellular matrix (Fig.
     17F). Differences in the degree of TSP1 staining in proximal versus distal regions of flaps
10  could not be discerned.
    Endogenous TSP] acutely and chronically alterspost-surgery tissuepO2
              Recovery and maintenance of tissue oxygenation are critical for tissue survival
     following ischemic injury. EPR was used to determine tissue pO2, sensed by line broadening
     of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) crystals preimplanted in proximal and distal regions of
15   dorsal flaps and in a unit of soft tissue adjacent to the flap (control, Fig. 18A). Pre-operative
    tissue P 0 2 values obtained 1 hour prior to flap elevation were essentially identical in WT
     and TSP1 null mice (Fig. 18B). Immediately following surgery, tissue P 0 2 in the control
     area adjacent to the flap increased rapidly in WT mice, presumably due to acute
    inflammatory responses associated with the adjacent injury. The elevated P 0 2 in the control
20   area was maintained for at least 3 days. Remarkably, this acute response was initially absent
    in the control areas of TSP1 null mice, but their P0 2 gradually increased to match the WT
    control P 0 2 at 48 hours.
              As expected, P 0 2 values within the flaps decreased immediately following surgery
    to similar levels for TSP1 null and WT mice (Fig. 18B). In WT animals, tissue pO2 in the
25   distal and proximal flap areas remained low 3 days following surgery, being 4.5 ± 1.6 and
    4.2 ± 1.7 mm Hg, respectively. Conversely, pO2 values in distal and proximal area of flaps
     for TSP1 null mice showed a progressive recovery of tissue PO2 with time. The PO2 values
     of distal and proximal flap areas in TSP1 null animals 3 days after surgery were
     significantly greater (11.1 ± 3.4 and 17.5 ± 3.2 mm Hg, respectively, p < 0.05) than PO2
30   found in WT flaps.
              TSP1 potently antagonizes the adhesive, migratory and proliferative responses of
     endothelial and VSMC to NO by limiting cGMP signaling (Isenberg et al., ProcNatl Acad
    Sci U S A 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006).
    The same NO signaling pathway is important for maintaining vascular patency through
35  relaxing VSMC, which causes blood vessel dilation and increased tissue perfusion (Yamada
                                                         114

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
    et al., JMagn Reson 154:287-297, 2002). We now identify TSP1 as a potent physiological
     antagonist of NO signaling to regulate VSMC cytoskeletal and contractile responses in vitro
     and tissue perfusion in vivo.
              Calcium binding to calmodulin activates MLC kinase to phosphorylate MLC.
 5  Phosphorylated MLC stimulates interactions between myosin and actin, cross-bridge
    cycling, and ultimately cell contraction. Si P induces VSMC contraction via several SI P
    receptors, which in turn signal to inhibit MLC phosphatase activity (Matsumoto et al., Magn
    Reson Med 54:1530-1535, 2005). NO/cGMP signaling relaxes VSMC via cGMP dependent
    protein kinase, which enhances intracellular calcium [Ca 2 ]; sequestration and also regulates
10  MLC phosphatase (Matsumoto et al., Magn Reson Med 54:1530-1535, 2005). Consistent
    with these signaling pathways, MLC phosphorylation in VSMC is increased by SIP, and
    NO blocks this response. Significantly, TSP1 prevents the NO-driven dephosphorylation of
    MLC in SIP-treated VSMC. The activity of TSP1 to antagonize NO-driven actin
     disassembly is also important because F-actin-containing cytoskeletal stress fibers interact
15  with the contractile protein myosin to mediate VSMC contraction. These results predicted
    that TSP1 should block NO-driven relaxation of VSMC, which was confirmed using in vitro
     assays of VSMC contraction mediated by serum or SIP in 3D collagen gels.
              The differential effects of an NO donor on blood flow in WT and TSP1 null mice
    confirm the physiological significance of TSPl as an antagonist of NO-mediated
20  vasorelaxation. In resting animals, the changes in blood oxygen levels detected by BOLD
    MRI directly reflect alterations in tissue blood flow. Using this technique, we found that
     endogenous TSP 1 limits the increase in peripheral blood oxygenation following an acute
    NO challenge. The speed of this response supports our hypothesis that preexisting
     endogenous TSP1 limits soft tissue perfusion by inhibiting NO-mediated vasorelaxation.
25            Results from the ischemic flap model indicate a clinically important role for TSP1
    in modulating tissue perfusion. Tissue survival following a fixed ischemic insult was
    markedly increased in the absence of endogenous TSP1. Importantly, the negative effect of
     endogenous TSP1 on tissue survival could be partially overcome by providing exogenous
    NO. Recent clinical reports suggest immediate relevance of the above findings to human
30   disease. Increased TSP1 expression in ischemic lower extremities correlates with limb
     amputation rates (Favier et al., JPathol207:358-366, 2005). Additionally, TSPi has been
     ascribed a role in myocardial infarct size, though the mechanism behind its effects remains
     debated (Sezaki et al., Exp Biol Med (Maywood)230:621-630, 2005; Frangogiannis et al.,
     Circulation 111:2935-2942, 2005). In the absence of TSPI, inflammatory responses were
35  increased and associated with greater infarct remodeling, although total infarct size did not
                                                       115

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     differ between control and TSP1 null animals (Frangogiannis et al., Circulation 111:2935
    2942, 2005). Furthermore, TSP1 expression was rapidly induced following reperfusion after
    ischemic injury in the kidney, and exogenous TSP1 induced proximal tubule injury (Thakar
    et al., J Clin Invest 115:3451-3459, 2005). These reports provide evidence that TSP1
 5  influences tissue preservation under ischemic conditions through different, though not
    mutually exclusive, mechanisms.
              Conversely, NO clearly plays an important role in modulating tissue ischemia
     secondary to vascular insufficiency. In both random flap and ischemia/reperfusion models,
     exogenous NO and L-arginine, the substrate of NOS, are tissue protective (van Nieuw
10  Amerongen and van Hinsbergh, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 21:300-311, 2001).
    Treatment with L-arginine in the drinking water and autologous bone marrow cells
    increased perfusion in a hind-limb ischemia model (Watterson et al., Cell Signal 17:289
    298, 2005). Non-selectively inhibiting NOS using L-NAME decreased tissue preservation
    under ischemic conditions (Bolz et al., Circulation 107:3081-3087, 2003), and eNOS null
15  mice have defective recovery of blood flow following hindlimb ischemia (Coussin et al.,
     Circ Res 91:151-157, 2002). These results are consistent with the effects of L-NAME to
     decrease and ISDN to increase tissue survival in our ischemic flap model.
              LiPc EPR provides a complementary assessment of p0 2 in ischemic soft tissue flaps
     (Krishna et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci U S A 99:2216-2221, 2002; Hammond et al., Plast
20  Reconstr Surg 91:316-321, 1993). At two anatomic locations, tissue PO2 after 3 days was
    greater in TSP1 null flaps as compared to WT flaps. These results correlate with the
     significantly greater tissue survival under fixed ischemic stress in TSP1 null flaps. Limiting
    NO production by inhibiting NOS increased whereas supplementing NO using ISDN
     decreased tissue necrosis only in WT mice, further supporting a role for TSP1 in limiting the
25   alteration of tissue perfusion by NO.
              The immediate divergence in PO2 following surgery in areas adjacent to null versus
    WT flaps indicates that endogenous TSP1 also acutely regulates tissue PO2 under ischemic
     stress. This positive effect of endogenous TSP1 on pO2 can not be directly explained by the
    negative effect of TSP1 on vasodilation reported here. However, the delayed increase in
30  TSP1 null mice might result from the reported defect in monocyte recruitment noted
    previously in excisional skin wounds (Mullen et al., Circ Res 88:145-151, 2001). In this
    case, the immediate increase in PO2 in the WT mice could result from inflammatory
    cytokine release by macrophages recruited to the area adjacent to the flap in a TSP 1
     dependent manner.

              The present studies extend the known activity of TSP1 as a potent antagonist of
    NO-induced vascular cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration (Isenberg et al., ProcNati
    Acad Sci USA 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71(4):785-793,
    2006) to modulation of NO-dependent VSMC contractility and MLC phosphorylation.
 5  Endogenous TSP1 thereby directly limits NO-mediated increases in perfusion of healthy
     and injured tissues. Thus, TSP1 plays a broader role in regulating vascular physiology than
    previously known, and drugs developed to mimic the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1
     (Khiabani and Kerrigan, PlastReconstr Surg 110:169-176, 2002) may likewise have anti
    vasodilator activities that impact their clinical use. Conversely, inhibiting TSP1 expression
10   or function could improve clinical outcome for surgical procedures that result in ischemic
     stress.
      Example 3: Blockade of Thrombospondin-1-CD47 Interactions Prevents Necrosis of
                                       Full Thickness Skin Grafts
15            Skin graft survival and healing requires rapid restoration of blood flow to the
     avascular graft. Failure or delay in the process of graft vascularization is a significant source
     of morbidity and mortality. One of the primary regulators of blood flow and vessel growth is
    nitric oxide (NO). The secreted protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP 1) limits NO-stimulated
    blood flow and growth and composite tissue survival to ischemia. We herein demonstrate a
20  role for TSP1 in regulating full thickness skin graft survival.
              Full thickness skin grafts (FTSG) consistently fail in wild type C57 Bl/6 mice but
     survive in mice lacking TSP1 or its receptor CD47. Ablation of the TSP1 receptor CD36,
    however, did not improve FTSG survival. Remarkably, wild type FTSG survived on TSP 1
25  null or CD47 null mice, indicating that TSP1 expression in the wound bed is the primary
     determinant of graft survival. FTSG survival in wild type mice could be moderately
    improved by increasing NO flux, but graft survival was increased significantly through
     antibody blocking of TSPl binding to CD47 or antisense morpholino oligonucleotide
     suppression of CD47.
30            TSP1 through CD47 limits skin graft survival. Blocking TSP1 binding or
     suppressing CD47 expression drastically increased graft survival. The therapeutic
     applications of this approach could include burn patients and the broader group of people
    requiring grafts or tissue flaps for closure and reconstruction of complex wounds of diverse
     etiologies.

    Introduction
              Burn injuries constitute a major source of mortality and morbidity (Wong &
    Munster, Surg Clin North Am 73(2):363-371, 1993). Among people aged 5 - 29 years,
    burns rank among the top 15 causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide (International
 5  Association for the Study of Insurance Economics. World fire statistics: information bulletin
     of the world fire statistics. Geneva: The Geneva Association, 2003). Over 2 million burn
    injuries are reported each year in the United States alone (Finkelstein & Miller, Incidence
     and Economic Burden of Injuries in the United States. New York: Oxford University Press,
    2006; Quinney et al., JBurn Care Rehabil 23(5):305-310, 2002). Survival from major burns
10  has improved over the last century as a result of improved management of the
    cardiovascular collapse attendant to major burns and aggressive management of the burn
    wound and subsequent infection (Atiyeh et al., World JSurg 29(2):131-148, 2005; Nolan,
    Ann Plast Surg 7(3):243-251, 1981; Shuck, Clin PlastSurg 1(4):577-590, 1974). As a
     source of damaged and/or dead tissue, the burn injury requires aggressive debridement
15   (Makepeace, Burns Incl Therm Inj 9(3):153-157, 1983; Quinby et al., Intensive CareMed
     7(2):71-6, 1981). However, this invariably creates massive open wounds, often with vital
    underlying structures exposed. Increasingly, aggressive surgical approaches with early
    tangential excision and wound closure are being applied (Shuck, Surg Clin North Am
     50(6):1325-1335, 1970; Oshima et al., Hum Cell 15(3):118-128, 2002). Such therapeutic
20   approaches represent a significant change in burn wound care and have lead to improvement
    in mortality rates of burn victims at a substantially lower cost (Zhu et al., Burns 29(1):65
     72, 2003). These approaches can also decrease the severity of hypertrophic scarring, joint
    contractures and stiffness, and promote faster rehabilitation (Pruitt, CurrProbl Surg
     16(5):1-95, 1979). Irrespective of any other consideration, early healing is paramount for
25  good aesthetic and functional recovery. Disruption of epidermal-mesenchymal
    communication due to a delay in epithelialization increases the frequency of developing
     fibrotic conditions such as scar hypertrophy and contractures. Autografts from uninjured
     skin remain the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients (Boyce & Warden, Am J
    Surg 183(4):445-456, 2002). Skin grafting is also a primary approach to the management of
30  complex and non-healing wounds of diverse etiology (Snyder, Clin Dermatol23(4):388
     395, 2005; Hierner et al., Clin Dermatol 23(4):343-352, 2005).
              Maximizing skin graft survival and take is paramount to successful wound
    reconstruction. Numerous techniques and agents have been utilized in an attempt to
    maximize skin graft survival. These include special dressings and splints to prevent
35  movement of the skin graft-wound bed interface (Danikas et al., PlastReconstr Surg
                                                       118

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
     11 1(1):489, 2003). Growth factors and clotting related products, such as fibrin, have been
    placed in the interface between the skin graft and the wound bed (Sierra et al., JBiomed
    Mater Res 59(1):1-11, 2002). Yet substantial complications in healing remain, with
     significant numbers of patients requiring additional intervention due to skin graft failure and
 5   loss, and non-healing of burn wounds (Subrahmanyam, Burns 25(8):729-731, 1999; Unal et
    al., Ann Plast Surg 55(1):102-106, 2005; McCampbell et al., JBurn Care Rehabil
    23(3):157-166, 2002; Desai et al., JBurn CareRehabil 12(5):482-484, 1991). Interventions
    to date have not addressed a fundamental problem, and determinant, of skin graft survival,
    namely the degree of vascularity within the wound bed. Following wounding, vascularity
10  can increase by two primary methods: (1) the development of new blood vessels from an
     existing vascular network, a process termed angiogenesis; or (2) remodeling and recruitment
     of existing blood vessels within the wound bed. Control of angiogenesis represents a
    balance between factors that stimulate the process and inhibit the process. Recruitment and
    remodeling of an existing vascular network is an effect of vascular dilatation and alterations
15   of regional perfusion.
              Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) was the first identified endogenous inhibitor of
     angiogenesis (Good et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 87(17):6624-6628, 1990; Taraboletti et
    al., J Cell Biol 111(2):765-772, 1990). TSP1, a major secretory product of activated
    platelets, is over expressed in wound beds (Reed et al., JHistochem Cytochem.
20  41(10):1467-1477, 1993). TSP1 inhibits angiogenesis by modulating proliferation and
    migration of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (Lawler, CurrOpin Cell
    Biol 12(5):634-640, 2000; Isenberg et al., Matrix Biol 24(2):110-123, 2005). Conversely,
    tumor driven angiogenesis has been found in several major cancers to be associated with
     decreased expression and production of TSP1 (Lawler & Detmar, Int JBiochem Cell Biol
25   36(6):1038-1045, 2004). Recently, the TSP1 status of endothelial progenitor cells has been
     linked to their ability to enhance angiogenic responses (Ii et al., Circ Res. 98(5):697-704
    2006).
              The bioactive gas nitric oxide (NO) is a major effector of vessel dilation and
     angiogenesis that was first identified as endothelial derived relaxing factor (EDRF) (Lawler,
30   Curr Opin Cell Biol 12(5):634-640, 2000). NO functions in both paracrine and autocrine
     fashions to regulate a number of cell responses that occur on rather different time scales.
    NO regulates VSMC contractility and in so doing controls blood pressure and, by altering
    the caliber of resistance vessels, acutely regulates tissue perfusion (Isenberg, Microsurgery
    24(5):385-391, 2004; Bolz et al., Circulation. 107(24):3081-3087, 2003). NO also
35  modulates a number of processes that, in toto, contribute to the healthy status of the
                                                       119

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
    cardiovascular system over an individual's lifetime (McAllister & Laughlin, Essays
    Biochem. 42:119-131 2006; Rush et al., Can JAppl Physiol. 30(4):442-474, 2005).
              Recently we reported that picomolar concentrations of TSP1 can effectively block
    the growth- and motility-promoting activities NO in endothelial and VSMC and that this
 5  inhibitory signal requires the TSP1 receptor CD47 (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci US
    A 102(37):13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006).
    Furthermore, endogenous TSP1 limits the vasodilator activity of NO, and thereby limits
    tissue survival under ischemic conditions by blocking NO-dependent restoration of vascular
    perfusion (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2). In the absence of TSP1, NO-driven
10   signaling is enhanced, increasing tissue oxygenation. As a result, tissue necrosis in ischemic
     dorsal skin flaps is virtually eliminated (Isenberg et al., Circ Res. Feb. 9, 2007). We now
    present evidence that TSP1 is limiting for full thickness skin graft (FTSG) survival. We
     further report that expression of TSP1 and its receptor CD47 within the wound bed, but not
    the skin graft, are major determinants of graft survival. Relevant to therapeutic applications,
15  we show that functional blockade of TSP 1 signaling at the wound bed-graft interface is
     sufficient to allow complete survival of FTSG.
    Materials and Methods
              Animals. C57BL/6 wild type, TSP 1-null, CD47-null, and CD36-null mice were
20  housed and maintained in a pathogen free environment and had ad libitum access to filtered
    water and standard rat chow. Handling and care of animals was in compliance with the
    guidelines established by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer
    Institute, National Institutes of Health and of Washington University.
              Reagents and cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cambrex,
25  Walkersville, MD) were maintained in endothelial cell growth medium (EM-GM)
     supplemented with the manufacturer's additives (Cambrex) and 2% fetal calf serum (FCS)
    in 5% CO 2 at 370 C. Cells were utilized within passages 4-9. Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), an
     exogenous NO donor, and N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a competitive
    inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A
30   CD47 targeting morpholino oligonucleotide (5'
     CGTCACAGGCAGGACCCACTGCCCA3'; SEQ ID NO: 21) and control mismatch
    morpholino were purchased from GeneTools (Philomath, Oregon). The CD47 targeting
    morpholino recognized a sequence conserved between the murine and human mRNAs. A rat
    monoclonal antibody to murine CD47, Ab 301, was prepared as described (Lindberg et al., J
35   Cell Biol 123(2):485-496, 1993). An isotype matched IgG2a control antibody was
                                                        120

    purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An antibody to CD47, B6H12,
    was purified by protein G affinity chromatography (Pierce) from conditioned media of the
    respective hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection).
             Full thickness skin graft model: Wild type, TSP1 null, CD47 null and CD36 null
 5  mice were matched for sex and age. Anesthesia was induced by and maintained with
    inhalation isoflurane. Body temperature was maintained at 37 'C with a heating pad during
    the procedure. The dorsal surface was clipped of hair and depilated with Nair@. The skin
    was then cleansed with surgical soap and alcohol and the animals draped. Using sterile
    technique, a 1 x 1 cm FTSG incorporating the panniculus carnosus, subcutaneous tissues
10   and skin were raised. Graft dimensions were marked on the animal skin surface with the aid
     of a template to insure consistency in dimension. Grafts were in the midline of the animal
     and secured with four interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures. Sutures were so placed as to include the
     fascia of the dorsal musculature to provide increased immobilization of grafts to the
    underlying wound bed. Animals were awakened and returned to individual cages and
15   allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Trauma to FTSG was not encountered during
    the post-operative interval since grafts were located in the dorsal midline over the mid
    thoracic area and each animal was housed individually following surgery. On postoperative
     day three or seven, the animals were again anesthetized with inhalation isoflurane and skin
    graft survival evaluated.
20            Treatment groups and protocols. The groups of animals utilized and the
    treatments received as indicated either at the time of skin grafting and/or during the post
     operative interval are summarized in Fig. 21. Animals treated with ISDN (1 mg/ml) or L
    NAME (0.5 mg/ml) had ad libitum access to drinking water containing the given
    concentrations of agents during the post-operative interval. Animals treated with a CD47
25  monoclonal antibody (Ab clone 301) or an isotype matched control antibody (Ig2a)
    underwent injection of 40 jig delivered as 10 tl of a 4 mg/ml stock in 100 tl of PBS with
     equal volumes injected between the wound bed and graft prior to suturing the graft in place.
    Animals treated with a CD47 morpholino oligonucleotide underwent injection of the FTSG
     and wound bed with 10 gmol/L in 250 W of PBS with 125g1 volumes injected in the graft
30   and wound bed, respectively prior to suturing the graft in place.
             Estimation of survival area in FTSG. The necrotic areas of the FTSG were
     determined by color, refill, eschar, and the pin-prick test. The outlines of viable and
    nonviable areas were traced using transparent film, and the area of necrosis cut from the
    template and the area of skin graft necrosis versus total skin graft area determined by
35  comparison of the original template weight to the weight of the cut template utilizing the

    method described by Ueda (Ueda et al., JSurg Res 80(2):200-204, 1998).. Skin graft
     survival area was presented as the ration of graft survival on post-operative day three or
     seven divided by the original graft area multiplied by 100%. Additionally, digital images
    were then acquired using an Olympus C5500 digital camera at a fixed distance (20 cm
 5  perpendicular to the animal) under standard room lighting with autoflash and macro settings
     engaged and uploaded for image analysis of tissue survival with a standard software
    program (Image-Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Animals were
     euthanized and skin grafts and wound beds excised, fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and
    processed for routine histology. Independent review of representative histologic sections
10   from FTSG was performed to assess levels of tissue necrosis and inflammation providing
     another assessment of FTSG survival.
             Laser Doppler analysis of tissue perfusion. Animals were secured supine as
     dictated by the anatomic area analyzed. Core temperature was monitored via rectal probe
     and maintained at 370 C by a heated stage. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% isoflurane
15   and a 50:50 mixture of room air and oxygen. The following scanner parameters were
     employed using a Moor Instruments LDI2-2k imager: scan area - 1.6 x 2.5 cm; scan speed
    4 ms/pixel, scan time 1 min 54 sec, override distance 25 cm. Measurement of the flux of
    blood was determined by the formula flux = blood x area-' x time-. Pre-operative baseline
    perfusion data was obtained, FTSG elevated and sutured in place and post-operative
20   scanning initiated at the indicated time points.
             Western analysis of CD47. HUVEC were plated in 12-well culture plates (5 x 104
    cells/well) (Nunc, Denmark) in full growth medium and treated over 48 h with indicated
     doses of CD47 and control morpholino. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS
     and lysed immediately in 1X SDS sample buffer containing 10 Dg/mL leupeptin, 10 D g/mL
25   aprotinin, 1 mM Na3 VO 4 , and 40 mM NaF. Lysates prepared in the SDS sample buffer
     described above were electrophoresed in 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE gels and transferred to
    PVDF membranes prior to immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to CD47 (clone
    B6H 12, Lab Visions, Inc, Fremont, CA). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with a
    monoclonal antibody against P-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
30           Histology: Full thickness skin grafts and graft wound beds were excised, fixed in
     10% buffered formaldehyde, paraffin embedded and sectioned at a thickness of 5 gim.
     Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H + E) according to standard
    procedures. Review of each slide was performed by an independent pathologist blinded to
    the origin of each tissue slide.

              Wound bed vascular index. Skin graft wound beds were assessed at indicated
    time points (72 hours or 7 days post-operatively) for visible alterations in vascularity under
     5x magnification. An arbitrary though strictly applied definition of countable vessels was
     employed to highlight both individual vessels and vascular ramifications. In any given
 5  vascular plexus visible by 5x magnification a vessel was defined as that segment traversing
    two branches. Visible vessels without ramifications and branches were counted once.
    Treatment status and genetic background of tissue images was not known by the reviewer.
    Results are expressed as vessels per cm 2 .
              Mitochondrial viability assay. Mitochondrial viability of full thickness skin grafts
10   as a correlate of tissue viability was assessed by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt to water
    insoluble colored formazan crystals through mitochondrial metabolism. Full thickness skin
    grafts from wild type and TSP1 null mice were weighed and incubated in 3 ml PBS
     supplemented 1:10 with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT,
    Promega) for 3 h in the dark at 370 C. Samples were removed, washed with distilled water
15   and blotted dry. The formazan salt was extracted in 3 ml of 2-propranol for 6 h in the dark at
     370 C. Absorbance for 200 gl aliquots was determined at 450 nm on a microplate reader.
     Samples were dried at 900 C overnight and weighed again. Results were expressed as
     absorbance normalized to tissue dry weight.
              Statistics: Results are presented as the mean ± SD of a total of 196 animals
20   distributed as indicated above including the described treatments groups and controls (see

    values as indicated.
25  Results
              Thrombospondin-1 limits FTSG survival. FTSG in both wild type (Fig. 22A,
    22B) and CD36 null animals (Fig. 22F, G) demonstrated 95 ± 6 and 77 ± 6 % necrosis
    respectively. In contrast FTSG in TSP1 (Fig. 23A, 23B) and CD47 null animals (Fig. 22F,
    22G) showed almost complete survival (95 ± 4 and 96 ± 12% respectively). Analysis of
30  wound bed vascularity at 72 hours post skin grafting demonstrated significantly increased
    numbers of visible vessels in those wounds beds lacking endogenous TSP1 compared to
    wild type (Fig. 22C, 22D). Similarly, wound bed analysis at 72 hours of CD47 null mice
     demonstrated increased vascularity compared to CD36 null wound beds. Consistent with
    increased graft survival and take, mitochondrial viability was found to be significantly
35  greater in TSP1 null FTSG at 24 and 72 hours post-operatively compared to wild type (Fig.
                                                        123

    22E) Laser Doppler analysis of FTSG survival was also performed in a series of wild type
     and TSP1-null animals on post-operative days 5 and 10 (Fig. 23A, 23B). In the absence of
    TSP1 significant perfusion was found at both time points compared to wild type FTSG
     supporting clinical and histologic analysis of graft survival.
 5           Modulation of FTSG survival through nitric oxide regulation. Wild type FTSG
     survival increased significantly (62 ± 8%) on supplementation of the drinking water post
     operatively with the NO releasing drug ISDN (Fig. 24A, 24B). FTSG survival, already
     approaching 100%, in TSP1-null grafts was not substantially altered by ISDN. Conversely,
    inhibiting endogenous NO synthesis through L-NAME administration in the drinking water
10   during the post-operative interval decreased TSP1-null graft survival (58 ± 6%) (Fig. 24C,
    24D).
             Wound bed TSP1 or CD47 are limiting for FTSG survival. To examine the role
    in graft survival of TSP1 expression in the graft versus the wound bed, wild type skin grafts
    were transplanted onto TSP1-null wound beds (recipients), and TSP1-null grafts were
15  transplanted onto wild type wounds. At 72 hours post-operatively, survival was significantly
    greater in wild type FTSG placed on TSP1-null wound beds (97 ± 6%) (Fig. 25A, 25B).
    Remarkably, TSP1-null FTSG placed on wild type wound beds all underwent significant
    necrosis at 72 hours (37 ± 5%), as did a series of control wild type FTSG placed on wild
    type wound beds. These findings again correlated with wound bed vascularity. TSP1-null
20  wound beds demonstrated increased vascularity despite the presence of wild type FTSG,
    whereas wild type wound beds showed minimal vascularity despite the presence of TSP1
    null FTSG. In other experiments FTSG from wild type animals were transplanted to CD47
    null wound beds and, as on TSP 1-null wound beds, demonstrated dramatically increased
    graft survival (92 ± 8%) (Fig. 26A). In contrast CD47-null FTSG placed on wild type
25  wounds demonstrated nearly total necrosis, similar to TSP 1-null grafts transplanted to wild
    type wounds. Wild type FTSG on CD36-null wound beds all showed substantial necrosis
     and not unexpectedly, CD36-null grafts on wild type wounds experienced substantial
    necrosis (85 ± 4 and 74 ± 3% respectively) (Fig. 26B). Analysis of wound bed vascularity at
     7 days post grafting found significantly increased vascularity in both TSP1-null (47 ± 7) and
30   CD47-null (68 ± 14) wound beds regardless of the genotype of the skin graft applied (Fig.
    26C) as compared to wild type (21 ± 10) and CD3 6-null (20 ± 7) wound beds. Interestingly,
     extension of the post-operative interval at which wound bed analysis was performed from
     72 hours to 7 days greatly enhanced the mean vessel count in TSP 1-null but not wild type
    wound beds (see Fig. 22D versus Fig. 26C).

              Suppression of CD47 expression is sufficient to increase FTSG survival. Wild
    type FTSG and wound beds were treated with either a CD47 antisense morpholino
     oligonucleotide or a mismatched control morpholino (10 jM) at the time of graft elevation
     (10 gmol/L in 250 tl of PBS with 125g1 volumes injected in the graft and wound bed,
 5  respectively). All grafts treated with the CD47 morpholino demonstrated dramatically
    increased survival (79 ± 5%) and were comparable to results obtained in TSP1 null and
     CD47 null animals (Fig. 27A, 27B). Conversely, control morpholino treated grafts and
    grafts treated with delivery vehicle alone demonstrated significant graft necrosis and loss.
    Effective dose-dependent suppression of CD47 with the same morpholino was demonstrated
10  in HUVEC (Fig. 27C) and previously in VSMC (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 2007; Example 4).
    Effective tissue suppression of CD47 through local delivery via syringe injection has also
    been demonstrated (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007). Control morpholino
    treated endothelial cells (and VSMC, see (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 2007; Example 4) did not
     show suppression of CD47. H & E staining of morpholino treated wild type FTSG found
15   essentially normal tissue architecture without evidence of necrosis and increased vessel
     density (Fig. 27D). These histologic findings were paralleled in TSP1 null skin grafts
     (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2) Conversely, untreated wild type FTSG showed
     loss of epidermis and hair follicles with ulceration, necrosis of dermal collagen,
    inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased vascular density (Fig. 27E).
20            CD47 blockade increases survival of FTSG. A monoclonal antibody to murine
     CD47, Ab clone 301, (40 jig delivered as 10 tl of a 4 mg/ml stock in 100 tl of PBS
     delivered as 50 tl to the skin graft and wound bed, respectively) when infiltrated into wild
    type FTSG and wound beds increased survival of wild type FTSG from only 5 ± 2% to 82
    4% (Fig. 28A, 28B). FTSG and wound beds infiltrated with vehicle (PBS) or an isotype
25  matched control IgG2a antibody showed no increase in graft survival (8 ± 5%). FTSG
    transplanted from TSP 1-null animals were placed upon wild type wound beds pretreated
    with monoclonal antibody (Ab 301) and demonstrated increased graft survival (95 ± 4%) as
    compared to grafts placed on untreated wound beds (Fig. 28B). H & E of antibody treated
    wild type FTSG demonstrated normal architecture without ulceration and minimal
30  inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 28C).
    Discussion
              Skin consists of two tissue layers - a keratinized epidermis and a deeper layer of
     dermis. Appendages including hair and glands are derived from the epidermis and project
35  into the dermis. Skin serves as a protective barrier, and any break in it must be rapidly and

     fibroblasts and capillaries invade the clot and form granulation tissue while the epithelial
     edges migrate to cover the wound surface. The current standard for wound closure following
     excision of a deep partial or full thickness burn is the application of a skin graft. Recently
 5   skin substitutes and engineered products have been employed with some success to
    minimize the need for skin grafts (Wood et al., Burns 32(4):395-401, 2006; Atiyeh et al.,
    Burns 31(8):944-956, 2005). These methods of wound closure all require rapid restoration
     of perfusion to the grafted elements. Restoration of tissue perfusion is important to wound
    healing and tissue survival under a range of conditions (Hochberg et al., Int JMicrocirc
10   Clin Exp. 14(1-2):67-72, 1994; Israeli et al., Ann PlastSurg. 32(3):305-309, 1994). L
     arginine, the precursor for NO production, has been reported to be useful in resuscitation of
    burn wound patients (Yan et al., Burns. 33(2):179-184, 2007) and in increasing survival and
    re-perfusion of ischemic tissues (Komorowska-Timek et al. Br JPlastSurg. 57(4):317-325,
    2004; Cordeiro et al., PlastReconstr Surg. 100(5):1227-1233, 1997). NO has also been
15   shown to enhance ischemic tissue survival (Gatti et al., Ann PlastSurg. 16(6):521-526,
     1986; Gribbe et al., JPlastReconstr Aesthet Surg. 60(3):287-293, 2007; Topp et al., JAm
     Coll Surg. 201(4):628-639, 2005).
              The present report demonstrates for the first time a critical role for TSP1 in
    controlling survival of FTSG by limiting the beneficial effects of NO. In the absence of
20   endogenous TSP 1, or its receptor CD47, significant increases in survival of FTSG were
     achieved. These findings parallel our recent reports that TSP1 regulates soft tissue survival
    under ischemic conditions in a NO-dependent manner (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example
    2; and Isenberg et al., Circ Res 2007; Example 4). Random myocutaneous flaps were found
    to experience more than 50% increase in survival in the absence of endogenous TSP1
25   (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2). Random myocutaneous flaps, though ischemic,
    retain partial perfusion through vascular networks at the base of the flap. In contrast FTSG
    initially lack any vascular connections. Therefore, FTSG survival requires rapid angiogenic
     and vascular remodeling responses. Analysis of wound beds at 72 hours and 7 days post
     operatively in TSP1-null animals suggests that the absence of TSP1 results in rapid vascular
30  remodeling of the wound bed. These findings are consistent with similar data obtained in
    wound beds of random ischemic myocutaneous flaps, and in muscle units of hind limbs
     following proximal vascular ligation (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2; and Isenberg
    et al., Circ Res 2007; Example 4), supporting a role for TSP1 in regulating vascular
    remodeling to hypoxic/ischemic stress in addition to its known long term regulation of
35   angiogenesis (Bornstein et al., Int JBiochem Cell Biol 36(6):1115-1125, 2004).

              CD47 is the critical target for controlling vascular responses to ischemia. This
    concept is clearly demonstrated here and in our earlier study in less severe models of tissue
    ischemia (Isenberg et al., Circ Res. Feb 9 2007). Our results also demonstrate that the
    previously-identified anti-angiogenic TSP1 receptor, CD36, plays a minimal role in limiting
 5  FTSG survival. These results support our findings that ischemic composite tissue survival is
     also not limited by CD36 (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007). These in vivo
     findings complement our recent findings that CD47 is necessary for TSP1 abrogation of the
    pro-angiogenic effects of NO in vitro, and that direct ligation of CD47 effectively blocks
    NO signaling (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem 281(36):26069-26080, 2006). Importantly for
10  therapeutic application of these findings, antibody blockade of CD47 or morpholino
     suppression of CD47 increases survival of FTSG (and composite tissue units; Isenberg et
    al., Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007). Ab 301, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes murine
     CD47, and a CD47 morpholino, when infiltrated into wild type FTSG and wound beds
    promoted tissue survival to nearly the same extent as genetic deletion of CD47 or TSP1.
15  Both the morpholino and Ab 301 are target specific (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 2007;
    Example 4), yet the ability to completely block or suppress CD47 with these agents in vivo
    is likely incomplete. Although we cannot determine the precise extent to which CD47 and
     CD47 signaling responses are neutralized by these agents, our results in animals clearly
    confirm they are efficacious within the specific models employed.
20            Our data show that it is the presence or absence of TSP1 and CD47 in the wound
    bed, not the graft, which ultimately dictates graft survival. Vascular index data from wild
    type wound beds treated with a morpholino or Ab 301 and wound beds from CD47- and
    TSP1 -null animals found substantial increases in visible vasculature suggesting that the
    TSP1 -CD47 interaction limits acute vascular remodeling. Additional support for the
25  primacy of the wound bed in determining FTSG survival was provided by cross-allograft
    transplant experiments. Regardless of the TSP1 or CD47 status of the FTSG itself, improved
    graft survival occurred if the wound bed was either inherently TSP1- or CD47-null or
    rendered effectively so through antibody ligation of or morpholino suppression of CD47.
    Preliminary experiments with autograft transplants of wild type FTSG to wild type wound
30  beds in which only the wound beds were treated with a CD47 monoclonal antibody or CD47
    morpholino similarly demonstrated increased survival of skin grafts. Therefore, skin graft
     survival is primarily determined by the status of the wound bed vis a vis functioning CD47
     and TSP 1. Interfering with TSP1 -CD47 interactions or decreasing the total number of such
    interactions through temporary receptor suppression is sufficient to significantly enhance
                                                         127

     skin graft survival and take. Since all animals were extensively backcrossed to the same
     C57B1/6 background, T cell rejection would not be expected to be a complicating factor.
              TSP1 has also been found to be important in tumor growth and metastasis
     (Bornstein et al., Int JBiochem Cell Biol 36(6):1115-1125, 2004; Adams, Int JBiochem
 5   Cell Biol; 29(6):861-865, 1997). Over-expression of TSP1 in cancer cells has been found to
     slow their growth and spread (Weinstat-Saslow et al., CancerRes; 54(24):6504-6511,
     1994). Though TSP1 -null animal do not demonstrate increased rates of tumor formation,
    crossing TSP1-null mice with tumor prone mice such as p53 nulls, enhances tumor
    progression (Lawler et al., Am JPathol;159(5):1949-5196, 2001; Ren et al., Biochim
10  Biophys Acta; 1765(2):178-188, 2006). Targeting either TSP1 or CD47 for the brief
    intervals employed in the present studies would not be expected to increase rates of tumor
     formation in the treated tissues. Also, the protocols of this study were based on local
    regional application of the therapeutic agents, making systemic side effects less likely. It
    remains to be seen if targeting TSP1 and CD47 for extended lengths of time increases tumor
15   formation rates.
              The clinical implications of the data presented herein are substantial. Skin graft
    necrosis and loss is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Though we found
     a modest increase in FTSG survival could be obtained by elevating tissue NO through orally
     administered ISDN, systemic delivery of such agents may have potential untoward side
20   effects. More importantly, we demonstrate that engagement of CD47 with monoclonal
     antibody or suppression using a specific morpholino can dramatically improve FTSG
     survival. This again illustrates the underlying principle that TSP 1-CD47 interactions limit
    the responsive range of NO whether it is produced endogenously or administered
     exogenously as a therapeutic agent. Because the morpholino we used was designed to
25  hybridize with a sequence conserved in the human CD47 and was demonstrated to suppress
     CD47 in cultured human cells (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2), this morpholino can
    be further tested for immediate clinical applications in improving skin graft survival and
     outcomes from burn wounds. A number of function modifying antibodies that recognize
    human CD47 are currently available and, with proper humanization, could also warrant
30  clinical testing. Importantly, both therapeutic agents can be delivered directly to the wound
    bed, minimizing potential systemic side effects. Additionally, these therapeutic agents may
    have a role in the treatment of burns irrespective of skin grafting. A major impediment to
    proper healing of burn wounds is their initial ischemic state (Pruitt, CurrProbl Surg.
     16(5):1-95, 1979; Foley, Surg Clin North Am. 50(6):1201-1210, 1970). Given the
35   demonstrated benefit of anti-CD47 therapy on ischemic tissue survival, direct application to
                                                        128

    the ischemic burn wound may promote increased perfusion of the burn wound and thereby
     limit the extent of tissue death, decreasing the overall magnitude, duration and need for

               Example 4: Increasing Survival of Ischemic Tissue by Targeting CD47
               This example demonstrates that CD47 ligation by TSP1 represents the means by
    which endogenous TSP1 tempers vascular responses to NO and in so doing alters tissue
     oxygen in the face of both ischemia and NO challenge. In wild type VSMC, NO-induced
10  changes in cytoskeleton organization and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation were
    blocked by TSP1. In contrast, TSP1 did not block these NO-induced changes in CD47 null
    VSMC. Further, random flaps subject to acute ischemia demonstrated minimal tissue
    necrosis in CD47 null transgenic mice. In contradistinction, random flaps in CD36 null
     animals demonstrated a degree of tissue necrosis comparable and even slightly greater than
15  that obtained in wild type animals. Further, treatment of random flaps with a CD47
    blocking antibody or an inhibitory peptide in both wild type and CD36 null animals was
     sufficient to recapitulate tissue survival results obtained in TSP1 null flaps. CD47 null mice
     subject to partial hindlimb ischemia also showed less tissue necrosis and increased skeletal
    muscle mitochondrial viability as compared to wild type and CD36 null animals. Increases
20  in tissue survival in CD47 null flaps correlated to increases in tissue oxygen as measured by
    EPR oximetry. These findings suggest that TSP1 is a global regulator of tissue perfusion
    through a CD47 dependent pathway and suggests novel therapeutic modalities for tissue
    preservation in the presence of ischemia.
               Thrombospondin-1 (TSP 1) limits the angiogenic and vasodilator activities of NO.
25  This activity of TSP1 can be beneficial in some disease states, but endogenous TSP1 limits
    recovery of tissue perfusion following fixed ischemic injury in dorsal skin flaps in mice.
    Using mice lacking the TSP1 receptors CD36 or CD47, we show in this example that CD47
    is the necessary receptor for limiting NO-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation and
    tissue survival following ischemic injury in skin flaps and hindlimbs. We further show that
30  blocking CD47 or TSP1 using monoclonal antibodies and decreasing CD47 expression
    using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide are effective therapeutic approaches to
     dramatically increase survival of soft tissue subjected to fixed ischemia. These treatments
     facilitate rapid vascular remodeling to restore tissue perfusion and increase skin and muscle
    viability. Thus, limiting CD47-dependent antagonism of NO-mediated vasodilation and
                                                         129

    vascular remodeling is a promising therapeutic modality to preserve tissues subject to
    ischemic stress.
              Tissue viability requires continuous perfusion, which in turn depends on vascular
    tone, sufficient intravascular volume, and adequate blood oxygenation (Drexler Prog
 5   CardiovascDis. 39:287-324, 1997; Hollenberg & Cunnion, J Crit Care 9:262-280, 1994;
    Levenson et al., J CardiovascPharmacol.7(Suppl 2):S 115-120, 1985). The contractile
     status of arterial smooth muscle is the major determinant of vascular tone, with venous tone
    playing a lesser role (Segal, Microcirculation.12:33-45, 2005; Pohl et al., Acta Physiol
    Scand. 168:505-510, 2000). Underperfusion of soft tissues is the leading cause of tissue
10  necrosis and secondary delayed wound healing in surgical patients (Athanasiou et al., Eur J
     CardiothoracSurg. 26:1015-1026, 2004). The complications incurred can be substantial
     and life threatening (Raghunathan et al., J Vasc Surg. 43:1175-1182, 2006). Complications
     of inadequate tissue perfusion are multiplied in the elderly and patients with hypertension
     and diabetics due to the general vasculopathies associated with these disease processes
15   (Nowygrod et al., J Vasc Surg. 43:205-216, 2006; Niezgoda & Mewissen, Ostomy Wound
    Manage. 50:1-11; quiz 12, 2004).
              Current therapies to improve vascular perfusion combine surgical vessel
    manipulation/bypass with vasodilators that relax VSMC (Hankey et al., JAMA. 295:547
     553, 2006; Antignani, Curr Vasc Pharmacol.1:205-216, 2003). The bioactive gas NO is a
20  potent vasodilator (Furchgott & Vanhoutte, FasebJ. 3:2007-2018, 1989) that activates
     soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). The increased cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein
    kinases and thereby decreases VSMC sensitivity to intracellular Ca , leading to relaxation
     of contractile proteins (Ignarro, JPhysiolPharmacol.53:503-514, 2002; Arnal et al., Cell
    Mol Life Sci. 55:1078-1087, 1999; Munzel et al., Herz. 22:158-172, 1997; Sauzeau et al., J
25  Biol Chem. 275:21722-21729, 2000).
              We recently reported that NO/cGMP signaling in VSMC and endothelial cells is
    potently inhibited by the secreted protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP 1) (Isenberg et al.,
     CardiovascRes. 71(4):785-793, 2006; Isenberg et al., Matrix Biol. 24:110-123, 2005;
    Ridnour et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:13147-13152, 2005). We further showed that
30   endogenous TSP1 limits the ability of NO to increase skeletal muscle perfusion and blood
     oxygen levels in vivo (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2). Following surgically
    induced acute ischemia in random dorsal skin flaps, endogenous TSP 1 also limits tissue
     survival and recovery of tissue oxygenation. Ischemic tissue survival could be improved by
    increasing NO levels using isosorbide dinitrate, but the degree of tissue necrosis in treated

    wild type mice remained higher than in TSP 1 null mice, which achieved essentially
    complete flap survival following this treatment.
             To further improve survival of ischemic stress in wild type mice, we explored
    therapeutic approaches that target the TSP1 receptors mediating its antagonism of NO
 5   signaling. Although ligation of the anti-angiogenic TSP1 receptor CD36 (Dawson et al., J
     Cell Biol. 138:707-717, 1997) by antibodies or TSP1-derived peptides is sufficient to inhibit
    NO/cGMP signaling in endothelial and VSMC (Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71(4):785
     793, 2006; Dawson et al., J Cell Biol. 138:707-717, 1997), we recently found that CD36 is
    not necessary for this activity of TSP1 (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080,
10  2006). Instead, engaging the TSP1 and SIRPa/SHPS1 receptor CD47 (Gardai et al., J
    Leukoc Biol. 79:896-903, 2006; Gao et al., JBiol Chem. 271:21-24, 1996; Wang & Frazier,
    Mol Biol Cell. 9:865-874, 1998) is necessary and sufficient for TSP1 to inhibit NO-driven
    responses in both endothelial and VSMC (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080,
    2006).
15           We now show that CD47 is also the critical TSP1 receptor that regulates vascular
    responses to NO in skin and hindlimb ischemia models. We demonstrate that CD47 null but
    not CD36 null mice are protected from necrosis due to acute ischemia. We further show
    that suppressing CD47 expression by local application of an antisense CD47 morpholino
     oligonucleotide or locally applying CD47 or TSP1 blocking antibodies dramatically reduces
20  tissue loss resulting from fixed ischemia. At least portions of this example were published
     as Isenberg et al. (Circ. Res., Feb. 9, 2007, e-pub ahead of print; 100(5):712-720, 2007).

              Estimation of survival area in flaps. The necrotic area of the flap was determined
     as described (Isenberg et al., Blood. Nov. 2, 2006). Animals were then euthanized and flaps
     excised, fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and processed for histology.
              Hindlimb ischemia. Wild type C57BL6, TSP1 null, CD47 null and CD36 null
 5  mice, age and sex matched, underwent ligation of the left external iliac and common
     femoral arteries. The right limb served as control. All animals underwent examination
     every 24 h to assess clinical ischemia based on a previously published index (Paek et al., J
     Vasc Surg. 36:172-179, 2002). At the end of 3 or 7 days animals were euthanized, and the
    tibialis anterior muscles from the right and left limbs were harvested, weighed and
10  processed for mitochondrial viability.
              Vascular index determination. Random myocutaneous flap wound beds and/or
    ischemic hindlimb vastus medialis muscle was assessed at indicated time points (72 hours or
     7 days post-operatively) for visible alterations in vascularity under 5x magnification. An
     arbitrary though strictly applied definition of countable vessels was employed to highlight
15  both individual vessels and vascular ramifications. In any given vascular plexus visible by
     5x magnification a vessel was defined as that segment traversing two branches. Visible
    vessels without ramifications and branches were counted once. Treatment status and genetic
    background of tissue images was not known by the reviewer.
              Mitochondrial viability assay: Mitochondrial viability of hindlimb muscle
20  biopsies was assessed by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt to water insoluble formazan
    through mitochondrial oxidation as described (Bonheur et al., JSurg Res. 116:55-63, 2004).
    Tibialis anterior muscle biopsies were weighed and incubated in 3 ml of PBS supplemented
     1:10 with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium stock (MTT, Promega,
    Madison, WI) for 3 h in the dark at 37 0C, washed with distilled water and blotted dry. The
25   formazan salt was extracted in 3 ml of 2-propranol for 6 hours in the dark at 37 0C.
    Absorbance for 200 gl aliquots was determined at 425 nm on a microplate reader. Muscle
     samples were dried at 90 0C and weighed again. Results were expressed as absorbance
    normalized to dry tissue weight.
              Laser Doppler imaging of hindlimb perfusion. Laser Doppler blood-flow
30  imaging was used to assess the extent of hindlimb perfusion following arterial ligation using
     a Doppler imager (Moor Instruments Inc., Wilmington, Delaware), which measures the flux
     of blood (blood x area    x time'). Body temperature was maintained at 37 0C. Mice were
     scanned immediately before and after surgery and 7 days after surgery. Equal areas of the
    control and ischemic limbs from the same anatomical region of the limbs were compared. To

    ratio between the ischemic and non-ischemic limbs.
              Histology: Sections of excised skin wounds were cut parallel to the long axis of
     each flap to include the entire length of the tissue sample, fixed in 10% buffered
 5   formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, sectioned at a thickness of 5 gm and stained with
    hematoxylin and eosin. Grading of inflammatory cell infiltrate and necrosis was also
    performed for each section. Immunohistology of morpholino and control tissue samples was
    performed as previously described with a primary monoclonal antibody to CD47 (clone
    B6H12, Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2).
10            Statistics: Statistical significance was calculated with the Student's t test or one
    way or two-way ANOVA as appropriate with a p value < 0.05 taken as significant using a
     standard software package (Origin 7, Origin Labs, Northampton, MA). All in vitro
     experiments were repeated a minimum of three times.
15                                                Results
              CD47 null mice demonstrate increased soft tissue survival of fixed ischemia.
    Dorsally located random myocutaneous McFarlane flaps in wild type mice demonstrated
     significant necrosis at 7 days (Fig 29A, 29B). In contrast, random flaps in CD47 null mice
     demonstrated minimal to no tissue necrosis to the same ischemic challenge. The response of
20   CD47 null animals to ischemia resembled that of TSP1 null mice (Isenberg et al., Blood
    2006; Example 2). In contrast, CD36 null flaps demonstrated areas of necrosis similar to,
     and in some instances greater than, wild type flaps.
              CD47 is necessary for exogenous TSP1 to limit NO-stimulated VSMC
     relaxation. FCS-driven VSMC contraction of type I collagen gels was robust in both wild
25  type and CD47 null VSMC, and exogenous NO comparably delayed contraction in both
     (Fig. 29C). As previously reported (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2), relaxation of
    pre-contracted VSMC by NO was completely inhibited by addition of exogenous TSP1 in
    wild type cells, but this response to TSP1 was absent in CD47 null VSMC (Fig. 29C).
     Similar results were found for VSMC pre-contracted using SIP (Fig. 29D). Therefore,
30   CD47 is the TSP1 receptor that mediates its inhibition of VSMC relaxation by NO.
              Antibody engagement of CD47 or sequestration of TSP1 increases ischemic
    tissue survival independent of CD36. Treatment with the function blocking anti-murine
     CD47 antibody 301 (10 l of 4 mg/ml stock in 90 l PBS) but not with a control IgG2a
    resulted in essentially complete tissue survival in wild type myocutaneous flaps (Fig. 30A,
35   30B). A similar increase in survival was observed using CD36 null mice, further indicating
                                                         134

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
    that this response is independent of CD36 (Fig. 30B). We also tested an anti-human TSP1
     antibody known to recognize an epitope that is conserved in murine TSP1 (clone A6. 1;
    Annis et al., J Thromb Haemost. 4:459-468, 2006) as a strategy to sequester endogenous
    TSP1. Tissue survival was enhanced in wild type flaps by treatment with this TSP1
 5   antibody (Fig. 30C, p < 0.05).
               Antisense knockdown of CD47 prevents TSP1 inhibition of NO-stimulated
    VSMC relaxation. Because blocking the CD47 receptor preserved ischemic tissue, we
     examined the effectiveness of temporarily reducing CD47 expression to enhance tissue
     survival. To first validate this approach in vitro, human aortic VSMC were pre-treated with
10   a CD47 morpholino oligonucleotide or a control morpholino. Western blotting showed a
     dose dependent decrease in CD47 protein following treatment with the CD47 morpholino
    but not in cells treated with the control morpholino (Fig. 3 1A). Based on these result,
    VSMC were pretreated with 10 gM of the CD47 morpholino, seeded into 3D collagen gels
     and the gel contraction measured (Fig. 31B). As in untreated cells, FCS-induced gel
15  contraction of CD47 morpholino-treated VSMC was relaxed by exogenous NO, but TSP1
    was not able to block this relaxation (Fig. 31B). Control morpholino-treated VSMC
    remained sensitive to TSP1 inhibition of NO-stimulated relaxation.
               CD47 knockdown prevents TSP1 inhibition of NO-driven cGMP accumulation.
    We further confirmed suppression of CD47 signaling by assessing cGMP levels in the
20  morpholino treated cells. Human aortic VSMC were pre-treated with the CD47 or control
    morpholinos, and cGMP accumulation in response to NO ± TSP1 determined. Knockdown
     of CD47 using the CD47 morpholino rendered the human aortic VSMC essentially blind to
    the inhibitory effects of TSP1 upon NO-driven cGMP accumulation (Fig. 31C). Conversely,
    control morpholino-treated cells retained sensitivity to inhibition of an NO-stimulated
25  cGMP flux by TSP1. Control experiments with untreated VSMC demonstrated complete
    inhibition of an NO-driven cGMP flux by exogenous TSP 1 and decreased basal and
     stimulated levels in the presence of CD47 as previously reported (Isenberg et al., JBiol
     Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006).
               CD47 knockdown increases tissue survival of ischemic myocutaneous flaps. The
30   CD47 morpholino was designed to complement a sequence in the CD47 mRNA that is
    conserved between the murine and human transcripts. Wild type C57BL6 mice undergoing
    mobilization of dorsal McFarlane flaps received either the CD47 morpholino (10 gM in 250
     gl of PBS with 125 gl volumes injected in the flap and wound bed respectively) or the
    control morpholino. To validate CD47 knockdown in vivo, immunohistochemical staining
35   of soft tissue flaps treated with the CD47 morpholino was done and demonstrated decreased
                                                        135

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    protein staining compared to untreated controls (Fig. 31D). Remarkably, wild type flaps
    treated with the CD47 morpholino showed essentially 100% survival (Fig. 31D). In
    contrast, treatment of flaps with the control morpholino resulted in necrosis comparable to
    that for untreated wild type flaps. Treatment with vehicle alone or vehicle plus delivery
 5   agent (Endoporter@, GeneTools) did not alter tissue survival. Quantification of wound bed
    vascularity showed substantial increases in visible blood vessels following CD47
    morpholino treatment relative to treatment with the control morpholino (Fig. 31 E) or
    untreated wound beds.
              CD47 null flaps demonstrate increased numbers of patent blood vessels
10   compared to wild type flaps. Histologic inspection of sections from CD36 null and CD47
    null flaps harvested 72 hours post-operatively found evidence of early ischemic necrosis in
     CD36 null flaps with, epithelial loss, hair follicle drop out and thinning and coagulation of
    the dermis (Fig. 31F, 31G). CD47 null flaps demonstrated normal cutaneous architecture
    with only a modest inflammatory cell infiltration at the inferior aspects of the flap units.
15           Endogenous TSP1 limits tissue survival under fixed hindlimb ischemia.
    Although the random dorsal flap is a useful model of ischemic injury, the limited thickness
     of murine myocutaneous tissue may facilitate diffusion of oxygen from the wound bed into
    the ischemic flap. Therefore, large composite tissue units might not obtain similar tissue
    protection in the absence of TSP1 or CD47. To better model a complex 3-dimensional
20  ischemic injury, we examined fixed ischemic insult secondary to proximal ligation of the
     external iliac and common femoral arteries in hindlimbs. Tissue survival was dramatically
    increased in the absence of TSP1 (Fig. 32A). The clinical findings in ischemic hindlimbs
    correlated with the increased muscle perfusion of TSP1 null limbs induced by an NO
    challenge (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2).
25           The clinical assessments of hindlimb survival were confirmed by quantifying
    mitochondrial viability in limb muscle using MTT reduction and normalizing to
    mitochondrial function in the untreated contralateral muscle (Fig. 32B). Mitochondrial
     function decreased to 23.5 ± 5% of control in wild type ischemic hindlimb but remained at
     58.5 ± 6% of control in TSP1 null hindlimbs (p < 0.05). Increased muscle viability was
30  consistent with increased vascular remodeling in the treated TSP1 null hindlimbs (Fig. 32C).
    These findings correlated with histologic findings of muscle cell necrosis and inflammatory
    cell invasion of wild type hindlimbs as compared to TSP1 null limbs (Fig. 32D).
              Consistent with the flap ischemia model, hindlimb ischemia was well tolerated in
     CD47 null mice as compared to wild type or CD36 nulls (Fig. 33A). Both CD47 null and
35  TSP1 null animals showed minimal to no clinical evidence of tissue necrosis. In contrast,
                                                         136

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    wild type and CD36 null hindlimbs demonstrated necrosis of skin, muscle and acral parts
    including the toes in response to vessel ligation. Similar to the TSP1 null mice, muscle
    mitochondrial viability was significantly increased under a fixed ischemic insult in CD47
    null limbs (Fig. 33B) compared to wild type or CD36 null animals. Both CD47 and TSP1
 5  null animals exhibited significantly increased vascular remodeling following vascular
     ligation as compared to wild type and CD36 null animals (Fig. 33C).
              Most surprisingly, treatment of ischemic wild type hindlimbs with a CD47
    morpholino recapitulated the TSP1/CD47 null phenotype with essentially no tissue necrosis
     and increased muscle mitochondrial viability (Fig. 33D). A control morpholino did not
10  protect ischemic wild type hindlimbs from tissue necrosis.
              Laser Doppler analysis of ischemic hindlimb perfusion was performed in wild type
     and transgenic mice. All animals demonstrated equal and profound decreases in hindlimb
    perfusion in the immediate postoperative interval. However, CD47 null animals
     demonstrated statistically greater levels of perfusion compared to wild type animals by the
15   end of the first post-operative week (Fig. 34) Also in keeping with clinical findings, TSP1
    null animals demonstrated increased perfusion compared to CD36 null.
                                                Discussion
              It was recently reported that NO-stimulated VSMC contraction in vitro and acute
20  vasodilation in vivo are effectively blocked by TSP1 (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example
    2). VSMC express two TSP1 receptors that can mediate its inhibition of NO signaling:
     CD36 and CD47 (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:13141-13146, 2005;
    Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006). CD36 is necessary for inhibition of
     angiogenesis by TSP1 in the cornea (Jimenez et al., Nat Med. 6:41-48, 2000), but inhibition
25   of NO signaling by TSP1 in vascular cells requires CD47, not CD36 (Isenberg et al., JBiol
     Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006). The cell surface glycoprotein CD47 is expressed by all
    vascular cells and has been ascribed roles in regulating integrin-matrix protein interactions,
     self recognition and immunity (Oldenborg, Leuk Lymphoma. 45:1319-1327, 2004; Brown
     & Frazier, Trends Cell Biol. 11:130-135, 2001; Grimbert et al., JImmunol. 177:3534-3541,
30  2006).
              Utilizing CD47 null cells and morpholino knockdown of CD47, we now show that
     CD47 is required for TSP1 to block NO-stimulated relaxation of VSMC. We further show
    that this pathway limits the ability of soft tissue to survive ischemic injury. Under
    conditions of soft tissue ischemia, CD47 null mice resemble TSP1 null mice in lacking
35   significant tissue necrosis (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2). Conversely, CD36 null
                                                         137

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
     flaps and ischemic hindlimbs, which express TSP 1 and CD47, demonstrate tissue necrosis
    comparable to that of wild type mice. Thus, CD47 is the dominant receptor through which
    TSP1 limits survival of ischemic soft tissues, whereas CD36 does not play a significant role
    in this pathology.
 5            The increased tissue survival in TSP1 null and CD47 null flaps correlated with
    increased blood vessel density in tissue sections as compared to wild type and CD36 null
     sections. Angiogenesis may contribute to revascularization under acute ischemic challenge
     (Simons, Circulation. 111:1556-1566, 2005). However, angiogenesis may not be rapid
     enough to account for the increased random flap and hindlimb survival of tissue ischemia in
10   CD47 nulls or induced by CD47 blockade or suppression. Differences between wild type
     and CD47 mice could be detected based on clinical markers of viability and perfusion in
    ischemic flaps and hindlimbs immediately following surgery. EPR tissue oxygen
    measurement in ischemic flaps of CD47 null mice showed similar recovery rapid recovery
     as previous reported for TSP1 null mice (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2).
15   Combined with the ability of endogenous TSP1 to acutely limit an increase in muscle
     oxygenation stimulated by NO (Isenberg et al., Blood 2006; Example 2), the acute recovery
     of blood flow we observe by preventing TSP 1/CD47 signaling may result from blood vessel
    remodeling in addition to angiogenesis. The increased number of visible vessels in treated
     flap wound beds and on the surface of the vastus medialis following proximal femoral
20   ligation also suggests rapid adaptation by existing vascular networks. Such changes were
     found within 24 hours post-operatively. Angiogenic neo-vascularization and arteriogenesis,
     as opposed to vascular dilation, require time intervals from days to weeks (Chen &
    Walterscheid, Circ Res. 99:787-789, 2006). Such dramatic and immediate effects in tissue
    vascularity must arise through a process of dilation and remodeling of existing vascular
25  networks, permitting increased flow across a preexisting vascular plexus rather than
     formation of new vessels. The dramatic increase in perfusion in response to fixed ischemia
    in the corresponding null mice reflects the central role TSP1 and CD47 play in controlling
    these vascular responses.
              Ligation of the external iliac and common femoral arteries supplying the hindlimb
30  creates fixed ischemia in a complex composite structure that includes cutaneous, muscle
     and osseous tissues and has greater metabolic needs than cutaneous flaps. TSP1 and CD47
    null mice were protected from significant tissue loss and necrosis of acral parts relative to
    wild type and CD36 null animals, confirming that eliminating TSP1/CD47 signaling is
     sufficient to allow survival of fixed ischemia in a complex composite tissue as well as in
35   skin flaps. Differences in tissue survival correlated with mitochondrial viability in biopsies
                                                        138

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    taken from the tibialis anterior muscle. This muscle unit, by virtue of its distal location in
    the lower limb vascular runoff, provided a reliable barometer of limb perfusion. Analysis of
     limb perfusion with laser Doppler imaging further confirmed the clinical and muscle
    mitochondrial findings. Despite exhibiting comparable initial losses of limb perfusion
 5   following vascular ligation, recovery of perfusion was always greater in the TSP1 and
     CD47 null limbs compared to wild type and CD36 null.
             These data from transgenic mice suggested that CD47 could be a useful therapeutic
    target for improving survival of ischemic tissues. We confirmed this by demonstrating that
    treating wild type mice with a CD47 blocking antibody or knockdown of CD47 using a
10  morpholino dramatically increases tissue survival from ischemia. These results show that
    temporary suppression of TSP1/CD47 signaling is sufficient to prevent loss of ischemic
    tissue and suggest that similar approaches may be effective for treating patients subject to
     acute ischemic stress due to injury or surgical reconstruction. The CD47 antibody that we
    used is specific for murine CD47, but a number of anti-human CD47 antibodies exist that
15  could be evaluated for preventing necrosis of ischemic tissues. The CD47 morpholino
    hybridizes to a sequence that is conserved between human and murine CD47, and we have
    verified that it suppresses CD47 expression in human VSMC and murine tissue. This
    morpholino is proposed to be an effective therapeutic.
             The strategies we present to block TSP 1/CD47 signaling are believed to have broad
20  clinical relevance. The responses in cutaneous flaps show that CD47 morpholino and
     antibody treatments can effectively prevent tissue loss due to ischemia in skin. Despite the
    potential difficulties in delivering agents to composite tissues, treatment with the CD47
    morpholino in the hindlimb ischemia model resulted in a similar degree of tissue protection.
    Treatment resulted in decreased limb necrosis manifest clinically as protection from
25  necrosis of toes, skin and muscle ulceration and limb shrinkage. Muscle mitochondrial
    viability was significantly improved in treated limbs relative to the control limbs.
             The results described herein establish an important pathophysiological role for
    TSP1/CD47 signaling to limit NO-driven responses in VSMC and tissue perfusion. In the
     absence of CD47, tissue subjected to a fixed ischemic insult can approach 100% survival
30   suggesting that CD47 is the dominant TSP1 receptor for mediating its effects on survival of
    ischemic stress. The absence of CD47 relieves vascular beds from the inhibitory actions of
    TSP1 on NO-signaling. Therapeutic intervention targeting TSP1 or CD47 (including those
     discussed herein) can improve tissue survival with potential to circumvent the significant
    morbidity and mortality due to ischemic tissue necrosis. Therapeutic modalities based upon
35  modulation of TSP1 and CD47 could have profound clinical utility for individuals through

         Example 5: Thrombospondin-1 Stimulates Platelet Aggregation by Blocking the
 5                     Antithrombotic Activity of Nitric Oxide/cGMP Signaling
              Platelet a-granules constitute the major rapidly releasable reservoir of
    thrombospondin-1 in higher animals. Although some fragments and peptides derived from
    thrombospondin-1 stimulate or inhibit platelet aggregation, its physiological function in
    platelets has remained elusive. This example shows that endogenous thrombospondin-1 is
10  necessary for platelet aggregation in vitro in the presence of physiological levels of nitric
     oxide (NO). Exogenous NO or elevation of cGMP delays thrombin-induced platelets
     aggregation under high shear and static conditions, and exogenous thrombospondin-1
    reverses this delay. Thrombospondin-1 null murine platelets fail to aggregate in response to
    thrombin in the presence of exogenous NO or 8Br-cGMP. At physiological concentrations
15   of the NO synthase substrate arginine, thrombospondin-1 null platelets have elevated basal
    cGMP. Ligation of CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to block NO induced cGMP accumulation
     and mimic the effect of thrombospondin- 1 on aggregation. Exogenous thrombospondin- 1
     also reverses the suppression by NO of aIIb/P3 integrin-mediated platelet adhesion on
    immobilized fibrinogen, mediated in part by increased GTP loading of Rap 1.
20  Thrombospondin-1 also inhibits cGMP-mediated activation of cGMP-dependent protein
    kinase and thereby prevents phosphorylation of VASP. Thus, release of thrombospondin-1
     from a-granules during activation provides positive feedback to promote efficient platelet
     aggregation and adhesion by overcoming the anti-thrombotic activity of physiological NO.

              Platelets play important roles in hemostasis and cancer metastasis and were the first
     source from which thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) was isolated (Jurasz et al., Br JPharmacol.
     143:819-826, 2004; Baenziger et al., JBiol Chem. 247:2723-2731, 1972). TSP1 is a major
    protein component of platelet a-granules, from which it is rapidly released during platelet
30   activation. The physiological function of TSP1 in platelets, however, remains controversial.
    Platelets from TSP1 null mice show normal aggregation in vitro (Lawler et al., J Clin Invest.
     101:982-992, 1998; Bonnefoy et al., Blood. 107:955-964, 2006). However, exogenous TSP1
     enhances thrombin-stimulated aggregation (Tuszynski et al., Blood. 72:109-115, 1988), and
     some monoclonal antibodies recognizing TSP1 inhibit thrombin and ionophore-stimulated
35  platelet aggregation (Dixit et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 82:3472-3476, 1985; Leung, J
                                                        140

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     Clin Invest. 74:1764-1772, 1984; Kasirer-Friede et al., Thromb Haemost. 86:653-659,
    2001). Certain fragments of TSP1 inhibit platelet aggregation (Legrand et al., Arterioscler
     Thromb. 14:1784-1791, 1994), yet some monovalent TSP1 peptides promote aggregation
     (Chung et al., Blood. 94:642-648, 1999; Dorahy et al., JBiol Chem. 272:1323-1330, 1997;
 5  Fujimoto et al., JBiol Chem. 278:26655-26665, 2003). Because TSP1 interacts with
     fibrinogen, TSP1 was proposed to bridge platelets via binding to fibrinogen bound to the
    platelet integrin aIIbP3 or by binding directly to this integrin (Bonnefoy et al., J. Biol.
     Chem. 276:5605-5612, 2001). Alternatively, TSP1 may regulate degradation of von
    Willebrand factor by ADAMTS13. (Bonnefoy et al., Blood. 107:955-964, 2006), which is
10  consistent with the increased collagen- and von Willebrand factor-mediated aggregation of
    TSP1 null platelets (Pimanda et al., JBiol Chem. 279:21439-21448, 2004). Functions of the
     several TSP1 receptors expressed on platelets have also been controversial. CD36 was the
     first such receptor identified (Asch et al., J Clin Invest. 79:1054-1061, 1987), but
     subsequent studies showed that TSP1 binding is normal to activated platelets from Naka
15  individuals who lack CD36 (Kehrel et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 179:985-991,
     1991; Tandon et al., Blood. 78:2809-2813, 1991). A proposed role for the platelet integrin
     aIIbP3 as a TSP1 receptor was similarly put in doubt by normal TSP1 binding to thrombin
     activated platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia that lack aIIbP3 (Aiken
    et al., Clin Invest. 78:1713-1716, 1986; Boukerche et al., Eur JBiochem. 171:383-392,
20   1988). The TSP1 receptor CD47 is highly expressed on platelets (Chung et al., Blood.
     94:642-648, 1999). Despite some controversy about the role of CD47 as platelet receptor for
    native TSP1, several groups have confirmed that CD47-binding peptides derived from TSP1
     stimulate platelet aggregation (Chung et al., Blood. 94:642-648, 1999; Dorahy et al., JBiol
     Chem. 272:1323-1330, 1997; Fujimoto et al., JBiol Chem. 278:26655-26665, 2003).
25   Similarly, the TSP1 antibody C6.7, which inhibits TSP1 binding to CD47, inhibits platelet
     aggregation (Dixit et al., Proc NatlAcad Sci USA. 82:3472-3476, 1985). The relevance of
    the peptide data, however, has been questioned because some CD47-binding peptides
     appear to signal in platelets through FcR7 rather than CD47 (Tulasne et al., Blood. 98:3346
     3352, 2001). Furthermore, the VVM sequences implicated in their binding to CD47 may not
30  be accessible to mediate binding of native TSP1 to this receptor (Kvansakul et al., Embo J.
    23:1223-1233, 2004). Nitric oxide (NO) is a well defined inhibitor of platelet activation
     (Radomski et al., Proc NatlAcad Sci USA. 87:5193-5197, 1990), although its effector
    cGMP also exerts some stimulatory effects on the early phases of activation (Li et al.,
    Blood. 107:965-972, 2006). Recently, we demonstrated that TSP1 potently inhibits NO
35   driven responses in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells (Isenberg et al., ProcNatl
                                                         141

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    Acad Sci USA. 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793,
    2006). This activity of TSP1 involves inhibition of NO-stimulated synthesis of cGMP by
     soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) as well as inhibition of an unknown target downstream of
    cGMP. Engaging either CD36 or CD47 mimics the inhibitory actions of TSP1 on
 5  NO/cGMP signaling in vascular cells, although only CD47 is necessary for inhibition by
    TSP1 (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006). Expression of CD36 and
     CD47 on platelets led us to propose that the potent antagonism of NO signaling we
    identified in vascular cells could extend to platelets and might clarify the role TSP1 plays in
    platelet aggregation. We report here that TSP1 is a physiological antagonist of NO to
10  regulate platelet aggregation and adhesion. In the absence of TSP1, NO/cGMP signaling
    precludes thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.
    Materials and Methods
             Animals Wild type (WT) and TSP1-null C57BL/6 mice were housed under
15  pathogen free conditions with ad libitum access to filtered water and standard chow.
    Handling and care of animals was in compliance with the guidelines established by the
    Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute and Washington
    University.
             Reagents Thrombin was kindly provided by Dr. Jules Gladner (NIDDK). The nitric
20   oxide donor diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) was kindly provided by Dr. Larry Keefer
     (NCI, Frederick, Maryland) TSP1 was purified from fresh human platelets as described
     (Roberts et al., J Tissue Cult Methods. 16:217-222, 1994). TSP1-based peptides were
     synthesized as described (Barazi et al., JBiol Chem. 277:42859-42866, 2002) or purchased
     from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Oxadiazole-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ)
25  was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant domains of TSP1 were kindly
    provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and Jack Lawler
     (Harvard). Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was provided by the blood bank of the Clinical Center
     of the National Institutes of Health. Fibronectin was purified from human plasma (Clinical
     Center of the National Institutes of Health) as described (Akiyama et al., JBiol Chem.
30  260:4492-4500, 1985). Type I collagen was purchased by Inamed (Fremont, CA).
    Fibrinogen was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).
             Preparationof Human Platelets Platelets were pelleted from platelet-rich plasma
     (PRP) by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 200 g. They were then washed with acid citrate
     dextrose (ACD) (85 mM citric acid, 65 mM sodium citrate, 100 mM glucose, pH 5.1) at a
35  ratio of 1:7 at room temperature. After pelleting the platelets again and removing the

     supernatant, the platelets were resuspended in 5 mL of Tyrode's buffer (137 mM NaCl, 3
    mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.3 mM NaHPO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM
    glucose, 5 mM HEPES, 3.5 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4). The final platelet number was adjusted to
    200 platelets/gl in 500 l/cuvette of Tyrode's buffer.
 5           Preparationof Murine Plateletsfor cGMP Assay After induction of general
     anesthesia with isoflurane 2%, age and sex matched C57BL/6 WT and TSP1-null mice
    underwent cardiac puncture. Blood was aspirated into 1 cc syringes with a 25 gauge needle
    containing 100 l heparin (Heparin Lock Flush, Abbott, Chicago, IL), mixed with 100 l
     3% ACD and centrifuged in 1.2 ml S-Monovette separation tubes (Sarstedt, Germany). PRP
10  was aspirated off, centrifuged, and the resulting platelet pellet was resuspended in 200 l of
    Tyrode's buffer.
             PlateletAggregation Assay Aggregation of human platelets under high shear
    conditions was assessed using a standard optical aggregometer (Lumi-Dual Aggregometer,
     Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA) at 37 'C and 1200 rpm in a volume of 500 l buffer
15  with a final platelet concentration of 2 x 105 platelets/gl over a 5 minute interval. Pre
    incubation with TSP1 and TSP1-based agents was for 15 minutes prior to addition of
    thrombin and/or the rapidly releasing nitric oxide donor DEA/NO. In some experiments
    platelets were pre-incubated with the RapI inhibitor GGTI-298 (10 gM) (Calbiochem, La
    Jolla, CA) for 30 minutes prior to initiating aggregation. In other high shear aggregation
20   experiments murine platelets were prepared as above with the following modifications.
    Mouse blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding of anesthetized mice using heparinized
    tubes. PRP was prepared and then diluted with 4 vol. of Tyrodes containing 5mM EDTA to
    prevent activation. After collection by centrifugation, platelets were resuspended in 2X
    initial PRP volume and held at room temperature for less than 1 hr before use. Aggregation
25  conditions consisted of 250 gL of washed platelets stirred at 1200 rpm in a Chronolog
     Optical aggregometer at 370 C. DEA/NO (10 gM) was added 30 seconds prior to activation
     and 8-BrcGMP added 15 min prior to activation with 0.2 U/ml human thrombin. Data was
    collected using Chronolog "Aggrolink" software. Platelet aggregation under static conditions
    was assessed using a spectrophotometer      (Beckman DU 640, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
30   CA) and determined as a change in absorbance at 400 nm with continuous observation over
     a five minute interval. The cuvette was inverted once every 60 seconds. Pre-incubation with
    TSP1 and TSP1-based agents was for 15 minutes prior to addition of thrombin and/or
    DEA/NO to minimize the formation of thrombin-serpinthrombospondin complexes (Chang
     & Detwiler, Arch Biochem Biophys. 299:100-104, 1992), which interfere with thrombin
35  platelet interactions.

    Fresh platelets were washed and suspended in Tyrode's buffer and allowed to adhere for 30
 5  minutes. Plates were washed with PBS, fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with
     0.02% toluidine blue. Adherent platelets were counted microscopically. In some

20  centrifuged at 13,000 g for 5 minutes at 4'C and the supernatants were incubated for 15
    minutes on a tumbler at 4'C with glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham) prebound
    with a GST-RalGDS RBD fusion protein (kind gift of J. Silvio Gutkind, NIH, Bethesda,
    MD). Bead complexes were washed by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 30 seconds at 4'C
     followed by resuspension in 0.5 mL lysis buffer; 2 washes were performed for each sample.
25  After the second wash, beads were resuspended in an equal volume of 2X SDS sample
    buffer and stored at -20'C. For Western analysis, bead-bound proteins in sample buffer were
    boiled for 10 minutes and subjected to electrophoresis on NuPAGE 10% Bis- Tris gels
     (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore,

                                                  Results
     TSP1 blocks the ability of NO to delay thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation
30            Thrombin-induced aggregation of human platelets was significantly delayed in the
    presence of exogenous NO (10 gM DEA/NO) under high shear conditions, and this delay
    was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by TSP1 (Figure 35A). The lowest concentration
     of TSP1 tested, 0.022 nM, was sufficient to accelerate platelet aggregation in the presence
     of NO, indicating that the physiological levels of TSP1 in normal plasma (0.1-0.2 nM) are
35   sufficient to tonically regulate this response. This response was specific for TSP1 in that
                                                        145

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
     fibrinogen or fibronectin had no significant effect on the NO delay at the same
    concentrations (Figure 35B). Because TSP1 has been reported to differentially affect platelet
     aggregation at high and low shear (Kasirer-Friede et al., Thromb Haemost. 86:653-659,
    2001; Jurk et al., Faseb J. 17:1490-1492, 2003; Agbanyo et al., J Clin Invest. 92:288-296,
 5   1993), we also examined the effect of TSP1 on static platelet aggregation in the presence of
    NO. Preincubation of platelets with exogenous TSP1 (2.2 nM) did not significantly alter
     aggregation in the presence of thrombin alone under these conditions, but TSP1 completely
     abrogated the NO-stimulated delay in aggregation (Figure 35C). Therefore, TSP1 stimulates
     aggregation independent of shear rate.
10   TSP1 prevents activation by NO of sGC in platelets
              sGC is the primary intracellular target of NO in platelets (Moro et al., Proc Nati
    Acad Sci USA. 93:1480-1485, 1996). Increased synthesis of cGMP induced by binding of
    NO to the heme of sGC activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGK), which in turn
    phosphorylates several targets to delay platelet aggregation (Massberg et al., JExp Med.
15   189:1255-1264, 1999). As previously demonstrated in vascular cells (Isenberg et al., Proc
    Natl Acad Sci U SA. 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793,
    2006), sGC is a target of TSP1 signaling in platelets. Both basal and NO stimulated cGMP
     levels were decreased following pre-treatment with TSP1 (Figure 35D). The dose
     dependence for TSP1 to inhibit NO-mediated sGC activation is consistent with that for
20   accelerating platelet aggregation. Inhibition of cGMP accumulation is specific for TSP1 in
    that platelets pre-treated with fibronectin demonstrated no inhibition of an NO-stimulated
    cGMP flux (Figure 35E). Even in PRP, which contains physiological levels of both
     fibrinogen and fibronectin, TSP1 continued to block NO-stimulated cGMP flux in platelets
     (Figure 35F). Thus physiological levels of these known TSP1 ligands do not interfere with
25  its activity.
    Endogenous TSP1 inhibits NO-driven cGMP accumulation in murine platelets
              The preceding results establish that exogenous TSP1 can limit NO/cGMP signaling
    in human platelets but do not reveal whether endogenous TSP1 significantly influences this
    pathway. Based on Figure 35A, basal plasma TSP1 levels in the WT mouse should be
30   sufficient to limit NO/cGMP signaling. Using platelets from WT and TSP1-null mice, we
     found that both basal and NO-stimulated platelet cGMP levels were elevated in TSP 1-null
    compared to WT platelets (Figure 36A). Exogenous TSP1 decreased the NO-driven flux in
    platelet cGMP in both WT and null platelets, though inhibition was greater in TSP1-null
    platelets (Figure 36B). Platelets are known to express eNOS, the absence of which in
35  platelets decreases bleeding times (Wallerath et al., Thromb Haemost. 77:163-167, 1997;

    Freedman et al., Circ Res. 84:1416-1421, 1999), but the Tyrode's buffer typically used to
     study platelet function lacks the eNOS substrate L-arginine. Addition of 100 gM L-arginine
    to Tyrode's elevated cGMP levels in TSP1-null but not in WT platelets (Figure 36C). Thus,
     endogenous TSP 1 limits cGMP flux driven by both exogenous and endogenous NO.
 5  Endogenous TSP1 is necessary for platelet aggregation in the presence of NO
              To determine the relevance of endogenous TSP1 to platelet aggregation, we
    compared thrombin induced aggregation at high shear using platelets from WT and TSP1
    null mice. At low thrombin concentrations, null platelets demonstrated resistance to
    thrombin-driven aggregation compared to WT platelets as determined by titration with
10  multiple additions of 0.1 U/mL thrombin (Figure 37A). At sufficiently high thrombin levels,
    null and WT platelets aggregated at the same rate and to nearly the same extent (Figure
     37B). However, even at this thrombin dose, null platelets became completely refractory to
    thrombin in the presence of exogenous NO while WT platelets demonstrated only a modest
     decrement in the extent and stability of aggregation in response to NO (Figure 37B). Under
15   static conditions, similar patterns of response were found in murine platelets. Null platelets
     demonstrated aggregation in the presence of thrombin, though the lack of endogenous TSP 1
    in these platelets led to decreased aggregation as compared to WT (Figure 37C). As with
    high shear conditions, exogenous NO delayed aggregation of WT murine platelets, but
    TSP1- null platelets were completely inhibited.
20  Endogenous TSP1 also limits aggregation downstream of cGMP
              In addition to limiting cGMP synthesis by sGC, we previously showed that TSP1
    inhibits signaling downstream of cGMP in endothelial cells (Isenberg et al., Proc Nati Acad
    Sci U S A. 102:13141-13146, 2005). This second mechanism is also conserved in platelets.
    The membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8Br-cGMP substantially inhibited aggregation of
25  WT murine platelets. As with NO, the cGMP analog rendered TSP1-null platelets resistant
    to thrombin-induced aggregation (Figure 37D).
     TSP1 limits the anti-adhesive activity of NO in platelets
              NO is known to inhibit activation of the platelet integrin aIIbP3 (Walsh et al.,
    Biochemistry. 43:473-480, 2004). Human platelet adhesion to the aIIbP3 ligand fibrinogen
30   (5 gg/ml) was partially inhibited by exogenous NO (Figure 38A). Similar inhibition was
     observed for adhesion on type I collagen (3 gg/ml). The effect of NO on adhesion to
     fibrinogen is mediated by cGMP signaling because the sGC inhibitor ODQ prevented the
     decrease in platelet adhesion in response to exogenous NO (Figure 38B). Treatment with
    TSP1 alone moderately increased basal adhesion of platelets on type I collagen and
                                                       147

     fibrinogen, but the ability of NO to significantly decrease platelet adhesion to fibrinogen or
    collagen was lost in the presence of TSP1 (Figure 38C).
     TSP1 regulates platelet adhesion via Rapt
              The GTPase RapI plays important roles in promoting platelet aggregation and
 5   adhesion (Franke et al., Mol Cell Biol. 20:779-785, 2000; Han et al., Curr Biol. 16:1796
     1806, 2006). cGMP activates cGK-I to phosphorylate Rap 1GAP2 on Ser7, which in turn
     limits thrombinmediated activation of Rap1 (Schultess et al., Blood. 105:3185-3192, 2005;
    Danielewski et al., Thromb Haemost. 93:319-325, 2005). GTP-bound RapI activates
    platelet acIIb3 integrin by binding to the adapter protein RIAM (Lafuente et al., Dev Cell.
10   7:585-595, 2004). To determine whether TSP1 regulates Rap1 activation in platelets, we
     assessed GTP loading by pull-down using the Rap 1-binding domain of RalGDS (Figure
     39A). As expected, thrombin stimulated Rap 1 activation, and either NO or 8Br-cGMP
    inhibited this activation. Addition of 2.2 nM TSP1 reversed the inhibition of Rap1 activation
    in the presence of NO or 8Br-cGMP, indicating that TSP1 blocks this response both at the
15   level of sGC and downstream of cGMP. TSP1 alone did not increase RapI activation
     (Figure 39B). The geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298 inhibits membrane
    translocation of RapI (Kanda & Watanabe, Br JPharmacol.151:476-482, 2007), and we
    verified that it inhibits basal and partially inhibits thrombin-stimulated Rap 1 activation in
    platelets (Figure 39B). Although other pathways may also be affected by this inhibitor,
20   GGTI-298 was selective in adhesion assays for blocking thrombin-stimulated adhesion of
    platelets on fibrinogen but not on the a2p1 ligand collagen (Figure 39C). The ability of
    TSP1 to stimulate thrombin-activated platelet adhesion to a substrate coated with the aIIbP3
    integrin ligand fibrinogen was lost following preincubation of platelets with GGTI-298
     (Figure 39D). Partial reversal of the TSP1 stimulation of adhesion was also seen in the
25  presence of NO. In the presence of NO, the 55 ± 9 % stimulation of adhesion by TSP1
     decreased to 25 ± 8% following RapI blockade with GGTI-298. Thus, promotion of aIIbP3
    mediated platelet adhesion by TSP1 is at least partially Rap1-dependent. GGTI-298
    preferentially delayed platelet aggregation at high shear in the presence of NO, consistent
    with the known stimulatory role of Rap 1 signaling in platelet aggregation (Figure 39E).
30  However, TSP1 maintained its ability to accelerate platelet aggregation in the presence of
    both NO and GGTI-298. Thus, the positive effects of TSP1 on aggregation must require
     additional signaling pathways.
     cGK-I is regulated by TSP1 signaling
              VASP is another target of cGK, and in mice VASP is required for NO to delay
35   aggregation (Aszodi et al., Embo J. 18:37-48, 1999). We first confirmed that treatment of
                                                         148

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    platelets with 8Br-cGMP stimulates VASP phosphorylation at Ser239 and found that this
    was inhibited by pretreating the platelets with TSP1 (Figure 39F). The ability of TSP1 to
    prevent phosphorylation of a direct cGK target stimulated by a cell-permeable cGMP analog
    implied that cGK itself is negatively regulated by TSP1 signaling. We tested this hypothesis
 5  using an in vitro kinase assay with a defined cGK-Iselective peptide substrate (Hall et al., J
    Biol Chem. 274:3485-3495, 1999). Activation of cGK via sGC using DEA/NO in intact
    platelets strongly induced 32P-incorporation into the peptide, and this was prevented in
    platelets treated with TSP1 (Figure 39G). This inhibition by TSP1 could occur at the level of
     sGC and/or cGK, so to specifically assess inhibition of cGK we activated intact platelets by
10  treating with 100 gM 8Br-cGMP for 1 minute prior to washing and lysis for the kinase
     assay. Treatment with 2.2 nM TSP1 inhibited 32P incorporation stimulated by 8Br-cGMP to
    the same extent as the well characterized cGK-I inhibitor Rp-8pCPT-cGMP (Figure 39H).
    Therefore, cGK is a second target for TSP1 signaling in platelets.
     Two domains of TSP1 block the NO-driven delay in platelet aggregation
15            To define the functional domains of TSP1 that block an NO-stimulated delay in
    platelet aggregation, we treated platelets with recombinant type 1 repeats (3TSR) and the C
    terminal domains of TSP1 (E123CaG-1). Both TSP1 fragments blocked the ability of NO to
     delay thrombin-induced aggregation at high shear (Figure 40A), whereas a trimeric
    recombinant     construct containing the N-terminal region of TSP1 (NoCi) was inactive at
20  the same concentration and further delayed aggregation at a higher dose (Figure 40B). 3TSR
     and E123CaG1 also reversed the NO delay of aggregation under static conditions and even
    tended to enhance aggregation beyond control conditions (Figure 40C). 3TSR and
    E123CaG1 inhibited NOstimulated cGMP flux in platelets with similar dose-dependencies
     as full length TSP, whereas NoCI was also inactive in this assay (Figure 40D). The type 1
25  repeats mediate TSP1 interactions with its receptor CD36, and the G module mediates CD47
    binding. Thus, consistent with antagonism of NO signaling in vascular cells (Isenberg et al.,
    JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006), engaging either TSP1 receptor on platelets appears
    to be sufficient to overcome the NO-driven delay in aggregation.
     CD36- and CD47-binding peptides mimic TSP1 antagonism of NO in platelet
30   aggregation
              Two CD47-binding sequences have been identified in the G module of TSP1 (Gao
    et al., JBiol Chem. 271:21-24, 1996). The NO-driven delay in platelet aggregation at high
     shear was blocked by a peptide from this region of TSP1 (7N3,   1102FIRVVMYEGKKm      11 2 ).
    Two control peptides in which the VVM sequence required for CD47 binding was mutated
35   (604, FIRGGMYEGKK, and 605, FIRVAIYEGKK) had no effect at 10 gM (Figure 41A).
                                                       149

WO 2008/060785                                                                PCT/US2007/080647
    Remarkably, 10 nM 7N3 was sufficient to significantly inhibit the NO delay (Figure 41B).
    Peptide 4N1-1 ( 1o16RFYVVMWKio23), comprising the first VVM sequence in TSP1, and a
     derivative of the 4N1-1 peptide with terminal lysines to increase its solubility (4N1K; Gao
    et al., JBiol Chem. 269:32389-32393, 1994) similarly prevented an NO-stimulated delay in
 5  platelet aggregation under static conditions (Figure 41C, 41D). A modified CD3 6-binding
    peptide derived from the second type 1 repeat (907,    434 GDGV(D-I)TRIR 442)    accelerated
    platelet aggregation in the presence of NO to a similar degree as the CD47-binding peptide
     7N3 in high shear conditions (Figure 41E). A second CD36- binding peptide derived from
    the third type 1 repeats of TSP1 (906, 4ssVTAGGGVQKRSRLoo) also reversed an NO
10   stimulated delay of platelet aggregation (Figure 4 IF), but a heparin-binding peptide derived
     from the same region (246,   412KRFKQDGGWSHWSPWSS 428 )           was inactive (Figure 41G).
    The CD47- (7N3) and CD36-binding peptides (p907) partially inhibited NO stimulated
    increases in platelet cGMP (Figure 41H), but the respective control peptides did not. This
    peptide data supports the results using the recombinant TSP1 domains: engaging either
15   CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit cGMP accumulation in platelets.
    Discussion
             Tonic NO/cGMP signaling acutely regulates vascular tone and tissue perfusion and,
    if sustained, can induce angiogenesis and vascular remodeling (Jones et al., Biochem
20  Biophys Res Commun. 318:520-528, 2004; Dimmeler et al., Nature 399:601-605, 1999;
    Ignarro, JPhysiolPharmacol.53:503-514, 2002; Ignarro et al., Circ Res. 90:21-28, 2002).
    TSP1 is a major endogenous antagonist of NO-dependent vasodilation (Isenberg et al., Proc
    NatlAcad Sci USA. 102:13141-13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793,
    2006; Isenberg et al., Blood. 109:1945-1952, 2007) and restricts blood flow by
25  vasoconstriction at sites of injury when released from platelets (Isenberg et al., Blood.
     109:1945-1952, 2007). Here, we demonstrate that the hemostatic role of TSP1 extends to
    regulation of platelet function. Under both high and low shear conditions, NO significantly
     delays thrombin-stimulated aggregation and decreases adhesion of human and murine
    platelets. The differential effects of NO on aggregation of WT versus TSP 1-null platelets
30   demonstrate that endogenous TSP1 released from platelets in response to thrombin plays an
    important role to facilitate hemostasis by overcoming the tonic anti-thrombotic activity of
    NO. Thus, local release of TSP1 from activated platelets can simultaneously stimulate local
    vasoconstriction, platelet adhesion, platelet activation, recruitment of additional platelets,
     and stabilization of the thrombus. Unlike small molecule platelet agonists such as ADP,
35  TSP1 is tethered to both platelets and the fibrin clot, ensuring its localization and persistence
                                                       150

WO 2008/060785                                                                  PCT/US2007/080647
    in controlling hemorrhage. TSP1 orthologs occur in all chordates examined and are
    presumed to have evolved by gene duplication and divergence from a single primordial
    thrombospondin gene whose present day descendants are found in lower animals (Adams
     & Lawler, Int JBiochem Cell Biol. 36:961-968, 2004; Brass, J Clin Invest. 115:3329-3331,
 5  2005). Therefore, this potent antagonist of NO signaling has been present throughout
    vertebrate evolution, supporting a central role of TSP1 in regulating vascular NO signaling.
    This function of TSP1 was not previously appreciated because NO is a volatile gas that is
     lost during the isolation of platelets for in vitro functional assays. In vivo, endothelial eNOS
    provides a tonic inhibitory level of NO. Platelets also contain eNOS and use circulating
10  Larginine to generate NO (Figure 42) (Wallerath et al., Thromb Haemost. 77:163-167,
     1997; Freedman et al., Circ Res. 84:1416-1421, 1999; Signorello et al., Eur JBiochem.
    270:2005-2012, 2003). Isolated platelets are rapidly depleted of the volatile NO, and the
    buffers employed in standard aggregation assays do not provide the L-arginine required for
    NO synthesis by endogenous platelet eNOS. Consequently, endogenous cGMP levels decay
15   as platelets are "rested" before testing, explaining why washed TSP1-null behave like WT
    platelets in their response to thrombin activation (Lawler et al., J Clin Invest. 101:982-992,
     1998; Bonnefoy et al., Blood. 107:955-964, 2006). The lack of a phenotype for TSP1- null
    mice in a tail snip bleeding assay may also be explained by limited dependence of this assay
     on NO as evidenced by the similar lack of a phenotype for eNOS-null mice (Ozuyaman et
20  al., Thromb Haemost. 93:1161-1167, 2005). Our results also suggest that the magnitude of
    the anti-thrombotic activity of NO may have been underestimated due to tonic antagonism
    by endogenous platelet TSP1. In normal platelets at high or low shear, exogenous NO
    typically delays but does not prevent aggregation (Radomski et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci US
    A. 87:5193-5197, 1990; Rossiello et al., J Thromb Haemost. 3:2554-2562, 2005; Holmes et
25  al., Br J Clin Pharmacol.60:355-363, 2005 and our data). This implies that NO/cGMP
     signaling modulates but does not prevent the signal transduction downstream of thrombin
    that initiates platelet aggregation. One consequence of thrombin signaling is a-granule
    release, which rapidly makes TSP1 available to bind to its receptors CD36 and CD47.
     Signaling through these receptors limits NO signaling in platelets at the level of sGC and
30  cGK, thereby promoting aggregation and adhesion (Figure 42). By examining TSP 1-null
    platelets, the potent inhibitory activity of NO in the absence of this positive feedback is
    revealed.
              Our data provide a new interpretation of the previously described effects of TSP1
     on aIIbp3-fibrinogen interactions (Leung, J Clin Invest. 74:1764-1772, 1984; Bonnefoy et
35  al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:5605-5612, 2001; Beiso et al., Biochim Biophys Acta. 1033:7-12,

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    2000). Independent of any direct interaction with fibrinogen or acIIb3, we propose that
    TSP1 promotes fibrinogen binding and platelet adhesion by activating acIIb3 via Rap1
     (Figure 42). We found that NO inhibits platelet adhesion on fibrinogen, whereas TSP1
    increases basal adhesion and reverses the inhibition by NO. This probably occurs via
 5  blocking the tonic inhibitory effect of cGMP/cGK signaling on activation of this integrin via
    RAP1GAP2 phosphorylation and Rap1 activation (Massberg et al., JExp Med. 189:1255
     1264, 1999; Schultess et al., Blood. 105:3185-3192, 2005; Danielewski et al., Thromb
    Haemost. 93:319-325, 2005), which occurs downstream of CD47- mediated activation of
     aIIbp3 (Chung et al., JBiol Chem. 272:14740-14746, 1997). By these mechanisms, TSP1
10  can increase platelet adhesion and incorporation into fibrin clots. A different CD47 ligand,
     SHPS1 (also called SIRPa), was also shown to regulate acIIb3 function (Kato et al., J
     Thromb Haemost. 3:763-774, 2005). However, the activity of SHPS1 was to inhibit rather
    than stimulate the integrin. These results implicate either cGK or its substrate RAP 1GAP2
     as the downstream target through which TSP1 inhibits 8Br-cGMP responses in platelets.
15  However, the ability of TSP1 treatment to prevent phosphorylation of a second cGK
     substrate VASP and to inhibit cGK activity in an in vitro kinase assay clearly establishes
    that cGK is a downstream target of TSP1 signaling. Based on studies in VASP null mice,
    VASP plays a critical role in the modulation of platelet aggregation by NO (Aszodi et al.,
    Embo J. 18:37-48, 1999), and phosphorylation of Ser239 is both a direct and indirect target
20   of NO/cGMP signaling to delay aggregation (Li et al., Blood. 107:965-972, 2006). Collagen
    is also an important physiological agonist for platelet activation. Platelet adhesion on
    collagen and activation in response to this adhesion is mediated by the platelet integrin a2p1
     and the collagen signaling receptor glycoprotein VI (Sarratt et al., Blood. 106:1268-1277,
    2005). Platelet adhesion to and aggregation induced by collagen is stimulated by peptide
25  4N1K (but not by the control 4NGG) and by TSP1 in WT but not in CD47-null platelets
     (Chung et al., Blood. 94:642-648, 1999). Here we found that NO inhibits platelet adhesion
    to type I collagen via a sGC-dependent mechanism, and TSP1 reverses this inhibition.
             Thus, in addition to enhancing platelet aggregation, TSP 1 can promote adhesive
    interactions with matrix collagen that induce platelet activation. The reported changes in
30  von Willebrand factor processing in TSP1 -null mice provides an additional mechanism by
    which platelet adhesion on collagen can be regulated, and the potential role of NO in this
    pathway merits further investigation (Bonnefoy et al., Blood. 107:955-964, 2006; Pimanda
    et al., JBiol Chem. 279:21439-21448, 2004). The role of endogenous TSP1 in the process
     of thrombus formation is less clear in severe vessel injury such as those created by guide
35  wire endothelial stripping of arterial segments (Budhani et al., JMol Cell Cardiol.43:210
                                                      152

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    214, 2007). Consistent with previous reports that CD47-binding peptides increase platelet
     aggregation (Chung et al., Blood. 94:642-648, 1999; Dorahy et al., JBiol Chem. 272:1323
     1330, 1997; Fujimoto et al., JBiol Chem. 278:26655-26665, 2003), we found that CD47
    binding peptides potently antagonize NO-stimulated delays in aggregation. This occurred
 5  under high shear and static conditions. Both conditions are physiologically relevant since
     some agonist receptor signaling pathways are initiated only under low shear conditions
     (Verkleij et al., Blood. 91:3808-3816, 1998; Frojmovic, Am Heart J. 135:S119-131, 1998).
    Thus, CD47 may be a useful pharmacological target for controlling platelet activation in
     diseases associated with decreased blood flow and shear such as peripheral vascular disease.
10  Vascular thrombus frequently complicates this process. Drugs that act as antagonists of
     CD47 may be useful for treating prothrombotic disorders, and agonists of CD47 could
    benefit bleeding disorders where thrombin activation is limited. CD47-binding peptides
     derived from TSP1 could provide leads for creating such mimetics. Such drugs might also
    be useful for individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease associated with TSP1
15  polymorphisms (Stenina et al., Int JBiochem Cell Biol. 36:1013-1030, 2004; Zwicker et al.,
    Blood. 108:1280-1283, 2006). Our data suggests that CD36 could also be a useful target to
    control platelet activation. CD36-null platelets aggregate normally, but this was also
     assessed without NO (Yamamoto et al., Br JHaematol.81:86-92, 1992). CD36-null mice
     and Naka- humans, who lack CD36, may have no phenotype with respect to NO signaling
20  because CD47 can mediate this activity of TSP1 independent of CD36 (Isenberg et al., J
    Biol Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006). However, because we show that engaging CD36 is
     sufficient to perturb NO signaling in platelets, CD36-directed drugs such as those currently
    in clinical testing as anti-tumor agents might be useful to modulate platelet function
     (Markovic et al., Am J Clin Oncol. 30:303-309, 2007).

                           Porcine Model: Implications for Human Disease
              Insufficient tissue perfusion underlies many acute and chronic diseases. Tissue
    perfusion in turn requires adequate blood flow, determined in large part by the relative state
30   of relaxation or constriction of arterial vessels. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular cells
    modulates blood flow and tissue perfusion by relaxing and dilating arteries. Recently we
    reported that the secreted protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP 1), through its cell surface receptor
     CD47, limits the ability of NO to relax and dilate blood vessels and thus decreases tissue
    perfusion. To determine the clinical potential of these discoveries we evaluated the
35  therapeutic efficacy of targeting TSP1-CD47 in a porcine model of tissue ischemia.

 5   and an NO donor (DEA/NO) and cGMP quantified.
             Antibody blockade of TSP1 or morpholino suppression of CD47 dramatically
     enhanced survival of random tissue flaps. These responses correlated with increased blood
    vessel patency and tissue blood flow on vessel injection studies. NO-stimulated cGMP flux
    in Yucatan VSMC was abrogated after antibody or morpholino treatment.
10           Antibody ligation of TSP1 or antisense morpholino knock down of CD47 greatly
    increased tissue survival to ischemia. Given the homology between porcine and human soft
    tissues these results suggest significant therapeutic potential for people.
    Introduction
15           Impaired tissue healing is a well recognized phenomenon in the elderly (Ashcroft et
    al., JAnat 187 (Pt 1):1-26, 1995; Ashcroft et al., Biogerontology 3(6):337-345, 2002).
    Among the many factors that contribute to this consequence of aging, alterations in blood
     flow is central (Marin, Mech Ageing Dev 79(2-3):71-114, 19). Decreased tissue blood flow
     secondary to vascular disease not only impairs tissue responses to trauma, surgical or
20   otherwise, but also leads to eventual ischemic tissue death (Reed & Edelberg, Sci Aging
    Knowledge Environ 2004(7):pe7, 2004). A majority of the population over 65 years of age
    will have varying degrees of vascular pathology and progressive diseases arising from the
     same (Sigvant et al., J Vasc Surg 45(6):1185-1191, 2007).
             Nitric oxide (NO) is a central regulators of vascular health and blood flow (Ignarro,
25  JPhysiolPharmacol53(4 Pt 1):503-514, 2002). This bioactive gas increases blood flow in
    mature vasculature through its ability to relax vascular smooth muscle cells (Ignarro, Circ
    Res 65(1):1-21, 1989) and increases new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) by
     stimulating vascular cell proliferation and migration 8,9. In the elderly, NO production in
    blood vessels is dramatically decreased (Napoli et al., Nitric Oxide 15(4):265-279, 2006), a
30  problem that is further accelerated in the presence of vascular pathology (Desjardins &
    Balligand, Acta Clin Beig 61(6):326-334, 2006). Recently, we discovered that the secreted
    matricellular protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is the central modulator of NO stimulation
     of vascular cells (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci US A 102(37):13141-13146, 2005;
    Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006). In the absence of endogenous TSP1,
35  NO-driven increases in tissue blood flow are dramatically increased (Isenberg et al., Blood
                                                       154

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
     109(5):1945-1952, 2007). Likewise, the absence of TSP1 or its necessary receptor CD47
    confers significant survival advantages to complex tissue units following ischemic insult
     and correlates directly with markedly improved blood flow. Blocking TSP 1 directly with
     antibody engagement or suppressing CD47 (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem 281(36):26069
 5  26080, 2006) with a morpholino oligonucleotide leads to heightened blood flow under
    ischemic stress (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007) and atherosclerotic
    vasculopathy in murine models.
             The use of an appropriate animal model is required to critically evaluate the
    therapeutic potential of this strategy in humans. The pig (Sus scrofa) represents an ideal
10   large animal model for analysis of therapeutic agents that modify blood flow (de Smet et al.,
     CardiovascRes 39(1):224-232, 1998) and tissue perfusion because the structure and
    morphology of pig vasculature and skin is nearly identical to human (Zhang et al., Plast
    Reconstr Surg 106(7):1555-1565, 2000; Guyuron et al., PlastReconstr Surg 101(3):816
     819, 1998). We herein demonstrate that using monoclonal antibodies to target TSP1 or an
15   antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to suppress CD47 expression greatly enhances
    ischemic soft tissue survival in a porcine tissue injury model. These results suggest that the
    identified therapeutics may be clinically efficacious in improving tissue blood flow and
    healing in people.
20  Materials and Methods
             Cells and reagents: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth medium was
     obtained from Cambrex (SM-GM, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). A CD47 morpholino
     antisense oligonucleotide complementary to human a 5'-UTR sequence conserved between
    murine and human CD47 mRNAs (CGTCACAGGCAGGACCCACTGCCCA; SEQ ID
25  NO: 21) and 5 base mismatched control morpholino were purchased from GeneTools
     (Philomath, Oregon). A monoclonal antibody to TSP1 (clone A6.1) was prepared as
     described (Dixit et al., JBiol Chem 261(4):1962-1968, 1986). TSP1 antibody HB8432 was
    purified from conditioned medium of the corresponding hybridoma, obtained from the
    American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), by affinity chromatography on
30  immobilized protein A. Fluorescein was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Monomeric
    type I collagen was obtained from Inamed (Fremont, CA).
             Animals: White hairless Yucatan miniature swine (Sus scrofa (Yuc:scr), Sinclair
    Research Center, Columbia, MO) between 15 and 30 kg and 6 months of age were housed
    in an AAALAC accredited facility in accordance with the standards in the Guide for the
35   Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 1996). Animals were fed once daily with
                                                       155

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
     ~750gm of Zeigler NIH SWINE (Zeigler Bros. Inc., Gardens, PA) and received water ad
     libitim. The animals were maintained on a 12:12 light dark cycle at 24 + 2 C and 30-70%
    relative humidity. Animals were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of ketamine 10
     12 mg/kg and medetomidine 20-30 gg/kg followed by IV catheter placement and
 5   administration of propofol to effect. Following intubation, they were placed on isoflurane
     1-3%. Buprenorphine 0.01mg/kg was given intramuscularly and cefazolin 25 mg/kg was
    given intravenously before surgery. Animals received warm LRS at ~10 ml/kg/hr and were
    maintained on a hot-water blanket during the procedure. Following the indicated post
     operative intervals animals were again anesthetized with 10-12 mg/kg ketamine and 20
10   30 gg/kg medetomidine and an intravenous catheter was placed, data acquisition was
    performed, and the animals were euthanized by administration of 80-100 mg/kg Euthasol
    intravenous.
              White hairless Yucatan miniature pig VSMC cultures. Under sterile technique,
     segments of the femoral artery were harvested, and the tissue was cut into small pieces and
15  incubated in smooth muscle cell growth medium with 1% collagenase type II (Worthington
    Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ). The resultant cell suspension was then plated in sterile
    culture flasks in growth medium and cultured until confluence obtained.
              Ischemic soft tissue flap model. Animals underwent shaving of the dorsal surface
    hair and cleansing of the skin with soap and alcohol. Random dorsal cutaneous flaps 2 x 10
20  x 0.5 cm were elevated and immediately sutured in place with interrupted 4-0 nylon suture
     (Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, NJ). Treated flaps were injected with the indicated amounts
     of drug in sterile normal saline. On the 3 and 7 post-operative days tissue survival was
     determined and flaps excised for histology. In some instances animals received intravenous
     fluorescein prior to euthanasia and flap perfusion assessed under ultra violet illumination.
25            Determination of flap survival. Clinical assessment of flap perfusion was
    performed with notation of color, capillary refill and bleeding to needle stick being
    recorded. Flap dimensions were then traced onto a clear plastic sheet and with demarcation
     of viable and non-viable areas made. Weights of segments of sheeting corresponding to
    viable versus non-viable portions of flaps were then determined and % survival expressed as
30   a percentage versus total as previously described (Isenberg et al., Blood 109(5):1945-1952,
    2007).
              Indian ink studies. The internal jugular vein and common carotid arteries were
    cannulated and the animals perfused with a volume of 5 L heparinized (50 U/mL) normal
     saline heated to 50'C. A mixture of India ink and gelatin (5%) heated to 50'C (1 L) was
35   administered by gently pressing and then releasing the plunger of the syringe to simulate the

     arterial pulse. The flaps were excised and placed in 100% glycerin and stored at 4'C for 10
     days. During this time flap tissue became thin, desiccated and transparent and allowed
    visualization of the vascular architecture under direct transillumination. Using 5X
    magnification patent vessels (defined as those demonstrating filling with India ink) were
 5  quantified and expressed as per cm 2 flap area.
              Adhesion assay. White hairless Yucatan miniature pig VSMC were plated at
     10,000 cells/well onto 96-well plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) precoated with type I collagen (3
     gg/ml). Cells were incubated for 1 h in basal medium (lacking additives and serum) with
     0.1% BSA and the indicated concentrations of TSP1 and DEA/NO. Plates were then washed
10  with PBS, fixed with glutaraldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and washed. Absorbed stain
    was solubilized with acetic acid from fixed cells and the resulting color signal determined
     on a MR580 Microelisa Auto Reader, (Dynatech, Alexandria, VA) at 450 nm wavelength.
    In other experiments cell were treated with a CD47 or mismatch control morpholino as
     described for 48 h prior to harvesting.
15            Morpholino suppression of CD47. White hairless Yucatan miniature pig VSMC
    were plated onto culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a the indicated cell density in
     smooth muscle cell growth medium + 2% FCS and cultured until approximately 90%
    confluent. Cultured cells were treated according to the recommendation of the manufacturer
    with morpholinos (10 jiM) and delivery agent (Endoporter@ 6 pLl/ml) and used within 48
20  hours of treatment.
              Intracellular cyclic nucleotide measurement. White hairless Yucatan miniature
    pig VSMC (104 cells/well) grown overnight in 12-well culture in SM-GM containing 2%
    FCS and then weaned off serum over 48 h before treatment with NO donors and other
     agents in serum/additive free medium + 0. 1% BSA. Intracellular cGMP levels were
25   determined using an enzyme immunoassay (Amersham, GE Health Care, UK).
              Analysis of white hairless Yucatan CD47 mRNA sequence. Approximately 2 x
     106 white hairless Yucatan miniature pig lung endothelial cells were suspended in 1 mL
    TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and processed according to the manufacturer's
     specifications. 5 jig total RNA was used to create cDNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen,
30   Carlsbad, CA). A primer approximately 60 bp upstream of the predicted CD47 start codon
     and a primer approximately 60 bp downstream of the predicted CD47 stop codon were used
    to amplify CD47 cDNA with PCR Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Two
    independently-derived PCR products were purified using the Wizard purification kit
     (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to sequencing at the NCI Minicore with the primers
35  used for PCR and two internal primers (to obtain higher-quality sequence of the ends of the

             Histology. Flaps were excised, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde, paraffin
 5   embedded and sectioned at a thickness of 5 gim. Sections were then stained with
    hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) according to standard procedures. Review of each slide was
    performed by an independent pathologist blinded to the origin of each tissue slide.
              Statistics: Results in a porcine model are presented as the mean ± SD of a total of
    23 animals. Each animal underwent 2 - 4 flaps dependent on the degree on non-pigment
10   dorsal skin for a total of 76 random dorsal cutaneous flaps distributed into the following
    treatment groups: Untreated (vehicle only) n = 22; CD47 morpholino n = 22; mismatch
    morpholino (negative control) n = 10; TSP1 monoclonal antibody A6.1 n = 16; TSP1
    monoclonal antibody HB8432 n = 6. Experiments with harvested primary femoral artery
    vascular smooth muscle cells from the Yucatan white hairless pig were repeated a least four
15  times and results are presented as the mean ± SD. India ink analysis of flap perfusion was
    performed on 6 flaps from each treatment group described and results presented as the mean
    ± SD. Significance was calculated with Student's t test or where appropriate one way and
    two way ANOVA using a standard soft ware package (Origin) with p < 0.05.
20  Results
                Yucatan pig CD47 mRNA. The antisense morpholino was designed to
    complement human and murine CD47, but the published sequence for porcine CD47 has
     four mismatched bases within this sequence (NM 213982; Shahein et al., Immunology
     106(4):564-576, 2002) (Fig. 43A). We first confirmed the sequence of Yucatan miniature
25  pig CD47. Tissue from the Yucatan white hairless mini pig was digested, cDNA prepared
     and sequence analysis performed (gi EU179507; NCBI). Based upon DNA sequencing of
    two independently derived CD47 cDNAs, white hairless Yucatan miniature pig CD47
    mRNA and predicted protein sequences are identical to those annotated for Sus scrofa
     (NM_213982). Based on their distribution in the sequence, 4 mismatches were not predicted
30  to impact targeting (Gene Tools). The strength of interaction between the target RNA
     sequence and the CD47 morpholino was estimated by analysis of melting temperature. At
    concentrations of 1 jM and 10 jM morpholino, the calculated TM are 99.80 C and 104.00 C
    respectively for porcine and human CD47. Thus, the morpholino should form stable
    complexes with the porcine CD47 mRNA under physiological conditions.

              Morpholino suppression of CD47 prevents TSP1 inhibition of NO-stimulated
    VSMC adhesion. To confirm that the morpholino effectively targets CD47 in porcine
    vascular cells, we first replicated our published results in human VSMC, where down
    regulation of CD47 using the same antisense morpholino blocked the ability of TSP1 to
 5  inhibit NO-stimulated effects    16. Porcine VSMC demonstrated NO-stimulated enhancement
     of adhesion to type I collagen, which was inhibited by exogenous TSP1 at very low doses
     (Fig. 43B).
              NO-driven cGMP accumulation in CD47 morpholino-treated Yucatan pig
    VSMC is not blocked by TSP1. To further validate the CD47 morpholino, VSMC from the
10   femoral arteries of Yucatan white hairless pigs were pre-treated with a CD47
     oligonucleotide morpholino or a mismatched control, and cGMP responses to exogenous
    NO were measured. As expected untreated, mismatch- and target morpholino-treated cells
     showed similar increases in cGMP after incubation with an NO donor (Fig. 43C). Pre
    incubation with TSP1 (2.2 nM) blocked the increase in cGMP in control and mismatch
15  treated cells. However, NO-stimulated cGMP levels in VSMC treated with a CD47
    morpholino were resistant to suppression by TSP1. Importantly, basal cGMP levels were
     also elevated in resting cells following treatment with the CD47 morpholino compared to
    untreated and mismatch treated cells (Fig. 43D).
              TSP1 antibody treatment of porcine VSMC blocks TSP1 inhibition of NO
20   stimulated cGMP accumulation. Antibody A6.1 was raised against human TSP1 but
    recognizes TSP1 across several species of mammals (Annis et al., J Thromb Haemost
    4(2):459-68, 2006). This TSP1 antibody improved survival of ischemic tissue in mice, but
    its ability to block cGMP signaling via CD47 has not been confirmed in vitro (Isenberg et
    al., Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007). To validate A6.1, white hairless Yucatan miniature pig
25  VSMC were incubated in the presence of A6.1 (10 gg/ml) and TSP1 (2.2 nM), and then NO
     added. The ability of TSP1 to block an NO-driven accumulation of cGMP was substantially
    reduced in the cells that were pretreated with A6.1 (Fig. 43E).
              Suppression of CD47 increases random cutaneous flap survival in a porcine
     model. 20 cm random cutaneous flaps were created in 6 month old white hairless Yucatan
30  miniature pigs. Flaps that were treated with a CD47 morpholino via infiltration injection
     showed significantly more tissue survival compared to untreated flaps or flaps treated with a
    control morpholino (Fig. 44A, 44B). Untreated and flaps treated with a mismatch control
    morpholino showed 47 ± 5% and 34 ± 6% necrosis respectively. In contrast morpholino
    treated flaps had minimal necrosis (12 ± 3 %).

              Morpholino suppression of CD47 is associated with increased perfusion of
     random ischemic flaps. Perfusion injection studies of freshly euthanized white hairless
    Yucatan pigs demonstrated alterations in flap staining by India ink consistent with clinical
     findings of tissue survival (Fig. 45A, 45B). Untreated flaps and flaps treated with a missense
 5  control morpholino showed lack of India ink staining of vessels that paralleled areas of
    tissue necrosis (Fig. 45C).
              Antibody ligation of TSP1 alters ischemic tissue survival. Random dorsal
    cutaneous flaps were treated with a monoclonal antibody to TSP1 (A6.1), which was
    previously shown to enhance ischemic tissue survival in a murine model (Isenberg et al.,
10   Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007). Treated flaps demonstrated significantly increased tissue
    preservation compared to untreated flaps (Fig. 46A, 46B). In contrast another monoclonal
     antibody to TSP1 (HB8432) did not increase tissue survival. Determination of tissue
     survival correlated with areas of fluorescein staining in flaps obtained in living animals.
15  Discussion
              Tissue necrosis is a common complication secondary to traumatic injury or in the
    post-operative interval following elective surgery (Annis et al., J Thromb Haemost
    4(2):459-468, 2006; Levin, Orthop Clin North Am 24(3):393-409, 1993), problems further
     enhanced by aging (Ryan, Micron 35(3):161-171, 2004; Harris & Rumbaut,
20  Pathophysiology 8(1):1-10, 2001). Significant morbidity and mortality arise as a result. A
    number of agents designed to increase tissue blood flow and enhance tissue survival have
    been utilized in several experimental models, though results in the clinical environment
    have been disappointing (Hankey et al., JAMA 295(5):547-553, 2006). A majority of
    currently employed agents are administered systemically and have non-specific and
25  troublesome side effects. Thus, new agents are needed that can enhance tissue survival and
    wound healing and at the same time avoid systemic complications.
              Nitric oxide is one of the central regulators of blood flow in the body based on its
     ability to relax VSMC and dilate blood vessels (Ignarro, JPhysiolPharmacol53(4 Pt
     1):503-514, 2002; Bolz et al., Circulation 107(24):3081-3087, 2003). Agents based on NO
30  have been used in experimental models to enhanced tissue blood flow and survival under
    ischemic insult (Isenberg et al., Microsurgery25(5):442-451, 2005; Knox et al.,
    Microsurgery 15(10):708-711, 1994). In people NO elevating agents such as nitroglycerine
     and isosorbide dinitrate have been employed for many years in treating ischemic heart and
    vascular disease. Recently we discovered that TSP 1, through CD47, potently blocks the
35   ability of NO to relax contracting VSMC (Isenberg et al., Blood 109(5):1945-1952, 2007).

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    In murine models of ischemia tissue survival, blood flow was dramatically enhanced by
    targeting TSP1 and CD47. Additionally tissue blood flow in both young and aged animals is
     substantially greater following an exogenous NO challenge in mice lacking TSP1 (Isenberg
    et al., Blood 109(5):1945-1952, 2007; Isenberg et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol
 5  Published on-line October 4, 2007; DOI: 10.1 161/ATVBAHA.107.155390). However, it is
    widely appreciated that therapeutic results in murine disease models often do not translate
    into clinical gains for people.
             We now present evidence that targeting TSP1-CD47 enhances NO-signaling in
    porcine vascular cells and increases ischemic tissue survival in higher mammals. In several
10  in vitro assays, porcine VSMC demonstrated TSP1 inhibition of NO-driven cell signaling.
    NO-stimulated adhesion to collagen was blocked by TSP 1. NO driven intracellular cGMP
     flux was also sensitive to blockade by TSP1. Treating porcine VSMC with a CD47
    morpholino that decreases expression of the cell receptor renders the cells functionally
    insensitive to TSP1 blockade of NO-stimulated signals including alterations in adhesion and
15  intracellular cGMP flux. Even more significant was the finding that TSP 1-CD47 signaling
    modulated basal levels of intracellular cGMP in porcine VSMC. We previously reported
    that endogenous TSP1 altered resting levels of cGMP in murine endothelial and aortic
     derived VSMC (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci US A 102(37):13141-13146, 2005;
    Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes 71(4):785-793, 2006) and that this response necessarily
20  required CD47 (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem 281(36):26069-26080, 2006). We also recently
    reported that TSP1 limits tissue cGMP at rest and after ischemic insult (Isenberg et al.,
    Blood 109(5):1945-1952, 2007; Isenberg et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol Published
     on-line October 4, 2007; DOI: 10.1 161/ATVBAHA.107.155390). We now extend these
     findings and show that interrupting TSP1-CD47 signaling by suppressing CD47 levels leads
25  to elevation of basal cGMP in porcine VSMC. Additionally, a TSP1 monoclonal antibody
     (A6.1) minimized the ability of TSP1 to inhibit NO-stimulated cGMP flux in porcine
    VSMC. Together these findings suggest that in a porcine model of tissue ischemia a CD47
    morpholino and a TSP1 antibody enhance tissue survival by increasing cGMP, maximizing
    vascular relaxation and increasing tissue perfusion.
30           To develop an experimental system with greater similarity to people we employed a
    porcine model of tissue ischemia. Pigs have been utilized in numerous studies of tissue
    healing and blood flow since they mimic human cutaneous and vascular anatomy (Bostick
    et al., JAm Assoc Lab Anim Sci 45(3):33-37, 2006' Van Dorp et al., Wound Repair Regen
     6(6):556-568, 1998; Russell et al., PlastReconstr Surg 117(7):2259-2266; discussion 2267

    vessels in the pig has recently been described and follows the same general rule as in
    humans with vessels traveling from deep to superficial and branching step-by-step into
    reduced-caliber divisions though the total number of segmental arcades in the porcine
    cutaneous envelope is greater than found in people (Zhang et al., PlastReconstr Surg
 5   106(7):1555-1565, 2000). Clinically this enhanced redundancy in cutaneous perfusion
    required alteration of the traditional random flap dimensions from a ratio of 1:2 between
    width and length to 1:5 to insure a predictable degree of tissue necrosis. We have recently
    reported therapeutic efficacy in enhancing ischemic tissue survival with a CD47 morpholino
     also delivered directly to tissue units through syringe injection (Isenberg et al., Circ Res
10   100(5):712-720, 2007; Isenberg et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol Published on-line
     October 4, 2007; DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA. 107.155390). Similar increases in tissue
     survival were obtained in flaps treated with a specific monoclonal antibody to TSP1 (clone
    A6.1). The monoclonal antibody can engage TSP1 directly at the cell surface and should
    persist in the soft tissues in the extra-vascular compartment for some time. In a murine
15  model of tissue ischemia the A6.1 antibody was also tissue protective and enhanced survival
     and blood flow (Isenberg et al., Circ Res 100(5):712-720, 2007). This finding is consistent
    with the ability of A6.1 to bind to both human and murine TSP1 (Annis et al., J Thromb
    Haemost 4(2):459-468, 2006).
              The results herein presented in a porcine model provide additional confirmation that
20  blockade of TSP1-CD47 signaling regionally, via morpholino suppression of CD47, or
     direct ligation of TSP 1 with a monoclonal antibody greatly enhances ischemic tissue
     survival. These results expand on our previous reports that therapeutic advantage can be
     obtained with the same treatments in murine ischemic tissue units. Combined with cellular
     data obtained in vascular cells from several different species including murine (Isenberg et
25  al., ProcNatl Acad Sci U S A 102(37):13141-13146, 2005' Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes
     71(4):785-793, 2006), bovine, porcine and human (Isenberg et al., Blood 109(5):1945-1952,
    2007) these findings provide strong evidence for the universality of NO regulation by TSP1
    in mammals and suggest therapeutic potential for people.

                             Cardiovascular Responses to Vasoactive Stress
              Nitric oxide (NO) locally regulates vascular resistance and blood pressure by
    modulating blood vessel tone. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP 1), via its receptor CD47, limits the
     ability of NO to relax vascular smooth muscle cells and increase regional blood flow under
35  ischemic stress. Because NO also has central cardiovascular effects and nitrovasodilators are

    important therapeutic regulators of blood pressure and cardiac function, we examined global
    cardiovascular responses to stress in mice lacking TSP1 or CD47. Mice lacking TSP1 have
    normal resting blood pressure and pulse but show an exaggerated drop in mean arterial
    pressure in response to NO. CD47-deficient mice have elevated resting blood pressure and
 5   exhibit a greater decrease in response to NO. TSP1 null mice exhibit a similarly exaggerated
    hypotensive response to isoflurane anesthesia. With concurrent central autonomic blockade,
    this leads to premature cardiovascular collapse and death of the TSP1 null mice. Blood
    pressure and regional cutaneous perfusion responses to temperature change and epinephrine
     are also dysregulated in TSP1 and CD47 null mice. Thus, TSP1 signaling via CD47 is an
10   acute physiological regulator of blood pressure and global hemodynamics.
              Cardiovascular homeostasis requires constant regulation of tissue perfusion and
    blood flow. This process involves coordinated interactions of the autonomic nervous
     system, heart, lungs and blood vessels. Regional metabolic demands must be met by rapid
15   and efficient redistribution of blood flow. The bioactive gas nitric oxide (NO) is a major
    physiological regulator of blood vessel diameter and blood flow (Ignarro, JPhysiol
    Pharmacol.53:503-514, 2002; Arnal et al., Cell Mol Life Sci. 55:1078-1087,
     1999).Endothelial cells lining arteries, in response to specific stresses, increase their
    production of NO, which in turn diffuses into the adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells
20   (VSMC) and causes cGMP-mediated relaxation. This results in vessel dilation and increased
    blood flow. Direct cGMP-dependent and indirect activation of the cGMP phosphodiesterase
     (PDE5) provides negative feedback to limit NO/cGMP signaling (Mullershausen et al., J
     Cell Biol. 160:719-727, 2003).The matricellular protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), which
    is produced by vascular cells and circulates at 100-200 pM levels in plasma (Bergseth et al.,
25   Thromb Res. 99:41-50, 2000), controls a second signaling pathway that limits the ability of
    NO to stimulate cGMP accumulation (Isenberg et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:13141
     13146, 2005; Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793, 2006).Physiological levels of
    TSP1 potently inhibit NO-driven relaxation of contracting VSMC and limit the ability of
    NO to increase tissue blood flow at rest and under stress (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945
30   1952, 2007).The ability of TSP1 to block NO/cGMP signaling in vascular cells requires its
    cell surface receptor CD47 (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006).Targeting
     of either TSP1 or CD47 significantly enhances tissue survival after local ischemic challenge
     (Isenberg et al., Circ Res. 100:712-720, 2007).
              NO has central as well as local effects. Hypertensive phenotypes have been found in
35   some NOS knockout mice (Ortiz & Garvin, Am JPhysiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol.

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    284:R628-638, 2003). Central administration of NO donors or nitrovasodilators can alter
    blood pressure and cardiac function, leading to the extensive use of these agents for treating
    chronic and acute diseases of the cardiovascular system (Hermann et al., J Clin Hypertens
     (Greenwich) 8:17-29, 2006).Based on its ability to limit NO signaling, we hypothesized that
 5  TSP1 and CD47 might also play a role in regulating central cardiovascular responses. Data
    presented below now shows that awake CD47 null mice have elevated blood pressure, and
    both CD47 and TSP1 null mice show exaggerated hypotensive responsives to NO.
    Furthermore, responses of these mice to anesthesia, central autonomic blockade, temperature
    change, and adrenergic stimulation demonstrate additional roles for endogenous TSP1 and
10  its receptor CD47 to limit global cardiovascular responses.
    Materials and Methods
             Animals. Wild type, TSP1-null and CD47-null C57BL/6 mice were housed under
    pathogen free conditions and had ad libitum access to filtered water and standard rat chow.
15  Handling and care of animals was in compliance with the guidelines established by the
    Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute.
             Reagents. The nitric oxide donor diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) was kindly
    provided by Dr. Larry Keefer (NCI, Frederick, Maryland). The nitric oxide donor
    PAPA/NO was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Isoflurane
20   (Forane@, USP) was purchased from Baxter Healthcare Corp. (Deerfield, IL). Epinephrine
    hydrochloride and hexamethonium chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
    MO).
             Blood Pressure and Pulse Measurements. Mean systolic, diastolic and arterial
    blood pressure (BP) and mean pulse was measured in age and sex matched mice using a
25  computerized tail cuff system (Hatteras Systems, MC4000 Blood Pressure Analysis System,
     Cary, NC). The mice were allowed to acclimate to the apparatus for 5 min prior to the start
     of measurement. Each animal underwent a cycle of 10 preliminary and 50 experimental
    pressures measurements for data acquisition and data calculation. Animals were acclimated
    to the measuring system and protocol for 4 days with treatment with data acquisition being
30  performed on the  5 th day. Pressures recordings were performed at the same time each day.
    Data was accepted if the mouse had valid readings for at least 20 consecutive pulse beats.
    All studies were performed at the same hour each day.
             ECG Measurements. ECG measurements were obtained in resting awake animals
    using the ECGenieT m ECG Screening System (Mouse Specifics, Inc., Boston, MA) Animals
35  were placed on the recording stage and allowed to acclimate to the system and

    measurements were obtained passively as the animal's paws contacted the lead surfaces
    built into the platform floor surface. Sampling of collected tracings were then analyzed by
    the include manufacturer software package for standard physiologic parameters.
              Skin Blood Flow. Skin blood flow was measured using laser Doppler imaging
 5   (MoorLD1-2k, Moor Instruments, Devon, England). Briefly, animals were placed in a prone
    position on a heating pad, and anesthesia was provided by 2% inhalation isoflurane in a
     50:50 mixture of oxygen to room air. Core temperature was monitored by rectal probe and
    was further controlled with a heat lamp. The hair of the dorsum of the animals was clipped
     and depilated with Nare  TM  and a template with a 1 cm 2 area used to trace a region of interest
10   (ROI). After equilibration to the experimental set-up analysis of cutaneous blood flow was
     obtained. The following instrument settings were used: override distance 21 cm; scan time
    4 msec/pixel. Results are expressed as the change percent control from baseline of the RO.
              General Anesthesia. Animals were induced with isoflurane via controlled
    vaporizer and maintained on 1.5% isoflurane and a 50:50 mixture of room air and oxygen
15   administered via nose cone. Respirations were monitored continuously monitored by direct
     observation of the animal. Body core temperature was measured via rectal probe.
    Temperature control was performed using a water-circulating warming surface and heating
     lamp. Following a 15 minute period of stabilization mean systolic, diastolic and arterial
    blood pressure and mean pulse measurements were determined.
20            Statistics. Results are presented as the mean ± SD with significance calculated by
    the Student's t test and an assigned p value 0.05. Data represents results of studies
    performed in a total of 40 animals distributed as follows: Wild type, n = 16; TSP 1-null, n     =
     16; CD47-null, n = 8.
25  Results
              CD47 controls resting blood pressure. Age and sex matched wild type and TSP1
    null C57BL/6 mice exhibited no significant differences in resting blood pressure (Fig. 47A).
    In contrast, CD47 null animals demonstrated significant elevations of systolic, diastolic and
    mean arterial pressure compared to wild type and TSP1-null animals. No significant
30   difference in mean resting pulse (Fig. 47B) or ECG was found between any age, gender or
     strain cohort.
              TSP1 and CD47 limit blood pressure responses to NO. Age and sex matched
    wild type and TSP1 null C57BL/6 mice were challenged with a rapidly releasing NO donor
     (DEA/NO, t% = 2-4 min (Thomas et al., Methods Enzymol. 359:84-105, 2002), 1 gl/gm
35  body weight of a 100 mM stock solution) administered via i.p. injection, and awake resting

WO 2008/060785                                                                 PCT/US2007/080647
    blood pressure and pulse were determined. Both wild type and TSP1-null mice demonstrated
     significant decreases in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (Fig. 47C), but
     significantly greater decreases in blood pressure measurements were noted in the absence of
    TSP1. Mean pulse values tended to increase modestly in all animals following DEA/NO
 5  challenge. Analysis of time course data demonstrated that recovery of baseline pressure
     levels was delayed in TSP1 null animals as compared to wild type mice. Similar differences
    were found when animals were challenged using an NO donor agent with slower release
    kinetics (PAPA/NO, t% = 15 minutes (Thomas et al., Methods Enzymol. 359:84-105, 2002),
    Fig. 47D), with the drop in mean arterial pressure always greater in the absence of TSP1.
10  Interestingly, CD47 null animals treated with PAPA/NO showed the greatest drop in mean
     arterial blood pressure (Fig. 47D). Once again mean pulse was only modestly increased
     above resting values in animals treated with PAPA/NO (Fig. 47E).
               TSP1 and CD47 limit cutaneous perfusion responses to NO. Changes in blood
    pressure can also influence cutaneous perfusion (Takeuchi et al., Jpn JPhysiol.29:119-130,
15   1979). When age and sex matched animals at a fixed core temperature (34.5 'C) were
    treated with exogenous NO (DEA/NO 1 l/gram weight of 100 mM stock) via rectal
    catheter bolus injection, the initial increase in cutaneous perfusion assessed by laser Doppler
    imaging was always significantly greater in TSP1 and CD47 null mice compared to wild
    type controls (Fig. 48A). By 30 minutes, perfusion in the TSP1 null returned to baseline, but
20   flux remained elevated in the CD47-null (Fig. 48B).
               TSP1 and CD47 limit blood pressure responses to epinephrine. Treatment with
     epinephrine (0.05 jig/animal in 50 tl of sterile saline via i.p. injection) produced the
     expected increase in mean arterial pressure in wild type animals (Fig. 49A). However, TSP1
    null animals did not show a significant increase in mean arterial pressure. Mean pulse values
25  were moderately increased in both wild type and TSP-null mice (Fig. 49B). However, the
     same dose of epinephrine proved fatal to CD47 null animals, precluding further
    measurements.
              A reflex increase in cutaneous perfusion has also been reported in response to an i.p.
     epinephrine challenge (Ishida et al., Biol Pharm Bull. 26:170-181, 2003). Both wild type and
30  TSP1 null animals had increased cutaneous perfusion secondary to an epinephrine bolus
     (Fig. 49C). However, the increase was greater and more sustained in the TSP1 null mice.
               TSP1 stabilizes blood pressure during general anesthesia. Induction of general
     anesthesia is associated with alterations in cardiovascular responses (Reich et al., Anesth
    Analg. 101:622-628, 2005). Isoflurane is a widely used agent for induction and maintenance
35   of general anesthesia. After establishment of general anesthesia with isoflurane, wild type
                                                        166

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    mice demonstrated the expected downward trend in systolic blood pressure and a very
    modest overall drop in mean arterial pressure (Fig. 50A). In contrast TSP1-null animals
     showed significant decreases in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures.
              TSP1 and CD47 limit alterations in tissue perfusion in response to temperature.
 5  Alterations in core temperature are known to significantly alter skin blood flow (Stocks et
    al., Aviat Space Environ Med. 75:444-457, 2004), due in part to autonomic regulation of
     skin in-flow vessels (Charkoudian, Mayo Clin Proc.78:603-612, 2003). Under controlled
    conditions of general anesthesia, the core temperature in animals was increased in 0.5 degree
    intervals from 34 to 37 'C, and cutaneous perfusion was measured via laser Doppler
10  imaging. Cutaneous perfusion increased in all animals with increasing core temperature
     (Fig. 50B). However, the increase as a percentage of the respective baseline values was
     always significantly greater in TSP1 and CD47 null animals.
              TSP1 limits cardiovascular collapse from central autonomic blockade.
    Maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure and minimization of larger alterations in
15   systolic and diastolic pressure are central for homeostasis. Input from the autonomic nervous
     system is critical for the precise control and support of blood pressure. Autonomic blockade
    with a centrally active agent such as the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium removes
     sympathetic tone and is known to enhance cardiovascular responses to alterations in nitric
     oxide levels (Scrogin et al., Am JPhysiol. 274:R367-374, 1998; Shibao et al., Hypertension
20   50:47-53, 2007). We induced and maintained general anesthesia with 1% isoflurane in wild
    type and TSP1 null mine. Core temperature was kept constant at 370 C, and the animals were
    challenged with hexamethonium. Cutaneous perfusion was then measured every 2.5 minutes
    via laser Doppler imaging (Fig. 51A, 51B). Both wild type and TSP1 null animals
     demonstrated decreases in cutaneous perfusion and eventual cardiovascular collapse and
25   death. However, the loss of perfusion was significantly more rapid in the absence of TSP1
     and diverged from that of wild type mice after 5 min. Wild type mice sustained cutaneous
    perfusion for an additional 10 min, indicating an important role for endogenous TSP1 in
    maintaining perfusion under this stress.
30  Discussion
              Aberrant vasoregulation contributes to the etiology of many chronic diseases
    including peripheral vascular disease, coronary heart disease and hypertension.
    Nitrovasodilators play a major role in the therapeutic management of these diseases.
    Previously, hydrolysis of cGMP by PDEs was considered the major regulator of NO
35   signaling in vascular physiology (Mullershausen et al., J Cell Biol. 160:719-727, 2003;
                                                        167

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    Rybalkin et al., Circ Res. 93:280-291, 2003). Inhibitors of PDE5 have proven
    therapeutically useful to increase NO responses in certain tissues. We have identified TSP1
     as a physiological regulator of the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by NO (Isenberg
    et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:13141-13146, 2005). Elevated basal cGMP levels in
 5  vascular cells from mice lacking endogenous TSP1 or CD47 show that cGMP signaling is
    continuously modulated by physiological concentrations of TSP1 independent of PDE
     activity (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080, 2006). In vivo, loss of TSP1 or
     CD47 results in enhanced perfusion of ischemic tissues as well as enhanced local and
     systemic cardiovascular responses to exogenous NO challenge. Thus, TSP1 constantly
10   functions to temper regional and systemic blood flow distribution in healthy tissue and in
    response to injury or stress.
              Homeostatic compensation mechanisms probably account for the normal resting
    blood pressure and pulse in TSP null mice. However, the modulating role of TSP1 becomes
     apparent in the face of centrally acting vasoactive stresses. The differential responses in
15  TSP1 null and wild type mice show that endogenous TSP1 functions continuously to
    maintain blood pressure by modifying central cardiovascular responses to NO. We also
    identified a role for TSP1 in maintaining blood pressure and perfusion in response to
    temperature change, adrenergic challenge, and isoflurane anesthesia. In addition to being
     opposed by TSP 1, the vasodilator activity of NO is also limited by baroreflex control.
20  Blocking autonomic input revealed an important role of TSP1 in maintaining vascular tone.
              The cardiovascular phenotype of the CD47 null mouse is more pronounced in that
    its resting blood pressure differs from that of a wild type mouse, and vasoactive challenges
    generally resulted in greater changes in blood pressure than were observed for TSP1 null
    mice. The stronger phenotype of the CD47 null relative to the TSP1 null could reflect some
25  compensation for loss of TSP1 by other thrombospondins expressed in vascular cells such
     as TSP2 and TSP4 (Lamy et al., JImmunol. 178:5930-5939, 2007; Stenina et al.,
     Circulation 108:1514-1519, 2003; Lopes et al., Mol Cell Biol. 23:5401-5408, 2003).
              Cutaneous perfusion is also linked to central control and distribution of blood flow
     and is sensitive to pressure alterations. Under conditions of a controlled increase in core
30  body temperature the absence of TSP1 or CD47 caused markedly enhanced blood flow
    through the cutaneous envelope. Thus, regional blood flow responses to core temperature
    changes are also limited by TSP1 via CD47. Identical experiments performed under general
    isoflurane anesthesia allowed correlation of mean arterial pressure with core body
    temperature and cutaneous perfusion. Here too, in the presence of similar mean arterial

              Because loss of TSP1/CD47 signaling can alter blood pressure and global
    hemodynamic responses to stress, the potential for elevated plasma or vascular matrix TSP1
     levels to increase blood pressure or decrease compliance in response to physiological NO
     signaling should also be considered. Elevated TSP1 expression in the blood vessel wall or
 5   surrounding matrix has been reported in atherosclerosis, restenosis, and diabetes (Riessen et
    al., Am Heart J. 135:357-364, 1998; Roth et al., JSurgRes. 74:11-16, 1998; Chen et al.,
     Circulation 100:849-854, 1999; Stenina et al., Circulation 107:3209-3215, 2003). Some
    cancers are associated with elevated circulating plasma TSP1 levels (Yamashita et al.,
     Cancer 82:632-638, 1998; Volpert et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 95:6343-6348, 1998;
10  Hayden et al., Ann Clin Biochem. 37 ( Pt 3):319-325, 2000), but it remains unclear whether
     elevated circulating TSP1 could be hypertensive.
              The present results suggest a central role for TSP1 in controlling blood pressure and
     are consistent with our previous finding that TSP1 null mice at rest demonstrate marked
    increases in skeletal muscle blood flow following an NO challenge as compared to the wild
15  type animal (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007). Given the association between a
    coding polymorphism in TSP1 and early coronary artery disease (Topol et al., Circulation
     104:2641-2644, 2001; Zwicker et al., Blood 108:1280-1283, 2006), our results raise the
    intriguing possibility that altering the antagonism between the TSP/CD47 and NO/cGMP
    pathways could lead to cardiovascular pathology in people. Further, these results suggest
20  that targeting TSP1/CD47 may provide new therapeutic approaches to regulate blood
    pressure as well as regional blood flow.
         Example 8: Blocking Thrombospondin-1/CD47 Signaling Alleviates Deleterious
                          Effects of Aging on Tissue Responses to Ischemia
25            Decreased blood flow secondary to peripheral vascular disease underlies a
     significant number of chronic diseases that account for the majority of morbidity and
    mortality among the elderly. Blood vessel diameter and blood flow are limited by the
    matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP 1) through its ability to block responses to the
     endogenous vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). In this study we investigate the role TSP1 plays
30  in regulating blood flow in the presence of advanced age and atherosclerotic vascular
     disease.
              Briefly, mice lacking TSP1 or CD47 show minimal loss of their resistance to
    ischemic injury with age and increased preservation of tissue perfusion immediately
     following injury. Treatment of WT and apolipoprotein E null mice using therapeutic agents
35  that decrease CD47 or enhance NO levels reverses the deleterious effects of age and diet

    induced vasculopathy and results in significantly increased tissue survival in models of
    ischemia.
              With increasing age and diet-induced atherosclerotic vascular disease, TSP1 and its
    receptor CD47 become more limiting for blood flow and tissue survival following ischemic
 5  injury. Drugs that limit TSP1/CD47 regulation of blood flow could improve outcomes from
     surgical interventions in the elderly and ameliorate vascular complications attendant to
     aging.
    Introduction
10            Complications from peripheral vascular disease, including coronary artery disease
     and myocardial infarction, stroke and ischemic vascular disease affect some 80% of people
     over the age of 65. The elderly have significant alterations in vascular anatomy including a
     loss of vascular networks (Lamah et al., Int JMicrocircClin Exp. 16:271-276, 1996)and
     alterations in vascular response to injury (Ryan T., Micron. 35:161-171, 2004). Age is a
15  recognized risk factor for complications following surgery including delayed and
    incomplete wound healing and tissue loss and accounts for significant morbidity and
    mortality in this group (Gohel et al., Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg. 29:74-77, 2005; Gosain et
    al., World JSurg. 28:321-326, 2004; Brem et al., Surg Technol Int. 11:161-167, 2003;
     Crooks A., J Wound Care 4:222-223, 2005)3-6. Animal studies have confirmed the impact of
20   aging upon wound healing (Ashcroft et al., Biogerontology 3:337-345, 2002; Ashcroft et al.,
    JAnat. 187 ( Pt 1):1-26, 1995; Kivirikko et al., Med Biol. 54:159-186, 1976).
              Tissue perfusion is regulated through the control of blood vessel diameter, which
    itself is controlled by the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Nitric
     oxide (NO) is a primary and ubiquitous dilator of blood vessels (Ignarro U., JPhysiol
25  Pharmacol.53:503-514, 2002). NO is constitutively produced in blood vessels by
     endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
     leading to cGMP production and vasodilation. In aged vascular cells (Bernardini et al.,
    Biochim Biophys Acta. 1745:265-272, 2005), animals and people, both eNOS expression
     and NO production (Qian et al., J CardiovascPharmacol.47:587-593, 2006)are decreased.
30            We recently reported that thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) blocks NO-driven VSMC
    relaxation in a CD47-dependent manner (Isenberg et al., JBiol Chem. 281:26069-26080,
    2006; Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007; Isenberg et al., Circ Res. 100:712-720,
    2007). NO-driven alterations in blood flow are substantially greater in the absence of TSP1
     or CD47. Given the deleterious effects of aging on the cardiovascular system, we wanted to
35   determine if blocking of TSP1 inhibition of NO signaling would provide significant tissue
                                                         170

    protection in senescent animals. Aged WT and apolipoprotein E (apoE) null mice (with diet
     driven vasculopathy) demonstrated increased tissue necrosis in response to a fixed ischemic
    challenge compared to young animals. In contrast, senescent TSP1-null and CD47-null
     animals subjected to the same ischemic challenge demonstrated tissue preservation
 5  comparable to that in young animals. Suppression of CD47 in senescent or apoE-null
     animals also resulted in increased tissue survival following ischemic injury.
    Materials and Methods
             Reagents. Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and L-nitro-N-methyl arginine (L-NAME)
10  were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). A CD47 morpholino antisense oligonucleotide
     (CGTCACAGGCAGGACCCACTGCCCA) and a mismatched control morpholino were
    purchased from GeneTools (Philmonth, Oregon).
             Animals. C57BL/6 WT, TSP1-null (Lawler et al., J Clin Invest. 101:982-992,
     1998) and CD47-null (Gao et al., J Cell Biol. 135:533-544, 1996)mice were maintained in a
15  pathogen free environment with ad libitum access to standard rat chow and water. ApoE
    null mice (B6.129P2-Apoe<tmlUnc>/J) were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor,
    ME) and maintained on either a standard rat chow diet or a 40% fat diet (Harlan Teklan,
    Madison, WI) (Meir et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 24:1006-1014, 2004). Animals
    used were 12 - 18 months of age, except as indicated when young animals (aged 2- 4
20  months) were used for control purposes. Care and handling of animals was in accordance
    with the Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute and of
    Washington University School of Medicine.
             Ischemic soft tissue flap model. Animals underwent creation of a random
    myocutaneous (McFarlane) flap as previously described (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945
25   1952, 2007). Some animals received either ISDN (1 mg/mL) or L-NAME (0.5 mg/ml) ad
     libitum in the drinking water during the post-operative interval.
             Estimation of survival area in flaps. The necrotic areas of dorsal myocutaneous
    McFarlane flaps were determined as previously described (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945
     1952, 2007).
30           Laser Doppler analysis of tissue perfusion. Core temperature was monitored via
    rectal probe and maintained at 370 C by a heated stage. Anesthesia was obtained with 1.5%
    isoflurane. A MoorLD1-2k scanner (Moor Instruments, Devon, England) was used with the
     following parameters: scan area - 1.6 x 2.5 cm; scan speed - 4 ms/pixel, scan time 1 min 54
     sec, override distance 25 cm. The override distance was 20 cm.

             Hind limb ischemia. Wild type, TSP1-null, CD47-null underwent ligation of the
     femoral artery at the level of the inguinal ligament as previously described (Isenberg et al.,
     Circ Res. 100:712-720, 2007)with a 5-0 nylon ligature placed around the femoral artery and
    tied, resulting in complete vessel occlusion.
 5           Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI imaging. WT and TSP1 null mice
     14- 18 months of age underwent in vivo analysis of tissue perfusion and blood flow using
    BOLD MRI. MRI images were acquired using a Bruker Biospin 4.7 T scanner and
    isoflurane anesthesia as previously described (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007).
    T2 mapping spin echo images were obtained using a multi-slice multi-echo (MSME)
10   sequence with a 10-echo train and an echo time of 15 ms. The scan time for a T2 mapping
    image set (NEX = 1) by the MSME sequence was 10 min.
             Hind paw perfusion assay. Fourteen month old mice underwent treatment of the
    hind paw with 5% mustard oil (Chem Services, Inc) in sesame oil (50 l to dorsal paw),
    which is known to induce NO-dependent vasoactive responses (Bernatchez et al., Proc Natl
15  Acad Sci USA. 102:761-766, 2005; Yang Ret al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 19:2762
    2768, 1999).
             Morpholino suppression of CD47. Flap soft tissue units and underling wound
    beds were injected with control vehicle (normal saline), a CD47 morpholino or a control
    morpholino (10 gM) in sterile saline. Flap survival was determined as described.
20           Mitochondrial viability assay. Mitochondrial viability of hindlimb muscle biopsies
    was assessed by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt to water insoluble formazan through
    mitochondrial oxidation as described (Bonheur et al., JSurg Res. 116:55-63, 2004). Results
    were expressed as absorbance normalized to dry tissue weight.
             Determination of tissue cGMP. Skeletal muscle biopsies of equal wet weight were
25   excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized, and then washed with 6% (w/v)
    trichloroacetic acid at 40 C. Homogenates were centrifuged and supernatants washed 4 times
    with 5 volumes of water saturated diethyl ether. The extracts was lyophilized and
    resuspended in assay buffer for analysis via immunoassay (Amersham, GE Healthcare, UK).
             Histology. Tissue units were excised, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde, paraffin
30   embedded, and sectioned at a thickness of 5 gim. Sections were then stained with
    hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Review of each slide was performed by an independent
    pathologist blinded to the origin of each tissue slide.
             Statistics. Results are presented as the mean ± SD of a total of 164 aged animals
     (12 - 18 months old) of the following genetic type: WT = 67, TSP1-null = 56, CD47-null       =
35   31, apo E-null = 10. Where indicated studies were performed in comparable numbers of

    Results
 5            Thrombospondin-1 limits tissue necrosis in aged animals. Aged (14 - 18 months
     old) sex matched WT and TSP 1-null mice underwent McFarlane flap surgery. Wild type
     flaps demonstrated near total necrosis with only 20 ± 6% survival obtained at 7 days (Fig
     52A, 52B). This is significantly less than the survival seen in young mice of the same
    background (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007) (p < 0.05). Flaps in senescent
10  TSP1-null mice demonstrated near total tissue survival with minimal necrosis (6 ± 3%).
     Survival did not differ significantly from that of young TSP 1-null mice (Isenberg et al.,
    Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007) (p > 0.05). Histologic review of WT tissue flaps from
     senescent mice demonstrated loss of the epidermis and ulceration, coagulative necrosis of
     subcutaneous collagen, and absence of hair follicles (Fig. 58A & 58C). TSP1-null flaps
15   demonstrated normal histology with minimal inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 58B &
     58D).
              Nitric oxide increases aged tissue survival after ischemia. WT aged mice that
    underwent random myocutaneous flaps and received ISDN ad libitum in the drinking water
     demonstrated a moderate but significant increase in tissue survival 41 ± 5% (p < 0.05) (Fig.
20   52C). Treatment of WT aged mice with L-NAME further decreased flap survival (8 ± 4%
    versus 20 ± 6%, p < 0.05) compared to untreated (Fig. 52A, 52C), while L-NAME failed to
     diminish flap survival in TSP1 -null animals. Given the near complete survival of random
     flaps in untreated aged TSP1 -null animals treatment with ISDN did not dramatically alter
     flap survival (Fig. 52C).
25            Tissue cGMP is limited by TSP1 and age. Skeletal muscle from WT and TSP 1
    null young (12 week old) and aged (18 month old) (Fig. 52D) or old mice alone (Fig. 52E)
    was analyzed for cGMP. Consistent with previous reports (Wheeler et al., Mol Cell
    Biochem. 169:115-124, 1997; Khatib et al., Mech Ageing Dev. 101:21-32, 1998), cGMP
     levels decreased significantly in aged WT animals. In contrast, cGMP was slightly elevated
30  in muscle samples from young TSP1-null mice and did not fall with age. Following 24
    hours of ischemia, old TSP1-null animals demonstrated significantly less decrease in tissue
    cGMP compared to wild type (Fig. 52E).
              SP1 limits immediate responses to ischemia in senescent animals. Mice (14-18
    months old) underwent random myocutaneous flaps and laser Doppler analysis of tissue
35  perfusion (Fig. 53A). TSP1-null and CD47-null flaps demonstrated greater flap perfusion
                                                        173

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    than WT flaps (Fig 53B) (Fig. 59). Null flaps exhibited less overall loss of tissue perfusion
    immediately after flap elevation and a progressive increase in tissue perfusion during the
    post-operative interval. WT flaps demonstrated progressive decreases in flap perfusion and
     showed no tendency to recovery.
 5            Thrombospondin-1 limits hind limb survival of ischemia in aged animals. Mice
     (age 14-18 months) underwent ligation of the femoral artery. Aged wild type animals
     demonstrated minimal remodeling of existing collateral vessels in the ischemic limb and
     significantly less than young mice (Fig. 54A, 54D). In contrast TSP1-null limbs
     demonstrated extensive vascular remodeling of existing collateral vessels with both young
10   and old animals performing equally well (Fig. 54B, 54D). Laser Doppler analysis of hind
     limb perfusion 72 hours post-ligation demonstrated less restoration of perfusion in wild type
     (Fig. 54A, 54C) than in TSP 1-null limbs (Fig. 54B, 54C). Mitochondrial viability of muscle
    biopsies from hind limbs was only minimally decreased in limbs undergoing vascular
     ligation compared to contralateral control limbs in TSP1-null specimens (Fig. 54E) Aged
15  WT samples showed a pronounced decrease in MTT signal between ischemic limb muscle
    compared to normal limb muscle, and between young and old tissue samples (Fig. 54E).
    H&E sections of hind limbs demonstrated marked sterile necrosis of muscle fibers and loss
     of cell nuclei in ischemic WT tissue (Figs. 60A, 60B). Ischemic TSP1-null muscle
     demonstrated minimal sterile necrosis of muscle fibers and increased cell nuclei.
20            Loss of TSP1 immediately enhances tissue perfusion following hindlimb
    ligation in older animals. Aged WT and TSP1-null animals showed a profound decrease in
    perfusion immediately following vascular ligation of the hindlimb (Fig. 55A, 55B).
    However, the TSP 1-null animals showed a progressive increase in hindlimb perfusion
    compared to WT limbs and had significantly more restoration of flow within the first post
25   operative hour.
              Aged TSP1 null animals demonstrate enhanced responses to exogenous NO in
    ischemic tissue. To further define the role of TSP1/NO signaling in acute responses to
    tissue ischemia, WT and TSP1-null mice (14-18 months of age) underwent ligation of the
     femoral artery. Three days following the procedure, animals underwent BOLD MRI in the
30  presence of an NO challenge (10 jiM DEA/NO). In the absence of TSP 1, NO-driven blood
     flow changes showed a progressive increase to levels slightly above those found in the
    control limb (Fig. 55D). WT animals demonstrated a significant deficit in tissue blood flow
    responses to exogenous NO challenge following proximal ligation compared to the non
     operated limb (Fig. 55C). T2 maps showed dramatic differences in WT animals between
                                                      174

WO 2008/060785                                                               PCT/US2007/080647
    control and ischemic hind limbs (Fig. 55c). In contrast, blood flow was the same in ischemic
     and control hind limbs in TSP 1-null mice (Fig 55d).
              CD47 limits tissue survival to ischemia in aged animals. We have reported that
    the effects of TSP1 on tissue ischemia are mediated by CD47 (Isenberg et al., Circ Res.
 5   100:712-720, 2007). Following random myocutaneous flap surgery, tissue survival in
     senescent CD47-null mice (93 ± 4%) resembled levels obtained in aged TSP1-null animals
     (Fig. 56A). In contrast to the decrease with age in WT animals, flap tissue survival in CD47
    null animals did not decrease age (Fig. 56A).
              TSP1 and CD47 limit vasodilatory responses in aged animals. WT and CD47
10  null mice aged 2-4 months underwent mustard oil application to the right hind paw and
    perfusion measured by Doppler. Young WT and CD47-null animals demonstrated
     equivalent levels of hind paw perfusion under basal conditions (Fig. 56B, 56C). However,
    upon application of mustard oil, CD47-null animals experienced a marked increase of the
    baseline perfusion as compared to WT. Likewise, young TSP1-null mice demonstrated
15   enhanced perfusion in response to a mustard oil challenge compared to WT (Fig. 56D).
     Senescent CD47- and TSP1-null animals had 20-25 % greater perfusion compared to WT
     animals following mustard oil treatment, with persistence of perfusion gains over time (Fig.
     56E).
             Morpholino suppression of CD47 increases aged tissue survival after ischemia.
20  WT mice 14-18 months in age underwent random myocutaneous flaps and were treated
    with control vehicle, a CD47 morpholino (Figs. 61A, 61B) or control morpholino (data not
     shown) injected directly to the flap and wound bed at the time of surgery. Post-operative
    tissue survival was increased in animals treated with a CD47 morpholino as compared to
    control treated animals (91 ± 4% vs 31 ± 6 % respectively) (Fig. 57A). Control morpholino
25  treated flaps displayed degrees of tissue necrosis comparable to untreated aged WT animals.
    Interestingly, CD47 morpholino treated WT flaps demonstrated substantial remodeling of
     existing collateral flap vessels (Fig. 61C). Mitochondrial viability was markedly increased
    in flaps that received the CD47 morpholino as compared to vehicle, missense morpholino or
    untreated flaps (Fig. 57B).
30           Ischemic tissue necrosis in aged animals with atherosclerotic peripheral
    vascular disease is minimized by CD47 suppression. ApoE-null mice 12-16 months of
     age fed a high fat diet for a minimum of 8 months underwent flap elevation. On post
     operative day 7 apoE-null animals demonstrated significantly decreased tissue survival
    comparable to or even slightly worse than changes seen in WT animals of comparable age
35   (Figs. 61D, 61E). Despite diet induced atherosclerosis, these animals showed increased
                                                       175

     enlargement and plaque formation (Fig. 61 F).

    Discussion
             Altered tissue perfusion secondary to atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease is a
    common cause of numerous diseases of the elderly (Marin J., Mech Ageing Dev. 79:71-114,
     1995; Bilato et al., Aging (Milano). 8:221-234, 1996). Such vasculopathy is endemic in
10  Western societies (Sontheimer DL, Am Fam Physician 73:1971-1976, 2006). The
    consequences of atherosclerotic vascular disease in the elderly are altered blood flow
     (Mackey et al., Adv Cardiol.44:234-244, 2007) and inadequate delivery of nutrients and
     oxygen to tissues with attendant tissue ischemia, necrosis and loss. Even in the absence of
     atherosclerotic changes, age-related decreases in nitric oxide synthase activity (Muller-Delp
15  et al., Am JPhysiolHeart Circ Physiol. 283:H 1662-1672, 2002; Muller-Delp et al., Am J
    Physiol Heart Circ Physiol.282:H1843-1854, 2002) and cellular and tissue cGMP
     (Wheeler et al., Mol Cell Biochem. 169:115-124, 1997; Khatib et al., Mech Ageing Dev.
     101:21-32, 1998)can impair the ability of senescent vasculature to dilate, thereby limiting
    the delivery of blood to tissues.
20           Recently, we demonstrated that NO-driven relaxation of VSMC is regulated by
    TSP1 (Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793, 2006). In both endothelial and VSMC
     (Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793, 2006; Isenberg et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci US
    A. 102:13141-13146, 2005), TSP1 via CD47, blocks the ability of endogenous or exogenous
    NO to elevate cGMP levels. As a physiologic consequence, tissue perfusion in response to
25  NO is significantly greater in the absence of TSP1 or CD47 (Isenberg et al., Blood
     109:1945-1952, 2007). Although the absence of TSP1 or CD47 conferred a survival
     advantage on ischemic tissues in young animals (10-16 weeks of age), it was not clear that
    ischemia in the elderly or in the presence of age-associated vasculopathy would be
     ameliorated by blocking the TSP1-CD47 pathway.
30           In the present study we found that TSP1, in a CD47 dependent manner, limits
    ischemic tissue survival under conditions of advanced age and atherosclerotic vasculopathy.
    In the absence of TSP1 or CD47, senescent mice were able to maintain perfusion following
     an ischemic insult. The acute effects of TSP1/CD47 signaling on perfusion of aged ischemic
    tissues is consistent with the immediate enhancement of tissue perfusion in muscle units of
35  TSP1-null animals exposed to exogenous NO (Isenberg et al., Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007).
                                                       176

WO 2008/060785                                                             PCT/US2007/080647
    Even more remarkable, senescent TSP1 -null animals demonstrate a greater perfusion
    increase in response to exogenous NO than young WT animals (see Fig. 55D and Isenberg
    et al., Blood 109:1945-1952, 2007). Superior perfusion and tissue survival responses of aged
    TSP1- and CD47-null animals were observed consistently for random cutaneous flaps,
 5  hindlimb vascular ligation, and a noninvasive mustard oil/hind paw assay despite the
    comparable soft tissue vascular densities in wild type and null animals (Agah et al., Am J
    Pathol. 161:831-839, 2002). The NO-dependence for tissue survival of ischemic injury in
    WT animals is supported by positive effects of NO supplementation with ISDN and
    negative effects of NOS inhibition with L-NAME. In the absence of TSP1, tissue survival is
10   less sensitive to NO modulation. This is not surprising since TSP1 limits cGMP
     accumulation in both vascular cells (Isenberg et al., CardiovascRes. 71:785-793, 2006;
    Isenberg et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci US A. 102:13141-13146, 2005)and tissue (Fig. 52D,
     52E), and prior studies have documented increased tissue TSP1 levels with age (Riessen et
    al., Am Heart J. 135:357-364, 1998). Thus, we propose that the NO-insufficiency of aging
15  may be due to increased TSP1 antagonism of NO/cGMP signaling as well as loss of NOS
     activity.
               ApoE-null mice on a high-fat diet develop a hyperlipidemic state analogous to that
    in humans. Blood vessels of these mice show luminal narrowing and hypertrophy of the
    medial layers with atherosclerotic plaque (Li et al., Circulation 110:1701-1705, 2004).
20   Comparable atherosclerotic changes in people have been associated with decreased local
    NO production by vascular endothelium (Desjardins et al., Acta Clin Belg. 61:326-334,
    2006; Napoli et al., Nitric Oxide 15:265-279, 2006). Interestingly, TSP1 expression has
    been found to increase with age in atherosclerotic blood vessels (Riessen et al., Am Heart J.
     135:357-364, 1998; Favier et al., JPathol.207:358-366, 2005)and in several end organs
25   (Kang et al., Am JKidney Dis. 37:601-611, 2001; Hiscott et al., ProgRetin Eye Res. 25:1
     18, 2006; Buee et al., Am JPathol. 141:783-788, 1992). Morpholino suppression of CD47
    improved ischemic tissue survival in apoE-null animals in the presence of diet-induced
     atherosclerotic vasculopathy, and also in aged wild type animals. These results suggest that
    targeting of TSP1 or CD47 in regional vascular beds could improve tissue perfusion under
30  conditions of both advanced age and peripheral vascular disease.
    Example 9: Bioactivities of Additional TSP1-based Peptides
               NO is a prime physiologic regulator in mammals and can stimulate pro-survival and
    pro-angiogenic responses. The ability to selectively enhance or block NO-driven effects has
35  remained a therapeutic goal for decades. Discovery that TSP1 and TSP1-based agents can
                                                       177

    block NO-driven effects provides therapies that either synergize or antagonize NO. Both
     approaches permit the harnessing of NO as a therapeutic drug by selectively increasing or
     decreasing NO-driven cellular responses.
              This example demonstrates selected bioactivities of TSP1-based peptides.

    Methods
              Adhesion assay. Vascular cells (VSMC or endothelial) were plated at 10,000
    cells/well onto 96-well plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) precoated with type I collagen (3 gg/ml).
     Cells were incubated for 1 h in basal medium (lacking additives and serum) with 0.1% BSA
10   and the indicated concentrations of TSP1 and DEA/NO. Plates were then washed with PBS,
     fixed with glutaraldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and washed. Absorbed stain was
     solubilized with acetic acid from fixed cells and the resulting color signal determined on a
    MR580 Microelisa Auto Reader, (Dynatech, Alexandria, VA) at 450 nm wavelength.
              Intracellular cyclic nucleotide measurement. Vascular cells (endothelial) or HT
15   1080 cells (104 cells/well) grown overnight in 12-well culture in SM-GM containing 2%
    FCS or RPMI + 10 % FCS respectively and then weaned off serum over 48 h before
    treatment with NO donors and other agents in serum/additive free medium + 0.1% BSA.
    Intracellular cGMP levels were determined using an enzyme immunoassay (Amersham, GE
    Health Care, UK). In other experiments fresh washed human platelets were incubated in
20  Tyrode's buffer and the indicated treatment agents ± NO and cGMP determined.
    Results.
              NO-stimulated adhesion of VSMC and endothelial cells to collagen matrix is
    blocked by TSP1-based peptides C6b and C6d. VSMC and endothelial cells
25   demonstrated increased adhesion to type I collagen in the presence of NO (10 jiM
    DEA/NO), which was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by peptide C6b and C6d (Fig.
     62A, 62B).
              NO-stimulated cGMP flux in endothelial cells and platelets is blocked by
    peptides C6b and C6d. Endothelial cells (Fig. 62C) and platelets (Fig. 62D) in basal
30  medium without serum or Tyrode's buffer respectively were treated with the indicated
    peptides ± NO (10 jiM DEA/NO) and cGMP levels determined.
              NO-stimulated vascular cell adhesion to type I collagen is not blocked by
     several other TSP1-based peptides. HAVSMC were treated with several TSP1 based
    peptides C6e (Fig. 62F) and C6s (Fig. 62E) ± NO (DEA/NO 10 jiM), and adhesion to type I
                                                       178

WO 2008/060785                                                              PCT/US2007/080647
    collagen determined. The ability of NO to increase cell adhesion was not blocked by these
    peptides.
              NO-stimulated cGMP flux in HT-1080 cells is inhibited by several TSP1 based
    peptides. HT-1080 cells were plated in 12-well plates in RPMI medium, weaned off serum
 5   over 48 hrs and treated with the indicated peptides at the given concentrations and cGMP
     determined via immunoassay (Figs. 63A-C).
    Example 10: Peptide C6d promotes aggregation
10            This example demonstrates that TSP 1-derived peptides, such as C6d can be used to
    promote platelet aggregation by blocking effects of NO.
    Methods
              Fresh human platelets were suspended in Tyrode's buffer and under low shear
15  conditions thrombin-stimulated aggregation measured as described. Platelets were then
    treated with peptide C6d (1 gM) ± NO (10 gM DEA/NO) and thrombin and aggregation
    measure.
    Results:
20            Thrombin-stimulated aggregation under low shear conditions was markedly delayed
    by NO. Concurrent treatment with peptide C6d completely reversed the anti-coagulation
     effects on NO on thrombin-stimulated aggregation. See Figure 64.
              This example demonstrates that peptides based on the sequences of C6d (SEQ ID
    NO: 1), including C6b (SEQ ID NO: 7) and other peptides described herein, can promote
25  platelet aggregation and blood clotting. These peptides and similar peptides can be used to
     stop bleeding from congenital bleeding disorders and acquired bleeding disorders. The will
     also be effective as topically applied hemostatic agents and may be used directly or
    incorporated into wound dressings and bandages for use in emergency situations and in
    treating victims of trauma. They can be used in the operating room to achieve bleeding
30  control from large wound surfaces such as found during burn or liver surgery.
              This disclosure demonstrates that blocking CD47 and/or TSP1, and particular the
     functional interaction between these proteins, increases tissue survival to ischemia, alters
    platelet function and blood clotting, and influences and modulates responses to aging. The
35   disclosure further provides compositions and methods for exploiting these discoveries. It
