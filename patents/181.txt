   Abstract
   The invention concerns a mechanism for the moving and locking of slats of a slat
   arrangement, which are used in particular in building installations.
   The mechanism includes a coupling rod, which is arranged to be moved freely in liner
 5 fashion. The rod is provided with a catch pin that is guided inside an angled slot of a
   lever that in turn is secured to a shaft which is positively coupled to the slat to be
   rotated. Linear movement of the coupling rod is transformed into a rotational
   movement of the slat. At the same time the design / configuration of the slot causes a
   locking action after the slat has been closed so that it cannot be opened from the
10 outside.

   Mechanism for the movement and locking of slats of a slat arrangement
   1.       FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The invention concerns the configuration of a mechanism for moving and
 5 locking of slats of a slat arrangement which are used in particular in building
   installations.
   1A.     CROSS-REFERENCE TO EARLIER PATENT APPLICATIONS
           The present patent application claims Paris Convention priority from German
   patent application DE 10 2017 100 659. The contents and disclosure of the
10 specification of that patent application is incorporated herein by way of shorthand
   cross-reference.
   2.       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Slat arrangements, otherwise known in Australia as shutters or blinds, are
   generally comprised of a plurality of rotatable or pivotable slats which can be moved
15 back and forth by means of a movement or gear mechanism (or arrangement)
   between a closed and an open position. Depending on the size or function of the slat
   arrangement, it may be required to lock the same in the closed position. For example
   it is thus possible to decouple the movement mechanism and the drive mechanism
   from forces that are generated in the process of sealing the slat arrangement with
20 sealing elements against which the slats have to be pressed. With a suitable locking
   means it is, moreover, possible to protect the slat arrangement from the direct effect
   of wind loads, or to effectively prevent a forced opening from the outside. For
   aesthetic reasons, and for protection from the environment and to prevent dirt build
   up, the movement mechanism is preferably disposed inside the slat arrangement. It
25 is thus necessary to keep the entire arrangement for moving and locking the slats as
   compact as possible.
           A movement mechanism (or simply: movement), which incorporates a locking
   means and which is disposed within the frame of a slat arrangement, is disclosed in
   patent document DE 10 2009 005 594 B4. The movement consists of multiple levers
30 on both sides of the slats. The levers are attached to the slat via two revolute joints
   and to the frame via another two revolute joints. A further respective revolute joint

   connects the movement to a drive element, which is able to move in a linear manner
   inside the frame, and to two of the levers. The lengths of the levers and positioning of
   the revolute joints is chosen such as to enable a tilting and outwards movement of
   the slats during the opening and closing movement. In order to lock the slats in their
 5 closed position, one of the levers is provided with a hook-like end which, when
   closing the slat arrangement, engages with a bolt that is attached to the slat.
           One disadvantage of this movement is the relatively complex configuration
   and lay-out which requires 12 revolute joints per slat. The greater the number of
   joints in such a design, the greater is the level of maintenance required.
10          Patent document GB 1396285 A discloses a manually operated movement for
   a slat arrangement, in this case a window louvre. The slats are provided on both
   sides with a short shaft each, through which the pivoting axis of the slats extends.
           To facilitate the opening and closing of the slats, the shafts are pivotally
   supported in pivot bearings in the frame of the slat arrangement. In order to couple
15 the rotational movement of the individual slats, the end of one of the shafts on one
   side of the slats is attached to two coupling rods that are able to move in an
   antiparallel manner. The coupling rods are moveably engaged with two pins that are
   oriented axially parallel to the axis of rotation, wherein said pins are attached to the
   respective shaft on both sides of the rotating axis. A plate with a slot-like cut-out is
20 attached to one of the coupling rods between the pivot bearings of two adjacent slats.
   An operating lever with handle is pivotally attached in approximately the same
   position on the other coupling rod. On the side of the pivoting point opposite the
   handle, the operating lever is provided with a catch that engages with the slot-like
   cut-out in the plate. The catch is implemented as a rotatable roller on a bolt. As a
25 result of the rotating motion of the operating lever, the coupling rods are moved
   antiparallel via the bearing of the operating lever and via the catch that is guided
   inside the cut-out. Said movement is transferred by means of the pins to the shafts,
   which causes all slats that are attached to the coupling rods to be moved around
   their axes of rotation.
30         To be able to lock the slats in their closed position, the otherwise linearly
   extending, slot-like cut-out is provided with an angled end. This is where the catch of
   the operating lever is located in the closed state of the slat arrangement. To provide
   the locking function, the angled end and the catch are positioned such in relation to

   the pivoting point of the operating lever that the catch, prior to reaching the angled
   end, must pass an inversion point after which the operating lever is retained in the
   locked position through a force that is extended by the slats. The location of the
   inversion point is where the catch moves past an imagined connecting line that
 5 extends perpendicular to the movement vector of the coupling rods towards the
   pivoting point of the operating lever. The force that is extended by the slats is in this
   instance caused by the counter-pressure of the elastic sealing elements against
   which the slats are placed in the closed state. The inversion point can only be
   overcome by the manual rotating motion of the operating lever, which makes it
10 impossible to open the slat arrangement from outside. The locking action would also
   work with a linearly extending cut-out, without the angled end. However, the angled
   end makes it possible to shorten the path of the operating lever that is required to
   achieve the locked position. One disadvantage is that after the inversion point has
   been passed, the force acting on the sealing elements in the closed position is
15 reduced again, which may have a negative effect on the sealing effect of the slat
   arrangement.
           Depending    on   the   size  of  the  slat arrangement,     it may    also   be
   disadvantageous that only one movement is provided for the locking of slats which
   are coupled via the coupling rods. The sealing of the entire slat arrangement with the
20 elastic sealing elements requires a certain contact pressure. The resulting motion
   resistance may cause a rather large mechanical load for the single movement
   mechanism or arrangement.
           In the implemented principle of the movement, five revolute joints per slat are
   required to be able to transfer the rotational movement, wherein greater tolerances
25 must be allowed for for the moveable connection between the coupling rods and the
   pins, which poses an additional difficulty for providing a reliable sealing of the slat
   arrangement.
          Against this background, it would be advantageous to provide a movement
   and locking mechanism for slats of a slat arrangement (such as horizontal or vertical
30 blinds, shutters or louvres for windows, doors and the like of a building) which is low
   in maintenance and consists of as few as possible and simple parts (components).

   5.     DETAILED       DESCRIPTION       OF   PREFERRED         EMBODIMENT       OF THE
   INVENTION
          The arrangement (or mechanism) for movement and locking of slats of a slat
25 arrangement comprises, according to Fig. 1, a pivot bearing 1 with an axis of rotation
   10. The pivot bearing 1 has the shape of a cylindrical sleeve which is fixed to a frame
   11 (shown only partially in the Figures) of the not-depicted slat arrangement, the
   frame providing the support structure for the entire slat arrangement.
          At pivot bearing 1 is received a shaft 2 for rotation about axis of rotation 10.
30 The shaft 2 is provided with a first end-face 21 and a second end-face 22. The first
   end-face 21 faces a slat 7 (depicted in the Figures by a dotted line) of the slat

   arrangement. A connecting piece 3 is non-rotatably attached to the first end-face 21.
   The connecting piece 3 is a parallelepiped-shaped body with which an interlocking
   and frictional connection to slat 7 can be established. The second end-face 22 of
   shaft 2 is provided with a coaxially-disposed profile extension 23 to provide an
 5 interlocking and frictional connection to a coupling element.
            The coupling element is attached to the second end-face 22 of the shaft 2.
   The coupling element is provided in form of a lever 4 made from a strip-like, flat
   material that comprises a fixed end 41 and a moveable end 42. The lever 4 is
   disposed flat against the second end-face 22 with its fixed end 41, and is non
10 rotatably attached to shaft 2 through an interlocking connection with the profile
   extension 23.
            Disposed at the moveable end 42 is a slot-like cut-out 43 that extends through
   the lever 4 in the direction of the axis of rotation 10. The cut-out 43 has a constant
   width b. Along its length, the cut-out 43 is angled to include angle a. At apex S of the
15 angle a the cut-out 43 is 'split' into a straight first leg 44 and a straight second leg 45.
   In other words, the two straight legs44, 45 join each other at an angle a. The first leg
   44, which extends from the apex S to the fixed end 41, is disposed in radial direction
   with respect to the axis of rotation 10. The second leg 45, which extends from the
   apex S to the moveable end 42, extends as a passant with respect to the axis of
20 rotation 10, wherein said second leg 45 is oriented such that it changes from the
   radial direction, as per the depiction in Fig. 1, at the angle Xin clockwise direction.
            A cylindrical catch pin 5 is disposed axially parallel to the axis of rotation 10
   that engages in the cut-out 43. It is provided with a slightly smaller diameter than the
   width b of the cut-out 43 so that it is able to move inside the slot-like cut-out 43 with
25 little play.
            The catch pin 5 is solidly attached to a catch pin retainer 51. The catch pin
   retainer 51 is a parallelepiped-shaped body that is adjustably attached to a coupling
   rod 6.
            The coupling rod 6 is disposed with its axis along the frame 11, orthogonal to
30 the axis of rotation 10 and at an axial distance to the axis of rotation 10. The coupling
   rod 6 has a circular cross-section and is linearly moveably supported along its axis at
   two slide bearings 61. The slide bearings 61 are disposed along the coupling rod 6,

   symmetrical at both sides of the pivot bearing 1, and are solidly connected to the
   frame 11.
          The catch pin retainer 51, which supports the catch pin 5, is located on the
   coupling rod 6 between the pivot bearings. To facilitate this, the catch pin retainer 51
 5 is provided with a through-hole with which it is slid onto the coupling rod 6. The
   attachment of the catch pin retainer 51 on the coupling rod 6 is detachable by means
   of grub screws 52, which are screwed in in radial direction to the coupling rod.
          To carry out a controlled movement of the slat 7 between an opened and a
   closed and locked state, the coupling rod 6 is attached to a linear actuator 8. Suitable
10 linear actuators 8 are known from prior art and are not described here any further.
   The linear actuator 8 is used to linearly move the coupling rod 6 inside the slide
   bearings 61.
           Figures 1 to 3 depict the design of a vertically oriented slat arrangement (not
   shown) in the closed and locked state. In the closed state, the coupling rod 6 is
15 located at an upper end-position 0. In the upper end-position 0, the catch pin 5 is
   disposed above an imaginary horizontal line H through the axis of rotation 10 of the
   pivot bearing 1 and is located inside the second leg 45.
          Considering the forces required to move the slat 7, as well as considering the
   requirement for keeping the arrangement as small as possible for integration into the
20 frame 11 of the slat arrangement, the axial distance between the axis of rotation 10
   and the coupling rod 6 and thus also the lever 4 are designed to be as small as
   possible. In the closed state, the lever 4 is at an approximate angle of 450 relative to
   the imaginary horizontal line H.
          The angle a and a radius r of the apex S to the axis of rotation 10 are matched
25 to each other. In the embodiment shown in the Figures, the chosen value of the
   radius r = 45 mm and the value of the angle a = 45*. Other values for the radius r and
   the angle a are possible within the range of the angle a from >00 to <900; whereby
   taking account of the above-stated requirements and of the usual opening angles of
   slats of a slat arrangement, only angles in the range between 300 and 600 are
30 meaningful. The values for the angle a should be chosen such that the second leg 45
   extends parallel to the coupling rod 6 in the closed state. Due to the shape of this
   path, the slat 7 is locked against opening from the outside.

            If an attempt is made to twist the slat 7 through an external force, said force is
   transferred from shaft 2 via the lever 4 to the catch pin 5. The torque acting on the
   catch pin 5 is directed almost perpendicular to the extension of the coupling rod 6
   due to the orientation of the second leg 45. The applied force is transferred via the
 5 catch pin retainer 51 and the coupling rod 6 radially to the slide bearings 61 and into
   the frame 11. A portion of the force that acts in axial direction on the coupling rod 6 is
   so negligibly small, if it exists at all, that it is not possible to transfer the force acting
   from outside to the slat 7 and onto the coupling rod 6. Thus the linear actuator 8 that
   is attached to the coupling rod 6 does not require high retaining forces, which means
10 that it may be designed as a correspondingly small and low-cost item.
            In the controlled movement during opening of the slat 7, the coupling rod 6 is
   moved downwards from the upper end-position 0. Following the coupling rod 6, the
   catch pin 5 is moved downwards inside the second leg 45. The displacement inside
   the straight second leg 45 takes place without overcoming any force, as it is
15 generated, for example, at the apex by the slats 7 known from the prior art. Since the
   second leg 45 extends parallel to the coupling rod 6, the displacement inside the
   second leg 45 does initially not cause a movement of the slat 7. Once the catch pin 5
   reaches the first leg 44 at the apex S, as shown in Fig. 3, the displacement of the
   catch pin 5 inside cut-out 43 is continued inside the first leg 44. Due to the angle a
20 with which the second leg 45 deviates from the radial track of the first leg 44, the
   catch pin 5 impacts on the wall of the cut-out 43 in the first leg 44. This causes the
   lever 4 to be moved together with the catch pin 5 so that the shaft 2 is made to rotate
   around the axis of rotation 10 and the slat 7 is opened.
            The controlled movement of the slat 7 may be continued until the lower end
25 position U of the coupling rod 6 is reached. In the lower end-position U, the slat 7 is
   in the open state. The locations of the upper and lower end-positions 0 and U
   depend on the desired location of the slat 7 in the open and closed state and will be
   determined by the configuration of the linear actuator 8.
            It is possible for the catch pin 5 to reach the lower end-position U to move past
30 the imaginary horizontal line H. When moving past the horizontal line H, the catch pin
   5 comes tangentially closer to the axis of rotation 10. The distance a between the
   axis of rotation 10 and the end of the first leg 44 is therefore chosen such that the
   first leg 44 does not limit the tangential approach.

           Each of the Figures 1 to 3 only shows one arrangement for the movement and
   locking of one slat 7. It is understood that in a slat arrangement with a plurality of
   slats 7, each slat 7 is connected with one lever 4, one catch pin retainer 51 and one
   catch pin 5 to the coupling rod 6. Multiple slide bearings 61 are provided to facilitate
 5 the linearly moveable support of the coupling rod 6. The number of slide (ie friction)
   bearings 61 corresponds at least to the number of slats 7, wherein the slide bearings
   61 are disposed symmetrically between the pivot bearings 10 of the slats 7. All slats
   7 of the slat arrangement are moved collectively due by propelling of the coupling rod
   6.
10        A further embodiment (not shown) for a slat arrangement with a plurality of
   slats 7 foresees that every slat 7 is fitted on its lengthwise opposite ends with an
   arrangement for moving and locking according to the Figures 1 to 3. The two
   coupling rods 6 are then redirected in the lower or upper section of the slat
   arrangement and moved via a single, horizontally disposed linear actuator.
15         In a slat arrangement with a plurality of slats 7, the advantages of the
   detachable fixing of the catch pin retainer 51 to the coupling rod 6 become apparent
   because it makes the independent adjustment of the individual slats 7 possible.
