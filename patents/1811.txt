                             STERILIZATION REACTOR AND METHOD
 5                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [001]            The invention relates to systems and methods to reduce a number of
   microorganisms in a liquid; more particularly, the invention relates to systems and methods that
   use a change in liquid pressure and/or temperature to kill, or mitigate the growth of,
   microorganisms, such as bacteria. The system and method can be used for liquid products or
10 substances in any industry, such as the food or pharmacological industries.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [002]            There is a known method of liquid product thermal treatment intended to destroy
   or decrease the amount of harmful microorganisms (also referred to herein simply as
   microorganisms) wherein microorganisms are killed by mixing liquid product with a heating
15 medium (e.g., sterile water steam) thereby heating the liquid product, and maintaining it at a
   temperature that ensures pasteurization or sterilization.
   [003]            One drawback of this known method is that the liquid product mixes with water
   when steam condenses during the process of product cooling. This increases product mass on
   average by about 30% and as a result water removal is necessary. The water removal generally
20 requires additional equipment, processing steps, time and expense. Another drawback of this
   known method is potential deterioration of product quality and taste after pasteurization due to
   destruction of vitamins and protein coagulation because of the temperature to which the product
   is raised.
   [004]            Another known method with similar technical characteristics is one in which
25 liquid product is mixed with a heating medium of condensing steam, and the liquid product is
   heated at a rate of about 14000 C/sec or more for pasteurization and about 76000 C/sec or more
   for sterilization to a temperature not exceeding the temperature at which qualitative changes in
   liquid product takes place (such qualitative changes and temperatures being known to those
   skilled in the art). The product is diffused into drops preferably not exceeding 0.3 mm in
30 diameter (this process is described in Russian Patent No. 2,052,967, the disclosure of which that
   is not inconsistent with the disclosure herein, is incorporated by reference). This method
   promotes efficient thermal treatment of the liquid product, sufficiently kills microorganisms and
   does not adversely impact the qualitative aspects of the liquid product, because it increases the
   rate at which the liquid product is heated and only maintains the product at a high temperature
35 for a short duration. The liquid product is heated only to a temperature lower than that which
                                                      1

    WO 2014/160020                                                                PCT/US2014/025637
   does not affect qualitative changes in the liquid product. This method is performed in a
   pasteurization device, which contains a liquid product diffuser, a pasteurization chamber, a
   nozzle for steam, a steam generator, a cooling chamber, and a vacuum pump.
   [005]            A drawback of this method is that it does not exclude mixing of product with
 5 steam condensate, which can adversely impact the stability of organoleptic and physicochemical
   properties (such as taste, odor, color and consistency) of such liquid products, which include, for
   example, non-frozen concentrate ("NFC") juices and dairy products, and it does not guarantee
   the necessary destruction of microorganisms that are heat resistant.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10 [006]            The purpose of the invention is to create an efficient liquid product pressure
   and/or temperature treatment method and device that promotes organoleptic and
   physicochemical stability of liquid products. It has been discovered that providing a flat stream
   (or "flat spray") of liquid between substantially parallel, heated surfaces of an interior cavity of a
   reactor increases the efficacy and throughput of the treatment method and system, and overall
15 operational costs are reduced as compared to related devices and methods.
   [007]            In accordance with various embodiments of the invention, a reactor for sterilizing,
   treating, pasteurizing, and/or otherwise reducing the number of microorganisms in a liquid, such
   as a liquid food substance, includes an interior cavity that is preferably defined by two
   substantially parallel surfaces (as used hereafter, the term "parallel" means substantially
20 parallel), an entrance to the interior cavity, one or more heating sources for each of the parallel
   surfaces, and a nozzle at the entrance of the interior cavity to provide a flat spray of the liquid
   into the interior cavity between the parallel surfaces. The parallel surfaces and interior cavity are
   preferably vertically oriented so the liquid spray remains substantially between the surfaces
   during a treatment process. The reactor may also include a pump for lowering the pressure in the
25 interior cavity, and one or more ports for introducing a heating medium (such as steam or hot
   air).
   [008]            A reactor according to aspects of the invention may include more than two heated,
   parallel surfaces. In that case, an inner cavity may be defined between each two adjacent parallel
   surfaces, and at least one nozzle that produces a flat stream of liquid located at the entrance of
30 each interior cavity. In accordance with various aspects of these embodiments, the interior
   surfaces are preferably orientated in a vertical configuration, such that the flat spray of liquid
   moves inside the interior cavity in between and substantially parallel to the inner surfaces. In
   accordance with further aspects, one or more nozzles introduce a flat spray into each entrance,
   and preferably into the center of each inner cavity.

    WO 2014/160020                                                                 PCT/US2014/025637
   [009]             A reactor according to the invention may further include a reservoir to collect the
   treated liquid. In a preferred embodiment, the reservoir is at the bottom of the reactor.
   [010]             Further, another aspect of the invention is a nozzle that converts a generally
   cylindrical stream of fluid into a flat stream. The nozzle preferably includes an interior structure
 5 (e.g., a flat, disc-shaped plate) to convert the stream from a cylindrical or conical stream to a flat
   spray that enters the interior cavity between the parallel inner surfaces. In a particularly
   preferred embodiment the cylindrical stream of liquid flows in one direction and is converted to
   a flat stream traveling in another direction.
   [011]             In accordance with additional embodiments of the invention, a process for treating
10 (e.g., pasteurizing, sterilizing or otherwise reducing the number of microorganisms in) a liquid,
   such as a liquid food substance, includes providing a reactor having a cavity preferably between
   two parallel surfaces, creating a vacuum within the cavity, heating the two parallel surfaces, and
   introducing a flat spray of liquid into the cavity between the parallel surfaces. In accordance
   with exemplary aspects of these embodiments, the two parallel walls are heated to substantially
15 the same temperature in order to uniformly heat the liquid passing through the inner cavity. In
   accordance with further aspects, the pressure drop of the liquid entering the nozzle to the liquid
   entering the interior cavity preferably varies between about 105 Pa/sec to 1010 Pa/sec. In
   accordance with yet further aspects, the process preferably includes diffusing the liquid into
   drops (preferably into drops not exceeding about 0.3 mm in diameter) and exposing the liquid to
20 a speed of pressure variation of about 105 Pa/sec, or 105 Pa/sec to 1010 Pa/sec, or about 1010
   Pa/sec, or more. In accordance with further aspects, the speed of the drops exiting the nozzle
   may be about 105 m/sec or more and the pressure drop occurs during diffusion of the liquid into
   the inner cavity as it exits the nozzle. The liquid is diffused utilizing the nozzle and may be
   maintained at one pressure on one side of the nozzle (the pressure being measurable and
25 controllable, preferably by using a pump) and is released when the liquid diffused into the inner
   cavity on the other side of the nozzle. The pressure inside the reactor may also be regulated and,
   if it is, the pressure may be regulated by the use of a vacuum pump.
   [012]             In accordance with various aspects of the exemplary device and method set forth
   herein, the liquid product may be exposed to additional heating. If so, the additional heating may
30 be performed in the reactor cavity or chamber as the liquid product is diffused and can be done
   utilizing superheated steam or any other suitable heating method or medium (other options
   include ultrasonic frequency, infrared light and hot air). If steam or another medium is used it
   may be introduced into the chamber through a separate port and delivered in the same direction
   as the liquid product, or in the opposite direction, or any direction. Further, the rate of heating
                                                        3

    WO 2014/160020                                                                  PCT/US2014/025637
   the liquid product preferably does not exceed 1100 0 C/sec, but any rate of heating can be utilized
   that sufficiently kills the required number of microorganisms and that does not heat the liquid
   product to a temperature at which its qualitative attributes are adversely affected.
   [013]            In another embodiment, the interior chamber is maintained at a temperature of
 5 between about 48'C and 82'C, and preferably between about 50'C-75'C, and most preferably
   from about 560 C-720 C. Such temperatures are most preferably below the heat required for HTST
   pasteurization of a liquid. In preferred embodiments, the temperature of the liquid before it
   enters the nozzle is about 100C-20'C less than the temperature of the liquid when it enters the
   interior cavity.
10 [014]            An embodiment of the invention also includes a nozzle for converting a high
   pressure cylindrical or conical stream of liquid flowing in a first direction to a flat stream of the
   liquid flowing in a second direction. The nozzle includes an inlet at a first end, a tapered end, a
   conduit therebetween, and an interior structure proximate the tapered end, the interior structure
   being generally flat and including a cutout to form a flat spray of liquid received from the
15 tapered end. The second direction may be perpendicular to the first direction.
   [015]            The invention provides a highly efficient, cost effective treatment method and
   device without significant changes in their organoleptic or physicochemical features.

    WO 2014/160020                                                                 PCT/US2014/025637
                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
   [022]            The description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention provided
   below is merely exemplary and is intended for purposes of illustration only; the following
   description is not intended to limit the scope of the invention disclosed herein.
 5 [023]            As set forth in more detail below, an exemplary reactor and method can be used to
   treat a liquid, such as a food substance, to pasteurize, sterilize or otherwise reduce the amount of
   microorganisms in a liquid in a cost-effective and efficacious manner. The reactor and process
   have a relatively high throughput compared to similar treatment devices and processes, because
   the device and process described herein are configured to efficiently heat a flat stream of liquid.
10 By making the reactor walls flat and creating an interior cavity between them, many more
   interior cavities can be formed within a given volume than with previous reactors, which are
   generally large, open vessels. Further, because the inner surfaces of the reactor preferably are
   substantially parallel and a flat spray of liquid to be treated is preferably introduced between
   them, the heat from the inner surfaces more efficiently heat the liquid. As an example if a
15 current reactor has a volume the size of a room, numerous reactors according to aspects the
   invention could fit into the same space, and significantly more liquid could be treated over a
   given period of time in the same amount of space.
   [024]            The reactor and method described herein may be used to treat a variety of liquids
   and may be particularly well suited for the treatment of food substances, such as dairy, non
20 frozen concentrate juices, and the like. As used herein "flat stream" or "flat spray" means a
   spray that is substantially planer. By way of examples, the spray may be substantially planer in a
   first direction and an angle of the spray in a direction perpendicular to the first direction may be
   about twenty degrees or less, about ten degrees or less, about five degrees or less or about two
   degrees or less. The spray is preferably about 5mm to 30mm thick.
25 [025]            FIG. 1 illustrates a reactor 100 in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the
   disclosure. As shown, the walls, surfaces and interior cavity of this embodiment are vertically
   oriented. Reactor 100 as shown includes two heated, parallel surfaces 102, 104, a heating source
   and a nozzle 112. Reactor 100 may include additional walls, not illustrated, to form an interior
   cavity 110 within the reactor. The interior cavity may be hermetically sealed. Reactor 100 may
30 also optionally include a reservoir 116 to collect the liquid. Reactor 100 may additionally
   include one or more ports to introduce steam or other heated fluid, such as air, to interior cavity
   110. Optionally, it may also include a vacuum source 114, which is preferably a vacuum pump.
   [026]            During operation of reactor 100, pressurized liquid is introduced to an entrance of
   reactor 100, e.g., near or at the top of reactor 100, via nozzle 112, and the liquid is projected
                                                       5

    WO 2014/160020                                                                 PCT/US2014/025637
   downward as a flat spray between the inner surfaces 106, 108, respectively of walls 102, 104.
   As the liquid enters interior cavity 110, the liquid undergoes a rapid change in pressure and/or
   temperature. The liquid is preferably heated via radiant heat from surfaces 106, 108. Providing
   a flat spay of liquid to interior cavity 110 allows rapid heating of the liquid, which reduces or
 5 eliminates the need for any additional heated fluid, such as air or steam, to be added to heat the
   liquid. Because less or no additional fluid is required to heat the treated liquid, as compared to
   other systems that use steam, less capital investment is required to treat the liquid, because less
   water would have to be removed from the treated liquid if it were heated using steam.
   [027]            Although not illustrated, a system including reactor 100 may include an additional
10 optional heat source, such as a steam generator, a hot air source, infrared radiation or any other
   suitable heating method. An exemplary system including an additional heat source and a cooling
   chamber is disclosed in United States Patent No. 7,708,941, the contents of which are hereby
   incorporated herein by reference, to the extent such contents do not conflict with the present
   disclosure.
15 [028]            Referring again to FIG. 1, each wall 102, 104 has an interior surface, 106, 108,
   respectively. An interior cavity 110 between interior surfaces 106, 108 defines at least part of an
   interior cavity within reactor 100. Walls that are heated and/or walls that are not heated may
   define any remaining portion of interior cavity 110. The walls may be coupled together using
   any suitable technique, such as welding, or the walls may be integrally formed. By way of one
20 example, walls 102, 104 may have dimensions of 1200 mm x 1200 mm and a spacing between
   the walls may be about 60 mm. Walls 102, 104 may be formed of any suitable material, such as
   stainless steel and have any suitable dimension or space between them.
   [029]            In the illustrated example, wall 102 and wall 104 are vertical and the liquid to be
   treated travels from an entrance between walls 102, 104 downward towards the bottom of the
25 reactor 100 and may be collected in reservoir 116. Because the liquid preferably travels in a
   substantially vertical direction, it tends to remain in the center of the inner cavity and be evenly
   heated.
   [030]            In another embodiment not illustrated, the walls may not be parallel, but may be
   in the shape of an inverted "V," with them being closest at the top where the flat liquid spray is
30 introduced. Alternatively, they could be formed in a "V" shape with them being farthest apart at
   the top where the flat liquid spray is introduced.
   [031]            Interior surfaces 106, 108 of walls 102, 104 may be heated to the same or
   different temperatures using a variety of techniques. For example, walls 102, 104 may be heated
   using one or more heating elements, such as heating jackets (e.g., steam or other heated fluid
                                                       6

     WO 2014/160020                                                                PCT/US2014/025637
   jackets) around one or more of an exterior or interior of the walls. Alternatively, walls 102, 104
   may be heated using electric heat or by having heated fluid pass through an interior portion of
   the walls. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention, walls 102, 104 are
   heated to a temperature of about 150 0 F-2000 F, although they may be heated to any suitable
 5 temperature.
    [032]           Although reactor 100 is illustrated with two parallel, vertical walls, a reactor in
   accordance with the present invention may have greater than two walls and a plurality of interior
   cavities, one being between every two wall surfaces. Each interior cavity defined by two wall
   surfaces may have one or more nozzles at the entrance to the cavity, such that the flat stream
10 exiting the one or more nozzles is projected substantially into the center of the interior cavity,
   equal-distant from each wall surface.
    [033]          Nozzle 112 is located at an entrance to interior cavity 110. Nozzle 112 converts
   an incoming stream of liquid (e.g., a cylindrical or conical stream) flowing in a first direction to a
   flat stream flowing in a second direction. In the illustrated example, the second direction is
15 perpendicular to the first direction. FIG. 3 illustrates exemplary nozzle 112 in greater detail.
   Nozzle 112 includes an inlet 302 at a first end 304, a tapered end 306 at an end of a conduit 308
   between first end 302 and tapered end 306. Inlet 302 and conduit 308 may have a diameter
   between about 1 and 3 mm. Nozzle 112 also includes an interior structure 310 that receives
   liquid from conduit 308 or tapered end 306 (e.g., in a cylindrical or conical pattern) and converts
20 the liquid to a flat spray pattern, as illustrated in FIG.2, which exits at end 312 of interior
   structure 310. The thickness of the flat spray exiting the nozzle may be no more than 5mm, no
   more than 10mm, no more than 20mm, or no more than 30mm.
    [034]           Interior structure 310 may include, for example, a flat plate, which may be in the
   shape of a disc. Interior structure 310 includes a leading edge 318 distal to end 312. In
25 accordance with exemplary aspects of these embodiments, the pressure change from the leading
   edge to the trailing edge is at least about 105 Pa/sec to 1010 Pa/sec. The volume of the liquid
   exiting nozzle 112 may be, for example between about 500 1/hr to 1000 1/hr or more. Nozzle 112
   may be formed of any suitable material, such as food-grade stainless steel.
    [035]          Nozzle 112 may be attached to one or more walls 102, 104 using any suitable
30 technique. By way of example, nozzle 112 may include a gasket ring 314, a clamping disc 316,
   and a fastening mechanism, such as a screw 318 to secure nozzle 112 to wall 104. Nozzle 112
   may be fastened, such that spray from nozzle 112 is centered between the surfaces 106, 108,
   respectively, of walls 102 and 104, as illustrated in FIGS. 1-2.

    WO 2014/160020                                                                PCT/US2014/025637
   [036]           In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention, nozzle 112 is
   designed to create drops having a diameter generally not exceeding about 0.3 mm (although it is
   possible that some drops would exceed this diameter even in the preferred embodiment). A
   speed of the drops in reactor may be about 10 m/sec or more, although this may vary according
 5 to desired operating parameters.
   [037]           Vacuum source 114 may include any suitable vacuum pump. Vacuum source or
   pump 114 may be configured to maintain a pressure in interior cavity 110 of any suitable
   amount, and preferably from below one atmosphere to about 0.25 Pa. The pressure in interior
   cavity 110 is selected to maintain a rapid pressure drop per time to kill microorganisms when the
10 liquid exits the nozzle and enters the interior cavity.
   [038]           The pressure differential rate to which liquid is subjected can vary widely. For
   example, the pressure differential rate may be about 105Pa/sec or more or about 109Pa/sec or
   more, or between 105Pa/sec to 101 0Pa/sec. To provide a desired pressure differential, liquid
   entering nozzle 112 may be pressurized.
15 [039]           FIG. 4 illustrates a method 400 of treating a liquid in accordance with additional
   embodiments of the invention. Method 400 includes the steps of providing a reactor having
   cavity between two parallel walls (step 402), heating each of the two parallel walls (step 406),
   and introducing a flat spray of liquid (e.g., liquid food product) into the cavity (step 408).
   Although not illustrated, method 400 may also include creating a vacuum in the interior cavity,
20 treatment of the liquid product with chemically active gases, or components, or substances, such
   as one or more chemically active gases including one or more of the group consisting of oxygen,
   chlorine and fluorine that kill bacteria.
   [040]           Step 402 include the step of providing a reactor having at least two parallel walls.
   The reactor may be reactor 100, as described above, and may include more than two parallel
25 walls.
   [041]           In step 406, the parallel walls of the reactor are heated. As noted above, the walls
