                   VEHICLE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
                          BACKGROUND ART
[0001]     The present invention relates to a vehicle
communication system that transmits vehicle information.
[0002]    A   known communication device transmits vehicle
information relating to a vehicle from the vehicle to an
information center.    Such a communication  device  is,   for
example, a mobile terminal installed in a vehicle and uses a
vehicle identification number that is    added to the vehicle as
information for identifying the vehicle     (refer to,   for
example, US Patent No.    7319848).
[0003]     The vehicle identification number added to the
vehicle is assigned when the vehicle is manufactured and is
not related to communication devices and on-board devices.
Therefore, a vehicle that can perform communication using the
vehicle identification number is    limited to a vehicle
provided with a communication device storing the vehicle
identification number.
                              SUMMARY
[0004]     It  is an object of the present invention to provide
a vehicle communication system that increases versatility for
the communication of vehicle information.
[0005]     To achieve the above object, a vehicle
communication system includes a first on-board device
installed in a vehicle and a first communication device
configured to be connected to the first on-board device.
Individual identification information used to identify the
first communication device as an individual communication
terminal is added to the first communication device.         The
first communication device is configured to transmit the
individual identification information to the first on-board
                                 1

device.  The first on-board device is configured to associate
vehicle information of the vehicle with the individual
identification information and transmit the vehicle
information associated with the individual identification
information to an information device via the first
communication device.
[0006]     To achieve the above object, a vehicle
communication system includes a first on-board device
installed in a vehicle, a first communication device
configured to be connected to the first on-board device, and
a second communication device configured to be connected to
the first on-board device.   Individual identification
information used to identify the first communication device
as an individual communication terminal is   added to the first
communication device.   The first communication device is
configured to transmit the individual identification
information to the first on-board device.   The first on-board
device is configured to associate vehicle information of the
vehicle with the individual identification information and
transmit the vehicle information associated with the
individual identification information to an information
device via the second communication device.

           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
[0019]    First Embodiment
                               3

[0020]    A  first embodiment of a vehicle communication
system will now be described with reference to the drawings.
[0021]    The vehicle communication system includes a
plurality of ECUs   (electronic control units),    which serves as
on-board devices,  and an on-board communication device.      Each
of the plurality of ECUs transmits the vehicle information it
manages from the on-board communication device to a center
that manages vehicle information relating to a plurality of
vehicles.  The  center serves as an information device.      In
this system, a communication ID unique to the on-board
communication device is   shared in advance among the ECUs that
upload vehicle information.     Further, each of these ECUs
associates the communication ID with the vehicle information
that it manages and uploads    the vehicle information
associated with the communication ID to the center via the
on-board communication device.     Upon receipt of the vehicle
information from the on-board communication device, the
center stores the received vehicle information in a vehicle
information database.   The center manages different kinds of
vehicle information received from the plurality of ECUs
separately for each vehicle using the communication ID
associated with the vehicle information as a key.       Each ECU
or the on-board communication device may be configured as a
circuitry that includes   (1) one or more processors that are
run by a computer program    (software),  (2) one or more
dedicated hardware circuits such as ASIC, or      (3) a
combination of the above.    Each of the processor includes a
CPU and a memory such as a RAM and a ROM, and the memory
stores program codes or instructions configured to execute
processing with the CPU.    The memory,  or computer   readable
medium, includes any available media that     is accessible by a
versatile or dedicated computer.
                                 4

[0022]      Specifically, as illustrated in Fig.      1, examples of
the ECUs that upload vehicle information include a navigation
ECU 100   and an audio ECU 200.    The navigation ECU 100        is an
ECU that controls a car navigation system and performs route
guidance from the current location to a destination or the
like.   The audio ECU 200 is an ECU that controls an audio
system for playing music in the passenger compartment.
[0023]      The navigation ECU 100    includes, for example, a CPU
110  (central processing unit),     a ROM 120  (read-only memory),
a RAM 130    (random access memory),   an I/O port   140     (input
output port),    and a communication controller 150,        all of
which are connected to each other via a communication bus
NW1.
[0024]      The audio ECU 200 includes, for example, a CPU 210,
a ROM 220,    a RAM 230,  an I/O port 240,  and a communication
controller 250 that are connected to one another by a
communication bus NW2.
[0025]      The communication controller 150     of the navigation
ECU 100   and the communication controller 250 of the audio ECU
200  are connected to a vehicle     network NW3.   Specifically,       in
addition to the navigation ECU 100 and the audio ECU 200 that
upload vehicle information, the plurality of ECUs include
ECUs 300   that do not upload vehicle information and are
connected to each other via the vehicle network NW3.
Further, the ECUs 100,     200, and 300 transmit and receive
various   sensor data and vehicle information such as control
data through the vehicle network NW3.       In this embodiment,
the vehicle network NW3 transmits and receives vehicle
information in accordance with a communications protocol
specified by a CAN     (controller area network).
[0026]      The navigation ECU 100    and the audio ECU 200 are
connected to an on-board communication device 400 via the
vehicle network NW3.     The on-board communication device 400
                                  5

includes, for example,  a CPU 410,   a ROM 420,  a RAM 430,  an
I/O port 440, a communication controller 450,     and an external
interface 460 that communicates with the outside of the
vehicle, all of which are connected to one another by a
communication bus NW4.   The external interface 460 uses a
communication ID 400A stored in the ROM 420     to establish
communication with the outside of the vehicle.      In this case,
an ID such as International Mobile Equipment Identity      (IMEI),
used to identify the on-board communication device 400      in a
network may be used as the communication ID 400A.
Alternatively, the communication ID 400A may be a number
assigned to each user by the operator of an information
server.  For example, when an on-board communication device
is set to access the server of a certain corporation, the ID
may be assigned to the on-board communication device by the
server of the corporation.    The IMEI  is  a communication ID
unique to the on-board communication device 400      and is fixed
regardless of changes in a network environment established
between the on-board communication device 400 and the outside
of the vehicle.
[0027]    A communication line Sl,    which is  a dedicated
communication line that connects the navigation ECU 100 and
the audio ECU 200 separately from other devices, is provided
between the I/O port  140 of the navigation ECU 100 and the
I/O port 240 of the audio ECU 200 as a communication path
that differs from the vehicle network NW3.      In the same
manner, a communication line S2,    which is a dedicated
communication line that connects the navigation ECU 100 and
the on-board communication device 400     separately from other
devices, is provided between the I/O port 140 of the
navigation ECU 100  and the I/O port 440    of the on-board
communication device 400   as a communication path that differs
from the vehicle network NW3.    The  communication lines S1 and
                                 6

S2 may each be, for example, a USB communication cable, a
PCI-E bus,  or a serial connection line.   The  communication
speed of each of the communication lines Si    and S2 that
connect the two on-board devices separately from other units
tends to be higher than the communication speed of the
vehicle network NW3 that connects three or more on-board
devices with each other.   Further, the communication lines     S1
and S2 can ensure confidentiality of information against
unauthorized access more easily than the vehicle network NW3.
[0028]     Therefore, in this embodiment, when the vehicle is
shipped out of the factory, the on-board communication device
400  shares the communication ID 400A with the navigation ECU
100  and the audio ECU 200 via the communication lines S1 and
S2  in response to a request from the navigation ECU 100 in a
state in which connection is established between the
navigation ECU 100  and the audio ECU 200 via the vehicle
network NW3 and the communication lines S1    and S2.
[0029]     More specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 2A, in a
state in which the on-board communication device 400     is
connected to the navigation ECU 100 via the communication
line S2,  the on-board communication device 400 transmits the
communication ID 400A it manages to the navigation ECU 100
via the communication line S2 in response to a request from
the navigation ECU 100.   Then, after obtaining the
communication ID 400A from the on-board communication device
400 via the communication line S2,   the navigation ECU 100
stores the obtained communication ID 400A in the ROM 120 of
the navigation ECU 100.   At this time, the communication ID
400A is  shared with the on-board communication device 400    and
the navigation ECU 100 via the communication line S2,     while
the confidentiality of the communication ID 400A is ensured.
[0030]     Further, as illustrated in Fig. 2B, at the point of
time when detecting connection with the audio ECU 200 via the
                                7

communication line Sl,  the navigation ECU 100 reads the
communication ID 400A obtained from the on-board
communication device 400   from the ROM 120 and transmits the
read communication ID 400A to the audio ECU 200 via the
communication line S1.   Then, after obtaining the
communication ID 400A from the navigation ECU 100 via the
communication line Sl,  the audio ECU 200 stores        the obtained
communication ID 400A in its ROM 220.     The communication ID
400A is shared with the navigation ECU 100     and the audio ECU
200 via the communication line S1 while the confidentiality
of the communication ID 400A is ensured.
[0031]    Then, the navigation ECU 100 uploads the vehicle
information that  it manages, such as position information of
the vehicle and setting information of the destination, to a
center 600 located outside the vehicle through the on-board
communication device 400.    More specifically, the navigation
ECU 100 uploads the vehicle information to a center
communication device  610 of the center 600.
[0032]    In detail, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the navigation
ECU 100 first transmits the vehicle information which it
manages to the on-board communication device 400 via the
communication line S2.   As described above, the navigation
ECU 100 reads the communication ID 400A, which is shared with
the on-board communication device 400,    from the ROM 120 and
associates the read communication ID 400A with vehicle
information Dl that is  transmitted.
[0033]    Then, when obtaining the vehicle information Dl
from the navigation ECU 100 via the communication line S2,
the on-board communication device 400 uploads the obtained
vehicle information Dl  to the center   600.  Specifically,      the
on-board communication device 400   obtains the vehicle
information Dl associated with the communication ID 400A from
the navigation ECU 100  and then uploads the vehicle
                                 8

information Dl  associated with the communication ID 400A to
the center 600.
[0034]    Further, as illustrated in Fig.    1, the audio ECU
200 includes the CPU 210,  the ROM 220,   the RAM 230,   the I/O
port 240, the communication controller 250,    and a short-range
communication interface 260 that are connected to one another
via the communication bus NW2.    The short-range communication
interface 260 carries out short-range communication such as
Bluetooth  (registered trademark) with a mobile information
terminal 500  located in the passenger compartment.      Further,
in this embodiment, the short-range communication interface
260 transmits the vehicle information it manages, such as
operating information of an audio system, to the mobile
information terminal 500 with which short-range communication
is established.
[0035]    The mobile information terminal 500 includes a
short-range communication interface 540, which carries out
short-range communication with the short-range communication
interface 260 of the audio ECU 200,    and an external   interface
550, which carries out communication with the outside of the
vehicle.  The mobile information terminal 500    further
includes a CPU 510,  a ROM 520,  and a RAM 530.    The short
range communication interface 540,    the external   interface
550, the CPU 510,  the ROM 520,  and the RAM 530 are connected
with one another via a communication bus NW5.      The short
range communication interface 540    obtains the vehicle
information managed by the audio ECU 200 through short-range
communication with the short-range communication interface
260 of the audio ECU 200.   The external   interface 550 uses a
communication ID 500A stored in the ROM 520    to establish
communication with the center 600 outside the vehicle.       In
this case, in the same manner as the communication ID 400A,
the communication ID 500A is   an ID such as an IMEI used to
                                9

identify the mobile information terminal 500     in a network.
Further, when communication is established with the center
600, the external  interface 550 uploads the vehicle
information obtained from the audio ECU 200 through short
range communication  to the center  600.  More  specifically,
the external interface 550 uploads the vehicle information to
the center communication device 610 of the center 600.
[0036]    As illustrated in Fig. 4, the audio ECU 200 first
transmits vehicle information D2   that it manages to the
mobile information terminal 500 through short-range
communication.  At this time,  as described above, the audio
ECU 200 reads the communication ID 400A shared with the on
board communication device 400 from the ROM 220 and
associates the read communication ID 400A with the vehicle
information D2 that is  transmitted.
[0037]    Then, when obtaining the vehicle information D2
from the audio ECU 200 through short-range communication, the
mobile information terminal 500 uploads the obtained vehicle
information D2 to the center 600.    Specifically, the mobile
information terminal 500  obtains the vehicle information D2
associated with the communication ID 400A from the audio ECU
200 and uploads the vehicle information D2    associated with
the communication ID 400A to the center 600.
[0038]    Then, as illustrated in Fig. 3, when the center 600
obtains the vehicle information Dl   from the navigation ECU
100 with the center communication device   610 via the on-board
communication device 400,  the center 600 stores      the vehicle
information Dl in a vehicle information database 620          (refer
to Fig. 1) separately for each vehicle using the
communication ID 400A associated with the obtained vehicle
information Dl as a key.   Further, as illustrated in Fig. 4,
when the center 600 obtains the vehicle information D2          from
the audio ECU 200 with the center communication device          610
                               10

via the mobile information terminal 500,    the center 600
stores the vehicle information D2   in the vehicle information
database 620  separately for each vehicle using the
communication ID 400A associated with the obtained vehicle
information D2  as a key.
[0039]     Fig. 5 illustrates one example of the data contents
of the vehicle information managed by the vehicle information
database 620.   In the example illustrated in Fig. 5, the
vehicle information database 620   includes "position
information,"  "destination,"  and "audio operating
information" that are data types   of the vehicle information
obtained from a predetermined vehicle.    Such data is managed
together with contents of the data and the obtained time.     In
the vehicle information, the "position information" and the
"destination" are information obtained from the navigation
ECU 100 via the on-board communication device 400,    and the
"audio operating information" is   information obtained from
the audio ECU 200 via the mobile information terminal 500.
Further, such vehicle information is associated with a common
communication ID "ID1,"   which indicates that the vehicle
information is obtained from the same vehicle.     As described
above, the vehicle information database    620 manages the
vehicle information obtained from the ECUs 100 and 200
through different communication paths in an centralized
manner using the common communication ID 400A as a key.
[0040]     Further, based on the vehicle information managed
by the vehicle information database   620 in this manner, the
center 600 provides information suitable for the vehicle that
transmitted the vehicle information.    In the example
illustrated in Fig. 5, based on the vehicle information
related to the  "position information" and the   "destination"
obtained from the navigation ECU 100,   the center 600 provides
the vehicle that transmitted the vehicle information with
                                11

suitable information such as waypoints that the vehicle will
pass by before arriving at the destination, traffic
information and weather information for the route from a
starting point to the destination for the vehicle, and news
related to the locations along the traveling route.     For each
type of information, the center 600 designates the ECU
provided with the information before the center communication
device 610 transmits the information to the on-board
communication device 400   or the mobile information terminal
500.   Instead, regardless of the type of the provided
information, the on-board communication device 400 or the
mobile information terminal 500 may designate the ECU
provided with the information in accordance with the type of
information received from the center 600 without the center
600 without specifying the ECU provided with the information.
[0041]     The actions of the vehicle communication system
according to the present embodiment will now be described
focusing on the actions when vehicle information is
transmitted to the center 600 from the navigation ECU 100     and
the audio ECU 200 through different communication paths.
[0042]     As  illustrated in Fig. 6, when the vehicle is
shipped out of the factory, in response to a request from the
navigation ECU 100   in state in which the navigation ECU 100
and the audio ECU 200 are connected via the vehicle network
NW3 and the communication lines    Si and S2, the on-board
communication device 400   transmits the communication ID 400A
that it manages to the navigation ECU 100 via the
communication line S2.
[0043]     When obtaining the communication ID 400A from the
on-board communication device 400,    the navigation ECU 100
sets the obtained communication ID 400A as data used when
transmitting the vehicle information Dl    it manages.  Further,
the navigation ECU 100   transmits the communication ID 400A
                                12

obtained from the on-board communication device 400 to the
audio ECU 200 via the communication line Si.     In other words,
the on-board communication device 400    transmits the
communication ID 400A to the audio ECU 200 through the
navigation ECU 100.
[0044]      When obtaining the communication ID 400A from the
navigation ECU 100,   the audio ECU 200 sets the obtained
communication ID 400A as data used when transmitting the
vehicle information D2   that it manages.
[0045]      Thereafter, the navigation ECU 100 associates the
communication ID 400A, which has been set in advance, with
the vehicle information Dl that    it manages and transmits the
vehicle information Dl,   which is  associated with the
communication ID 400A, to the on-board communication device
400.   Then, when receiving the vehicle information Dl    from
the navigation ECU 100,   the on-board communication device 400
uploads   the vehicle information Dl  associated with the
communication ID 400A to the center communication device 610.
[0046]      In the same manner, the audio ECU 200 associates
the communication ID 400A, which has been set in advance,
with the vehicle information D2 that    it manages and transmits
the vehicle information D2,   which is associated with the
communication ID 400A, to the mobile information terminal
500.   Then, when receiving the vehicle information D2    from
the audio ECU 200,   the mobile information terminal 500
uploads   the vehicle information D2  associated with the
communication ID 400A to the center communication device 610.
[0047]      Then, when receiving the vehicle information Dl
uploaded from the navigation ECU 100 via the on-board
communication device 400   and the vehicle information D2
uploaded from the audio ECU 200 via the mobile information
terminal 500,   the center communication device  610 stores the
received vehicle information Dl and D2    in the vehicle
                                13

information database   620 using the communication ID 400A as a
key.
[0048]     The operation of the vehicle communication system
according to this embodiment will now be described.
[0049]    When an ECU installed in the vehicle uploads the
vehicle information it manages to the center that is      located
outside the vehicle, an ID of the transmission source ECU is
usually assigned to the vehicle information that is uploaded.
Thus, the ID assigned to the vehicle information differs
between the transmission source ECUs.
[0050]     Thus, in order for the center to manage the vehicle
information uploaded from the ECUs for separately for each
vehicle, the vehicle information can be uploaded to the
center associated with a vehicle identification number      (VIN)
that identifies the vehicle based on manufacturer, model,      or
manufactured year of the vehicle.
[0051]     However, such a vehicle identification number is
data that is non-essential to the on-board communication
device 400.   Therefore, in order to share such a vehicle
identification number with the ECUs 100 and 200 that are
connected to the on-board communication device 400 via the
communication lines Si   and S2,   the vehicle identification
number needs to be written to the on-board communication
device 400 by an ECU that manages the vehicle identification
number.  The ECU that manages the vehicle identification
number may differ between vehicle models.      Therefore, when
the vehicle identification number is written, the ECU that
manages the vehicle identification number also needs to be
specified when the vehicle is shipped out of the factory.
Thus, there is room for improvement with regard to
convenience for manufacturing vehicles.
[0052]     In this respect, in the present embodiment, among
the ECUs that are installed in the vehicle, the ECUs 100 and
                                 14

200 that upload the vehicle information share the
communication ID 400A, which is an ID unique to the on-board
communication device 400, with the on-board communication
device 400 through the communication lines Si and S2 when the
vehicle is shipped out of the factory.
[0053]    Here, the communication ID 400A is an ID used to
identify the on-board communication device 400    in the network
when the on-board communication device 400 establishes
communication with the outside of the vehicle.     Further, the
communication ID 400A is data that is essential    for the on
board communication device 400.    Therefore, there is no need
to write the communication ID 400A in advance to the on-board
communication device 400  from a different ECU, and the
communication ID 400A improves the convenience during
manufacturing as compared to the vehicle identification
number described above.   Further, the communication ID 400A
is an IMEI, for example, which is    assigned as a number unique
to all communication devices.    Therefore, any vehicle
including the on-board communication device 400    can perform
communication using the communication ID 400A.     This
increases the versatility of communication using the vehicle
information Dl and D2.
[0054]    Further, when the vehicle information Dl and D2     is
obtained from the ECUs 100 and 200 that are installed in the
vehicle, the center 600 stores the vehicle information Dl     and
D2 in the vehicle information database 620    separately for
each vehicle by using the communication ID 400A associated
with the obtained vehicle information Dl and D2    as a key.
This allows the center 600 to manage the vehicle information
Dl and D2 obtained from the ECUs 100 and 200 separately for
each vehicle.
[0055]    The communication ID 400A associated with the
vehicle information Dl  and D2  is  an ID shared in advance with
                               15

the ECUs 100   and 200,  which are the transmission sources of
the vehicle information Dl and D2.         Further, the
communication ID 400A is not associated with the vehicle
information Dl   and D2 when the on-board communication device
400 or the mobile information terminal 500         arbitrates the
vehicle information Dl    and D2.     The communication ID 400A is
associated with the vehicle information Dl         and D2 when the
ECUs 100  and 200, which are the transmission sources         of the
vehicle information Dl    and D2,   transmit the vehicle
information Dl   and D2.   Therefore, even if the vehicle
information Dl   and D2  is uploaded to the center 600 through
different communication paths from the ECUs 100          and 200, the
vehicle information Dl    and D2   is   associated with the common
communication ID 400A.     This allows the center 600 to manage
the vehicle information Dl and D2        separately for each vehicle
regardless of the communication paths of the vehicle
information Dl   and D2  from the vehicle.
[0056]     The first embodiment has the advantages described
below.
[0057]      (1) The vehicle information Dl and D2        is uploaded
to the center 600   together with the communication ID 400A
that is  the individual identification information added to
the on-board communication device 400.         Here,  the
communication ID 400A is an IMEI,        for example, which is a
unique number and assigned to all communication devices.
This allows any vehicle including the on-board communication
device 400 to perform communication using the communication
ID 400A and improves versatility of communication using the
vehicle information Dl    and D2.
[0058]      (2) The vehicle information Dl and D2        is
information, for example, relating to the traveling situation
and environment of the vehicle.        The frequency of
transmission of the vehicle information Dl         and D2,  the amount
                                  16

of information of the vehicle information Dl        and D2,  and the
communication environment of the vehicle information Dl and
D2 differ between the vehicle information Dl        and D2.   In the
vehicle communication system described above, it is desirable
that the vehicle include communication devices that transmit
the vehicle information Dl and D2       separately.   The on-board
communication device 400     and the mobile information terminal
500  include different individual identification numbers.
However, the communication ID 400A, which is the individual
identification number added to the on-board communication
device 400,    is shared for communication by the on-board
communication device 400     and communication by the mobile
information terminal 500.      Therefore, the vehicle information
Dl  and D2  transmitted from the on-board communication device
400  and the mobile information terminal 500      can be managed by
the center 600 as information relating to the same vehicle.
[0059]       (3) The  communication ID 400A, which is the
individual identification number added to the on-board
communication device 400,     is  information for specifying the
vehicle including the vehicle communication system and highly
confidential.     The transmission of the communication ID 400A
is performed through the communication lines Si         and S2 that
connect the ECUs 100 and 200 separately from other devices.
This improves confidentiality of the communication ID 400A.
[0060]       (4) The  on-board communication device 400 transmits
the vehicle information Dl,      which is associated with the
communication ID 400A and obtained from the navigation ECU
100,  to the center 600,    and the mobile information terminal
500  transmits the vehicle information D2,      which is associated
with the communication ID 400A and obtained from the audio
ECU 200,   to the center 600.     Therefore, the vehicle
information Dl    transmitted from the on-board communication
device 400 and the vehicle information D2 transmitted from
                                   17

the mobile information terminal 500 can be managed by the
center 600 as information related to the same vehicle.
[0061]     Second Embodiment
[0062]     A  second embodiment of the vehicle communication
system will now be described with reference to the drawings.
The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in
that the second embodiment is applied to a vehicle that does
not include the on-board communication device.      Same
reference numerals are given to those components that are the
same as the corresponding components of the first embodiment.
Such components will not be described in detail.      The
description hereafter will focus on differences from the
first embodiment.
[0063]     As  illustrated in Fig. 7, in the same manner as the
first embodiment, in the second embodiment, the communication
line S1  is connected between the I/O port 140 of the
navigation ECU 100    and the I/O port 240 of the audio ECU 200.
Further, the audio ECU 200 includes the short-range
communication interface 260 which carries out short-range
communication such as Bluetooth     (registered trademark) with
the mobile information terminal 500 in the passenger
compartment.    Further, the mobile information terminal 500
includes the external    interface 550 which uses the
communication ID 500A stored in the ROM 520     to establish
communication with the center 600 located outside the
vehicle.   In this case, the communication ID 500A is an ID
used to identify the mobile information terminal 500      in a
network.
[0064]     In the second embodiment, when short-range
communication is established for the first time with the
audio ECU 200,   the mobile information terminal 500 shares    the
communication ID 500A with the navigation ECU 100 and the
                                 18

audio ECU 200 through short-range communication and via the
communication line Si.
[0065]    More specifically, as illustrated in Fig.      8A, when
connection through short-range communication with the mobile
information terminal 500    is  first detected, the audio ECU 200
requests the mobile information terminal 500      to transmit the
communication ID 500A.    At this time, the audio ECU 200 logs
and records the detection result of the connection through
short-range communication with the mobile information
terminal 500.   If the mobile information terminal 500
currently connected to the audio ECU 200 has been connected
through short-range communication in the past or if the audio
ECU 200 has been connected in the past through short-range
communication to a mobile information terminal 500 other than
the currently connected mobile information terminal 500, the
audio ECU 200 does not   request the currently connected mobile
information terminal 500    to transmit the communication ID
500A.  On the other hand, if the mobile information terminal
500 currently connected to the audio ECU 200 has not been
connected through short-range communication in the past and
the audio ECU 200 has not been connected in the past through
short-range communication to a mobile information terminal
500 other than the currently connected mobile information
terminal 500,  the audio ECU 200 requests the currently
connected mobile information terminal 500 to transmit the
communication ID 500A.
[0066]    Further, in response to the request from the audio
ECU 200, the mobile information terminal 500      transmits the
communication ID 500A that     is manages to the audio ECU 200
through the short-range communication.      Then, when obtaining
the communication ID 500A from the mobile information
terminal 500  through the short-range communication, the audio
ECU 200 stores the obtained communication ID 500A in the ROM
                                  19

220 of the audio ECU 200.     Thus, the communication ID 500A is
shared by the mobile information terminal 500 and the audio
ECU 200 through the short-range communication.
[0067]     Further, as illustrated in Fig.    8B, at the point of
time when connection with the navigation ECU 100 via the
communication line Si    is detected, the audio ECU 200 reads
the communication ID 500A obtained from the mobile
information terminal 500    from the ROM 220.   Then, the audio
ECU 200 transmits the read communication ID 500A to the
navigation ECU 100 via the communication line S1.      Then, when
obtaining the communication ID 500A from the audio ECU 200
via the communication line Sl,     the navigation ECU 100  stores
the obtained communication ID 500A in the ROM 220 of the
navigation ECU 100.    Thus,  the communication ID 500A is
shared by the navigation ECU 100     and the audio ECU 200 via
the communication line S1.
[0068]     Then, the navigation ECU 100 uploads the vehicle
information Dl   that it manages, such as position information
of the vehicle and setting information of the destination, to
the center 600, which is located outside the vehicle, through
the mobile information terminal 500.
[0069]     More specifically, as illustrated in Fig.     9, the
navigation ECU 100   first transmits the vehicle information Dl
that is manages to the audio ECU 200 via the communication
line S1.   At this time, as described above, the navigation
ECU 100  reads the communication ID 500A, which is shared with
the mobile information    terminal  500, from the ROM 120.   Then,
the navigation ECU 100    associates the read communication ID
500A with the vehicle information Dl that     is transmitted.
[0070]     Further, when obtaining the vehicle information Dl
from the navigation ECU 100 via the communication line Sl,
the audio ECU 200 transmits the obtained vehicle information
Dl to the mobile information terminal 500 through short-range
                                 20

communication.    Specifically,         the audio ECU 200        obtains  the
vehicle information Dl          associated with the communication ID
500A from the navigation ECU 100.            Then, the audio ECU 200
transmits the vehicle information Dl associated with the
communication ID 500A to the mobile information terminal 500.
[0071]      Then, when obtaining the vehicle information Dl
from the audio ECU 200 through short-range communication, the
mobile information terminal 500 uploads the obtained vehicle
information Dl   to the center         600.  Specifically,        the mobile
information terminal 500          obtains the vehicle information Dl
associated with the communication ID 500A from the audio ECU
200.   Then, the mobile information terminal 500 uploads the
vehicle information Dl          associated with the communication ID
500A to the center 600.
[0072]      In the same manner, the audio ECU 200 uploads the
vehicle information D2          that it manages, such as operating
information of the audio system, to the center 600 located
outside the vehicle via the mobile information terminal 500.
[0073]      More specifically, as illustrated in Fig.                 10, the
audio ECU 200 first transmits the vehicle information D2 that
it manages to the mobile information terminal 500                   through
short-range communication.           At this time, as described above,
the audio ECU 200 reads the communication ID 500A shared with
the on-board communication device 400              from the ROM 220.
Then, the audio ECU 200 associates the read communication ID
500A with the vehicle information D2 that                  is transmitted.
[0074]      When obtaining the vehicle information D2                 from the
audio ECU 200 through the short-range communication, the
mobile information terminal 500 uploads the obtained vehicle
information D2   to the center 600.          Specifically, the mobile
information terminal 500          obtains the vehicle information D2
associated with the communication ID 500A from the audio ECU
200.   Then, the mobile information terminal 500 uploads the
                                       21

vehicle information D2,  which is  associated with the
communication ID 500A, to the center 600.
[0075]    The actions of the vehicle communication system
according to the second embodiment will now be described
focusing on the actions when the vehicle information is
transmitted to the center 600 from the navigation ECU 100     and
the audio ECU 200 through a common communication path.
[0076]    As illustrated in Fig. 11,    when connection with the
mobile information terminal 500 through short-range
communication is  first detected, the audio ECU 200 requests
the mobile information terminal 500 to transmit the
communication ID.
[0077]    In response to the request from the audio ECU 200,
the mobile information terminal 500 transmits the
communication ID 500A to the audio ECU 200 through short
range communication.
[0078]    When obtaining the communication ID 500A from the
mobile information terminal 500,   the audio ECU 200 sets the
obtained communication ID 500A as data used when transmitting
the vehicle information D2 that   is manages.   Further, the
audio ECU 200 transmits the communication ID 500A obtained
from the mobile information terminal 500 to the navigation
ECU 100 via the communication line Si.
[0079]    When obtaining the communication ID 500A from the
audio ECU 200, the navigation ECU 100    sets the obtained
communication ID 500A as data used when transmitting the
vehicle information Dl  that it manages.
[0080]    Thereafter, the navigation ECU 100 associates the
vehicle information Dl  that it manages with the communication
ID 500A that is set in advance.    Then, the navigation ECU 100
transmits the vehicle information Dl associated with the
communication ID 500A to the audio ECU 200.     When receiving
the vehicle information Dl associated with the communication
                               22

ID 500A from the navigation ECU 100,   the audio ECU 200
transmits the vehicle information Dl associated with the
communication ID 500A to the mobile information terminal 500.
In the same manner, the audio ECU 200 associates the vehicle
information D2 that it manages with the communication ID 500A
that is set in advance.   Then, the audio ECU 200 transmits
the vehicle information D2 associated with the communication
ID 500A to the mobile information terminal 500.
[0081]    When receiving the vehicle information Dl and D2
managed by the navigation ECU 100   or the audio ECU 200 from
the audio ECU 200,  the mobile information terminal 500
uploads the vehicle information Dl   and D2 associated with the
communication ID 500A to the center communication device 610.
[0082]    When receiving the vehicle information Dl and D2
from the navigation ECU 100   or the audio ECU 200 through the
mobile information terminal 500,   the center communication
device 610 stores  the received vehicle information Dl   and D2
in the vehicle information database   620 using the
communication ID 500A as a key.
[0083]    The operation of the vehicle communication system
according to the second embodiment will now be described.
[0084]    In a vehicle that does not   include an on-board
communication device, when ECUs installed in the vehicle
upload the vehicle information that they manage to the center
located outside the vehicle, short-range communication is
usually established between one of the ECUs that have a
short-range communication function and a mobile information
terminal carried by an occupant of the vehicle.    Then, the
ECU installed in the vehicle uploads the vehicle information
to the center located outside the vehicle via the mobile
information terminal.
[0085]    At this time, in the second embodiment, since the
on-board communication device 400   is not installed in the
                                23

vehicle, the ECUs 100 and 200 that upload the vehicle
information share the communication ID 500A, which is    an ID
unique to the mobile information terminal 500,   in place of
the communication ID 400A, which is an ID unique to the on
board communication device 400 in the first embodiment.
[0086]    The communication ID 500A of the mobile information
terminal 500  is an ID used to identify the mobile information
terminal 500  in the network when the mobile information
terminal 500 establishes communication with the outside of
the vehicle.   Further, the communication ID 500A is data that
is essential  for the mobile information terminal 500.
Therefore, there is no need for a separate ECU to write the
communication ID 500A in advance to the mobile information
terminal 500.   Further, the communication ID 500A is,   for
example, an IMEI that a unique number and assigned to all
communication devices.   This allows any vehicle capable of
performing short-range communication with the mobile
information terminal 500   to perform communication using the
communication ID 500A and improves versatility of
communication using the vehicle information Dl and D2.
[0087]    Further, when obtaining the vehicle information Dl
and D2 from the ECUs 100 and 200 installed in the vehicle,
the center 600 stores the vehicle information Dl   and D2 in
the vehicle information database   620 separately for each
vehicle using the communication ID 500A associated with the
obtained vehicle information Dl and D2   as a key.  This  allows
the center 600 to manage the vehicle information Dl and D2
obtained from the ECUs 100 and 200 separately for each
vehicle.
[0088]    In particular, in the second embodiment, when
connection through short-range communication with the mobile
information terminal 500   is detected for the first time, the
ECUs 100 and 200 that upload the vehicle information Dl and
                                24

D2 set the communication ID 500A of the mobile information
terminal 500 as data used when transmitting the vehicle
information Dl and D2.   If the communication ID 500A has been
obtained once, the ECUs 100   and 200 no longer update the
obtained communication ID 500A even when connection through
short-range communication with the mobile information
terminal 500 is detected.    Therefore, for example, even when
multiple occupants of the vehicle each have a mobile
information terminal 500,   and the different mobile
information terminals  500 establish short-range communication
with the ECUs 100  and 200,  the communication ID 500A shared
by the ECUs 100 and 200 that upload the vehicle information
Dl and D2 remains the same regardless    of the mobile
information terminal 500   that establishes short-range
communication.  This  allows the center 600 to manage the
vehicle information Dl  and D2   separately for each vehicle
over the entire period during which the vehicle is used
regardless of changes in the mobile information terminal 500
that arbitrates uploading of the vehicle information Dl and
D2 from the ECUs 100 and 200.
[0089]    As described above, the second embodiment has the
same advantages as the first embodiment.
[0090]    It should be apparent to those skilled in the art
that the present invention may be embodied in many other
specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of
the invention.  Particularly, it should be understood that
the present invention may be embodied in the following forms.
[0091]    In the first embodiment, the on-board communication
device 400 and the navigation ECU 100    are connected by the
communication line S2 that   serves as a dedicated
communication line, and the navigation ECU 100 and the audio
ECU 200 are connected by the communication line Si     that
serves as a dedicated communication line.     Further, the on
                                25

board communication device 400 transmits the communication ID
400A to the navigation ECU 100 via the communication line S2,
and the navigation ECU 100 transmits the communication ID
400A to the audio ECU 200 via the communication line Si.
Instead, the on-board communication device 400 and the audio
ECU 200 may be connected by a dedicated communication line.
Further, the on-board communication device 400 may transmit
the communication ID 400A to the audio ECU 200 via the
dedicated communication line.
[0092]     In the second embodiment, the mobile information
terminal 500  and the audio ECU 200 are connected through
short-range communication, and the audio ECU 200 and the
navigation ECU 100  are connected by the communication line S1
that serves as a dedicated communication line.    Further, the
mobile information terminal 500 transmits the communication
ID 500A to the audio ECU 200 through short-range
communication in response to a request from the audio ECU
200,  and the audio ECU 200 transmits the communication ID
500A to the navigation ECU 100 via the communication line S1.
Instead, the mobile information terminal 500   and the
navigation ECU 100 may be connected through short-range
communication.   Further, the mobile information terminal 500
may transmit the communication ID 500A to the navigation ECU
100  through short-range communication.
[0093]     In the first embodiment, the vehicle communication
system includes the navigation ECU 100  and the audio ECU 200
that are configured separately from each other.    However, the
vehicle communication system may include an ECU integrating
the functions of the ECUs 100 and 200.   In this case, the on
board communication device 400 and integrated ECU may be
connected by a dedicated communication line, and the
communication ID 400A may be transmitted to the integrated
ECU via the dedicated communication line from the on-board
                               26

communication device 400    in response to a request from the
integrated ECU.    Further, the integrated ECU may associate
the communication ID 400A received from the on-board
communication device 400 with the vehicle information Dl and
D2 that it manages to transmit the vehicle information Dl       and
D2 associated with the communication ID 400A to the center
600 through the on-board communication device 400      or the
mobile information terminal 500.      Moreover, the integrated
ECU does not need to have the short-range communication
function and may be configured to perform communication with
the center 600 through only the on-board communication device
400.   In this case,  the integrated ECU may associate the
communication ID 400A received from the on-board
communication device 400 with the vehicle information Dl and
D2 which it manages to transmit the vehicle information Dl
and D2 associated with the communication ID 400A to the
center 600 through the on-board communication device 400.
[0094]      In the second embodiment, the vehicle communication
system includes the navigation ECU 100      and the audio ECU 200
that are configured separately from each other.       However, the
vehicle communication system may be configured to include an
ECU integrating the functions of the ECUs 100 and 200.       In
this case, the mobile information terminal 500 and integrated
ECU may be connected through short-range communication, and
the communication ID 500A may be transmitted to the
integrated ECU through short-range communication from the
mobile information terminal 500     in response to a request from
the integrated ECU.
[0095]      In the first embodiment, the destination of the
vehicle information Dl    from the navigation ECU 100 via the
on-board communication device 400     and the destination of the
vehicle information D2    from the audio ECU 200 via the mobile
information terminal 500    are both the center 600.    However,
                                 27

the destination to which the on-board communication device
400  transmits the vehicle information Dl may differ from the
destination to which the mobile information terminal 500
transmits the vehicle information D2.
[0096]     In the first embodiment, the vehicle information Dl
and D2  is uploaded to the center 600 by a communication path
selectively routed through the navigation ECU 100 and the
audio ECU 200.   Instead, the ECUs 100 and 200 may upload the
vehicle information Dl   and D2   to the center 600  through a
communication path routed through the on-board communication
device 400 in addition to a communication path routed through
the mobile information terminal 500.
[0097]     In the embodiments described above, the dedicated
communication lines Si   and S2 are used as communication paths
when the communication IDs    400A and 500A are shared with the
navigation ECU 100  and the audio ECU 200.     However, if
information security can be ensured in the vehicle network
NW3,  the communication IDs   400A and 500A may be transferred
between the ECUs 100 and 200 via the vehicle network NW3.       In
this case, the dedicated communication lines S1      and S2 may be
omitted.
[0098]     In the embodiments described above, the
communication lines S1   and S2 are used as communication paths
for both of the communication IDs     400A and 500A and the
vehicle information Dl   and D2.    Instead, the communication
lines S1  and S2 may be used as communication paths for the
communication IDs  400A and 500A, and the vehicle network NW3
may be used as a communication path for the vehicle
information Dl  and D2.   Further, the vehicle network NW3 may
be used as a communication path for the communication IDs
400A and 500A, and the communication lines Si and S2 may be
used as communication paths for the vehicle information Dl
and D2.
                                 28

[0099]     In the embodiments described above, the audio ECU
200 transmits and receives the vehicle information Dl      and D2
to and from the mobile information terminal 500, which is
located in the passenger compartment, through short-range
communication.   Instead of such short-range communication,
transmission and reception of the vehicle information Dl and
D2 may be performed by connecting the audio ECU 200 and the
mobile information terminal 500 with a dedicated
communication line.
[0100]     In the embodiments described above, the navigation
ECU 100  and the audio ECU 200 upload vehicle information.
However, any ECU connected to the vehicle network NW3 may
upload the vehicle information to the center 600.
[0101]     In the embodiments described above, the IMEI     is
used as the communication ID 400A of the on-board
communication device 400   or the communication ID 500A of the
mobile information terminal 500.     An Electronic Serial Number
 (ESN) or a Mobile Equipment Identifier    (MEID) may also be
used as the communication IDs 400A and 500A.      In this manner,
any information may be used as the communication IDs      400A and
500A as long as the information is added and assigned to all
communication devices   including the on-board communication
device 400 and the mobile information terminal 500.
[0102]     The present examples and embodiments are to be
considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the
invention is not to be limited to the details given herein,
but may be modified within the scope and equivalence of the
appended claims.
[0103]     In this specification, the terms "comprise",
"comprises",  "comprising" or similar terms are intended to
mean a non-exclusive inclusion,    such that a system, method or
apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not      include
                                29
