ABSTRACT
A tank suction system in which the inlet end of a suction hose is suspended just below
the surface of the water and the outlet end of the suction hose is attached to the roof of
the tank. This arrangement allows for easy installation of the system from the outside
of the tank, and can be installed even when the tank is full of water.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to a suction system for extracting water from a
storage tank.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Traditionally rainwater tanks were fitted with an outlet pipe or tap positioned
slightly above the bottom of the tank in order to minimise the pickup of sludge which
invariably collects at the bottom of a tank. However, to be effective the outlet needs to
be a significant distance above the bottom of the tank with the portion of the tank below
the outlet effectively being wasted.
[0003]      To maximise utilisation of a tank whilst still avoiding contaminated water from
the bottom of a tank floating pickups are often used. In such systems a hose is
suspended just below the water surface by a float, with the hose connected to an outlet
which connected close to the bottom of a tank.
[0004]      Whilst known floating tank pickups are effective, the connection to the outlet
at the bottom of the tank is difficult to install, requiring the tank to be almost empty to be
fitted. This is obviously undesirable as it takes the tank out of service, and is often
unacceptable where the tank is the sole source of water for a site. Working inside a
tank also presents issues, often being difficult and dangerous and in many jurisdictions
requiring the installer to have a confined space working license, and often requiring at
least two installers to be present.
[0005]      The object of this invention is to provide a tank suction system to alleviate
the above problem, or at least provide the public with a useful alternative.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      In a first aspect the invention provides a suction system for a water tank
comprising a suction hose with a first and second end, and a float, wherein the first end
of the suction hose is attached in proximity to the top of the tank and the second end of
the suction hose is suspended below the surface of the water in the tank.

[0007]      Preferably the second end of the suction hose is fitted with an elbow.
[0008]      In preference the first end of the suction hose is removably attached to the
roof.
[0009]      The first end of the suction hose may be attached to the roof of the tank or to
the top of a wall of the tank.
[0010]      It should be noted that any one of the aspects mentioned above may include
any of the features of any of the other aspects mentioned above and may include any
of the features of any of the embodiments described below as appropriate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0014]      The following detailed description of the invention refers to the
accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used
throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same and like
parts. Dimensions of certain parts shown in the drawings may have been modified
and/or exaggerated for the purposes of clarity or illustration.
[0015]      The present invention provides a tank suction system in which the inlet end
of a suction hose is suspended just below the surface of the water and the outlet end of
the suction hose is attached to the roof of the tank. This arrangement allows for easy
installation of the system from the outside of the tank, and can be installed even when
the tank is full of water.
[0016]      A tank suction system according to a preferred embodiment of the invention
is shown fitted to a tank 10 in Figure 1. The tank is shown cutaway to reveal the
majority of the system components which are fitted inside the tank. The components
are not drawn to scale for representational convenience. Wherever possible
components are made of food grade materials or stainless steel to provide safe
drinking water and minimise corrosion.
[0017]      The tank 10 comprises walls 12 and a roof 14 to which the suction system is
attached via roof plate 40. A flange 42 attaches to the roof plate and in turn to a
suction hose 20 via a barrel union 44 and a threaded tail of the hose. A non
permanent connection to the hose eases installation and allows for maintenance. The
inlet end of the hose is suspended below the water surface 16 by float 30 which is

                                                _r
attached via a flexible line 32. Suspending the inlet just below the water surface avoids
using potentially contaminated and de-oxygenated water from the bottom of the tank.
The inlet comprises a filter cage 26 and an elbow 24 to keep the filter cage away from
the floor of the tank when the water level is low. A non-return valve 22 ensures that the
system remains full of water for correct operation of a suction pump.
[0018]      Components of the system fitted externally to the tank include a suction
pump 52 with outlet 54 and suction line 50 attached to the roof plate 40 via tee a 46.
The tee includes a bung 48 which is removed to allow priming of the suction hose 20
and suction line 50 with water to ensure that the suction pump 52 can operate.
[0019]      The system shown in Figure 1 is shown installed by attaching to the roof 14
of the tank. In some situations it may be preferable to install the system instead at the
top of the tank wall 12.
[0020]      Installation of the system is relatively simple and can be carried out by a
sole installer working outside of the tank at all times, thus avoiding the need for a
confined space working permit and the associated risks. The system is supplied in two
sub-assemblies: the suction hose 20 with nut tail 28, non-return valve 22, elbow 24,
filter cage 26, float line 32 and float line 30 fitted; and the roof plate 40 with flange 42,
barrel union 44, tee 46 and bung 48 fitted. The suction line 50, pump 52 and 54 are
supplied separately and will be very much site specific. To install the system a hole
approximately 160mm across is first cut into the roof approximately 300mm from the
tank edge. The suction hose 20 is filled with water and the inlet end and float then fed
through the hole and into the tank. The threaded tail 28 of the suction hose is then
attached to the roof plate 40 via the flange 42 and barrel union 44. At this stage the
roof plate is not attached to the roof or the suction line so that it can be easily
manipulated. The roof plate is then secured to the roof via suitable fastenings and
sealed underneath if desired by foam sealing strips so the plate can easily be removed
if servicing of the system is ever required. The suction line 50 is then connected
between the tee 46 and the pump 52. Preferably the suction line is attached via a
barrel union or the like so that the roof plate can be lifted for system maintenance if
needed.
[0021]      The reader will now appreciate the present invention which provides a tank
suction system that can be easily installed, even in a full tank.

[0022]     Further advantages and improvements may very well be made to the present
invention without deviating from its scope. Although the invention has been shown and
described in what is conceived to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is
recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention,
which is not to be limited to the details disclosed herein but is to be accorded the full
scope of the claims so as to embrace any and all equivalent devices and apparatus. In
particular any number of pipe and hose fitting could be used as is well known in the art.
 Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the
common general knowledge in this field.
[0023]     In the present specification and claims (if any), the word "comprising" and its
derivatives including "comprises" and "comprise" include each of the stated integers
but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.
