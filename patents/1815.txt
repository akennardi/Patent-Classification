MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST HER2
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies directed to human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2) and to uses of such antibodies, in particular their use in the
treatment of cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
HER2 is a 185-kDa cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase and member of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family that comprises four distinct receptors: EGFR/ErbB-1,
HER2/ErbB-2, HER3/ErbB-3, and HER4/ErbB-4. Both homo- and heterodimers are formed
by the four members of the EGFR family, with HER2 being the preferred and most potent
dimerization partner for other ErbB receptors (Graus-Porta et al., Embo J 1997; 16:1647
1655; Tao et al., J Cell Sci 2008;121:3207-3217). HER2 can be activated by overexpression
or by heterodimerization with other ErbBs that can be activated by ligand binding (Riese
and Stern, Bioessays 1998;20:41-48). For HER2, no ligand has been identified. HER2
activation leads to receptor phosphorylation, which triggers a cascade of downstream
signals through multiple signaling pathways, such as MAPK, phosphoinositol 3-kinase/AKT,
JAK/STAT and PKC, which ultimately results in the regulation of multiple cellular functions,
such as growth, survival and differentiation (Huang et al., Expert Opin Biol Ther 2009;9:97
110).
        Much of the attention on HER2 in tumors has been focused on its role in breast
cancer, in which HER2 overexpression is reported in approximately 20% of the cases and is
correlated with poor prognosis (Reese et al., Stem Cells 1997;15:1-8; Andrechek et al.,
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2000;97:3444-3449; and Slamon et al., Science 1987;235:177
182). Besides breast cancer, HER2 expression has also been associated with other human
carcinoma types, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer,
ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, esophageal cancer and squamous cell
carcinoma of the head & neck (Garcia de Palazzo et al., Int J Biol Markers 1993;8:233-239;
Ross et al., Oncologist 2003;8:307-325; Osman et al., J Urol 2005;174:2174-2177;
Kapitanovic et al., Gastroenterology 1997; 112:1103-1113; Turken et al., Neoplasma
2003;50:257-261; and Oshima et al., Int J Biol Markers 2001;16:250-254).
        Trastuzumab (Herceptin*) is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody
directed against domain IV of the HER2 protein, thereby blocking ligand-independent HER2
homodimerization, and to a lesser extend heterodimerization of HER2 with other family
members in cells with high HER2 overexpression (Cho et al., Nature 2003;421:756-760 and
Wehrman et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006;103:19063-19068). In cells with modest
                                               1

HER2 expressing levels, trastuzumab was found to inhibit the formation of HER2/EGFR
heterodimers (Wehrman et al., (2006), supra; Schmitz et al., Exp Cell Res 2009;315:659
670). Trastuzumab mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and prevents
ectodomain shedding, which would otherwise result in the formation of a truncated
constitutively active protein in HER2 overexpressing cells. Also inhibition of both in vitro and
in vivo proliferation of tumor cells expressing high levels of HER2 has been reported for
trastuzumab (reviewed in Nahta and Esteva, Oncogene 2007;26:3637-3643). Herceptin®
has been approved both for first-line and adjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressing
metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with chemotherapy, or as a single agent
following one or more chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab has been found to be effective
only in 20-50% of HER2 overexpressing breast tumor patients and many of the initial
responders show relapse after a few months (Dinh et al., Clin Adv Hematol Oncol
2007;5:707-717).
          Pertuzumab (OmnitargTM) is another humanized monoclonal antibody. It is directed
against domain II of the HER2 protein, resulting in inhibition of ligand-induced
heterodimerization (i.e., HER2 dimerizing with another member of the ErbB family to which
a ligand has bound); a mechanism reported to not strictly require high HER2 expression
levels (Franklin et al., Cancer Cell 2004;5:317-328.). Although pertuzumab also mediates
ADCC, the main mechanism of action of pertuzumab relies on its dimerization blockade
(Hughes et al., Mol Cancer Ther 2009;8:1885-1892). Moreover, pertuzumab was found to
enhance EGFR internalization and downregulation by inhibiting the formation of EGFR/HER2
heterodimers, which otherwise tethers EGFR at the plasma membrane (Hughes et al., 2009,
supra). This correlates with the observation that EGFR homodimers internalize more
efficient than EGFR/HER2 dimers (Pedersen et al., Mol Cancer Res 2009;7:275-284. The
complementary mechanisms of action of pertuzumab and trastuzumab reportedly results in
enhanced anti-tumor effects and efficacy when combined in patients who progressed during
prior trastuzumab therapy (Baselga et al., J Clin Oncol 2010;28:1138-1144), and a phase
III trial to evaluate this antibody combination together with Docetaxel in previously
untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is underway.
         An alternative approach to improve targeted antibody therapy is by delivering
cytotoxic cells or drugs specifically to the antigen-expressing cancer cells. For example, the
so-called trifunctional antibodies are bispecific antibodies, targeting with one arm the
antigen on the tumor cell and with the other arm for instance CD3 on T cells. Upon binding,
a complex of T cells, tumor cells and effector cells that bind Fc is formed, leading to killing
of the tumor cells (Muller and Kontermann, BioDrugs 2010;24:89-98.). Ertumaxomab is one
such trifunctional antibody against HER2, which induces cytotoxicity in cell lines with low
HER2 expression and which is in Phase II clinical development in metastatic breast cancer
                                                 2

(Jones et al., Lancet Oncol 2009;10:1179-1187 and Kiewe et al., Clin Cancer Res
2006; 12:3085-3091).
        A HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) is currently in clinical development. T-DM1
consists of trastuzumab conjugated to the fungal toxin maytansine. In Phase II trials,
responses in a heavily pretreated patient cohort including prior trastuzumab and/or lapatinib
therapy were reported Burris et al, 2011, J Clin Oncol 29: 398-405 and Lewis Phillips et al.,
Cancer Res 2008;68:9280-9290). Preliminary data from a Phase II trial determining efficacy
and safety of T-DM1 versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel in her2-positive metastatic breast
cancer patients with no rior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were reported (Perez et al,
Abstract BA3, European Society for Medical Oncology meeting 2010). A Phase III trial to
evaluate T-DM1 efficacy and safety versus capecitabine + lapatinib in patients with HER2
positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received prior trastuzumab
therapy is ongoing.
        While many factors are involved in selecting a suitable antibody for HER2 targeted
therapy, it is typically an advantage for an ADC approach if the HER2-antibody complex
efficiently internalizes upon antibody binding. Studies on murine HER2 antibodies have
shown that certain combinations of antibodies instigate HER2 endocytosis (Ben-Kasus et al.,
PNAS 2009;106:3294-9). Human HER2 antibodies F5 and C1 have been reported to
internalize relatively rapidly on their own and to bind the same epitope (WO 99/55367 and
WO 2006/116107). As compared to EGFR, however, internalization of HER2 is impaired.
Indeed, EGFR homodimers internalize much more efficiently than HER2 homodimers (Dinh
et al., Clin Adv Hematol Oncol 2007;5:707-717). EGFR, and also HER3, can increase
endocytosis of HER2 by the formation of EGFR/HER2 and HER3/HER2 heterodimers,
respectively (Baulida et al., J Biol Chem 1996;271:5251-5257; Pedersen NM, et al., Mol
Cancer Res 2009;7:275-84).
        The complex mechanisms regulating the function of HER2 warrant further research
on new and optimized therapeutic strategies against this proto-oncogene. Accordingly, there
remains a need for effective and safe products for treating HER2-related diseases, such as
cancer.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel highly specific and effective
monoclonal HER2 antibodies for medical use. The antibodies of the invention exhibit HER2
binding characteristics that differ from antibodies described in the art. Particularly, although
most of the antibodies apparently bind to HER2 segments overlapping with those bound by
trastuzumab, pertuzumab or F5/C1 as shown in a cross-blocking HER2 binding assay, the
novel antibodies are characterized by a higher efficiency in killing HER2-expressing tumor
                                                3

cells in an ADC assay, improved internalization and/or other advantages over the known
antibodies.
         In preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are fully human, bind to
novel epitopes, and/or have favorable properties for therapeutic use in human patients.
Exemplary properties include, but are not limited to, favorable binding characteristics to
cancer cells expressing human HER2 at high or low levels, specific binding rhesus epithelial
cells expressing a HER2 ortholog, efficient internalization upon binding to HER2, high
capacity for killing cancer cells expressing high- or low-levels of HER2 when administered as
an ADC, promoting proliferation of HER2-expressing cells less than F5, a neutral or
inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HER2-expressing cancer cells, and provide for
effective ADCC-mediated killing of HER2-expressing cells, as well as any combination of the
foregoing properties.
         These and other aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions
The term "HER2" (also known as ErbB-2, NEU, HER-2, and CD340), when used herein,
refers to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (SwissProt P04626) and includes any
variants, isoforms and species homologs of HER2 which are naturally expressed by cells,
including tumor cells, or are expressed on cells transfected with the HER2 gene. Species
homologs include rhesus monkey HER2 (macaca mulatta; Genbank accession No.
GI: 109114897).
        The term "immunoglobulin" refers to a class of structurally related glycoproteins
consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) low molecular weight
chains and one pair of heavy (H) chains, all four inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The
structure of immunoglobulins has been well characterized. See for instance Fundamental
Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). Briefly, each heavy
chain typically is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as      VH  or
VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region typically is
comprised of three domains,    CH1, CH2, and CH 3 . Each light chain typically is comprised of a
light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL or VL) and a light chain constant
region. The light chain constant region typically is comprised of one domain, CL. The      VH  and
VL regions may be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability (or hypervariable
regions which may be hypervariable in sequence and/or form of structurally defined loops),
also termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that
are more conserved, termed framework regions (FRs). Each        VH  and VL is typically composed
of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the
following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 (see also Chothia and Lesk J. Mol.
Biol. 196, 901-917 (1987)). Unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context, CDR
sequences herein are identified according to IMGT rules (Brochet X., Nucl Acids Res.
2008;36:W503-508 and Lefranc MP., Nucleic Acids Research 1999;27:209-212; see also
internet http address imgt.cines.fr/IMGT-vquest/vquest?livret=0&Option=humanIg.
However, the numbering of amino acid residues in an antibody sequence can also be
performed by the method described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)
(phrases such as "variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat", "Kabat position" or
"according to Kabat" herein refer to this numbering system). Particularly, for numbering of
amino acids in the constant region, the EU index numbering system according to Kabat et
                                               7

al, supra, can be used. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given
antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a
"standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
        The term "antibody" (Ab) in the context of the present invention refers to an
immunoglobulin molecule, a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule, or a derivative of
either thereof, which has the ability to specifically bind to an antigen under typical
physiological conditions with a half life of significant periods of time, such as at least about
30 minutes, at least about 45 minutes, at least about one hour, at least about two hours, at
least about four hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours, about 24 hours or
more, about 48 hours or more, about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, etc., or any other relevant
functionally-defined period (such as a time sufficient to induce, promote, enhance, and/or
modulate a physiological response associated with antibody binding to the antigen and/or
time sufficient for the antibody to recruit an effector activity). The variable regions of the
heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin molecule contain a binding domain that
interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies (Abs) may mediate the
binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the
immune system (such as effector cells) and components of the complement system such as
C1q, the first component in the classical pathway of complement activation. A HER2
antibody may also be a bispecific antibody, diabody, or similar molecule (see for instance
PNAS USA 90(14), 6444-8 (1993) for a description of diabodies). Indeed, bispecific
antibodies, diabodies, and the like, provided by the present invention may bind any suitable
target in addition to a portion of HER2. As indicated above, the term antibody herein, unless
otherwise stated or clearly contradicted by context, includes fragments of an antibody that
are antigen-binding fragments, i.e., retain the ability to specifically bind to the antigen. It
has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody may be performed by
fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of antigen-binding fragments encompassed
within the term "antibody" include (i) a Fab' or Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment
consisting of the  VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains, or a monovalent antibody as described in
W02007059782 (Genmab); (ii) F(ab') 2 fragments, bivalent fragments comprising two Fab
fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting
essentially of the  VH and  CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting essentially of the VL
and  VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature
341, 544-546 (1989)), which consists essentially of a VH domain and also called domain
antibodies (Holt et al; Trends Biotechnol. 2003 Nov;21(11):484-90); (vi) camelid or
nanobodies (Revets et al; Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2005 Jan;5(1):111-24) and (vii) an
isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two
domains of the Fv fragment, VL and     VH, are coded for by separate genes, they may be
                                                 8

joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a
single protein chain in which the VL and   VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules
(known as single chain antibodies or single chain Fv (scFv), see for instance Bird et al.,
Science 242, 423-426 (1988) and Huston et al., PNAS USA 85, 5879-5883 (1988)). Such
single chain antibodies are encompassed within the term antibody unless otherwise noted or
clearly indicated by context. Although such fragments are generally included within the
meaning of antibody, they collectively and each independently are unique features of the
present invention, exhibiting different biological properties and utility. These and other
useful antibody fragments in the context of the present invention, as well as bispecific
formats of such fragments, are discussed further herein. It also should be understood that
the term antibody, unless specified otherwise, also includes polyclonal antibodies,
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-like polypeptides, such as chimeric antibodies and
humanized antibodies, and antibody fragments retaining the ability to specifically bind to
the antigen (antigen-binding fragments) provided by any known technique, such as
enzymatic cleavage, peptide synthesis, and recombinant techniques. An antibody as
generated can possess any isotype.
        As used herein, "isotype" refers to the immunoglobulin class (for instance IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or IgM) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region
genes.
        The term "monovalent antibody" means in the context of the present invention that
an antibody molecule is capable of binding a single molecule of the antigen, and thus is not
able of antigen crosslinking.
        An "antibody deficient in effector function" or an "effector-function-deficient
antibody" refers to an antibody which has a significantly reduced or no ability to activate
one or more effector mechanisms, such as complement activation or Fc receptor binding.
Thus, effector-function deficient antibodies have significantly reduced or no ability to
mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). An example of such an antibody is IgG4.
        A "HER2 antibody" or "anti-HER2 antibody" is an antibody as described above, which
binds specifically to the antigen HER2.
        The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having
variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences.
The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by
human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site
specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term "human
antibody", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences
                                                 9

derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been
grafted onto human framework sequences.
        As used herein, a human antibody is "derived from" a particular germline sequence if
the antibody is obtained from a system using human immunoglobulin sequences, for
instance by immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes or by
screening a human immunoglobulin gene library, and wherein the selected human antibody
is at least 90%, such as at least 95%, for instance at least 96%, such as at least 97%, for
instance at least 98%, or such as at least 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the
amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, outside the
heavy chain CDR3, a human antibody derived from a particular human germline sequence
will display no more than 20 amino acid differences, e.g. no more than 10 amino acid
differences, such as no more than 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5, for instance no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1
amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline
immunoglobulin gene.
        In a preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is isolated. An "isolated
antibody," as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody which is substantially free of
other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (for instance an isolated antibody
that specifically binds to HER2 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind
antigens other than HER2). An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope,
isoform or variant of HER2 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens,
for instance from other species (such as HER2 species homologs). Moreover, an isolated
antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals. In one
embodiment of the present invention, two or more "isolated" monoclonal antibodies having
different antigen-binding specificities are combined in a well-defined composition.
        When used herein in the context of two or more antibodies, the term "competes
with" or "cross-competes with" indicates that the two or more antibodies compete for
binding to HER2, e.g. compete for HER2 binding in the assay described in Example 14. An
antibody "blocks" or "cross-blocks" one or more other antibodies from binding to HER2 if the
antibody competes with the one or more other antibodies 25% or more, with 25%-74%
representing "partial block" and 75%-100% representing "full block", preferably as
determined using the assay of Example 14. For some pairs of antibodies, competition or
blocking in the assay of the Examples is only observed when one antibody is coated on the
plate and the other is used to compete, and not vice versa. Unless otherwise defined or
negated by context, the terms "competes with", "cross-competes with", "blocks" or "cross
blocks" when used herein is also intended to cover such pairs of antibodies.
        The term "epitope" means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an
antibody. Epitopes usually consist of surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or
                                                10

sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as
well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are
distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of
denaturing solvents. The epitope may comprise amino acid residues directly involved in the
binding (also called immunodominant component of the epitope) and other amino acid
residues, which are not directly involved in the binding, such as amino acid residues which
are effectively blocked or covered by the specifically antigen binding peptide (in other
words, the amino acid residue is within the footprint of the specifically antigen binding
peptide).
         The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to a preparation of antibody
molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a
single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. Accordingly, the term "human
monoclonal antibody" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have
variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences.
The human monoclonal antibodies may be generated by a hybridoma which includes a B cell
obtained from a transgenic or transchromosomal nonhuman animal, such as a transgenic
mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain
transgene, fused to an immortalized cell.
         As used herein, the term "binding" in the context of the binding of an antibody to a
predetermined antigen or epitope typically is a binding with an affinity corresponding to a      KD
of about 10-7 M or less, such as about 10-8 M or less, such as about 10-9 M or less, about
1010 M or less, or about 10-" M or even less when determined by for instance surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIAcore 3000 instrument using the antigen as the
ligand and the antibody as the analyte, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an
affinity corresponding to a   KD that is at least ten-fold lower, such as at least 100 fold lower,
for instance at least 1,000 fold lower, such as at least 10,000 fold lower, for instance at
least 100,000 fold lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA,
casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. The amount with
which the affinity is lower is dependent on the     KD of the antibody, so that when the   KD of
the antibody is very low (that is, the antibody is highly specific), then the amount with
which the affinity for the antigen is lower than the affinity for a non-specific antigen may be
at least 10,000 fold.
         The term "kd" (sec-1), as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate constant of a
particular antibody-antigen interaction. Said value is also referred to as the koff value.
         The term "ka" (M- x sec'), as used herein, refers to the association rate constant of
a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
                                                  11

         The term    "KD"   (M), as used herein, refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of
a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
         The term "KA" (M-), as used herein, refers to the association equilibrium constant of
a particular antibody-antigen interaction and is obtained by dividing the       ka  by the kd.
         As used herein, the term "inhibits proliferation" (e.g. referring to cells, such as tumor
cells) is intended to include any substantial decrease in the cell proliferation when contacted
with a HER2 antibody as compared to the proliferation of the same cells not in contact with
a HER2 antibody, e.g., the inhibition of proliferation of a cell culture by at least about 10%,
at least about 20% or at least about 30%, or at least as much as a reference antibody such
as trastuzumab, e.g., as determined by an assay in the Examples, e.g. example 16.
         As used herein, the term "promotes proliferation" (e.g. referring to cells, such as
tumor cells) is intended to include any substantial increase in the cell proliferation when
contacted with a HER2 antibody as compared to the proliferation of the same cells not in
contact with a HER2 antibody, e.g., the promotion of proliferation of a cell culture by at
least about 10%, at least about 20% or at least about 30%, or at least as much as a
reference antibody as F5, e.g., as determined by an assay in the Examples.
         As used herein, the term "internalization", when used in the context of a HER2
antibody includes any mechanism by which the antibody is internalized into a HER2
expressing      cell   from    the  cell-surface and/or    from   surrounding   medium,     e.g., via
endocytosis.      The internalization of an antibody can be evaluated using a direct assay
measuring the amount of internalized antibody (such as, e.g., the fab-CypHer5E assay
described in Example 18), or an indirect assay where the effect of an internalized antibody
toxin conjugate is measured (such as, e.g., the anti-kappa-ETA'assay of Example 17).
         The present invention also provides antibodies comprising functional variants of the
VL region,   VH  region, or one or more CDRs of the antibodies of the examples. A functional
variant of a VL,    VH,  or CDR used in the context of a HER2 antibody still allows the antibody
to retain at least a substantial proportion (at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%
or more) of the affinity/avidity and/or the specificity/selectivity of the parent antibody and
in some cases such a HER2 antibody may be associated with greater affinity, selectivity
and/or specificity than the parent antibody.
         Such functional variants typically retain significant sequence identity to the parent
antibody. The percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of
identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % homology = # of identical
positions/total # of positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length
of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The
percent identity between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences may e.g. be determined
using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, Comput. Apple. Biosci 4, 11-17 (1988) which
                                                    12

has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight
residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent
identity between two amino acid sequences may be determined using the Needleman and
Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48, 444-453 (1970) algorithm.
        Exemplary variants include those which differ from a parent antibody VH and/or VL
sequence shown in Figures 1 and 2 at one or more "variant" amino acid positions, denoted
"X" in the corresponding consensus sequence. Preferred variants are those in which the new
amino acid is selected from those at the corresponding position in one of the aligned
sequences in Figure 1 or 2 (for details on CDR sequence variants, see Table 4).
Alternatively or additionally, the sequence of VH, VL or CDR variants may differ from the
sequence of the VH, VL or CDR of the parent antibody sequences mainly by conservative
substitutions; for instance at least 10, such as at least 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 of the
substitutions in the variant are conservative amino acid residue replacements.
        In the context of the present invention, conservative substitutions may be defined by
substitutions within the classes of amino acids reflected in the following table:
        Amino acid residue classes for conservative substitutions
        Acidic Residues                         Asp (D) and Glu (E)
        Basic Residues                          Lys (K), Arg (R), and His (H)
        Hydrophilic Uncharged Residues          Ser (S), Thr (T), Asn (N), and
                                                Gln (Q)
        Aliphatic Uncharged Residues            Gly (G), Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L),
                                                and Ile (I)
        Non-polar Uncharged Residues            Cys (C), Met (M), and Pro (P)
        Aromatic Residues                       Phe (F), Tyr (Y), and Trp (W)
        The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell"), as used herein, is intended
to refer to a cell into which an expression vector has been introduced, e.g. an expression
vector encoding an antibody of the invention. Recombinant host cells include, for example,
transfectomas, such as CHO cells, HEK293 cells, NS/0 cells, and lymphocytic cells.
        The term "transgenic non-human animal" refers to a non-human animal having a
genome comprising one or more human heavy and/or light chain transgenes or
transchromosomes (either integrated or non-integrated into the animal's natural genomic
DNA) and which is capable of expressing fully human antibodies. For example, a transgenic
mouse can have a human light chain transgene and either a human heavy chain transgene
or human heavy chain transchromosome, such that the mouse produces human HER2
antibodies when immunized with HER2 antigen and/or cells expressing HER2. The human
                                               13

heavy chain transgene may be integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the mouse, as is
the case for transgenic mice, for instance HuMAb mice, such as HCo7, HCo12, or HCo17
mice, or the human heavy chain transgene may be maintained extrachromosomally, as is
the case for transchromosomal KM mice as described in W002/43478. Similar mice, having
a larger human Ab gene repertoire, include HCo7 and HCo20 (see e.g. W02009097006).
Such transgenic and transchromosomal mice (collectively referred to herein as "transgenic
mice") are capable of producing multiple isotypes of human monoclonal antibodies to a
given antigen (such as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and/or IgE) by undergoing V-D-J recombination
and isotype switching. Transgenic, nonhuman animal can also be used for production of
antibodies against a specific antigen by introducing genes encoding such specific antibody,
for example by operatively linking the genes to a gene which is expressed in the milk of the
animal.
        "Treatment" refers to the administration of an effective amount of a therapeutically
active compound of the present invention with the purpose of easing, ameliorating,
arresting or eradicating (curing) symptoms or disease states.
        An "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount
effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic
result. A therapeutically effective amount of a HER2 antibody may vary according to factors
such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the HER2
antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is
also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody portion are
outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.
        An "anti-idiotypic" antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants
generally associated with the antigen-binding site of an antibody.
Further aspects and embodiments of the invention
As described above, in a first aspect, the invention relates to a monoclonal antibody which
binds HER2.
        Monoclonal antibodies of the present invention may be produced, e.g., by the
hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256, 495 (1975), or may be
produced by recombinant DNA methods. Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from
phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in, for example, Clackson et al.,
Nature 352, 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222, 581-597 (1991).
Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from any suitable source. Thus, for example,
monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from hybridomas prepared from murine splenic B
cells obtained from mice immunized with an antigen of interest, for instance in form of cells
expressing the antigen on the surface, or a nucleic acid encoding an antigen of interest.
                                                14

Monoclonal antibodies may also be obtained from hybridomas derived from antibody
expressing cells of immunized humans or non-human mammals such as rats, dogs,
primates, etc.
        In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention is a human antibody. Human
monoclonal antibodies directed against HER2 may be generated using transgenic or
transchromosomal mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse
system. Such transgenic and transchromosomic mice include mice referred to herein as
HuMAb mice and KM mice, respectively, and are collectively referred to herein as
"transgenic mice".
        The HuMAb mouse contains a human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encodes
unrearranged human heavy (p and y) and       K light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together
with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p and    K chain loci (Lonberg, N. et
al., Nature 368, 856-859 (1994)). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of
mouse IgM or     K and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light
chain transgenes, undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity
human IgG,K monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg, N. et al. (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg,
N. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113, 49-101 (1994) , Lonberg, N. and Huszar,

        The HCo7, HCo12, HCo17 and HCo20 mice have a JKD disruption in their
endogenous light chain (kappa) genes (as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 821-830
(1993)), a CMD disruption in their endogenous heavy chain genes (as described in Example
1 of WO 01/14424), and a KCo5 human kappa light chain transgene (as described in
Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996)). Additionally, the Hco7 mice have
a HCo7 human heavy chain transgene (as described in US 5,770,429), the HCo12 mice
have a HCo12 human heavy chain transgene (as described in Example 2 of WO 01/14424),
the HCo17 mice have a HCo17 human heavy chain transgene (as described in Example 2 of
WO 01/09187) and the HCo20 mice have a HCo20 human heavy chain transgene. The
resulting mice express human immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain transgenes in a
                                                15

background homozygous for disruption of the endogenous mouse heavy and kappa light
chain loci.
        In the KM mouse strain, the endogenous mouse kappa light chain gene has been
homozygously disrupted as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 811-820 (1993) and the
endogenous mouse heavy chain gene has been homozygously disrupted as described in
Example 1 of WO 01/09187. This mouse strain carries a human kappa light chain
transgene, KCo5, as described in Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996).
This mouse strain also carries a human heavy chain transchromosome composed of
chromosome 14 fragment hCF (SC20) as described in WO 02/43478. HCo12-Balb/C mice
can be generated by crossing HCo12 to KCo5[J/K](Balb) as described in WO/2009/097006.
        Splenocytes from these transgenic mice may be used to generate hybridomas that
secrete human monoclonal antibodies according to well known techniques.
        Further, human antibodies of the present invention or antibodies of the present
invention from other species may be identified through display-type technologies, including,
without limitation, phage display, retroviral display, ribosomal display, and other
techniques, using techniques well known in the art and the resulting molecules may be
subjected to additional maturation, such as affinity maturation, as such techniques are well
known in the art (see for instance Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227, 381 (1991) (phage
display), Vaughan et al., Nature Biotech 14, 309 (1996) (phage display), Hanes and
Plucthau, PNAS USA 94, 4937-4942 (1997) (ribosomal display), Parmley and Smith, Gene
73, 305-318 (1988) (phage display), Scott TIBS 17, 241-245 (1992), Cwirla et al., PNAS

10, 80-84 (1992), and US 5,733,743). If display technologies are utilized to produce
antibodies that are not human, such antibodies may be humanized.

Antibody formats
The present invention provides HER2 antibodies which efficiently bind to and internalize into
HER2-expressing tumor cells, typically without significantly promoting ligand-independent
proliferation of the cells. Depending on the desired functional properties for a particular use,
particular antibodies can be selected from the set of antibodies provided in the present
invention and/or their format can be adapted to change these properties, as described
below.
        The antibody of the invention can be of any isotype. The choice of isotype typically
will be guided by the desired effector functions, such as ADCC induction. Exemplary isotypes
are IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Either of the human light chain constant regions, kappa or
lambda, may be used. If desired, the class of a HER2 antibody of the present invention may
be switched by known methods. For example, an antibody of the present invention that was
originally IgM may be class switched to an IgG antibody of the present invention. Further,
class switching techniques may be used to convert one IgG subclass to another, for instance
from IgG1 to IgG2. Thus, the effector function of the antibodies of the present invention
may be changed by isotype switching to, e.g., an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or
IgM antibody for various therapeutic uses. In one embodiment an antibody of the present
invention is an IgG1 antibody, for instance an IgG1,K.
        In a further embodiment, the antibody of the invention is glyco-engineered to reduce
fucose and thus enhance ADCC, e.g. by addition of compounds to the culture media during
antibody production as described in US2009317869 or as described in van Berkel et al.
(2010) Biotechnol. Bioeng. 105:350 or by using FUT8 knockout cells, e.g. as described in
Yamane-Ohnuki et al (2004) Biotechnol. Bioeng 87:614. ADCC may alternatively be
optimized using the method described by Umana et al. (1999) Nature Biotech 17:176.
        In a further embodiment, the antibody of the invention has been engineered to
enhance complement activation, e.g. as described in Natsume et al. (2009) Cancer Sci.
100:2411.
                                               41

        In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention is a full-length antibody,
preferably an IgG1 antibody, in particular an IgG1,K antibody. In another embodiment, the
antibody of the invention is an antibody fragment or a single-chain antibody.
       Antibody fragments may e.g. be obtained by fragmentation using conventional
techniques, and the fragments screened for utility in the same manner as described herein
for whole antibodies. For example, F(ab') 2 fragments may be generated by treating an
antibody with pepsin. The resulting F(ab') 2 fragment may be treated to reduce disulfide
bridges with a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol, to produce Fab' fragments. Fab
fragments may be obtained by treating an antibody with papain. A F(ab') 2 fragment may
also be produced by binding Fab' fragments via a thioether bond or a disulfide bond.
Antibody fragments may also be generated by expression of nucleic acids encoding such
fragments in recombinant cells (see for instance Evans et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 184,
123-38 (1995)). For example, a chimeric gene encoding a portion of an F(ab') 2 fragment
could include DNA sequences encoding the     CH1  domain and hinge region of the H chain,
followed by a translational stop codon to yield such a truncated antibody fragment
molecule.
       As explained above, in one embodiment, the HER2 antibody of the invention is a
bivalent antibody, i.e. an antibody capable of binding two antigens or epitopes on the same
antigen.
        In another embodiment, the HER2 antibody of the invention is a monovalent
antibody.
        In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention is a Fab fragment or a one-armed
antibody, such as described in US20080063641 (Genentech) or other monovalent antibody,
e.g. such as described in W02007048037 (Amgen).
        In a preferred embodiment, a monovalent antibody has a structure as described in
W02007059782 (Genmab) (incorporated herein by reference) having a deletion of the hinge
region. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the antibody is a monovalent antibody, wherein
said HER2 antibody is constructed by a method comprising:
        i)     providing a nucleic acid construct encoding the light chain of said monovalent
antibody, said construct comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the VL region of a
selected antigen specific HER2 antibody and a nucleotide sequence encoding the constant
CL region of an Ig, wherein said nucleotide sequence encoding the VL region of a selected
antigen specific antibody and said nucleotide sequence encoding the CL region of an Ig are
operably linked together, and wherein, in case of an IgG1 subtype, the nucleotide sequence
encoding the CL region has been modified such that the CL region does not contain any
amino acids capable of forming disulfide bonds or covalent bonds with other peptides
comprising an identical amino acid sequence of the CL region in the presence of polyclonal
                                               42

human IgG or when administered to an animal or human being;
         ii)      providing a nucleic acid construct encoding the heavy chain of said
monovalent antibody, said construct comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the VH
region of a selected antigen specific antibody and a nucleotide sequence encoding a
constant CH region of a human Ig, wherein the nucleotide sequence encoding the CH region
has been modified such that the region corresponding to the hinge region and, as required
by the Ig subtype, other regions of the CH region, such as the CH3 region, does not
comprise any amino acid residues which participate in the formation of disulphide bonds or
covalent or stable non-covalent inter-heavy chain bonds with other peptides comprising an
identical amino acid sequence of the CH region of the human Ig in the presence of
polyclonal human IgG or when administered to an animal human being, wherein said
nucleotide sequence encoding the VH region of a selected antigen specific antibody and said
nucleotide sequence encoding the CH region of said Ig are operably linked together;
         iii)     providing a cell expression system for producing said monovalent antibody;
         iv)      producing said monovalent antibody by co-expressing the nucleic acid
constructs of (i) and (ii) in cells of the cell expression system of (iii).
         Similarly, in one embodiment, the HER2 antibody is a monovalent antibody, which
comprises
         (i)      a variable region of an antibody of the invention as described herein or an
antigen binding part of the said region, and
         (ii)     a CH region of an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof comprising the      CH 2
and  CH 3   regions, wherein the   CH region or fragment thereof has been modified such that the
region corresponding to the hinge region and, if the immunoglobulin is not an IgG4 subtype,
other regions of the     CH region, such as the  CH 3 region, do not comprise any amino acid
residues, which are capable of forming disulfide bonds with an identical      CH region or other
covalent or stable non-covalent inter-heavy chain bonds with an identical       CH region in the
presence of polyclonal human IgG.
         In a further embodiment hereof, the heavy chain of the monovalent HER2 antibody
has been modified such that the entire hinge has been deleted.
         In another further embodiment, the immunoglobulin referred to in step ii) above is of
the IgG4 subtype.
         In another further embodiment, said monovalent antibody is of the IgG4 subtype,
but the   CH 3  region has been modified so that one or more of the following amino acid
substitutions have been made:

*KABAT indicates amino acid numbering according to Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of
Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991). EU index indicates amino acid numbering according to EU
index as outlined in Kabat et al., (supra).
         In another further embodiment, the sequence of said monovalent antibody has been
modified so that it does not comprise any acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation.
HER2 antibodies of the invention also include single chain antibodies. Single chain
antibodies are peptides in which the heavy and light chain Fv regions are connected. In one
embodiment, the present invention provides a single-chain Fv (scFv) wherein the heavy and
light chains in the Fv of a HER2 antibody of the present invention are joined with a flexible
peptide linker (typically of about 10, 12, 15 or more amino acid residues) in a single peptide
chain. Methods of producing such antibodies are described in for instance US 4,946,778,
Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore
eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994), Bird et al., Science 242, 423-426
(1988), Huston et al., PNAS USA 85, 5879-5883 (1988) and McCafferty et al., Nature 348,
552-554 (1990). The single chain antibody may be monovalent, if only a single       VH and VL
are used, bivalent, if two  VH  and VL are used, or polyvalent, if more than two VH  and VL are
used.
         In one embodiment, the HER2 antibody of the invention is an effector-function
deficient antibody. In one embodiment, the effector-function-deficient HER2 antibody is a
human stabilized IgG4 antibody, which has been modified to prevent Fab-arm exchange
(van der Neut Kolfschoten et al. (2007) Science 317(5844):1554-7). Examples of suitable
human stabilized IgG4 antibodies are antibodies, wherein arginine at position 409 in a
heavy chain constant region of human IgG4, which is indicated in the EU index as in Kabat
et al., is substituted with lysine, threonine, methionine, or leucine, preferably lysine
                                                44

(described in W02006033386 (Kirin)) and/or wherein the hinge region has been modified to
comprise a Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys sequence.
        In one embodiment, the stabilized IgG4 HER2 antibody is an IgG4 antibody
comprising a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein said heavy chain comprises a human
IgG4 constant region having a residue selected from the group consisting of: Lys, Ala, Thr,
Met and Leu at the position corresponding to 409 and/or a residue selected from the group
consisting of: Ala, Val, Gly, Ile and Leu at the position corresponding to 405, and wherein
said antibody optionally comprises one or more further substitutions, deletions and/or
insertions, but does not comprise a Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys sequence in the hinge region.
Preferably, said antibody comprises a Lys or Ala residue at the position corresponding to
409 or the CH3 region of the antibody has been replaced by the CH3 region of human IgG1,
of human IgG2 or of human IgG3. See also W02008145142 (Genmab).
        In an even further embodiment, the stabilized IgG4 HER2 antibody is an IgG4
antibody comprising a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein said heavy chain comprises a
human IgG4 constant region having a residue selected from the group consisting of: Lys,
Ala, Thr, Met and Leu at the position corresponding to 409 and/or a residue selected from
the group consisting of: Ala, Val, Gly, Ile and Leu at the position corresponding to 405, and
wherein said antibody optionally comprises one or more further substitutions, deletions
and/or insertions and wherein said antibody comprises a Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys sequence in the
hinge region. Preferably, said antibody comprises a Lys or Ala residue at the position
corresponding to 409 or the CH3 region of the antibody has been replaced by the CH3
region of human IgG1, of human IgG2 or of human IgG3.
        In a further embodiment, the effector-function-deficient HER2 antibody is an
antibody of a non-IgG4 type, e.g. IgG1, IgG2 or IgG3 which has been mutated such that
the ability to mediate effector functions, such as ADCC, has been reduced or even
eliminated. Such mutations have e.g. been described in Dall'Acqua WF et al., J Immunol.
177(2):1129-1138 (2006) and Hezareh M, J Virol. ;75(24):12161-12168 (2001).

HER2 bispecific antibody linked or conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, such as a cytotoxin,
a chemotherapeutic drug, a cytokine, an immunosuppressant, or a radioisotope. Such
conjugates are referred to herein as "immunoconjugates". Immunoconjugates which include
one or more cytotoxins are referred to as "immunotoxins".
        A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to (e.g., kills)
cells. Suitable therapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates of the present invention
include taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin,

protein, diphtherin toxin, and Pseudomonas endotoxin. See, for example, Pastan et al., Cell
47, 641 (1986) and Goldenberg, Calif. A Cancer Journal for Clinicians 44, 43 (1994).
Therapeutic agents that may be administered in combination with a HER2 antibody of the
present invention as described elsewhere herein, such as, e.g., anti-cancer cytokines or
chemokines, are also candidates for therapeutic moieties useful for conjugation to an
antibody of the present invention.
        In one embodiment, a HER2 antibody of the invention comprises a conjugated
nucleic acid or nucleic acid-associated molecule. In one such embodiment, the conjugated
nucleic acid is a cytotoxic ribonuclease, an antisense nucleic acid, an inhibitory RNA
molecule (e.g., a siRNA molecule) or an immunostimulatory nucleic acid (e.g., an
immunostimulatory CpG motif-containing DNA molecule). In another embodiment, a HER2
antibody of the invention is conjugated to an aptamer or a ribozyme.
                                               46

         In one embodiment, HER2 antibodies comprising one or more radiolabeled amino
acids are provided. A radiolabeled HER2 antibody may be used for both diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes (conjugation to radiolabeled molecules is another possible feature).
Non-limiting examples of labels for polypeptides include 3H, 14C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99Tc, and
1251, 1311, and 186Re.
         In one embodiment,          the antibody is conjugated          to a radioisotope or to a
radioisotope-containing chelate. For example, the antibody can be conjugated to a chelator
linker, e.g. DOTA, DTPA or tiuxetan, which allows for the antibody to be complexed with a
radioisotope. The antibody may also or alternatively comprise or be conjugated to one or
more radiolabeled amino acids or other radiolabeled molecule. A radiolabeled CD74 Ab may
be    used   for both    diagnostic     and therapeutic       purposes.     Non-limiting       examples of
                        3    4     5          0   99                       86     2 13     225        22 7
radioisotopes include H,    1  C, ' N,  35S, 9 Y,   Tc, 1251, "'In, 131I, 1   Re,      Bs,     Ac and     Th.
         HER2 antibodies may also be chemically modified by covalent conjugation to a
polymer to for instance increase their circulating half-life. Exemplary polymers, and
methods to attach them to peptides, are illustrated in for instance US 4,766,106, US
4,179,337, US 4,495,285 and US 4,609,546. Additional polymers include polyoxyethylated
polyols and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (e.g., a PEG with a molecular weight of between
about 1,000 and about 40,000, such as between about 2,000 and about 20,000).
        Any method known in the art for conjugating the HER2 antibody to the conjugated
molecule(s), such as those described above, may be employed, including the methods
described by Hunter et al., Nature 144, 945 (1962), David et al., Biochemistry 13, 1014
(1974), Pain et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 40, 219 (1981) and Nygren, J. Histochem. and
Cytochem. 30, 407 (1982). Such antibodies may be produced by chemically conjugating the
other moiety to the N-terminal side or C-terminal side of the HER2 antibody or fragment
thereof (e.g., a HER2 antibody H or L chain) (see, e.g., Antibody Engineering Handbook,
edited by Osamu Kanemitsu, published by Chijin Shokan (1994)). Such conjugated antibody
derivatives may also be generated by conjugation at internal residues or sugars, where
appropriate.
        The agents may be coupled either directly or indirectly to a HER2 antibody of the
present invention. One example of indirect coupling of a second agent is coupling via a
spacer moiety to cysteine or lysine residues in the antibody. In one embodiment, a HER2
antibody is conjugated to a prodrug molecule that can be activated in vivo to a therapeutic
drug via a spacer or linker. After administration, the spacers or linkers are cleaved by
tumor-cell associated enzymes or other tumor-specific conditions, by which the active drug
is formed. Examples of such prodrug techologies and linkers are described in WO02083180,
W02004043493, W02007018431, W02007089149, and W02009017394 by Syntarga BV,

et al. Suitable antibody-prodrug technology and duocarmycin analogs can also be found in
U.S. Patent No. 6,989,452 (Medarex).
 In one embodiment, the HER2 antibody of the present invention is attached to a chelator
linker, e.g. tiuxetan, which allows for the antibody to be conjugated to a radioisotope.
Bispecific antibodies
         In a further aspect, the invention relates to a bispecific molecule comprising a first
antigen binding site from a HER2 antibody of the invention as described herein above and a
second antigen binding site with a different binding specificity, such as a binding specificity
for a human effector cell, a human Fc receptor, a T cell receptor, a B cell receptor or a
binding specificity for a non-overlapping epitope of HER2, i.e. a bispecific antibody wherein
the first and second antigen binding sites do not cross-block each other for binding to HER2,
e.g. when tested as described in Example 14.
         Exemplary bispecific antibody molecules of the invention comprise (i) two antibodies,
one with a specificity to HER2 and another to a second target that are conjugated together,
(ii) a single antibody that has one chain or arm specific to HER2 and a second chain or arm
specific to a second molecule, (iii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to HER2 and a
second molecule, e.g., via two scFvs linked in tandem by an extra peptide linker; (iv) a
dual-variable-domain antibody (DVD-Ig), where each light chain and heavy chain contains
two variable domains in tandem through a short peptide linkage (Wu et al., Generation and
Characterization of a Dual Variable Domain Immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig TM ) Molecule, In:
Antibody Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg (2010)); (v) a chemically-linked bispecific
(Fab') 2 fragment;  (vi) a Tandab, which is a fusion of two single chain diabodies resulting in
a tetravalent bispecific antibody that has two binding sites for each of the target antigens;
(vii) a flexibody, which is a combination of scFvs with a diabody resulting in a multivalent
molecule; (viii) a so called "dock and lock" molecule, based on the "dimerization and
docking domain" in Protein Kinase A, which, when applied to Fabs, can yield a trivalent
bispecific binding protein consisting of two identical Fab fragments linked to a different Fab
fragment; (ix) a so-called Scorpion molecule, comprising, e.g., two scFvs fused to both
termini of a human Fc-region; and (x) a diabody. In one embodiment, the bispecific
antibody of the present invention is a diabody, a cross-body, or a bispecific obtained via a
controlled Fab arm exchange as those described in the present invention.

        the molecule contains the Fab region or parts of the Fab region of at least one other
        antibody; in this class, asymmetry in the Fc region could also be present, and be
        used for specific linkage of the two parts of the molecule;

        In one embodiment, the second molecule is a cancer antigen/tumor-associated
antigen such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate specific antigen (PSA), RAGE
(renal antigen), a-fetoprotein, CAMEL (CTL-recognized antigen on melanoma), CT antigens

progression (for instance another one of the HER receptors; HER1, HER3, or HER4). In one
embodiment, the second antigen-binding site binds a different, preferably non-blocking, site
on HER2 than the one bound by the antibody of the invention. For example, the second
molecule may be derived from, or cross-block HER2-binding of, trastuzumab, pertuzumab,
F5, or C1.
        Methods of preparing bispecific antibodies include those described in WO
2008119353 (Genmab) and reported van der Neut-Kolfschoten et al. (Science. 2007 Sep
14;317(5844):1554-7) and it may for example be performed as described in example 20 of

precipitated construct (as described in for instance WO 00/46147, Benvenisty and Reshef,
PNAS USA 83, 9551-55 (1986), Wigler et al., Cell 14, 725 (1978), and Coraro and Pearson,
Somatic Cell Genetics 7, 603 (1981)). Such nucleic acid vectors and the usage thereof are
well known in the art (see for instance US 5,589,466 and US 5,973,972).
         Exemplary expression vectors for the antibodies of the invention are also described

such as the vectors described in Bebbington (1992) Biotechnology (NY) 10:169-175.
         A nucleic acid and/or vector may also comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a
secretion/localization sequence, which can target a polypeptide, such as a nascent
polypeptide chain, to the periplasmic space or into cell culture media. Such sequences are
known in the art, and include secretion leader or signal peptides.
         In an expression vector of the invention, HER2 antibody-encoding nucleic acids may
comprise or be associated with any suitable promoter, enhancer, and other expression
facilitating elements. Examples of such elements include strong expression promoters (e. g.,
human CMV IE promoter/enhancer as well as RSV, SV40, SL3-3, MMTV, and HIV LTR
promoters), effective poly (A) termination sequences, an origin of replication for plasmid
product in E. coli, an antibiotic resistance gene as selectable marker, and/or a convenient
cloning site (e.g., a polylinker). Nucleic acids may also comprise an inducible promoter as
opposed to a constitutive promoter such as CMV IE.
         In one embodiment, the HER2 antibody-encoding expression vector may be
positioned in and/or delivered to the host cell or host animal via a viral vector.

a cell comprising a nucleic acid stably integrated into the cellular genome that comprises a
sequence coding for expression of a HER2 antibody of the present invention. In another
embodiment, the present invention provides a cell comprising a non-integrated nucleic acid,
such as a plasmid, cosmid, phagemid, or linear expression element, which comprises a
sequence coding for expression of a HER2 antibody of the invention.
        In a further aspect, the invention relates to a hybridoma which produces an antibody
of the invention as defined herein. In an even further aspect, the invention relates to a
transgenic non-human animal or plant comprising nucleic acids encoding a human heavy

Uses
In a further main aspect, the invention relates to a HER2 antibody of the invention for use
as a medicament.
        The HER2 antibodies of the invention may be used for a number of purposes. In
particular, the antibodies of the invention may be used for the treatment of various forms of
cancer, including metastatic cancer and refractory cancer.
        In one embodiment, the HER2 antibodies of the invention are used for the treatment
of breast cancer, including primary, metastatic, and refractory breast cancer.
        In one embodiment, the HER2 antibodies of the invention are used for the treatment

lung cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal
cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head & neck, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer,
testis cancer, malignant melanoma and a soft-tissue cancer (e.g. synovial sarcoma).
                                                55

        Similarly, the invention relates to a method for killing a tumor cell expressing HER2,
comprising administration, to an individual in need thereof, of an effective amount of an
antibody of the invention, such as an antibody drug-conjugate (ADC).
        In one embodiment, said tumor cell is involved in a form of cancer selected from the
group consisting of: breast cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder
cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer and squamous
cell carcinoma of the head & neck, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, testis cancer,
malignant melanoma, and a soft-tissue cancer (e.g., synovial sarcoma).
        In one embodiment, the tumor cell is one that co-expresses HER2 and at least one
other member of the EGFR family, preferably EGFR, HER3, or both of EGFR and HER3, and
is a tumor cell involved in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial/cervical cancer,
lung cancer, malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, testis
cancer, a soft-tissue tumor (e.g., synovial sarcoma), or bladder cancer.
        In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for treating cancer in a subject,
comprising selecting a subject suffering from a cancer comprising tumor cells co-expressing
HER2 and EGFR and/or HER3, and administering to the subject an antibody of the invention,
optionally in the form of an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent or drug. In one
embodiment, the subject suffers from a cancer selected from the group consisting of breast
cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial/cervical cancer, lung cancer, malignant melanoma,
ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, testis cancer, a soft-tissue tumor (e.g.,
synovial sarcoma), or bladder cancer.
        Also, the invention relates to the use of a monoclonal antibody that binds to human
HER2 for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, such as one of the
specific cancer indications mentioned above.
        The invention further relates to a monoclonal antibody for use in the treatment of
cancer, such as one of the cancer indications mentioned above.
        In a further embodiment of the methods of treatment of the present invention, the
efficacy of the treatment is being monitored during the therapy, e.g. at predefined points in
time, by determining tumor burden or HER2 expression levels on the relevant tumor cells.
        Dosage regimens in the above methods of treatment and uses are adjusted to
provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single
bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the
dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the
therapeutic situation. Parenteral compositions may be formulated in dosage unit form for
ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.
        The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the HER2 antibodies depend on
the disease or condition to be treated and may be determined by the persons skilled in the
                                               56

art. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of a compound
of the present invention is about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-50 mg/kg, for example
about 0.1-20 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-10 mg/kg, for instance about 0.5, about such as
0.3, about 1, about 3, about 5, or about 8 mg/kg.
        A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art may readily determine and
prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example,
the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the HER2 antibody employed in the
pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the
desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is
achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a composition of the present invention will be
that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic
effect. Administration may e.g. be parenteral, such as intravenous, intramuscular or
subcutaneous. In one embodiment, the HER2 antibodies may be administered by infusion in
a weekly dosage of from 10 to 500 mg/m 2, such as of from 200 to 400 mg/m 2 . Such
administration may be repeated, e.g., 1 to 8 times, such as 3 to 5 times. The administration
may be performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as of
from 2 to 12 hours. In one embodiment, the HER2 antibodies may be administered by slow
continuous infusion over a long period, such as more than 24 hours, in order to reduce toxic
side effects.
        In one embodiment the HER2 antibodies may be administered in a weekly dosage of
from 250 mg to 2000 mg, such as for example 300 mg, 500 mg, 700 mg, 1000 mg, 1500
mg or 2000 mg, for up to 8 times, such as from 4 to 6 times when given once a week. Such
regimen may be repeated one or more times as necessary, for example, after 6 months or
12 months. The dosage may be determined or adjusted by measuring the amount of
compound of the present invention in the blood upon administration by for instance taking
out a biological sample and using anti-idiotypic antibodies which target the antigen binding
region of the HER2 antibodies of the present invention.
        The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the bispecific antibodies depend
on the disease or condition to be treated and may be determined by the persons skilled in
the art. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of a
bispecific antibody of the present invention is about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-50
mg/kg, for example about 0.1-20 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-10 mg/kg, for instance about
0.5, about such as 0.3, about 1, about 3, about 5, or about 8 mg/kg.
        In one embodiment, the HER2 antibodies may be administered by maintenance
therapy, such as, e.g., once a week for a period of 6 months or more.
                                              57

         A HER2 antibody may also be administered prophylactically in order to reduce the
risk of developing cancer, delay the onset of the occurrence of an event in cancer
progression, and/or reduce the risk of recurrence when a cancer is in remission.
HER2 antibodies may also be administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with
other therapeutic agents relevant for the disease or condition to be treated. Accordingly, in
one embodiment, the antibody-containing medicament is for combination with one or more
further therapeutic agent, such as a cytotoxic, chemotherapeutic or anti-angiogenic agent.
         Such combined administration may be simultaneous, separate or sequential. For
simultaneous administration the agents may be administered as one composition or as
separate compositions, as appropriate. The present invention thus also provides methods
for treating a disorder involving cells expressing HER2 as described above, which methods
comprise administration of a HER2 antibody of the present invention combined with one or
more additional therapeutic agents as described below.

radiotherapy to a subject in need thereof.
        In one embodiment, the present invention provides the use of a HER2 antibody, such
as a HER2 antibody of the present invention, for the preparation of a pharmaceutical
composition for treating cancer to be administered in combination with radiotherapy.
        Radiotherapy may comprise radiation or associated administration of
radiopharmaceuticals to a patient is provided. The source of radiation may be either
external or internal to the patient being treated (radiation treatment may, for example, be
in the form of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy (BT)). Radioactive
elements that may be used in practicing such methods include, e.g., radium, cesium-137,
iridium-192, americium-241, gold-198, cobalt-57, copper-67, technetium-99, iodide-123,

preventing cancer, which method comprises administration to a subject in need thereof of a
therapeutically effective amount of a HER2 antibody, such as a HER2 antibody of the
present invention, in combination with surgery.
Diagnostic uses
        The HER2 antibodies of the invention may also be used for diagnostic purposes.
Thus, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a diagnostic composition comprising a
HER2 antibody as defined herein.
        In one embodiment, the HER2 antibodies of the present invention may be used in
vivo or in vitro for diagnosing diseases wherein activated cells expressing HER2 play an
active role in the pathogenesis, by detecting levels of HER2, or levels of cells which contain
HER2 on their membrane surface. This may be achieved, for example, by contacting a
sample to be tested, optionally along with a control sample, with the HER2 antibody under
conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the antibody and HER2.
        Thus, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for detecting the
presence of HER2 antigen, or a cell expressing HER2, in a sample comprising:
- contacting the sample with a HER2 antibody of the invention under conditions that allow
for formation of a complex between the antibody and HER2; and
- analyzing whether a complex has been formed.
        In one embodiment, the method is performed in vitro.
        More specifically, the present invention provides methods for the identification of,
and diagnosis of invasive cells and tissues, and other cells targeted by HER2 antibodies of
the present invention, and for the monitoring of the progress of therapeutic treatments,
status after treatment, risk of developing cancer, cancer progression, and the like.
                                               63

        Suitable labels for the HER2 antibody and/or secondary antibodies used in such
techniques are well-known in the art.
        In a further aspect, the invention relates to a kit for detecting the presence of HER2
antigen, or a cell expressing HER2, in a sample comprising
- a HER2 antibody of the invention or a bispecific molecule of the invention; and
- instructions for use of the kit.
        In one embodiment, the present invention provides a kit for diagnosis of cancer
comprising a container comprising a HER2 antibody, and one or more reagents for detecting
binding of the HER2 antibody to HER2. Reagents may include, for example, fluorescent
tags, enzymatic tags, or other detectable tags. The reagents may also include secondary or
tertiary antibodies or reagents for enzymatic reactions, wherein the enzymatic reactions
produce a product that may be visualized.
Anti-idiotypic antibodies
        In a further aspect, the invention relates to an anti-idiotypic antibody which binds to
a HER2 antibody of the invention as described herein.
        An anti-idiotypic (Id) antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants
generally associated with the antigen-binding site of an antibody. An Id antibody may be
prepared by immunizing an animal of the same species and genetic type as the source of a
HER2 mAb with the mAb to which an anti-Id is being prepared. The immunized animal
typically can recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing
antibody by producing an antibody to these idiotypic determinants (the anti-Id antibody).
        An anti-Id antibody may also be used as an "immunogen" to induce an immune
response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody. An anti-anti-Id
may be epitopically identical to the original mAb, which induced the anti-Id. Thus, by using
antibodies to the idiotypic determinants of a mAb, it is possible to identify other clones
expressing antibodies of identical specificity.
        The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should
not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
        The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should
not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
EXAMPLES
Example 1 - Expression constructs for HER2 and HER2 variants
Fully codon-optimized constructs for expression of full length HER2 (1255 aa, Swissprot
P04626), the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 (Her2-ECDHis, aa 1-653 with a C-terminal
His6 tag), the naturally occurring HER2 splice variant (Her2-delex16, resulting from exon 16
                                                64

deletion and lacking aa 633-648) and a truncated form of the HER2 receptor (Her2-stumpy,
aa 648-1256), were generated. The construct contained suitable restriction sites for cloning
and an optimal Kozak sequence (Kozak, M., Gene 1999;234(2):187-208.). The constructs
were cloned in the mammalian expression vector pEE13.4 (Lonza Biologics; Bebbington,
C.R., et al., Biotechnology (N Y) 1992;10(2):169-75) and fully sequenced to confirm the
correctness of the construct.
Example 2 - Expression constructs for Pertuzumab,            C1 and F5
Fully codon-optimized constructs for expression of the heavy chain (HG) and the light chain
(LC) of the IgG1 antibodies pertuzumab, C1 and F5 in HEK cells, were generated. The
variable regions encoded by these constructs are identical to those described in U.S. Patent
No. 6,949,245 for pertuzumab heavy chain and light chain and U.S. Patent No. 7,244,826
for C1 and F5 heavy and light chain. For C1 and F5, the mammalian expression vectors
p33G1f and p33K or p33L (pcDNA3.3 (Invitrogen)) containing the fully codon optimized
constant region for the human IgG1 heavy chain (allotype f), the human kappa light chain
or the human lambda light chain, respectively, were used. For pertuzumab, the mammalian
expression vectors pGlf (pEE12.4 (Lonza Biologics) and pKappa (pEE6.4 (Lonza Biologics),
containing the fully codon-optimized constant region for the human IgG1 heavy chain
(allotype f) and the human kappa light chain, respectively, were used.
        Trastuzumab (Herceptin*) can be produced in the same manner, using the heavy
and light chain sequences described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,632,924.
Example 3 - Transient expression in HEK-293 or CHO cells
Freestyle TM 293-F (a HEK-293 subclone adapted to suspension growth and chemically
defined Freestyle medium, (HEK-293F)) cells were obtained from Invitrogen and transfected
with the appropriate plasmid DNA, using 293fectin (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. In the case of antibody expression, the appropriate heavy chain
and light chain expression vectors were co-expressed.
        pEE13.4Her2, pEE13.4Her2-delex16 and pEE13.4Her2-stumpy were transiently
transfected in the Freestyle TM CHO-S (Invitrogen) cell line using Freestyle MAX transfection
reagent (Invitrogen). Expression of HER2 and Her2-delex16 was tested by means of FACS
analysis as described below.
Example 4 - Stable polyclonal pool expression in NSO
pEE13.4Her2, pEE13.4Her2-delex16 and pEE13.4Her2-stumpy were stably transfected in
NSO cells by nucleofection (Amaxa). A pool of stably transfected cells was established after
                                               65

selection on glutamine dependent growth, based on the integrated glutamine synthetase
selection marker (Barnes, L.M., et al., Cytotechnology 2000;32(2):109-123).
Example 5 - Purification of His-tagged HER2
Her2ECDHis was expressed in HEK-293F cells. The His-tag in Her2ECDHis enabled
purification with immobilized metal affinity chromatography, since the His-tagged protein
binds strongly to the resin beads, while other proteins present in the culture supernatant do
not bind strongly.
In this process, a chelator fixed onto the chromatographic resin was charged with C02+
cations. Her2ECDHis containing supernatant was incubated with the resin in batch mode
(i.e. solution). After incubation, the beads were retrieved from the supernatant and packed
into a column. The column was washed in order to remove weakly bound proteins. The
strongly bound Her2ECDHis proteins were then eluted with a buffer containing imidazole,
which competes with the binding of His to C02+. The eluent was removed from the protein
by buffer exchange on a desalting column.
Example 6 - Immunization procedure of transgenic mice
Antibodies 001, 019, 021, 025, 027, 032, 033, 035, 036, 049, 050, 051, 054, 055, 084,
091, 094, 098, 100, 105, 123 and 124 were derived from the following immunization: three
female HCo12 mice, one male and two female HCo12-Balb/C mice, one male HCo17 mouse
and one male HCo20 mouse (Medarex, San Jose, CA, USA) were immunized alternating with
5x10 6 NSO cells transiently transfected with Her2ECD intraperitoneal (IP) and 20 pg
Her2ECDHis protein coupled to the hapten Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) subcutaneous
(SC) at the tail base, with an interval of fourteen days. A maximum of eight immunizations
was performed per mouse (four IP and four SC immunizations). The first immunization with
cells was done in complete Freunds' adjuvant (CFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).
For all other immunizations, cells were injected IP in PBS and KLH coupled Her2ECD was
injected SC using incomplete Freunds' adjuvant (IFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).
        Antibodies 125, 127, 129, 132, 152, 153 and 159 were derived from the following
immunization: one male and two female HCo12-Balb/C mice, one female HCo20 mouse, and
one female HCo12 mouse (Medarex) were immunized alternating with 5x10 6 NSO cells
transiently transfected with Her2delex16 IP and 20 pg Her2ECDHis protein coupled to the
hapten Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) SC at the tail base, with an interval of fourteen
days. A maximum of eight immunizations was performed per mouse (four IP and four SC
immunizations). The first immunization with cells was done in complete Freunds' adjuvant
(CFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA). For all other immunizations, cells were injected
                                                66

IP in PBS and KLH coupled Her2ECD was injected SC using incomplete Freunds' adjuvant
(IFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).
        Antibody 143, 160, 161, 162, 166 and 169 were derived from the following
immunization: one female and one male Hco12 mouse, one female Hco12-Balb/C mouse,
one male HCo17 mouse and one male HCo20 mouse (Medarex) were immunized alternating
with 20 pg Her2ECDHis protein coupled to the hapten Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH),
alternating IP and SC at the tail base with an interval of fourteen days. A maximum of eight
immunizations was performed per mouse (four IP and four SC immunizations). The first
immunization was done IP in complete Freunds' adjuvant (CFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit,
MI, USA). The other immunizations were injected using incomplete Freunds' adjuvant (IFA;
Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).
        Mice with at least two sequential titers against TC1014-Her2, TC1014-Her2delex16
or TC1014-Her2stumpy in the antigen specific FMAT screening assay (as described in
example 7), were considered positive and fused.
Example 7 - Homogeneous antigen specific screening assay
The presence of HER2 antibodies in sera of immunized mice or HuMab (human monoclonal
antibody) hybridoma or transfectoma culture supernatant was determined by homogeneous
antigen specific screening assays (four quadrant) using Fluorometric Micro volume Assay
Technology (FMAT; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). For this, a combination of 4
cell based assays was used. Binding to TC1014-Her2 (HEK-293F cells transiently expressing
the HER2 receptor; produced as described above), TC1014-Her2delex16 (HEK-293F cells
transiently expressing the extracellular domain of Her2-delex (a 16 amino acid deletion
mutant of the HER2 receptor; produced as described above) and TC1014-Her2stumpy
(HEK-293F cells transiently expressing the extracellular stumpy domain of the HER2
receptor; produced as described above) as well as HEK293 wild type cells (negative control
cells which do not express HER2) was determined. Samples were added to the cells to allow
binding to HER2. Subsequently, binding of HuMab was detected using a fluorescent
conjugate (Goat anti-Human IgG-Cy5; Jackson ImmunoResearch). TH1014-Pertuzumab
(produced in HEK-293F cells) was used as a positive control and HuMab-mouse pooled
serum and HuMab-KLH were used as negative controls. The samples were scanned using an
Applied Biosystems 8200 Cellular Detection System (8200 CDS) and 'counts x fluorescence'
was used as read-out. Samples were stated positive when counts were higher than 50 and
counts x fluorescence were at least three times higher than the negative control.
Example 8 - HuMab hybridoma generation
                                                67

HuMab mice with sufficient antigen-specific titer development (defined as above) were
sacrificed and the spleen and lymph nodes flanking the abdominal aorta and vena cava were
collected. Fusion of splenocytes and lymph node cells to a mouse myeloma cell line was
done by electrofusion using a CEEF 50 Electrofusion System (Cyto Pulse Sciences, Glen
Burnie, MD, USA), essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, the
primary wells were sub cloned using the ClonePix system (Genetix, Hampshire, UK). To this
end specific primary well hybridoma's were seeded in semisolid medium made from 40%
CloneMedia (Genetix, Hampshire, UK) and 60% HyQ 2x complete media (Hyclone, Waltham,
USA). The sub clones were retested in the antigen-specific binding assay as described in
Example 7 and IgG levels were measured using an Octet (Fortebio, Menlo Park, USA) in
order to select the most specific and best producing clone per primary well for further
expansion. Further expansion and culturing of the resulting HuMab hybridomas were done
based upon standard protocols (e.g. as described in Coligan J.E., Bierer, B.E., Margulies,
D.H., Shevach, E.M. and Strober, W., eds. Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley &
Sons, Inc., 2006). Clones derived by this process were designated PC1014.
Example 9 - Mass Spectrometry of purified antibodies
Small aliquots of 0.8 mL antibody containing supernatant from 6-well or Hyperflask stage
were purified using PhyTip columns containing Protein G resin (PhyNexus Inc., San Jose,
USA) on a Sciclone ALH 3000 workstation (Caliper Lifesciences, Hopkinton, USA). The
PhyTip columns were used according to manufacturer's instructions, although buffers were
replaced by: Binding Buffer PBS (B.Braun, Medical B.V., Oss, Netherlands) and Elution
Buffer 0.1M Glycine-HCI pH 2.7 (Fluka Riedel-de HaLn, Buchs, Germany). After purification,
samples were neutralized with 2M Tris-HCI, pH 9.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,
Netherlands). Alternatively, in some cases larger volumes of culture supernatant were
purified using MabSelect SuRe.
        After purification, the samples were placed in a 384-well plate (Waters, 100 pl
square well plate, part# 186002631). Samples were deglycosylated overnight at 37*C with
N-glycosidase F (Roche cat no 11365177001. DTT (15 mg/mL) was added (1 pL/well) and
incubated for 1 h at 37*C. Samples (5 or 6 pL) were desalted on an Acquity UPLC TM
(Waters, Milford, USA) with a BEH300 C18, 1.7pm, 2.1x 50 mm column at 60 *C. MQ water
and LC-MS grade acetonitrile (Biosolve, cat no 01204101, Valkenswaard, The Netherlands)
with both 0.1% formic acid (Fluka, cat no 56302, Buchs, Germany), were used as Eluens A
and B, respectively. Time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectra were recorded on
line on a micrOTOFTM mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) operating in the
positive ion mode. Prior to analysis, a 900-3000 m/z scale was calibrated with ES tuning
mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Mass spectra were deconvoluted with
                                               68

DataAnalysisT M software v. 3.4 (Bruker) using the Maximal Entropy algorithm searching for
molecular weights between 5 and 80 kDa.
        After deconvolution, the resulting heavy and light chain masses for all samples were
compared in order to find duplicate antibodies. This was sometimes due to the presence of
an extra light chain, but in the comparison of the heavy chains, the possible presence of C
terminal lysine variants was also taken into account. This resulted in a list of unique
antibodies, i.e., a unique combination of specific heavy and light chains. In case duplicate
antibodies were found, one unique antibody was selected based on results from other tests.
Example 10 - Sequence analysis of the HER2 antibody variable domains and
cloning in expression vectors
Total RNA of the HER2 HuMabs was prepared from 5x10 6 hybridoma cells and 5'-RACE
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from 100 ng total RNA, using the SMART RACE
cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. VH and VL
coding regions were amplified by PCR and cloned directly, in frame, in the pG1f and pKappa
expression vectors, by ligation independent cloning (Aslanidis, C. and P.J. de Jong, Nucleic
Acids Res 1990;18(20): 6069-74). Clones derived by this process were designated TH1014.
For each antibody, 16 VL clones and 8 VH clones were sequenced. Clones which predicted
heavy and light chain mass in agreement with the mass of the hybridoma derived material
of the same antibody (as determined by mass spectrometry) were selected for further study
and expression.
        The resulting sequences are shown in Figures 1 and 2 and in the Sequence Listing.
Selected sequences are also described in more detail below. CDR sequences were defined

Example 11 - Purification of antibodies
Culture supernatant was filtered over 0.2 pm dead-end filters, loaded on 5 ml MabSelect
SuRe columns (GE Health Care) and eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate-NaOH, pH 3. The
eluate was immediately neutralized with 2M Tris-HCI, pH 9 and dialyzed overnight to 12.6
mM NaH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (B.Braun). Alternatively, subsequent to purification,
the eluate was loaded on a HiPrep Desalting column and the antibody was exchanged into
12.6 mM NaH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (B.Braun) buffer. After dialysis or exchange of
                                             80

buffer, samples were sterile filtered over 0.2 pm dead-end filters. Purity was determined by
SDS-PAGE and concentration was measured by nephelometry and absorbance at 280 nm.
Purified antibodies were stored at 40 C. Mass spectrometry was performed to identify the
molecular mass of the antibody heavy and light chains expressed by the hybridomas as
described in Example 9.
Example 12 - Binding of HER2 clones to tumor cells expressing membrane-bound
HER2 measured by means of FACS analysis
The binding of HER2 antibodies to AU565 cells (purchased at ATCC, CRL-2351) and A431
cells (purchased at ATCC, CRL-1555), was tested using flow cytometry (FACS Canto II, BD
Biosciences). Qifi analysis (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) revealed that AU565 cells expressed
on average 1,000,000 copies of HER2 protein per cell, whereas A431 cells expressed on
average 15,000 copies per cell. Binding of HER2 antibodies was detected using a
Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson). Trastuzumab
(clinical-grade Herceptin*) was used as positive control antibody, and an isotype control
antibody was used as negative control antibody. ECs0 values were determined by means of
non-linear regression (sigmoidal dose-response with variable slope) using GraphPad Prism
V4.03 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
        As shown in Figure 3, all tested HER2 antibodies bound to HER2 expressed on both
AU565 and A431 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The ECs0 values for binding varied
between 0.336-2.290 pg/mL for AU565 cells and 0.068-1.135 pg/mL for A431 cells.
Especially on A431 cells, large differences in ECs0 values were observed between the tested
antibodies. However, antibody 098 had the best (i.e., lowest) ECs 0 value on both types of
cells. Also some differences in maximum binding levels were observed between different
antibodies, on both AU565 and A431 cells. Of the tested antibodies, antibody 098 also had
the highest maximum binding level on AU565 cells, whereas antibody 025 had the highest
maximum binding level on A431 cells.
Example 13 - Binding of HER2 antibodies to membrane-bound HER2 expressed on
Rhesus epithelial cells measured by means of FACS analysis
To determine cross-reactivity with Rhesus HER2, the binding of HER2 antibodies to HER2
positive Rhesus epithelial cells (4MBr-5 purchased at ATCC) was tested using flow cytometry
(FACS Canto II, BD Biosciences). A Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG antibody
(Jackson) was used as a secondary conjugate. An isotype control antibody was used as
negative control antibody.
        As shown in Figure 4, all tested HER2 antibodies were cross-reactive with Rhesus
monkey HER2. At both tested concentrations (1 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL), the HER2 antibodies
                                               81

were able to bind specifically to Rhesus monkey HER2. Antibody 127 demonstrated poor
binding at 1 pg/mL concentration, but showed good binding at 10 pg/mL concentration.
Antibody 098 had the highest binding level at both antibody concentrations. No binding was
observed with the isotype control antibody.
Example 14 - Competition of HER2 antibodies for binding to soluble Her2ECDHis
measured in sandwich-ELISA
The optimal coating concentrations of the tested HER2 antibodies and optimal Her2ECDHis
concentration were determined in the following manner: ELISA wells were coated overnight
at 4*C with HER2 HuMabs serially diluted in PBS (0.125-8 pg/mL in 2-fold dilutions). Next,
the ELISA wells were washed with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 [Sigma
Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands]) and blocked for one hour at room temperature (RT)
with PBSTC (PBST supplemented 2% [v/v] chicken serum [Gibco, Paisley, Scotland]). The
ELISA wells were then washed with PBST and incubated for one hour at RT with Her2ECDHis
serially diluted in PBSTC (0.25-2 pg/mL in 2-fold dilutions). Unbound Her2ECDHis was
washed away with PBST, and bound Her2ECDHis was incubated for one hour at RT with
0.25 pg/mL biotinylated rabbit-anti-6xhis-biot (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The plate was
thereafter washed with PBST and incubated for one hour with 0.1 pg/mL Streptavidin-poly
HRP (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) diluted in PBST. After washing, the reaction
was visualized through a 15 minutes incubation with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline
6-sulfonic acid (ABTS: one ABTS tablet diluted in 50 mL ABTS buffer (Roche Diagnostics,
Almere, The Netherlands)) at RT protected from light. The colorization was stopped by
adding an equal volume of oxalic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).
Fluorescence at 405 nm was measured on a microtiter plate reader (Biotek Instruments,
Winooski, USA). The antibody concentrations that resulted in sub-optimal binding of each
antibody were determined and used for the following cross-block experiments.
         Each HER2 antibody was coated to the ELISA wells at the sub-optimal dose that was
determined as described above. After blocking of the ELISA wells, the wells were incubated
with the predetermined concentration of 1 pg/mL biotinylated Her2ECDHis in the presence
or absence of an excess of a second (competitor) HER2 antibody. The ELISA was then
performed as described above. Residual binding of Her2ECDHis to the coated antibody was
expressed as a percentage relative to the binding observed in the absence of competitor
antibody. Percentage competition was then determined as 100 minus the percentage of
inhibition. 75% competition was considered as complete cross-block, whereas 25-74%
competition was considered as partial cross-block, and 0-24% competition was considered
non-blocking.
                                             82

        As shown in Table 5, all HER2 antibodies were found to be able to block binding to
Her2ECDHis, at least partially, for themselves. After dividing the antibodies into 3 major
cross-block groups,     all antibodies were    tested   for competition   with   at least   one
representative antibody from each group.
        The first group comprised trastuzumab and antibodies 169, 050 and 084, which
blocked each other for binding to Her2ECDHis, but did not cross-block antibodies from other
groups.
        The second group comprised pertuzumab and antibodies 025, 091 and 129, which
blocked each other for binding to Her2ECDHis, except for antibodies 129 and 091 which
both cross-blocked pertuzumab and 025, but not each other. None of the antibodies of
group 2 blocked antibodies from other groups.
        A third group comprised antibodies C1, F5, 127, 098, 132, 153 and 159, which did
not cross-block any antibody from the other groups. Within this group 3, some variation
was observed. Antibody 127 was the only antibody that was able to cross-block all other
antibodies in this group for binding to Her2ECDHis; antibody 159 cross-blocked all other
antibodies within this group, except 132; clone 098 cross-blocked all antibodies of group 3,
except 132 and 153; antibody 153 cross-blocked 127, 132 and 159 for binding to
Her2ECDHis, but not 098, C1 or F5; clone 132 cross-blocked 127, 132 and 153. When
added as competitor antibodies, F5 and C1 only demonstrated cross-blocking of each other.
However, the reverse reaction also revealed competition with antibodies 127, 098 and 159,
but not 153 and 132. Possibly, these differences may have resulted from lower affinities of
antibodies C1 and F5 for Her2ECDHis.
        Values higher than 100% can be explained by avidity effects and the formation of
antibody-Her2ECDHis complexes containing two non-competing antibodies.

Example 15 - Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
SK-BR-3 cells (purchased at ATCC, HTB-30) were harvested (5x10 6 cells), washed (twice in
PBS, 1500 rpm, 5 min) and collected in 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
cosmic calf serum (CCS) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), to which 200 pCi 51Cr (Chromium-51;
Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) was added. The
mixture was incubated in a shaking water bath for 1.5 hours at 370 C. After washing of the
cells (twice in PBS, 1500 rpm, 5 min), the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% CCS, counted by trypan blue exclusion and diluted to a
concentration of 1x10 5 cells/mL.
         Meanwhile, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from fresh
buffy coats (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using standard Ficoll density
centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instructions (lymphocyte separation medium;
Lonza, Verviers, France). After resuspension of cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% CCS, cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion and concentrated to 1x10 7
cells/mL.
         Trastuzumab was produced in CHO cells resulting in an (increased) non-core
fucosylation grade of 12.4%, whereas the other HER2 antibodies were produced in HEK
cells, resulting on average in 4% non-core fucosylation.
         For the ADCC experiment, 50 pL  5 Cr-labeled SK-BR-3 cells (5.000 cells) were pre
incubated with 15 pg/mL HER2 antibody (IgG1,K) in a total volume of 100 pL RPMI medium
                                               84

supplemented with 10% CCS in a 96-well microtiter plate. After 15 min at RT, 50 pL PBMCs
(500,000 cells) were added, resulting in an effector to target ratio of 100:1. The maximum
amount of cell lysis was determined by incubating 50 pL     5 t Cr-labeled SK-BR-3 cells (5000
cells) with 100 pL 5% Triton-X100. The amount of spontaneous lysis was determined by
incubating 5000    5 tCr-labeled  SK-BR-3 cells in 150 pL medium, without any antibody or
effector cells. The level of antibody-independent cell lysis was determined by incubating
5000 SK-BR-3 cells with 500,000 PBMCs without antibody. Subsequently, the cells were
incubated 4 hr at 37*C, 5% C0 2 . To determine the amount of cell lysis, the cells were
centrifuged (1200 rpm, 3 min) and 75 pL of supernatant was transferred to micronic tubes,
after which the released    5 tCr was counted using a gamma counter. The measured counts
per minute (cpm) were used to calculate the percentage of antibody-mediated lysis as
follows:
(cpm sample - cpm Ab-independent lysis)/(cpm max. lysis - cpm spontaneous lysis)x 100%
As shown in Figure 5, HER2 antibodies from cross-block groups 1 and 2 induced efficient
lysis of SK-BR-3 cells through ADCC. From group 3, antibody 153 was the only antibody
that induced efficient ADCC, antibody 132 induced about 10% ADCC, and clones 098, 159
and 127 did not induce ADCC.
Example 16 - Inhibition of ligand-independent proliferation of AU565 cells
HER2 antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit proliferation of AU565 cells in vitro.
Due to the high HER2 expression levels on AU565 cells (-1,000,000 copies per cell as
described in Example 12), HER2 is constitutively active in these cells and thus not
dependent on ligand-induced heterodimerization.
         In a 96-well tissue culture plate (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), 9000
AU565 cells were seeded per well in the presence of 10 pg/mL HER2 antibody in serum-free
cell culture medium. As a control, cells were seeded in serum-free medium without
antibody. After 3 days, the amount of viable cells was quantified with Alamarblue
(BioSource International, San Francisco, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Fluorescence was monitored using the EnVision 2101 Multilabel reader (PerkinElmer, Turku,
Finland) with standard Alamarblue settings. The Alamarblue signal of antibody-treated cells
was plotted as a percentage relative to untreated cells. Dunnett's test was applied for
statistical analysis.
         The results are shown in Figure 6, depicting the percentage proliferation of AU565
cells after HER2 antibody treatment compared to untreated cells, which was set to 100%.
Of the tested Group 1 antibodies, trastuzumab, 050 and 169 demonstrated significant
inhibition of AU565 cell proliferation (P<0.05), whereas 084 had no effect. None of the
                                                  85

tested antibodies from group 2 (Pertuzumab, 025, 092 and 129) was able to inhibit AU565
cell proliferation. The tested antibodies from group 3 (098 and 153) did not inhibit AU565
proliferation. In contrast, both antibodies induced enhanced proliferation of AU565 cells
compared to untreated cells (098 more than 153). Enhancing proliferation can be an
advantage in some therapeutic applications of ADC-conjugates, e.g., where the cytotoxic
action of the drug relies on, or is enhanced by, cell proliferation. For trastuzumab and
pertuzumab, this was in accordance with the results described by Juntilla et al. (Cancer Cell
2009; 15(5):353-355).
Example 17 - Inhibition of ligand-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells
Since HER2 is an orphan receptor, its signaling is mainly dependent on activation of other
ErbB-family members such as EGFR and Her3. Upon ligand binding, these two receptors can
bind to and activate the HER2 receptor, resulting in e.g. proliferation. Various publications
describe that pertuzumab efficiently inhibits Heregulin-1-induced proliferation (Franklin
MC. Cancer Cell 2004 / Landgraf R. BCR 2007). For trastuzumab, it has been described that
it has little effect on Heregulin-1-induced HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and proliferation
(Larsen SS., et al., Breast Cancer Res Treat 2000;58:41-56; Agus DB., et al., Cancer Cell
2002;2:127-137; Wehrman et al. (2006), supra).
         To investigate the ability of the present human HER2 antibodies to interfere with
Heregulin-1-induced HER2/HER3 heterodimers, a Heregulin-1-induced proliferation assay
was performed. Therefore, MCF7 cells (purchased at ATCC, HTB-22) expressing -20.000
HER2 molecules per cell, were seeded in a 96-wells tissue culture plate (Greiner bio-one)
(2.500 cells/well) in complete cell culture medium. After 4 hours, the cell culture medium
was replaced with starvation medium containing 1% Cosmic Calf Serum (CCS) and 10
pg/mL HER2 antibody. Next, Heregulin-31 (PeproTech, Princeton Business Park, US) diluted
in 1% CCS containing starvation medium was added to the wells to a final concentration of
1.5 ng/ml. After 4 days incubation, the amount of viable cells was quantified with
Alamarblue (BioSource International) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Fluorescence was monitored using the EnVision 2101 Multilabel reader (PerkinElmer) with
standard Alamarblue settings. The Alamarblue signal of HER2 antibody-treated ligand
induced cells was plotted as a percentage signal compared to ligand-induced cells incubated
without HER2 antibody. Dunnett's test was applied for statistical analysis.
         Figure 7 shows the percentage of viable MCF7 cells stimulated with Heregulin-31 and
treated with the indicated HER2 antibody, relative to the viable cells after stimulation with
Heregulin-31 in the absence of HER2 antibody, which was set to 100%. MCF-7 proliferation
in absence of both Heregulin-31 and antibody was also depicted (none). Antibodies 025,
091, 129, 153 and pertuzumab (TH1014-pert) demonstrated significant inhibition of
                                                 86

Heregulin-1-induced MCF-7 proliferation (P<0.05). Also trastuzumab showed some
inhibition of Heregulin-p1-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells, although not as efficient as
the other tested HER2 antibodies. It has been reported that domain IV of HER2 is involved
in the stabilization of EGFR/HER2 heterodimers, but without details on its contribution to
HER2/HER3 heterodimers (Wehrman et al., supra). Antibodies 050, 084, 169 and 098 had
no statistically significant effect on Heregulin-1-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells.
Without being limited to theory, this suggests that these antibodies do not inhibit ligand
induced HER2/HER3 heterodimerization.
Example 18 - Anti-kappa-ETA' assay
To investigate the suitability of HER2 antibodies for an antibody-drug conjugate approach, a
generic in vitro cell-based killing assay using kappa-directed pseudomonas-exotoxin A (anti
kappa-ETA') was developed. The assay makes use of a high affinity anti-kappa domain
antibody conjugated to a truncated form of the pseudomonas-exotoxin A. Upon
internalization, the anti-kappa-ETA' domain antibody undergoes proteolysis and disulfide
bond reduction, separating the catalytic from the binding domain. The catalytic domain is
transported from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum via the KDEL retention motif, and
subsequently translocated to the cytosol where it inhibits protein synthesis and induces
apoptosis (ref. Kreitman RJ. BioDrugs 2009;23(1):1-13). In this assay, to identify HER2
antibodies that enable internalization and killing through the toxin, HER2 antibodies are
preconjugated with the anti-kappa-ETA' before incubation with HER2-positive cells.
         First, the optimal concentration of anti-kappa-ETA' was determined for each cell line,
i.e. the maximally tolerated dose that does not lead to induction of non-specific cell death.
AU565 cells (7500 cells/well) and A431 cells (2500 cells/well) were seeded in normal cell
culture medium in 96-wells tissue culture plate (Greiner bio-one) and allowed to adhere for
at least 4 hours. Next, cells were incubated with 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0 pg/mL
anti-kappa-ETA' dilutions in normal cell culture medium. After 3 days, the amount of viable
cells was quantified with Alamarblue (BioSource International, San Francisco, US) according
to the manufacturer's instruction. Fluorescence was monitored using the EnVision 2101
Multilabel reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) with standard Alamarblue settings. The
highest concentration anti-kappa-ETA' that did not kill the cells by itself was used for
following experiments (0.5 pg/mL for AU565 and 1 pg/mL for A431).
         Next, antibody-mediated internalization and killing by the toxin was tested for
different HER2 antibodies. Cells were seeded as described above. Dilution-series of HER2
antibodies were pre-incubated for 30 minutes with the predetermined concentration anti
kappa-ETA' before adding them to the cells. After 3 days of incubation, the amount of viable
cells was quantified as described above. The Alamarblue signal of cells treated with anti
                                                 87

kappa-ETA' conjugated antibodies was plotted compared to cells treated with antibody
alone. 23.4 pg/mL Staurosporin was used as positive control for cell killing. An isotype
control antibody was used as negative control.
        As shown in Figure 8A,B and Table 6, all anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated HER2
antibodies were able to kill AU565 cells in a dose-dependent manner. All tested anti-kappa
ETA'-conjugated HER2 antibodies demonstrated better killing of AU565 cells compared to
both anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated trastuzumab and anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated pertuzumab
(TH1014-pert). Moreover, the percentage of killed AU565 cells was higher for anti-kappa
ETA'-conjugated HER2 antibodies (70.3 - 49.9 %), compared to anti-kappa-ETA'
conjugated trastuzumab (31.9 %) and anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated pertuzumab (47.51 %),
and the ECs0 values were increased. EC 0 values for anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated HER2
antibodies ranged between 12.12 ng/mL and 46.49 ng/mL) compared to 78.49 ng/mL for
anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated trastuzumab and 117.8 ng/mL for anti-kappa-ETA'-conjugated
pertuzumab. Antibody 159 had the highest percentage of cell-kill, and 098 the lowest EC0 .

Example 19 - Internalization of HER2 antibodies measured with an FMAT-based
fab-CypHer5E assay
To investigate whether the enhanced killing of AU565 cells observed in the kappa-toxin-ETA'
assay described in the previous Example correlated with enhanced internalization of HER2
antibodies, a fab-CypHer5E-based internalization assay was performed. CypHer5E is a pH
sensitive dye which is non-fluorescent at basic pH (extracellular: culture medium) and
fluorescent at acidic pH (intracellular: lysosomes), with an acid dissociation constant (pKa)
of 7.3.
        AU565 cells were seeded in 384-well tissue culture plates (Greiner bio-one), at a
density of 3000 cells/well in normal cell culture medium supplemented with 240 ng/mL fab
CypHer5E (conjugation of Goat-fab-anti-Human IgG [Jackson] with CypHer5E [GE
Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands] was made according to manufacturer's
instructions). Next, HER2 antibodies were serially diluted in normal cell culture medium,
added to the cells and left at room temperature for 9 hours. Mean fluorescent intensities
(MFI) of intracellular CypHer5E were measured using the 8200 FMAT (Applied Biosystems,
Nieuwerkerk A/D IJssel, The Netherlands) and 'counts x fluorescence' was used as read-out.
An isotype control antibody was used as negative control antibody. ECs 0 values and maximal
MFI were determined by means of non-linear regression (sigmoidal dose-response with
                                                  89

variable slope) using GraphPad Prism V4.03 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA).
       The results are shown in Table 8, depicting the EC50 and maximal MFI values for all
tested HER2 antibodies in the CypHer5E internalization assay with AU565 cells. The
maximal MFI values indicate how many HER2 receptors are internalized upon antibody
binding. All HER2 antibodies showed higher maximal MFI values (137,904 - 38,801)
compared to trastuzumab (35,000) and pertuzumab (TH1014-pert) (32,366), indicating
that the tested HER2 antibodies induced enhanced receptor internalization. Notably,
antibodies that did not compete with trastuzumab or TH1014-pert induced more receptor
internalization compared to antibodies that did compete with trastuzumab and TH1014-pert,
with the highest MFI achieved by antibodies 098 and 127. Without being limited to theory,
this might be inherent to an inability to inhibit HER2 heterodimerization.

An in vitro method for producing bispecific antibodies is described in WO 2008119353
(Genmab) and reported van der Neut-Kolfschoten et al. (Science. 2007 Sep
14;317(5844):1554-7). Herein, a bispecific antibody is formed by "Fab-arm" or "half
molecule" exchange (swapping of a heavy chain and attached light chain) between two
monospecific IgG4- or IgG4-like antibodies upon incubation under mildly reducing
conditions. This Fab-arm exchange reaction is the result of a disulfide-bond isomerization
reaction wherein the inter heavy-chain disulfide bonds in the hinge regions of monospecific
antibodies are reduced and the resulting free cysteines form a new inter heavy-chain
disulfide bond with cysteine residues of another antibody molecule with a different
specificity. The resulting product is a bispecific antibody having two Fab arms with different
sequences.
In a novel invention the knowledge of this natural IgG4 Fab-arm exchange is adapted to
generate a method to produce stable IgG1-based bispecific antibodies. The bispecific
antibody product generated by this method described below will no longer participate in
IgG4 Fab-arm exchange. The basis for this method is the use of complimentary CH3
domains, which promote the formation of heterodimers under specific assay conditions. To
enable the production of bispecific antibodies by this method, IgG1 molecules carrying
certain mutations in the CH3 domain were generated: in one of the parental IgG1 antibody
T350I, K370T and F405L mutations in the other parental IgG1 antibody the K409R
mutation.
To generate bispecific antibodies, these two parental antibodies, each antibody at a final
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL (equimolar concentration), were incubated with 25 mM 2
mercaptoethylamine-HCI (2-MEA) in a total volume of 100 pL TE at 37*C for 90 min. The
reduction reaction is stopped when the reducing agent 2-MEA is removed by using spin
columns (Microcon      centrifugal filters, 30k, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
Example 21 - HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies tested in an in vitro kappa
directed ETA' killing assay
        The example shows that HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies can deliver a cytotoxic
agent into tumor cells after internalization in a generic in vitro cell-based killing assay using
kappa-directed pseudomonas-exotoxin A (anti-kappa-ETA'). This assay makes use of a high
affinity anti-kappa domain antibody conjugated to a truncated form of the pseudomonas
exotoxin A. Similar fusion proteins of antibody binding proteins (IgG-binding motif from
Streptococcal protein A or protein G) and diphtheria toxin or Pseudomonas exotoxin A have
previously been (Mazor Y. et al., 3. Immunol. Methods 2007; 321:41-59); Kuo SR. et al.,
2009 Bioconjugate Chem. 2009; 20:1975-1982). These molecules in contrast to anti-kappa
                                                 91

ETA' bound the Fc part of complete antibodies. Upon internalization and endocytic sorting
the anti-kappa-ETA' domain antibody undergoes proteolysis and disulfide-bond reduction,
separating the catalytic from the binding domain. The catalytic domain is then transported
from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum via a KDEL retention motif, and subsequently
translocated to the cytosol where it inhibits protein synthesis and induces apoptosis
(Kreitman RJ. et. al., BioDrugs 2009; 23:1-13).
        The anti-HER2 antibodies used in this example are 025, 153 and 169. In addition a
fully human monoclonal IgG1,K antibody 005 of the following sequence was used:

The following bispecific antibodies were generated in analogy with the below procedure:
                                              92

IgGl-153-ITL x IgG1-005-K409R
IgGl-153-ITL x IgG1-169-K409R
The bispecific antibodies were produced according to the procedure described in example
20.
The antibody mixtures, containing each antibody at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, was
incubated with 25 mM 2-mercaptoethylamine HCI (2-MEA) in a total volume of 100 pL TE at
37*C for 90 min. To stop the reduction reaction, the reducing agent 2-MEA was removed by
desalting the samples using spin columns (Microcon centrifugal filters, 30k, Millipore)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
        The HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies were pre-incubated with the anti-kappa-ETA'
before incubation with A431 cells. A431 cells express -15,000 HER2 antibodies per cell
(determined via Qifi analysis) and are not sensitive to treatment with 'naked'         HER2
antibodies.
        First, the optimal concentration of anti-kappa-ETA' was determined for each cell line,
i.e. the maximally tolerated dose that does not lead to induction of non-specific cell death.
A431 cells (2500 cells/well) were seeded in normal cell culture medium in a 96-wells tissue
culture plate (Greiner bio-one) and allowed to adhere for at least 4 hours. These cells were
incubated with an anti-kappa-ETA' dilution series, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0 pg/mL
in normal cell culture medium. After 3 days, the amount of viable cells was quantified with
Alamarblue (BioSource International, San Francisco, US) according to the manufacturer's
instruction.    Fluorescence was monitored      using the EnVision   2101   Multilabel reader
(PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) with standard Alamarblue settings. The highest concentration
anti-kappa-ETA' that did not kill the cells by itself (1 pg/mL for A431 cells) was used for
following experiments.
        Next, the effect of HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies and         HER2 monospecific
antibodies pre-incubated with anti-kappa-ETA' was tested for their ability to induce cell kill.
A431 cells were seeded as described above. A dilution series of the HER2 specific antibodies
(monospecific and bispecific antibodies) was made and pre-incubated for 30 min with the
predetermined concentration of anti-kappa-ETA' before adding them to the cells. After 3
days incubation at 37'C, the amount of viable cells was quantified as described above. The
Alamarblue signal of cells treated with anti-kappa-ETA' pre-incubated with the antibodies
was plotted compared to cells treated without antibody treatment. ECs 0 values and maximal
                                               93

cell death were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Staurosporin (23.4 pg/mL) was
used as positive control for cell killing. An isotype control antibody (IgG1/kappa; IgGl-3G8
QITL) was used as negative control.
        Figure 9 and table 9 shows that all anti-kappa-ETA' pre-incubated HER2 bispecific
antibodies were able to kill A431 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results
demonstrate that most HER2 bispecific antibodies tested were more effective than the
monospecific antibody present in the combination in this anti-kappa-ETA' assay. In addition,
the efficacy of bispecific antibody 005X169, 025X169 and 153X169 showed that the efficacy
of a monospecific antibody which lacks activity in this in vitro kappa-directed ETA' killing,
HER2 specific antibody (169), can be increased through bispecific combination with another
HER2 specific antibody.

Example       22 - HER2 receptor downmodulation                 by incubation with bispecific
antibodies targeting different HER2 epitopes
        HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies may bind two different epitopes on two spatially
different HER2 receptors. This may allow other HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies to bind to
the remaining epitopes on these receptors. This could result in multivalent receptor cross
linking (compared to dimerization induced by monovalent antibodies) and consequently
enhance     receptor   downmodulation.     To   investigate   whether  HER2  x HER2   bispecific
antibodies induce enhanced downmodulation of HER2, AU565 cells were incubated with
antibodies and bispecific antibodies for three days. Total levels of HER2 and levels of
antibody bound HER2 were determined.
                                                  94

        AU565 cells were seeded in a 24-well tissue culture plate (100.000 cells / well) in
normal cell culture medium and cultured for three days at 37'C in the presence of 10 pg/mL
HER2 antibody with either the ITL or the K409R mutation or HER2 x HER2 bispecific
antibodies. As a control, the combination of two monospecific HER2 antibodies, with
unmodified IgG1 backbones, was also tested (1:1), at a final concentration of 10 pg/mL.
After washing with PBS, cells were lysed by incubating them for 30 min at room
temperature with 25 pL Surefire Lysis buffer (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland). Total protein
levels were quantified using bicinchoninic acid (BCA)           protein assay reagent (Pierce)
following manufacturer's protocol. HER2 protein levels in the lysates were analyzed using a
HER2-specific sandwich ELISA. Rabbit-anti-human HER2 intracellular domain antibody (Cell
Signaling) was used to capture HER2 and biotinylated goat-anti-human HER2 polyclonal
antibody R&D systems, Minneapolis, USA), followed by streptavidin-poly-HRP, were used to
detect bound HER2. The reaction was visualized using 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline
6-sulfonic acid (one ABTS tablet diluted in 50 mL ABTS buffer [Roche Diagnostics, Almere,
The    Netherlands])   and   stopped    with  oxalic acid    (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,  The
Netherlands). Fluorescence at 405 nm was measured on a microtiter plate reader (Biotek
Instruments, Winooski, USA) and the amount of HER2 was expressed as a percentage
relative to untreated cells.
        The results are shown in Figure 10 and Table 10 which demonstrates that all the
tested    HER2   x   HER2    bispecific antibodies    induced   >40%    HER2  downmodulation.
Interestingly,  all  HER2    x   HER2   bispecific  antibodies  demonstrated   increased  HER2
downmodulation compared to both of their monospecific counterparts.

Example 23 - Colocalization of HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies with lysosomal
marker LAMP1 analyzed by confocal microscopy
        The HER2 downmodulation assay as described in Example 22 indicated that HER2 x
HER2 bispecific antibodies were able to increase lysosomal degradation of HER2. To confirm
these findings, confocal microscopy technology was applied. AU565 cells were grown on
glass coverslips (thickness 1.5 micron, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany) in
standard tissue culture medium at 37'C for 3 days. Cells were pre-incubated for 1 hour with
50 pg/mL leupeptin (Sigma)      to block lysosomal activity after which 10 pg/mL HER2
monospecific antibodies or HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies were added. Also the
combination of two monospecific IgG1 antibodies (1:1) was tested at a final concentration
of 10 pg/mL. The cells were incubated for an additional 3 or 18 hours at 37'C. Hereafter the
cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min. at room temperature with 4%
formaldehyde (Klinipath). Slides were washed with blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with
0.1% saponin [Roche] and 2% BSA [Roche]) and incubated for 20 min with blocking buffer
containing 20 mM NH4 CI to quench formaldehyde. Slides were washed again with blocking
buffer and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with mouse-anti-human CD107a
(LAMP1)   (BD   Pharmingen) to stain/identify lysosomes. Following washing with blocking
buffer, the slides were incubated 30 min at room temperature with a cocktail of secondary
antibodies; goat-anti-mouse IgG-Cy5 (Jackson) and goat-anti-human IgG-FITC (Jackson).
Slides were washed again with blocking buffer and mounted overnight on microscope slides
using 20 pL mounting medium (6 gram Glycerol [Sigma] and 2.4 gram Mowiol 4-88
[Omnilabo] was dissolved in 6 mL distilled water to which 12 mL 0.2M Tris [Sigma] pH8.5
                                             96

was added followed by incubation for 10 min at 50-60'C. Mounting medium was aliquoted
and stored at -20'C.). Slides were imaged with a Leica SPE-II confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems) equipped with a 63x 1.32-0.6 oil immersion objective lens and LAS-AF
software. To allow for quantification of overlapping pixel intensities, saturation of pixels
should be avoided. Therefore the FITC laser intensity was decreased to 10%, smart gain
was set at 830 V and smart offset was set at -9.48 %. By using these settings, the
bispecific antibodies were clearly visualized without pixel saturation, but the monospecific
antibodies were sometimes difficult to detect. To compare lysosomal colocalization between
monospecific and bispecific antibodies, these settings were kept the same for all analyzed
confocal slides.
        12-bit grayscale TIFF images were analyzed for colocalisation using MetaMorph*
software (version Meta Series 6.1, Molecular Devices Inc, Sunnyvale California, USA). FITC
and Cy5 images were imported as stacks and background was subtracted. Identical
thresholds settings were used (manually set) for all FITC images and all Cy5 images.
Colocalisation was depicted as the pixel intensity of FITC in the region of overlap (ROI),
were the ROI is composed of all Cy5 positive regions. To compare different slides stained
with several HER2 antibodies, HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies or the combination of two
different monospecific antibodies the images were normalized using the pixel intensity of
Cy5. Goat-anti-mouse IgG-Cy5 was used to stain the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (CD107a).
The pixel intensity of LAMP1 should not differ between various HER2 antibodies or the HER2
x HER2 bispecific antibodies tested (one cell had a pixel intensity of Cy5 of roughly
200.000).
Normalized values for colocalization of FITC and Cy5 =
                 [(TPI-FITC x percentage FITC-Cy5 colocalization)/100] x [200.000/TPI-Cy5]
In this formula, TPI stands for Total Pixel Intensity.
Figure 11 and Table 11 present percentage of viable cells, as measured by the FITC pixel
intensity overlapping with Cy5 for various monospecific HER2 antibodies and HER2 x HER2
bispecific antibodies. For each antibody or bispecific molecule depicted, three different
images were analyzed from one slide containing ~ 1, 3 or >5 cells. Significant variation was
observed between the different images within each slide. However, it was evident that all
HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies demonstrate increased colocalisation with the lysosomal
marker LAMP1, when compared with their monospecific counterparts. These results indicate
that once internalized, HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies are efficiently sorted towards
                                                97

lysosomal compartments, making them suitable for a bispecific antibody drug conjugate
approach.

Example 24 - Inhibition of proliferation of AU565 cells upon incubation with HER2
monospecific or HER2 X HER2 bispecific antibodies
         The HER2 x HER2 bispecific antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit
proliferation of AU565 cells in vitro. Due to the high HER2 expression levels on AU565 cells
(-1.000.000     copies per cell as determined with Qifi-kit), HER2 is constitutively active in
these cells and thus not dependent on ligand-induced heterodimerization. In a 96-wells
tissue culture plate (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), 9.000 AU565 cells were
seeded per well in the presence of 10 pg/mL HER2 antibody or HER2 x HER2 bispecific
antibodies in serum-free cell culture medium. As a control, cells were seeded in serum-free
medium without antibody or bispecific antibodies. After three days, the amount of viable
cells was quantified with Alamarblue (BioSource International, San Francisco, US) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was monitored using the EnVision 2101
Multilabel reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) with standard Alamarblue settings. The
Alamarblue signal of antibody-treated cells was plotted as a percentage relative to
untreated cells.
         Figure 12 and table 12 depicts the fluorescent intensity of Alamarblue of AU565 cells
after incubation with HER2 antibodies and HER2XHER2 bispecific antibodies. Herceptin@
(trastuzumab) was included as positive control and demonstrated inhibition of proliferation
as described by Juntilla TT. et al., Cancer Cell 2009; 15: 429-440. All HER2 x HER2
bispecific antibodies were able to inhibit proliferation of AU565 cells. Bispecific antibodies:
IgGl-005-ITL x IgGl-169-K409R and IgGl-025-ITL x IgGl-005-K409R were more effective
compared to their monospecific antibody counterparts in this assay.

Example 25 - Her2 x CD3 bispecific antibodies tested in an in vitro cytotoxicity
assay
        CD3 is a co-receptor in the T cell receptor complex expressed on mature T cells.
Combination of a CD3 specific antibody Fab-arm with a tumor antigen specific antibody Fab
arm in a bispecific antibody would result in the specific targeting of T cells to tumor cells,
leading to T cell mediated tumor cell lysis. Likewise, CD3 positive T cells could be targeted
to other derailed cells in the body, to infected cells or directly to pathogens.
        HER2 x CD3 bispecific antibodies were generated. Heavy and light chain variable
region sequences for the HER2 specific Fab-arm were as indicated for antibody 153 and 169
in Example 21. The following heavy and light chain variable region sequences for the CD3
specific Fab-arm were used:

        Bispecific antibodies from these HER2 and CD3 specific antibodies were generated as
described in Example 20 and tested in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using AU565 cells.
AU565 cells were cultured to near confluency. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and
trypsinized for 5 minutes at 370C. 12 mL culture medium was added to inactivate trypsin
and cells were spun down for 5 min, 800 rpm. Cells were resuspended in 10 mL culture
medium and a single cell suspension was made by passing the cells through a cellstrainer.
100 pL of a 5x109 cells/mL suspension was added to each well of a 96-well culture plate,
and cells were incubated at least 3 hrs at 370C, 5% C02 to allow adherence to the plate.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood from healthy
volunteers using Leucosep 30 mL tubes, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Greiner
Bio-one). T cells were isolated from PBMC preparations by negative selection using the
Untouched Human T-cells Dynabead kit (Dynal). Isolated cells were resuspended in culture
medium to a final concentration op 7x10 6 cells/mL.
        Culture medium was removed from the adhered AU565 cells, and replaced with 50
pl/well 2x concentrated antibody-dilution and 50 pl/well 7x10 6 T cells/mL (ratio
effector:target = 7:1). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 0 C, 5% C0 2. Supernatants
were removed and plates were washed twice with PBS. To each well 150 pL culture medium
and 15 pL Alamar blue was added. Plates were incubate for 4 hours at 37 0 C, 5% C0 2 , and
absorbance was measured (Envision, Perkin Elmer).
        Figure 13 and table 13 shows that whereas control antibodies (Her2 monospecific
IgG1-Herceptin*, CD3 monospecific IgG1-YTH12.5 and monospecific IgG1-huCLB-T3/4,
irrelevant antigen monospecific IgG1-b12, and CD3 x b12 bispecific antibodies) did not
induce T cell mediated cytotoxicity, bispecific (Duo) Her2 x CD3 antibodies huCLB/Her2

T cell mediated cytotoxicity of AU565 cells. Bispecific antibodies containing Her2-169 were
more potent than those containing Her2-153.
Mutants of IgG1-hu-CLB-T3/4, IgG1-YTH12.5 and Her2-153 were made containing a N297Q
mutation to remove a glycosylation site; glycosylation at this site is critical for IgG
Fcgamma receptor interactions (Bolt S et al., Eur IImmunol 1993, 23:403-411). Figure 13
shows that N297Q mutation and therefore absence of Fc glycosylation of Her2 x CD3
bispecific antibodies YTH12.5/Her2-153 and huCLB/Her2-153 did not impact the potential to
induce dose dependent T cell mediated cytotoxicity of AU565 cells.

Example 26 - HER2 downmodulation
To investigate if enhanced HER2 internalization induced by Group 3 antibodies 098 and 153
also results in enhanced receptor downmodulation, AU565 cells were incubated with HER2
antibodies for 3 days, and analyzed for presence of HER2. AU565 cells were seeded in a 24
wells tissue culture plate (100.000 cells/well) in normal cell culture medium and cultured for
3 days at 37'C in the presence of 10 pg/mL HER2 antibody. After washing with PBS, cells
were lysed by incubating 30 min at room temperature with 25 pL Surefire Lysis buffer
(Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland). Total protein levels were quantified using bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HER2 protein
levels in the lysates were analyzed using a HER2-specific sandwich ELISA. Rabbit-anti
human HER2 intracellular domain antibody (Cell Signaling) was used to capture HER2 and
biotinylated goat-anti-human HER2 polyclonal antibody (R&D),          followed by streptavidin
poly-HRP, were used to detect bound HER2. The reaction was visualized using 2,2'-azino-bis
3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS: dilute one ABTS tablet in 50 mL ABTS buffer
[Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands]) and stopped with oxalic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Fluorescence at 405 nm was measured on a microtiter plate
reader (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, USA) and the amount of HER2 was expressed as a
percentage relative to untreated cells.
                                              101

The results shown in Figure 14 and Table 14 demonstrate that both Group 3 antibodies (098
and 153) induced more than 50% HER2 downmodulation. In contrast, antibodies 025, 169
and Herceptin barely induced downmodulation (approximately 20% of untreated cells). This
was in line with enhanced internalization observed by antibodies 098 and 153.

Example 27 - Colocalization of HER2 antibodies with lysosomal marker LAMP1
analyzed by confocal microscopy.
The HER2 downmodulation assay as described in example 26 and the CypHer-5E based
internalization assay as described in example 19 indicated that HER2 antibodies from group
3 were more efficiently internalized and targeted towards lysosomes compared to antibodies
from Groups 1 and 2. However, in these experiments the confocal imaging was done with
settings that allowed discriminating between monospecific and bispecific antibodies but not
between different monospecific antibodies, in fact, with these settings monospecific
antibodies could harldy be detected. To be able to compare between the different
monospecific antibodies, the confocal slides were measured again with increased gain
settings, to enhance fluorescence intensity. All other steps of the procedure were the same
as described in example 23.
The results are depited in Figure 15 and Table 15, and show that the FITC pixel intensity
overlapping with Cy5 for various monospecific HER2 antibodies. From each slide three
different images were analyzed containing     -  1, 3 or >5 cells. Significant variation was
observed between the different images within each slide. Still, it was evident that antibodies
098 and 153 were more efficiently targeted towards lysosomal compartments, compared to
025, pertuzumab, 169 and Herceptin. This correlated well with the enhanced internalization
and receptor degradation induced by these antibodies.

Example 28 - HER2 extracellular domain shuffle human-to-chicken
To further define the HER2 binding regions recognized by antibodies from the four different
cross-competition groups, a HER2 extracellular domain shuffle experiment was performed.
To this end, a small gene-synthesis library with five constructs was generated, swapping the
sequences of domain I, II, III or IV of the extracellular domain of human HER2 to the
corresponding sequence of chicken HER2 (Gallus gallus isoform B NCBI: NP_001038126.1):
1) fully human HER2 (Uniprot P04626) hereafter named hu-HER2, 2) hu-HER2 with chicken
domain I (replacing amino acids (aa) 1-203 of the human Her2 with the corresponding
chicken Her2 region) hereafter named hu-HER2-ch(I), 3) hu-HER2 with chicken domain II
(replacing amino acids (aa) 204-330 of the human Her2 with the corresponding chicken
Her2 region) hereafter named hu-HER2-ch(II),          4) hu-HER2 with chicken domain III
(replacing aa 331-507 of the human Her2 with the corresponding chicken Her2 region)
hereafter named hu-HER2-ch(III) and 5) hu-HER2 with chicken domain IV (replacing aa
508-651 of the human Her2 with the corresponding chicken Her2 region) hereafter named
hu-HER2-ch(IV). The human and chicken HER2 orthologs show 67% homology in their
extracellular domain with 62% homology in domain I, 72% homology in domain II,           63%
homology in domain III and 68% homology in domain IV. The constructs were transiently
transfected in the FreestyleTM CHO-S (Invitrogen) cell line using Freestyle MAX transfection
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and transfected cells
were cultured for 20 hours. HER2 antibody binding to the transfected cells was analyzed by
means of flow cytometry: The transfected CHO-S cells were harvested, washed with FACS
buffer and incubated with 10 pg/mL HER2 antibody (30 minutes on ice). Binding of HER2
antibodies was detected using a Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG
antibody (Jackson). To check if expression between different batches was the same, cells
were    fixed   and   permeabilized   using   Cytofix/Cytoperm     solution  (BD)  according
manufacturer's instruction and stained with a rabbit-anti-human intracellular HER2 antibody
(DAKO) in combination with a secondary PE-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson).
An isotype control antibody was used as negative control. Fluorescence was measured on a
FACSCanto-II (BD)     and binding curves were made by means of non-linear regression
(sigmoidal dose-response with variable slope) using GraphPad Prism V4.03 software
                                             103

(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Loss of binding was used as read out to identify
which HER2 domains were recognized by the different antibodies.
        Exemplary binding curves for antibody 153 are shown in figure 16. All binding results
are shown in Table 16. Group 1 HER2 antibodies 050, 084, 169 and Herceptin showed loss
of binding to Hu-HER2-ch(IV), but not to the proteins with one of the remaining domains
shuffled, demonstrating that the epitopes of Group 1 mAbs reside in HER2 domain IV.
Group 2 antibodies 025, 091, 129 and pertuzumab showed only loss of binding to Hu-HER2
ch(II), indicating that the epitope resides in HER2 domain II. Antibodies 098 and 153 were
both defined to Group 3 in the cross-competition assay but showed some variation in the
shuffle experiment. Antibody 098 clearly showed loss of binding to Hu-HER2-ch(I) and a
minor decrease in binding to Hu-HER2-ch(II), while 153 showed only loss of binding to Hu
HER2-ch(II). These data suggest that Group 3 mAbs 098 and 153 can also bind, at least
partially, to the HER2 domain II, with epitopes that possibly extend into HER2 domain I, as
is the case for 098.

mice was determined. 10x10 6 NCI-N87 tumor cells in 50% matrigel were injected s.c. in
female SCID mice, 10 mice per group. Eight days after tumor inoculation, intravenous
treatment with HER2-HuMabs 091, 084, and 169 or control antibody HuMab-HepC was
started. In figure 17 (A) this is indicated as day 1, day of treatment initiation. The first dose
was at 40 mg/kg, followed by 10 mg/kg on days 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 after
treatment initiation.
Tumor volume was determined at least 2 times per week. Volumes (mm 3 ) were calculated
                                                2
from caliper (PLEXX) measurements as width        x length)/2.
The results are depicted in Figure 17A and 17B which shows that the mice administered
with HuMab 084, 169 and 091 demonstrated slower tumor growth (A) and better survival
(B) than the mice that received negative control antibody HuMab-HepC. All treatments were
well-tolerated.
Example 30 - Therapeutic treatment of BT-474 breast tumor xenografts in Balb/C
nude mice
The effect of therapeutic treatment of five different HER2 HuMabs on human subcutaneous
BT-474 breast tumor xenografts in Balb/C nude mice was determined. BT-474 tumor cells
were injected 24 to 72 hours after a whole body irradiation with a y-source (1.8 Gy, Co60,
BioMep, France). 2x10 7 BT-474 cells in 200 pl of RPMI 1640 containing matrigel (50:50,
v:v; BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of female Balb/C
nude mice. Body weight and tumor volume of the mice was recorded twice a week. Tumor
volumes (mm 3) were       calculated from caliper (PLEXX)       measurements      as: (width 2 X
length)/2.
Treatment with HER2 HuMabs was started when the tumors reached a mean volume of 100
200 mm 3 . Tumor bearing mice were randomized into groups of 8 mice. One group received
twice weekly intravenous (i.v.) injections of the control mAb HuMab-HepC. Four other
groups received twice weekly i.v. injections of HER2 HuMab 025, 129, 153 and 091, with a
first dose of 20 mg/kg and following 9 doses of 5 mg/kg.
The results are depicted in Figure 18A and 18B and show that BT-474 tumor growth was
partially inhibited with HuMab 129 and HuMab 153 treatment (about 30 and 50% of
inhibition compared to HuMab-HepC control treatment).             HuMab-025 and HuMab-091
strongly inhibited the BT-474 tumor growth and the time to reach a tumor volume of 800
     3
mm was significantly delayed by these antibodies. Survival was also improved in the HER2
HuMAb receiving mice.
