           SIM CARD BODY WITH INTEGRATED SIM AND SIM EJECT TOOL
Field
[0001] The present invention relates to a SIM card body having an integrated SIM card
and SIM eject tool.
Background
[0002] SIM (Subscriber identity Module) cards are used in a range of mobile computing
devices such as mobile telephones and tablets. Telecommunication service providers
typically provide SIM cards to users by incorporating the SIM card in a pushout portion
of a plastic SIM card body, which is typically the size of a business card. A user presses
the SIM card out of the SIM card body and then inserts it into a SIM tray in their device.
[0003] SIM eject tools are used to open the SIM tray, allowing the user to insert or
remove a SIM card from the SIM tray.            SIM cards are commercially supplied by
telecommunication providers separately from the mobile computing devices. SIM eject
tools are typically provided with the mobile computing devices. SIM eject tools may also
be adhered to the surface of a SIM card body.
[0004] Conventional methods of supplying SIM eject tools suffer several drawbacks. For
example, the SIM eject tool can be easily misplaced. This is inconvenient, especially for
international travellers, who often swap SIM cards when travelling in different countries.
Additionally, when provided separately to the SIM card, the SIM eject tool requires
separate packaging, increasing the cost of supply. Adhering the SIM eject tool to the
surface of the SIM card body also requires additional handling of both the SIM card body
and the SIM eject tool before they are provided to a user.
[0005] In this context, there is a need for improved ways of providing SIM eject tools.
Summary
[0006] According to the present invention, there is provided a SIM card body having:
        a SIM card removably provided in the SIM card body; and
        a SIM eject tool which comprises a pin portion adapted to open a SIM tray and
        which is integrally or removably provided in the SIM card body.

                                            2
[0007] The SIM card body may comprise a first region and a second region. The SIM
card may be removably provided in the first region, and the SIM eject tool may be
integrally or removably provided in the second region.
[0008] The SIM card and the SIM eject tool may be removably provided in the SIM card
body in push out portions.
[0009] Alternatively, at least one section of the SIM card body may be adapted to be
removed to define the pin portion of the SIM eject tool.
[0010] The SIM card may be a full sized SIM card, a micro-SIM card or a nano-SIM
card.
Brief Description of Drawings
[0011] Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
       Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a conventional SIM card body incorporating a
SIM card;
       Figure 2 is a diagram of a conventional SIM eject tool;
       Figure 3 is a diagram of a SIM card body according to one embodiment of the
present invention; and
       Figure 4 is a diagram of a SIM card body according to a further embodiment of
the present invention.
Description of Embodiments
[0012] Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 depicts a conventional SIM card body 10
which comprises an integrally formed SIM card 12. Apertures 14 are cut into the SIM
card body 10 around the periphery of the SIM card 12, such that the SIM card 12 forms
a push out portion 16 which is connected to the SIM card body 10 by bridging portions
18. The bridging portions 18 are breakable, allowing the SIM card 12 to be pushed out
of the SIM card body 10 by finger pressing. The SIM card 12 can then be inserted into
the SIM tray of a device, such as a mobile telephone (not shown), by a user.

                                             3
[0013] Figure 2 depicts a conventional SIM eject tool 20 which comprises a body 22 and
a pin portion 24. The body 22 is adapted to be held by a user, and the pin portion 24 is
adapted to open the SIM tray of a device, such as a mobile telephone (not shown).
[0014] Figure 3 depicts a SIM card body 26 according to one embodiment of the present
invention. In this embodiment, the SIM card 28 forms a push out portion 32 in the same
manner as in the conventional SIM card body depicted in Figure 1.
[0015] The SIM card 28 may be one or more conventional SIM cards, for example full
sized SIM cards, micro-SIM cards or nano-SIM cards.
[0016] The SIM card body 26 also comprises a SIM eject tool 36 which comprises a
body 38 and a pin portion 40. The body 38 is adapted to be held by a user, and the pin
portion 40 is adapted to open the SIM tray of a mobile computing device, for example a
mobile telephone (not shown).
[0017] The SIM eject tool 36 may be provided in the SIM card body 26 by any means
that allows the pin portion 40 of the SIM eject tool 36 to be used to open the SIM tray
(not shown) of a mobile computing device.
[0018] For example, in the embodiment of the invention depicted in Figure 3, the SIM
eject tool 36 may be pushed out from the SIM card body 26 in the same manner as the
SIM card 28. In an alternative embodiment depicted in Figure 4, sections of the SIM
card body 26 may be removable by breaking the SIM card body 26 along lines 42 to
define the pin portion 40.
[0019] The SIM card body 26, the SIM card 28 and the SIM eject tool 36 may be
comprised of plastic, metal or a combination thereof.
[0020] Embodiments of the present invention provide a SIM card body that which
incorporates both a SIM card and a SIM eject tool. Advantageously, embodiments of
the present invention remove the need for a SIM card and a SIM eject tool to be
packaged and provided separately, or for the SIM eject tool to be manufactured
separately and then adhered to the SIM card body. Additionally, embodiments of the
present invention also reduce the potential for the SIM eject tool to be misplaced.
[0021] For the purpose of this specification, the word "comprising" means "including but
not limited to," and the word "comprises" has a corresponding meaning.
