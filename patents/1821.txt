Background of the Invention
A number of parasites can infest or infect domestic animals especially also companion
animals such as cats and dogs. These pests and parasites are of great nuisance to both the
animals and their owners.
Isoxazoline compounds are known in the art and these compounds and their use as
antiparasitic are described, for example, in US patent application US 2007/0066617, and
International Patent applications WO 2005/085216, WO 2007/079162, WO 2009/002809,

This class of compounds is known to possess excellent activity against ectoparasites, i.e.
parasitic insect and acarids, such as ticks and fleas and endoparasites such as nematodes.
Examples of isoxazoline compounds are carbamoyl benzamide phenyl isoxazoline (CBPI)
compounds.      A specific example of a CBPI compound is 4-[5-(3,5-Dichlorophenyl)-5
trifluoromethyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl]-2-methyl-N-[(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethylcarbamoyl)-methyl]

The CBPI compound fluralaner is disclosed in patent application WO 2005/085216.
As these isoxazoline compounds have been originally investigated for their use in the
agricultural area it is necessary to identify specific formulations that allow their veterinary
use, i.e. safe administration to control parasites in animals effectively.
One known and convenient way of administering an ectoparasiticide compound to an animal
is oral administration, e.g. as solid oral formulation such as tablets or soft chews that have a
high bioavailability to allow the control of parasites with a low dosage of the ectoparasiticide
compound orally administered to the animal.

Detailed Description of the Invention
The present invention relates to the formulation of a solid oral dosage form (sometimes
referred to as solid pharmaceutical composition or formulation) containing an isoxazoline
compound of Formula (1) (as described below), that provides significantly improved
bioavailability of such isoxazoline compound after administration to an animal.
Specifically, in this formulation the isoxazoline compound of Formula (1) is dissolved in a
solvent. This drug solution is then adsorbed onto a solid carrier which is incorporated into a
traditional solid oral dosage form. Utilizing pre-dissolved isoxazoline compounds of Formula
(1) in the formulation significantly improves the bioavailability of the active drug substance
compared to traditional solid oral dosage forms containing the active drug substance
incorporated as a solid.
As indicated in the example the inventors discovered, that with dimethylacetamide (DMAC)
as solvent for isoxazoline compounds in a solid oral dosage form similar pharmacokinetic
profiles were obtained when it was s dosed at a lower dose compared to dosage forms with
the active incorporated in higher dosage as a solid.
When 2-pyrrolidone (2-pyrol) was utilized as the solvent in the formulation, significantly
higher plasma levels were observed compared to the control, even with the formulation
comprising an isoxazoline compound dosed at a lower dose.
This formulation approach provides unexpectedly significant improvement in bioavailability,
enabling a significantly lower dosage required to achieve similar or superior pharmakokinetic
profiles. Hence, similar blood levels can be achieved that lead to similar effectiveness to
control parasites but with a reduced dosage of the isoxazoline compound.
The solid oral dosage form according to the invention comprises an isoxazoline compound of
the Formula (1)

processes described e.g. in Patent Applications US 2007/0066617, WO 2007/079162, WO
2009/002809, WO 2009/080250, WO 2010/070068, WO 2010/079077, 2011/075591 and
WO 2011/124998 or any other process coming within the competence of a person skilled in
the art who is an expert in chemical synthesis. For the chemical preparation of the products
of the invention, a person skilled in the art is regarded as having at his disposal, inter alia, the
entire contents of "Chemical Abstracts" and of the documents which are cited therein.
The formulations according to the invention are effective for long durations of time in the
treatment of ectoparasites of mammals and, in particular, of fleas and ticks in small
mammals such as dogs and cats.
The amount of the isoxazoline compound of Formula (1) in the formulation may be in the
range of 1-15% w/w. In an alternative embodiment the amount of such compound may be in
the range of 2.0-7.5% w/w. The preferred range is 3.0-4.5% w/w.
In one embodiment, the composition comprises a solid carrier, e.g. microcrystalline cellulose,
colloidal silicone dioxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or other solid carrier excipient with appropriate
characteristic behaviours.
In one embodiment the solid carrier is microcrystalline cellulose (10.0-50.0% w/w, preferred
15.0-25.0%w/w).
In the formulation according to the invention one preferred solvent is a pyrrolidone solvent,
especially 2-pyrrolidone. Alternatively other pyrrolidone solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone
can be used.
Another preferred solvent is dimethyl acetamide (DMAC). The preferred range of dimethyl
acetamide (DMAC) is 2.0-35.0%w/w. Alternative solvents for use in the current invention

the range of 2.5-30.0%w/w. The preferred range is 7.0-12.0%w/w. The preferred range of
other dimethyl acetamide is 2.0-35.0%w/w.
In one embodiment, the solid oral dosage form is a soft chew. In another embodiment, the
solid oral dosage form is a conventional (hard) tablet. Such tablet can include a coating or
can include excipients for extended release that are known in the art. In yet another
embodiment, granules for oral administration or capsules are employed.
"Soft chew" or "Soft chewable veterinary pharmaceutical product" is intended to mean a
product which is solid at room temperature and that is soft to chew and which is functionally
chewy because the product has some plastic texture during the process of mastication in the
mouth. Such soft chews have a softness that is similar to a cooked ground meat patty.
In soft chew formulations the forming agent is important for the texture of the soft chew and
the possibility to form single soft chews from the dough that stay intact and separate.
Forming agents are agents providing texture to the soft chew product, like for example

                                               16
polyethylene glycol (PEG), microcrystalline wax, cetyl alcohol or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
In an embodiment, the forming agent is polyethylene glycol (PEG). Moreover, depending
upon the desired consistency of the soft chew, different molecular weight PEG may be
utilized. In an embodiment, PEG 8000 is utilized. However, the PEG chosen is a matter of
choice and the molecular weight may be higher or lower than 8000, but preferably higher
than 600. Alternatively PEG 3500 might be used.
In an embodiment, the forming agent comprises about 3.0 % to about 35 % w/w of the
pharmaceutical composition. In an alternate embodiment, a forming agent comprises about
4.5 %to about 30 % w/w% of the pharmaceutical composition. In an alternate embodiment, a
forming agent comprises about 10 % to about 20 %w/w of the pharmaceutical composition.
In case the forming agent is polyvinylpyrrolidone e.g. 2, 4, 5, 6 or 9 % w/w are present in the
soft chew.
A preferred formulation for the solid oral pharmaceutical composition includes:
         4.4% w/w compound of Formula (1), especially fluralaner
         10.5% w/w 2-pyrrolidone
         25.0% w/w microcrystalline cellulose
         5.1% w/w sodium starch glycolate
         15.0% w/w flavour
         2.0% w/w sodium lauryl sulphate
         2.5% w/w sodium pamoate
         0.5% w/w aspartame
         0.5% w/w magnesium stearate
         1.5% w/w glycerol
         17.25% w/w soybean oil
         15.75% w/w PEG8000
The amount of glycerol in the formulation may range from 0-12.0% with the preferred range
of 0.5-10.0%. Soybean oil amounts may range from 5.0-25.0% with the preferred range of
10.0-22.0%. Desired ranges of the other excipients include sodium starch glycolate (2.0
15.0%), flavor (5-25%), sodium lauryl sulfate (0.05-5.0%), sodium pamoate (0.01-5.0%),
aspartame (0.01-2.0%), and magnesium stearate (0.01-2.0%).
The formulation according to the current invention conventionally further comprise
physiologically acceptable formulation excipients known in the art e.g. as described in
"Gennaro, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy" (20th Edition, 2000)
incorporated by reference herein. All such ingredients, carriers and excipients must be
substantially pharmaceutically or veterinary pure and non-toxic in the amounts employed and
must be compatible with the pharmaceutically active ingredients.
Additional excipients that can be present in the formulation are e.g. one or more fillers, one
or more flavours, or sugar components, surfactants, stabilizers, flow agents, disintegration
agents, preservatives and/or lubricating agents.
This invention is also directed to formulations as described above with combinations
comprising more than one pharmaceutically active ingredient, e.g. in addition to the
compound of Formula (1)another compound of Formula (1) or a pharmaceutically active
ingredient with a different structure.
Preferred combinations comprising active ingredients selected from the group consisting of
isoxazoline compounds of Formula (1) or (II) and avermectins and milbemycins. In one
embodiment the formulation, especially soft chew comprises a combination of an isoxazoline

                                                  17
compound of Formula (1), especially fluralaner or afoxolaner, with ivermectin. In another
embodiment the soft chew comprises a combination of an isoxazoline compound of Formula
(1) , especially fluralaner por afoxolaner, with milbemycin or with moxidectin.
Other combinations of the present invention can include insect or acarid rrowth regulators
(AGRs or IGRs) such as e.g. fenoxycarb, lufenuron, diflubenzuron, novaluron, triflumuron,
fluazuron, cyromazine, methoprene, pyriproxyfen etc., thereby providing both initial and
sustained control of parasites (at all stages of insect development, including eggs) on the
animal subject, as well as within the environment of the animal subject.
The inventors discovered that oral solid dosage forms of isoxazoline compounds of Formula
(1) as described above, especially of fluralaner, afoxoloaner can be produced that result in a
higher bioavailability of the isoxazoline compound after administration to animals. In such
methods the isoxazoline compound of Formula (1)is first dissolved in a suitable solvent (e.g.
2-pyrol or DMAC) and then adhered to a solid carrier (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose). Such
process can be used in general for various solid oral dosage forms such as hard tablets,
granules, capsules or soft chews (soft chewable tablets).
A general method for preparing a solid oral dosage form, such as a soft chewable tablet
formulation comprises the steps of:
         1. Dissolve the isoxazoline compound (e.g. fluralaner or afoxolaner) in the solvent
         (e.g. 2-pyrrolidone) to form a solution.
         2. Add the isoxazoline solution to the solid carrier (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose) and
         mix to form a first dry mixture.
         3. Add all other dry excipients to the first dry mixture and mix to form a second dry
         mixture.
         4. Add liquid ingredients, glycerol and soybean oil, to the second dry mixture. Mix to
         form wet mass.
         5. Melt a wax (e.g. polyethylene glycol 8000) and add to the wet mass. Mix well to
         form the final bulk mass.
         6. Form appropriately sized chewable tablets
In an embodiment the tablets may be formed from the final bulk mass utilizing a forming
machine. Alternatively, the tablets may be formed by other means known in the art. For
example, the tablets may be formed by hand.
         Methods of using the solid oral pharmaceutical compositions
In one embodiment the product of the invention is intended for use for controlling a parasitic
insect- , acarid and/or helminth, especially parasitic insect and/ or acarid infestation. The
term "controlling a parasitic insect- and/or acarid infestation" refers to preventing, reducing or
eliminating an infestation by such parasites on animals preferably by killing the insects and/
or acarids or nematode parasites within hours or days.
The term "parasitic insect- and acarid" refers to ectoparasites e.g. insect and acarine pests
that commonly infest or infect animals. Examples of such ectoparasites include the egg,
larval, pupal, nymphal and adult stages of lice, fleas, mosquitoes, mites, ticks, and biting or
nuisance fly species. Especially important are fleas and ticks, especially their adult stages.
Examples of invertebrate parasitic pests controlled by administering the solid oral formulation
of this invention to an animal to be protected include ectoparasites (arthropods, acarines,
etc) and        endoparasites      (helminths,    e.g.,  nematodes,      trematodes,      cestodes,
acanthocephalans, etc.).
In particular, the formulations of this invention are effective against ectoparasites including:
flies such as Haematobia (Lyperosia) irritans (horn fly), Stomoxys calcitrans (stable fly),
Simulium spp. (blackfly), Glossina spp. (tsetse flies), Hydrotaea irritans (head fly), Musca

                                                 18
autumnalis (face fly), Musca domestica (house fly), Morellia simplex (sweat fly), Tabanus
spp. (horse fly), Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum, Lucilia sericata, Lucilia cuprina
(green blowfly), Calliphora spp. (blowfly), Protophormia spp., Oestrus ovis (nasal botfly),
Culicoides spp. (midges), Hippobosca equine, Gastrophilus instestinalis, Gastrophilus
haemorrhoidalis and Gastrophilus naslis; lice such as Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis, Bovicola
equi, Haematopinus asini, Felicola subrostratus, Heterodoxus spiniger, Lignonathus setosus
and Trichodectes canis; keds such as Melophagus ovinus; mites such as Psoroptes spp.,
Sarcoptes scabei, Chorioptes bovis, Demodex equi, Cheyletiella spp., Notoedres cati,
Trombicula spp. and Otodectes cyanotis (ear mites); ticks such as Ixodes spp., Boophilus
spp., Rhipicephalus spp., Amblyomma spp., Dermacentor spp., Hyalomma spp. and
Haemaphysalis spp.; and fleas such as Ctenocephalides felis (cat flea) and Ctenocephalides
canis (dog flea).
In general, the formulations according to the invention will contain an effective amount of the
isoxazoline compounds of Formula (1)as defined above, meaning a non-toxic but sufficient
amount to provide the desired control effect. A person skilled in the art using routine
experimentation may determine an appropriate "effective" amount in any individual case.
Such an amount will depend on the age, condition, weight and type of the target animal.
The solid oral dosage forms may be formulated to contain an amount of the isoxazoline
compound of Formula (1)that is adjusted to animals in a specific weight range. The animals
may receive a dosage of the solid oral formulation according to the invention every 2, 3, 4, 5
or 6 months or receives a monthly, weekly or daily dosage. The treatment can, for example,
be continuing or seasonal. The time period between treatments depends upon factors such
as the parasite(s) being treated, the degree of infestation, the type of mammal or bird and the
environment where it resides. It is well within the skill level of the practitioner to determine a
specific administration period for a particular situation.
The solid oral formulations of the present invention are especially suitable for combating
parasites that infest mammals (including humans). Mammalian subjects include primates
(e.g., monkeys), bovine (e.g., cattle or dairy cows), porcine (e.g., hogs or pigs), ovine (e.g.,
goats or sheep), equine (e.g., horses), canine (e.g., dogs), feline (e.g., house cats), camels,
deer, donkeys, buffalos, antelopes, rabbits, and rodents (e.g., guinea pigs, squirrels, rats,
mice, gerbils, and hamsters). Of particular note is the embodiment wherein the animals to be
protected are domesticated dogs (i.e. Canis lupus familiaris) and domestic house cats (i.e.
Felis catus).
In some embodiments of this invention, the solid oral formulation of an isoxazoline of
Formula (1)is administered to treat parasitoses of an animal (or make a medicament to treat
parasitoses of an animal). The term "parasitoses" includes pathologic conditions and
diseases associated with or caused by one or more ectoparasites directly, such as, for
example, anemia and flea allergy dermatitis. It also includes pathologic conditions or
diseases associated with caused by one or more vector-transmitted pathogens, such as, for
example, Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis (particularly Canine Ehrlichiosis), and Rocky Mountain
spotted fever from vector ticks.
This invention also relates to treatment methods wherein at least an ancillary goal of
controlling ectoparasites in and/or on an animal is to control an ectoparasitic infestation in an
environment that is occupied (periodically or continuously) by the animal. In some such
embodiments, for example, the animal is a companion animal (e.g., a cat or dog). The
environment may be, for example, a house or other shelter; a room; a pen, a stall, or other
confinement means; bedding; etc.
This invention also is directed to kits that are, for example, suitable for use in performing the
treatment methods described above. In general, such a kit will comprise an oral solid
formulation according to the invention comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a
isoxazoline of Formula (1), and an additional component(s). The additional component(s) may
be, for example, one or more of the following: a diagnostic tool, instructions for administering

                                               19
the composition, an apparatus for administering the composition, a container comprising an
excipient or other active ingredient to be mixed or administered in combination with the
composition, or a memory aid (e.g., a stamp to adhere to a calendar to remind an animal
owner of a time to administer a subsequent dose of the composition).
As used herein, the term "w/w" designates weight/weight, the term "w/v" designates
weight/volume, and the term "mg/kg" designates milligrams per kilogram of body weight. As
used herein, %w/w represents the percentage by weight of an ingredient in the recipe of the
product.
The invention having been fully described, its practice is illustrated by the examples provided
below. The examples do not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined entirely by the
appended claims.

  Dimethylacetamide (DMAC) is a good solvent for the active (A-1443) with a solubility of
 791.5 mg/mL.        However, when utilized in this type of formulation approach, similar
 pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained compared to chewable tablets with the active
 incorporated as a solid (control). Given that the DMAC formulation was dosed at a lower
 dose (15 mg/kg compared to 25 mg/kg for the control), these results are improvements in
 dose adjusted pharmacokinetic measurements (Cmax and AUC) over the control (see Table
 2 and Figure 1).
 When 2-pyrrolidone (2-pyrol) was utilized as the solvent in the formulation (solubility 775.41
 mg/mL), significantly higher plasma levels were observed compared to the control, even with
 the formulation dosed at a lower dose (15 mg/kg compared to 25 mg/kg for the control).
  Dose normalized pharmacokinetic measurements (Cmax and AUC) for the 2-pyrol
 formulation are more than double that of the DMAC formulation and more than triple that of
 the control (see Table 2 and Figure 1). These results were unexpected.
 This formulation approach provides significant improvement in bioavailability, enabling a
 significantly lower dosage required to achieve similar to superior pharmacokinetic profiles.

Pharmacokinetic profile following oral administration of chewable formulations of
isoxazoline compounds
The objective of this study is to compare the blood plasma pharmacokinetic profile of three
different isoxazoline compounds in two different chewable formulations after a single oral
(PO) administration of in dogs.
Test formulations:
The following compounds were formulated according to the invention. Specifically, the
isoxazoline compound was first dissolved in a solvent, i.e. 2-pyrrolidone. This drug solution
was then adsorbed onto the solid carrier, i.e. microcrystalline cellulose, which was
incorporated into a solid oral dosage form as described in the specification with excipients as
described in Table 3. Comparative example formulation ID No. 13-009, 13-011 and 13-013
contain the active drug substance incorporated as a solid that was manufactured as
described in general in the specification without prior pre-dissolving the active ingredient and
adsorption to the solid carrier.

Each animal was administered the tablet or chew by placing it in the back of the oral cavity
over the tongue to initiate swallowing.
Plasma was obtained from the collected blood samples and analyzed for concentrations of
the test compounds. Individual blood samples (approximately 4.5 mL per sample) were taken
via jugular venipuncture into sodium-citrate tubes from all dogs for drug analysis. Blood
samples were collected at the following time points: pretreatment (within 2 h prior to dosing)
and approximately 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after dosing ( 15 min). A final blood sample
was taken from each dog on Day 7 ( 2 h after the time of dosing on Day 0).

Results:
When 2-pyrrolidone (2-pyrol) was utilized as the solvent in the formulation (alternate chew),
similar or even higher plasma levels were observed compared to the control chew, even with
the formulation dosed at a lower dose (10 mg/kg compared to 25 mg/kg for the control)- see
Figure 2.
Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the plasma concentration data with the
computer program Pharsight WinNonlin Enterprise, Version 4.0.1, or more recent update
(Model 200: plasma data, extravascular input).
Dose normalized pharmacokinetic measurements (Cmax and AUC) for the 2-pyrol
formulation (alternate chew) are much higher, in some cases more than double to five times
that of the control formulation (see Table 5).
This formulation approach provides significant improvement in the bioavailability relative to
the control formulation, enabling a significantly lower dosage required to achieve similar to
superior pharmacokinetic profiles. These results were unexpected.
