   COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CD38-EXPRESSING TUMORS
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to the treatment of cancer using a combination therapy
   comprising an antibody that binds CD38, a corticosteroid and a non-corticosteroid
 5 chemotherapeutic agent.
   BACKGROUND
            Multiple myeloma is a B cell malignancy characterized by the latent accumulation
   in bone marrow of secretory plasma cells with a low proliferative index and an extended
   life span. The disease ultimately attacks bones and bone marrow, resulting in multiple
10 tumors and lesions throughout the skeletal system.
           Approximately 1% of all cancers, and slightly more than 10% of all hematologic
   malignancies, can be attributed to multiple myeloma (MM). Incidence of MM increases in
   the aging population, with the median age at time of diagnosis being about 61 years.
            Currently available therapies for multiple myeloma include chemotherapy, stem
15 cell transplantation, Thalomid* (thalidomide), Velcade* (bortezomib), Aredia*
   (pamidronate), and Zometa* (zoledronic acid). Current treatment protocols, which
   include a combination of chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine, BCNU,
   melphalan, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and prednisone or dexamethasone, yield a
   complete remission rate of only about 5%, and median survival is approximately 36-48
20 months from the time of diagnosis. Recent advances using high dose chemotherapy
   followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cell
   transplantation have increased the complete remission rate and remission duration. Yet
   overall survival has only been slightly prolonged, and no evidence for a cure has been
   obtained. Ultimately, all MM patients relapse, even under maintenance therapy with
25 interferon-alpha (IFN-a) alone or in combination with steroids.
            If a patient is candidate or possible candidate for autologous transplant, induction
   therapy often involve non-alkylating chemotherapy, in that alkylating agents interfere
   with harvesting (stem cell collection). The preferred regimen is VAD, which allows for
   subsequent harvest (Wu KL, Clin Lymphoma Myeloma 2005;6:96). Another treatment
30 modality, tested in induction setting before transplant, includes Thalidomide combined
   with dexamethasone (Cavo M Blood 2005;106:35).
                                                      1

            Efficacy of the available chemotherapeutic treatment regimens for MM is limited
   by the low cell proliferation rate and development of multi-drug resistance. For more than
   90% of MM patients, the disease becomes chemoresistant. As a result, alternative
   treatment regimens aimed at adoptive immunotherapy targeting surface antigens on
 5 plasma cells are being sought.
            CD38 is an example of an antigen expressed on such malignant plasma cells,
   and is expressed in a variety of malignant hematological diseases, including but not
   restricted to, multiple myeloma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell acute
   lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstr6m macroglobulinemia, primary systemic amyloidosis,
10 mantle-cell lymphoma, pro-lymphocytic/myelocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia,
   chronic myeloid leukemia, follicular lymphoma, NK-cell leukemia and plasma-cell
   leukemia. Expression of CD38 has been described on epithelial/endothelial cells of
   different origin, including glandular epithelium in prostate, islet cells in pancreas, ductal
   epithelium in glands, including parotid gland, bronchial epithelial cells, cells in testis and
15 ovary and tumor epithelium in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Diseases where CD38
   expression could be involved, include but are not restricted to broncho-epithelial
   carcinomas of the lung, breast cancer (evolving from malignant proliferation of epithelial
   lining in ducts and lobules of the breast), pancreatic tumors, evolving from the b-cells
   (insulinomas), tumors evolving from epithelium in the gut (e.g. adenocarcinoma and
20 squamous cell carcinoma) In CNS, neuroblastomas express CD38. Other such diseases
   include carcinoma in the prostate gland, seminomas in testis and ovarian cancers.
            Normally, CD38 is expressed by hemopoietic cells, and in solid tissues. With
   regard to hemopoietic cells, the majority of medullary thymocytes are CD38*, resting and
   circulating T- and B-cells are CD38-, and activated cells are CD38*. CD38 is also
25 expressed on approximately 80% of resting NK cells and monocytes, and on lymph node
   germinal center lymphoblasts, plasma B cells and some intrafollicular cells. CD38 can
   also be expressed by dendritic cells. A significant proportion of normal bone marrow
   cells, particular precursor cells, express CD38. In addition to lymphoid precursor cells,
   CD38 is also expressed on erythrocytes and on platelets.
30          With regard to solid tissues, CD38 is expressed in the gut by intra-epithelial cells
   and lamina propria lymphocytes, by Purkinje cells and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain,
   by epithelial cells in the prostate, p-cells in the pancreas, osteoclasts in the bone, retinal
   cells in the eye, and sarcolemma of smooth and striated muscle.
                                                        2

            Functions ascribed to CD38 include both receptor mediation in adhesion and
   signaling events and (ecto-) enzymatic activity. As an ectoenzyme, CD38 uses NAD* as
   substrate for the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and ADPR, but also of
   nicotinamide and nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). cADPR and
 5 NAADP have been shown to act as second messengers for Ca 2+ mobilization. By
   converting NAD+ to cADPR, CD38 regulates the extracellular NAD+ concentration and
   hence cell survival by modulation of NAD-induced cell death (NCID). In addition to
   signaling via Ca 2*, CD38 signaling occurs via cross-talk with antigen-receptor complexes
   on T and B cells or other types of receptor complexes, e.g. MHC molecules, and is in
10 this way involved in several cellular responses, but also in switching and secretion of
   IgG1.
            Anti-CD38 antibodies are described in the literature, for instance in Lande R, et
   al., Cell Immunol. 220(1), 30-8 (2002), Ausiello CM, et al., Tissue Antigens. 56(6), 539
   47 (2000), and Cotner T, et al., Int J Immunopharmacol. 3(3), 255-68 (1981) and in
15 W02005/103083 (Morphosys). CD38 has a number of functions, which may or may not
   be activated by a molecule binding to CD38. For instance the mouse anti-CD38 antibody
   IB4 has agonistic properties in relation to CD38. IB4 is shown to induce T cell activation
   as indicated by Ca 2+ mobilization in Jurkat cells (Zubiaur M, et al., J Immunol. 159(1),
   193-205 (1997), to induce significant proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
20 (PBMCs), to induce release of significant IL-6 levels and to induce release of detectable
   IFN-y levels (Lande, Zubiaur Morra, Ansiello supra).
            It is clear that in spite of the recent progress in the discovery and development of
   anti-cancer agents, many forms of cancer involving CD38-expressing tumors still have a
   poor prognosis. Thus, there is a need for improved methods for treating such forms of
25 cancer.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   It is an object of the invention to provide improved methods for the treatment of CD38
   expressing tumors that result in increased efficacy and/or prolonged survival.
30 Thus, in a first main aspect, the invention relates to a method for inhibiting growth and/or
   proliferation of tumor cells expressing CD38 in an individual in need thereof, which
   method comprises administration to the said individual of
            i) a non-agonistic antibody which binds to CD38,
                                                         3

            ii) at least one corticosteroid, and
            iii) at least one non-corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent.
   The three types of medicaments may be administered simultaneously or sequentially in
   any order. Furthermore, they may be administered separately or in one or two
 5 pharmaceutical compositions.
   The triple therapy may, in some embodiments, allow administration of lower amounts of
   a medicament than when used as mono- or in duplex therapy. Such lower amounts may
   generate fewer side-effects, allowing more effective treatment of patients that cannot be
10 treated with high doses, such as elderly or hypersensitive patients.
   In one embodiment, the non-agonistic antibody which binds to CD38 used in the
   invention is antibody -005, -003 or -024, described herein. These antibodies have
   previously been described in patent application PCT/DK2006/000166 (WO 2006099875)
15 (Genmab).
   In some embodiments, said at least one non-corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent
   comprises
            - an alkylating agent, such as melphalan,
20          and/or
            - a glutamic acid derivative, such as thalidomide or lenalidomide
            and/or
            - a proteasome inhibitor, such as bortezomib.
25 In a similar aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating cancer involving cells
   expressing CD38 in an individual, wherein said method comprises the features of the
   method described above.
   In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for treating cancer involving tumor
30 cells expressing CD38 in an individual in need thereof, which method comprises
   administration to the said individual of:
            i) a non-agonistic antibody which binds to CD38,
            ii) optionally at least one corticosteroid, and
            iii) optionally at least one non-corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent,
                                                        4

   followed by autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.
           Thus, in this method, the anti-CD38 antibody is used in induction therapy
   preceding autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. Without
   being bound by any specific theory, it is believed that anti-CD38 antibodies are
 5 particularly suitable for such induction therapy, because they do not have many
   undesired side-effects, thus keeping the patient in good condition before the transplant.
   In an even further aspect, the invention relates to a therapeutic combination for inhibiting
   growth and/or proliferation of tumor cells expressing CD38, comprising
10         i) a non-agonistic antibody which binds to CD38,
           ii) at least one corticosteroid, and
           iii) at least one non-corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent,
   wherein the combination is suitable for separate, sequential and/or simultaneous
   administration.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   Definitions
            A "non-agonistic antibody which binds to CD38" or "anti-CD38 antibody" when
10 used herein refer to an antibody which upon binding to CD38 does not induce significant
   proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells when compared to the proliferation
   induced by an isotype control antibody or medium alone (as assayed e.g. as described
   herein below in Example 18). In one embodiment, an anti-CD38 antibody used in the
   invention is not only a non-agonist, but even an antagonist of CD38.
15          The terms "CD38" and "CD38 antigen" are used interchangeably herein, and
   include any variants, isoforms and species homologs of human CD38, which are
   naturally expressed by cells or are expressed on cells transfected with the CD38 gene.
   Synonyms of CD38, as recognized in the art, include ADP ribosyl cyclase 1, cADPr
   hydrolase 1, Cd38-rs1, Cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase 1, 1-19, NIM-R5 antigen.
20          The term "immunoglobulin" refers to a class of structurally related glycoproteins
   consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) low molecular weight
   chains and one pair of heavy (H) chains, all four inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The
   structure of immunoglobulins has been well characterized. See for instance
   Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)).
25 Briefly, each heavy chain typically is comprised of a heavy chain variable region
   (abbreviated herein as    VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant
   region typically is comprised of three domains,   CH1 , CH2 , and CH3 - Each light chain
   typically is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a
   light chain constant region. The light chain constant region typically is comprised of one
30 domain, CL. The    VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of
   hypervariability (or hypervariable regions which can be hypervariable in sequence and/or
   form of structurally defined loops), also termed complementarity determining regions
                                                     11

   (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions
   (FRs).
            Each  VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged
   from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2,
 5 CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 (see also Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901-917 (1987)).
   Typically, the numbering of amino acid residues in this region is performed by the
   method described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th
   Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991) (phrases
   such as variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or according to Kabat herein
10 refer to this numbering system for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable
   domains). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence of a
   peptide may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or
   insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable
   domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after
15 residue 52 of VH CDR2 and inserted residues (for instance residues 82a, 82b, and 82c,
   etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of
   residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of
   the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
            The term "antibody" (Ab) in the context of the present invention refers to an
20 immunoglobulin molecule, a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule, or a derivative of
   either thereof, which has the ability to specifically bind to an antigen under typical
   physiological conditions for significant periods of time such as at least about 30 minutes,
   at least about 45 minutes, at least about one hour, at least about two hours, at least
   about four hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours, about 24 hours or
25 more, about 48 hours or more, about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, etc., or any other
   relevant functionally-defined period (such as a time sufficient to induce, promote,
   enhance, and/or modulate a physiological response associated with antibody binding to
   the antigen).
            The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin
30 molecule contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions
   of the antibodies (Abs) may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or
   factors, including various cells of the immune system (such as effector cells) and the first
   component (Clq) of the classical complement system.
                                                      12

            An anti-CD38 antibody may be a bispecific antibody, diabody, or similar molecule
   (see for instance PNAS USA 90(14), 6444-8 (1993) for a description of diabodies).
   Indeed, bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and the like, provided by the present invention
   may bind any suitable target in addition to a portion of CD38.
 5          As indicated above, the term antibody herein, unless otherwise stated or clearly
   contradicted by context, includes fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to
   specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an
   antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding
   fragments encompassed within the term "antibody" include (i) a Fab fragment, a
10 monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) F(ab) 2 and
   F(ab') 2 fragments, bivalent fragments comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide
   bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting essentially of the  VH and CH1
   domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting essentially of the VL and   VH domains of a single
   arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)), which
15 consists essentially of a  VH domain; (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region
   (CDR), and (vii) a combination of two or more isolated CDRs which may optionally be
   joined by a synthetic linker. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment,
   VL and   VH,  are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant
   methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in
20 which the VL and    VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain
   antibodies or single chain Fv (scFv), see for instance Bird et al., Science 242, 423-426
   (1988) and Huston et al., PNAS USA 85, 5879-5883 (1988)). Such single chain
   antibodies are encompassed within the term antibody unless otherwise noted or clearly
   indicated by context. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are
25 included within the term antibody. Although such fragments are generally included within
   the meaning of antibody, they collectively and each independently are unique features of
   the present invention, exhibiting different biological properties and utility. These and
   other useful antibody fragments in the context of the present invention are discussed
   further herein.
30          It also should be understood that the term antibody also generally includes
   polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-like polypeptides, such
   as chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to
   antibodies, and antibody fragments retaining the ability to specifically bind to the antigen
   (antigen-binding fragments) provided by any known technique, such as enzymatic
                                                      13

   cleavage, peptide synthesis, and recombinant techniques. An antibody as generated can
   possess any isotype.
            The term "epitope" means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an
   antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules
 5 such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional
   structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and
   nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the
   latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. The epitope may comprise amino
   acid residues directly involved in the binding (also called immunodominant component of
10 the epitope) and other amino acid residues, which are not directly involved in the
   binding, such as amino acid residues which are effectively blocked by the specifically
   antigen binding peptide (in other words, the amino acid residue is within the footprint of
   the specifically antigen binding peptide).
            The term "bispecific molecule" is intended to include any agent, such as a
15 protein, peptide, or protein or peptide complex, which has two different binding
   specificities. For example, the molecule may bind to, or interact with, (a) a cell surface
   antigen and (b) an Fc receptor on the surface of an effector cell. The term "multispecific
   molecule" is intended to include any agent, for instance a protein, peptide, or protein or
   peptide complex, which has more than two different binding specificities. For example,
20 the molecule may bind to, or interact with, (a) a cell surface antigen, (b) an Fc receptor
   on the surface of an effector cell, and (c) at least one other component. Accordingly, the
   present invention includes, but is not limited to, bispecific, trispecific, tetraspecific, and
   other multispecific molecules which are directed to CD38, and to other cell surface
   antigens or targets, such as Fc receptors on effector cells.
25          The term "bispecific antibodies" is intended to include any anti-CD38 antibody,
   which is a bispecific molecule. The term "bispecific antibodies" also includes diabodies.
   Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which the    VH  and VL domains are
   expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for
   pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair
30 with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites
   (see for instance Holliger, P. et al., PNAS USA 90, 6444-6448 (1993), Poljak, R.J. et al.,
   Structure 2, 1121-1123 (1994)).
            As used herein, the term "effector cell" refers to an immune cell which is involved
   in the effector phase of an immune response, as opposed to the cognitive and activation
                                                      14

   phases of an immune response. Exemplary immune cells include a cell of a myeloid or
   lymphoid origin, for instance lymphocytes (such as B cells and T cells including cytolytic
   T cells (CTLs)), killer cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, monocytes, eosinophils,
   neutronphils, polymorphonuclear cells, granulocytes, mast cells, and basophils. Some
 5 effector cells express specific Fc receptors and carry out specific immune functions. In
   some embodiments, an effector cell is capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular
   cytotoxicity (ADCC), such as a neutrophil capable of inducing ADCC. For example,
   monocytes, macrophages, which express FcR are involved in specific killing of target
   cells and presenting antigens to other components of the immune system, or binding to
10 cells that present antigens. In some embodiments, an effector cell may phagocytose a
   target antigen, target cell, or microorganism. The expression of a particular FcR on an
   effector cell can be regulated by humoral factors such as cytokines. For example,
   expression of FcyRI has been found to be up-regulated by interferon y (IFN-y) and/or
   G-CSF. This enhanced expression increases the cytotoxic activity of FcyRI-bearing cells
15 against targets. An effector cell can phagocytose or lyse a target antigen or a target cell.
           The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies
   having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin
   sequences. The human antibodies of the present invention may include amino acid
   residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (for instance
20 mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic
   mutation in vivo). However, the term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended
   to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another
   mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework
   sequences.
25         As used herein, a human antibody is "derived from" a particular germline
   sequence if the antibody is obtained from a system using human immunoglobulin
   sequences, for instance by immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human
   immunoglobulin genes or by screening a human immunoglobulin gene library, and
   wherein the selected human antibody is at least 90%, such as at least 95%, for instance
30 at least 96%, such as at least 97%, for instance at least 98%, or such as at least 99%
   identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline
   VH or VL variable region gene segment. Typically, a human antibody derived from a
   particular human germline VH or VL variable region gene segment sequence will display
   no more than 10 amino acid differences, such as no more than 5, for instance no more
                                                         15

   than 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the
   germline immunoglobulin gene.
            A "chimeric" antibody is an antibody that contains one or more regions from one
   antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies .derived from
 5 another species. A monovalent chimeric antibody is a dimer (HL)) formed by a chimeric
   H chain associated through disulfide bridges with a chimeric L chain. A divalent chimeric
   antibody is tetramer (H2L2 ) formed by two HL dimers associated through at least one
   disulfide bridge. A polyvalent chimeric antibody may also be produced, for example, by
   employing a CH region that oligomerizes (for instance from an IgM H chain, or p chain).
10 Typically, a chimeric antibody refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy
   and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in
   antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or
   subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to
   corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to
15 another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as
   they exhibit the desired biological activity (see for instance US 4,816,567 and Morrison
   et al., PNAS USA 81, 6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies are produced by
   recombinant processes well known in the art (see for instance Cabilly et al., PNAS USA
   81, 3273-3277 (1984), Morrison et al., PNAS USA 81, 6851-6855 (1984), Boulianne et
20 al., Nature 312, 643-646 (1984), EP125023, Neuberger et al., Nature 314, 268-270
   (1985), EP171496, EP173494, W086/01533, EP184187, Sahagan et al., J. Immunol.
    137, 1066-1074 (1986), W087/02671, Liu et al., PNAS USA 84, 3439-3443 (1987), Sun
   et al., PNAS USA 84, 214-218 (1987), Better et al., Science 240, 1041-1043 (1988) and
   Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,
25 Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988)).
            A "humanized" antibody is an antibody that is derived from a non-human species,
   in which certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and
   light chains have been mutated so as to avoid or abrogate an immune response in
   humans. Humanized forms of non-human (for instance murine) antibodies are chimeric
30 antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin.
   For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient
   antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by
   residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as
   mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired antigen-binding
                                                      16

   characteristics such as specificity, and affinity. In some instances, Fv framework region
   (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human
   residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not
   found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to
 5 further optimize antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise
   substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or
   substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human
   immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human
   immunoglobulin sequence. A humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a
10 portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human
   immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., Nature 321, 522-525 (1986),
   Riechmann et al., Nature 332, 323-329 (1988) and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2,
   593-596 (1992).
           The terms "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as used
15 herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A
   monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a
   particular epitope. Accordingly, the term "human monoclonal antibody" refers to
   antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant
   regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human
20 monoclonal antibodies may be generated by a hybridoma which includes a B cell
   obtained from a transgenic or transchromosomal nonhuman animal, such as a
   transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a
   light chain transgene, fused to an immortalized cell. A monoclonal antibody may be
   abbreviated as mAb.
25         As used herein, "specific binding" refers to an antibody binding to a
   predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody, binds with an affinity corresponding to a
   KD  of about 10~7 M or less, such as about 10-8 M or less, such as about 10-9 M or less,
   about 10-10 M or less, or about 10-11 M or even less when determined by surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) technology in a BlAcore 3000 instrument using recombinant CD38 as
30 the ligand and the antibody as the analyte. The antibody may bind to the predetermined
   antigen with an affinity corresponding to a KD that is at least ten-fold lower, such as at
   least 100 fold lower, for instance at least 1000 fold lower, such as at least 10,000 fold
   lower, for instance at least 100,000 fold lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific
   antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related
                                                       17

   antigen. The amount with which the affinity is lower is dependent on the         KD of the
   antibody, so that when the      KD of the antibody is very low (that is, the antibody is highly
   specific), then the amount with which the affinity for the antigen is lower than the affinity
   for a non-specific antigen may be at least 10,000 fold.
 5          The term specificity herein refers to the ability of a CD38 binding peptide, such as
   an anti-CD38 antibody, to recognize an epitope within CD38, while only having little or
   no detectable reactivity with other portions of CD38 (including other epitopes that are
   bound by other anti-CD38 antibodies). Specificity can be relatively determined by
   competition assays as described herein. Specificity can more particularly be determined
10 by any of the epitope identification/characterization techniques described herein or their
   equivalents known in the art.
            An antibody specific for a particular antigenic determinant may nonetheless
   cross-react with other biomolecules that may be present in some biological context with
   CD38. More typically, an anti-CD38 antibody, may cross-react with CD38 homologues
15 from other species. In either or both contexts, typically such cross-reactive antibodies
   are selective for human CD38 with respect to relevant structure and/or environmental
   factors.
            The term "selectivity" herein refers to the preferential binding of an anti-CD38
   antibody, for a particular region, target, or peptide; typically a region or epitope in CD38,
20 as opposed to one or more other biological molecules, structures, cells, tissues, etc. In
   one embodiment, an anti-CD38 antibody used in the present invention is selective for a
   portion of CD38 in the context of colon cancer cells (i.e., the anti-CD38 antibody will
   selectively bind to the portion of CD38 over other components of a colon cancer cell).
            The term  "kd" (sec-1 ), as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation
25 equilibrium rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Said value is also
   referred to as the koff value.
            The term "k," (M-1 x sec-1), as used herein, is intended to refer to the association
   equilibrium rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
            The term  "KD"  (M), as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation
30 equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
            The term  "KA"  (M-1), as used herein, is intended to refer to the association
   equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction and is obtained by
   dividing the k, by the   kd
                                                        18

            As used herein, "isotype" refers to the antibody class (for instance IgG1, IgG2,
   IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or IgM) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.
            "Target cell" shall mean any undesirable cell in an individual. In some
   embodiments, the target cell is a cell expressing or overexpressing CD38. Cells
 5 expressing CD38 typically include hemopoietic cells, such as medullary thymocytes,
   activated T and B cells, 80% of resting NK cells and monocytes, lymph node germinal
   center lymphoblasts, plasma B cells and some intrafollicular cells, dendritic cells, normal
   bone marrow cells, particular precursor cells, 50-80% of umbilical cord blood cells,
   erythrocytes and platelets. CD38 can also be expressed by non-hemopoietic cells, such
10 as intra-epithelial cells and lamina propria lymphocytes in the gut, by Purkinje cells and

   No:7.
           In another embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the invention is

           In one embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the invention is an
   antibody binding to human CD38 encoded by human light chain and human heavy chain
   nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences in their variable regions as set forth in
10 SEQ ID No:1 and SEQ ID No:6, respectively.
           In one embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the invention is an
   antibody binding to human CD38 encoded by human light chain and human heavy chain
   nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences in their variable regions as set forth in
   SEQ ID No:11 and SEQ ID No:16, respectively.
15         In one embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the invention is an
   antibody binding to human CD38 encoded by human light chain and human heavy chain
   nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences in their variable regions as set forth in
   SEQ ID No:21 and SEQ ID No:26, respectively.
           In a yet further embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the

   particular an antibody comprising one or more of the sequences given in Figure 1b
   and/or the sequences given in Figure 2B of WO 2005/103083.
           Antibodies interact with target antigens primarily through amino acid residues that
   are located in the six heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions
25 (CDRs). For this reason, the amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse
   between individual antibodies than sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR
   sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen interactions, it is possible to
   express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific naturally occurring
   antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the
30 specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different
   antibody with different properties (see for instance Riechmann, L. et al., Nature 332,
   323-327 (1998), Jones, P. et al., Nature 321, 522-525 (1986) and Queen, C. et al.,
   PNAS USA 86, 10029-10033 (1989)).
                                                     23

            Since it is well known in the art that antibody heavy chain CDR3 domains play a
   particularly important role in the binding specificity/affinity of an antibody for an antigen
   (Ditzel HJ,et al., J Immunol. 157(2), 739-49 (1996), Barbas SM et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.
   116, 2161-2162 (1994), and Barbas SM et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92(7), 2529-33
 5 (1995), the antibodies used in the invention may comprise the heavy chain CDR3s of
   -003 or -005 or -024. The antibodies used in the invention may also comprise the heavy
   and light chain CDR3s of -003 or -005 or -024.

   Antibodies suitable for use in the present invention also include variants of the
   antibodies of the Examples. A functional variant of a     VL, VH, or CDR used in the context
   of a CD38 antibody still allows the antibody to retain at least a substantial proportion (at
   least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more) of the affinity/avidity and/or
15 specificity/selectivity of the parent antibody and in some cases such an antibody may be
   associated with greater affinity, selectivity, and/or specificity than the parent antibody.
           A "variant" anti-CD38 antibody is an antibody that differs from a parent antibody
   (typically generated by immunization) by one or more suitable amino acid residue
   alterations, that is substitutions, deletions, insertions, or terminal sequence additions, in
20 the CDRs or other VH and/or VL sequences (provided that at least a substantial amount
   of the epitope binding characteristics of the parent antibody are retained, if not improved
   upon, by such changes).
            Thus, for example, in an antibody variant one or more amino acid residues may
   be introduced or inserted in or adjacent to one or more of the hypervariable regions of a
25 parent antibody, such as in one or more CDRs. An anti-CD38 antibody variant may
   comprise any number of inserted amino acid residues, provided again that at least a
   substantial amount of the epitope binding characteristics of the parent antibody are
   retained. An anti-CD38 antibody variant of the present invention may for example
   comprise from about 1-30 inserted amino acid residues, for instance from about 1-10,
30 such as for instance from about 2-10, for instance from 2-5 or such as from about 1-5
   inserted amino acid residues. Likewise, an anti-CD38 antibody variant of the present
   invention may for example comprise from about 1-30 deleted amino acid residues, for
   instance from about 1-10, such as for instance from about 2-10, for instance from 2-5 or
   such as from about 1-5 deleted amino acid residues. Likewise, an anti-CD38 antibody
                                                        31

   variant of the present invention may for example comprise from about 1-30 substituted
   amino acid residues, for instance from about 1-10, such as for instance from about 2-10,
   for instance from 2-5 or such as from about 1-5 substituted amino acid residues.
   Likewise, an anti-CD38 antibody variant useful for the present invention may for example
 5 comprise from about 1-30 terminal sequence amino acid residue additions, for instance
   from about 1-10, such as for instance from about 2-10, for instance from 2-5 or such as
   from about 1-5 terminal sequence amino acid residue additions. A antibody variant of the
   present invention may also comprise a combination of two or more of such insertions,
   deletions, substitutions and terminal sequence amino acid residue additions, provided
10 that the variant possesses at least a substantial proportion of the parent antibodies
   affinity, specificity, and/or selectivity with respect to one or more CD38 epitopes.
            In one embodiment, the antibody used in the invention comprises a variant VH
   CDR3 consisting essentially of a sequence having at least about 80%, such as at least
   about 85%, for instance at least about 90%, such as at least about 95% amino acid
15 sequence identity to a sequence according to any one of SEQ ID No:10 or SEQ ID
   No:20 or SEQ ID No:30, wherein the antibody has at least a substantial proportion (at
   least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more) of the epitope binding
   characteristics of an antibody having a variant VH CDR3 sequence of SEQ ID No:10 or
   SEQ ID No:20 or SEQ ID No:30, respectively, such as an antibody having a         VH
20 sequence of SEQ ID No:7 or SEQ ID No:17 or SEQ ID No:27, respectively, such as an
   antibody having a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:7 and a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2, or
   an antibody having a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:17 and a VL sequence of SEQ ID
   No:12, or an antibody having a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:27 and a VL sequence of
   SEQ ID No:22, respectively.
25          The percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of
   identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % homology = # of identical
   positions/total # of positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the
   length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two
   sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity
30 between two sequences may be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm, as
   described in the non-limiting examples below.
            The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences may be determined
   using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com),
   using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length
                                                       32

   weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The percent identity between two nucleotide or amino acid
   sequences may also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller,
   Comput. Apple. Biosci 4, 11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN
   program (version 2.0), using a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12
 5 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid
   sequences may be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48,
   444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the
   GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62
   matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length
10 weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
           The sequence of CDR variants may differ from the sequence of the CDR of the
   parent antibody sequences through mostly conservative substitutions; for instance at
   least about 35%, about 50% or more, about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about
   75% or more, about 80% or more, about 85% or more, about 90% or more, about 95%
15 or more (e.g., about 65-99%) of the substitutions in the variant are conservative amino
   acid residue replacements. In the context of the present invention, conservative
   substitutions may be defined by substitutions within the classes of amino acids reflected
   in one or more of the following three tables:

           More conservative substitutions groupings include: valine-leucine-isoleucine,
5 phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine.
  Additional groups of amino acids may also be formulated using the principles described
  in, e.g., Creighton (1984) Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties (2d Ed. 1993),
  W.H. Freeman and Company.

            Where hypervariable region insertions are made to generate a variant antibody,
   the typical range of lengths of the hypervariable region in question in known antibodies
   should be taken into consideration. For example, for the first hypervariable region of a
   light chain variable domain, insertions may be introduced into the VL CDR1 sequence of
 5 a parent antibody while retaining a substantially similar and thereby expected
   appropriate size, which according to Kabat et al., supra, e.g., typically has an overall of
   about 9-20 (e.g., about 10-17) residues. Similarly, VL CDR2 typically has an overall
   length from about 5-10 residues; VL CDR3 typically has a length of about 7-20 residues;
   VH  CDR1 typically has a length of about 10-15 residues; VH CDR2 typically has a length
10 of about 15-20 residues; and    VH CDR3 typically has a length of about 6-30 residues
   (e.g., 3-25 residues). Insertions in the  VH region typically are made in VH CDR3 and
   typically near the C-terminal of the domain, such as about residues 97-102 of the parent
   VH  CDR3 (for instance adjacent to, or C-terminal in sequence to, residue number 100 of
   the parent VH CDR3 sequence) using the alignment and numbering as described in
15 Kabat. Antibody variants with inserted amino acid residue(s) in a hypervariable region
   thereof may be prepared randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of the
   parent antibody for the target antigen is such that randomly produced antibody variants
   may be readily screened. For example, phage display provides a convenient method of
   screening such random variants.
20          In a further embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the invention
   is an antibody which is characterized with respect to its ability to compete (competitively
   inhibit) or cross-compete (i.e., relatively partially inhibit epitope binding) with an antibody
   having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2 and a         VH  sequence of SEQ ID No:7 (such as
   antibody -003), or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:12 and a VH
25 sequence of SEQ ID No:17 (such as antibody -005) or an antibody having a VL
   sequence of SEQ ID No:22 and a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:27, (such as antibody
   -024), for binding to CD38. Such an antibody may be, for instance, a Fab fragment,
   derived from an antibody that binds to an epitope identical to or overlapping with an
   epitope bound by an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2 and a VH sequence
30 of SEQ ID No:7, or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:12 and a VH
   sequence of SEQ ID No:17 or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:22 and a
   VH  sequence of SEQ ID No:27. Competition for binding to CD38 or a portion of CD38 by
   two or more antibodies may be determined by any suitable technique. In one
   embodiment, competition is determined for example as described in Example 7, 8 and 9.
                                                       35

            Often competition is marked by a significantly greater relative inhibition than
   about 5% as determined by ELISA and/or FACS analysis. It may be desirable to set a
   higher threshold of relative inhibition as a criteria/determinant of what is a suitable level
   of competition in a particular context (e.g., where the competition analysis is used to
 5 select or screen for new antibodies designed with the intended function of blocking the
   binding of another peptide or molecule binding to CD38 (e.g., the natural binding
   partners of CD38 such as CD31, also called CD31 antigen, EndoCAM, GPIIA', PECAM
   1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule or naturally occurring anti-CD38 antibody)).
   Thus, for example, it is possible to set a criteria for competitiveness wherein at least
10 about 10% relative inhibition is detected; at least about 15% relative inhibition is
   detected; or at least about 20% relative inhibition is detected before an antibody is
   considered sufficiently competitive. In cases where epitopes belonging to competing
   antibodies are closely located in an antigen, competition may be marked by greater than
   about 40% relative inhibition of CD38 binding (e.g., at least about 45% inhibition, such
15 as at least about 50% inhibition, for instance at least about 55% inhibition, such as at
   least about 60% inhibition, for instance at least about 65% inhibition, such as at least
   about 70% inhibition, for instance at least about 75% inhibition, such as at least about
   80% inhibition, for instance at least about 85% inhibition, such as at least about 90%
   inhibition, for instance at least about 95% inhibition, or higher level of relative inhibition).
20          In a further embodiment, the non-agonistic CD38 antibody used in the invention
   is an antibody that specifically binds to a CD38 epitope that also is specifically bound by
   an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2 and a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:7
   (such as antibody -003), or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:12 and a VH
   sequence of SEQ ID No:17 (such as antibody -005) or an antibody having a VL
25 sequence of SEQ ID No:22 and a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:27 (such as antibody
   -024).
            A CD38 epitope bound by an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2 and
   a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:7 (such as the antibody -003), or an antibody having a VL
   sequence of SEQ ID No:12 and a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:17 (such as the antibody
30 -005) or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:22 and a VH sequence of SEQ
   ID No:27 (such as antibody -024), may be identified via standard mapping and
   characterization techniques, further refinement of which may be identified by any
   suitable technique, numerous examples of which are available to the skilled artisan.
   These techniques may also be used to identify and/or characterize epitopes for anti
                                                      36

   CD38 antibodies generally. As one example of such mapping/characterization methods,
   an epitope for an anti-CD38 antibody may be determined by epitope "foot-printing" using
   chemical modification of the exposed amines/carboxyls in the CD38 protein. One
   specific example of such a foot-printing technique is the use of HXMS (hydrogen
 5 deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry) wherein a hydrogen/deuterium
   exchange of receptor and ligand protein amide protons, binding, and back exchange
   occurs, wherein the backbone amide groups participating in protein binding are
   protected from back exchange and therefore will remain deuterated. Relevant regions
   may be identified at this point by peptic proteolysis, fast microbore high-performance
10 liquid chromatography separation, and/or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
   See, e.g., Ehring H, Analytical Biochemistry, 267(2) 252-259 (1999) and/or Engen, J.R.
   and Smith, D.L. (2001) Anal. Chem. 73, 256A-265A. Another example of a suitable
   epitope identification technique is nuclear magnetic resonance epitope mapping (NMR),
   where typically the position of the signals in two-dimensional NMR spectres of the free
15 antigen and the antigen complexed with the antigen binding peptide, such as an
                                                                                              15
   antibody, are compared. The antigen typically is selectively isotopically labeled with        N
   so that only signals corresponding to the antigen and no signals from the antigen binding
   peptide are seen in the NMR-spectrum. Antigen signals originating from amino acids
   involved in the interaction with the antigen binding peptide typically will shift position in
20 the spectres of the complex compared to the spectres of the free antigen, and the amino
   acids involved in the binding may be identified that way. See for instance Ernst Schering
   Res Found Workshop. (44), 149-67 (2004), Huang et al., Journal of Molecular Biology
   281(1), 61-67 (1998) and Saito and Patterson, Methods. 9(3), 516-24 (1996).
           Epitope mapping/characterization may also be performed using mass
25 spectrometry methods. See for instance Downward, J Mass Spectrom. 35(4), 493-503
   (2000) and Kiselar and Downard, Anal Chem. 71(9), 1792-801 (1999).
           Protease digestion techniques may also be useful in the context of epitope
   mapping and identification. Antigenic determinant-relevant regions/sequences may be
   determined by protease digestion, e.g. by using trypsin in a ratio of about 1:50 to CD38
30 overnight (O/N) digestion at 370C and pH 7-8, followed by mass spectrometry (MS)
   analysis for peptide identification. The peptides protected from trypsin cleavage by the
   antibody may subsequently be identified by comparison of samples subjected to trypsin
   digestion and samples incubated with antibody and then subjected to digestion by e.g.
   trypsin (thereby revealing a foot print for the binder). Other enzymes like chymotrypsin,
                                                      37

   pepsin, etc. may also or alternatively be used in a similar epitope characterization
   method. An antibody which gives the significantly same result as an antibody having a
   VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2 and a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:7 (such as the antibody
   -003), or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:12 and a VH sequence of SEQ
 5 ID No:17 (such as the antibody -005) or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID
   No:22 and a   VH sequence of SEQ ID No:27 (such as antibody -024) in these
   measurements are deemed to be an antibody that bind the same epitope as an antibody
   having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:2 and a      VH  sequence of SEQ ID No:7 (such as the
   antibody -003), or an antibody having a VL sequence of SEQ ID No:12 and a        VH
10 sequence of SEQ ID No:17 (such as the antibody -005) or an antibody having a VL
   sequence of SEQ ID No:22 and a VH sequence of SEQ ID No:27 (such as antibody
   -024), respectively. See for instance Manca, Ann Ist Super Sanita. 27(1), 15-9 (1991) for
   a discussion of similar techniques.
            Other methods potentially helpful in mapping epitopes include crystallography
15 techniques, X-ray diffraction techniques (such as the X-ray diffraction/sequence study
   techniques developed by Poljak and others in the 1970s-1980s), and the application of
   Multipin Peptide Synthesis Technology. Computer-based methods such as sequence
   analysis and three dimensional structure analysis and docking may also be used to
   identify antigenic determinants. For example, an epitope may also be determined by
20 molecular modeling using a structure of CD38 with docking of the structure of the Fab
   fragment of the individual monoclonal antibody. These and other mapping methods are
   discussed in Epitope Mapping A Practical Approach (Westwood and Hay Eds.) 2001

            An antibody used in the present invention may have any suitable affinity and/or
25 avidity for one or more epitopes contained at least partially in CD38. Affinity refers to the
   strength of binding of the antibody to such an epitope. Typically, affinity is measured by
   dissociation constant Kd, defined as [Ab] x [Ag] / [Ab-Ag] where [Ab-Ag] is the molar
   concentration of the antibody-antigen complex (or the antibody-antigen complex), [Ab] is
   the molar concentration of the unbound antibody and [Ag] is the molar concentration of
30 the unbound antigen. The affinity constant K, is defined by 1/Kd- Suitable methods for
   determining specificity and affinity by competitive inhibition can be found in for instance

           Anti-CD38 antibodies used in the present invention may have an affinity for at
   least one epitope at least partially comprised in CD38 in the range of about 104 to about
 5 1010 M-1 . Such an antibody may have an affinity that is at least as great for CD38 as -003
   and -005 and -024, and in some embodiments have an affinity that is at least about as
   great as -003 and -005 and -024. Affinity may be determined by any of the methods
   described elsewhere herein or their known equivalents in the art. An example of one
   method that may be used to determine affinity is provided in Scatchard analysis of
10 Munson & Pollard, Anal. Biochem. 107, 220 (1980). Binding affinity also may be
   determined by equilibrium methods (for instance enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay
   (ELISA) or radioimmunoassay (RIA)) or kinetics analysis (for instance BIACORE       TM
   analysis).
           Typically, the disassociation constant for anti-CD38 antibodies used in the
15 present invention is less than about 100 nM, less than about 50 nM, less than about 10
   nM, about 5 nM or less, about 1 nM or less, about 0.5 nM or less, about 0.1 nM or less,
   about 0.01 nM or less, or even about 0.001 nM or less.
           Non-limiting examples of anti-CD38 antibodies suitable for use in the present
20 invention include (a) a complete functional, immunoglobulin molecule comprising: (i) two
   identical chimeric heavy chains comprising a variable region with a human B cell surface
   antigen specificity and human constant region and (ii) two identical all (i.e. non-chimeric)
   human light chains; (b) a complete, functional, immunoglobulin molecule comprising: (i)
   two identical chimeric heavy chains comprising a variable region as indicated, and a
25 human constant region, and (ii) two identical all (i.e. non-chimeric) non-human light
   chains; (c) a monovalent antibody, i.e., a complete, functional immunoglobulin molecule
   comprising: (i) two identical chimeric heavy chains comprising a variable region as
   indicated, and a human constant region, and (ii) two different light chains, only one of
   which has the same specificity as the variable region of the heavy chains. The resulting
30 antibody molecule binds only to one end thereof and is therefore incapable of divalent
   binding. As another illustration, immunoglobulin-related peptides provided by the present
   invention may be said to include the following: (a) a whole immunoglobulin molecule; (b)
   an scFv; (c) a monoclonal antibody; (d) a human antibody; (e) a chimeric antibody; (f) a
                                                    39

   humanized antibody; (g) a Fab fragment; (h) an Fab' fragment; (i) an F(ab') 2 fragment; (j)
   an Fv molecule; and (k) a disulfide-linked Fv molecule.
           In one embodiment, the antibody used in the present invention is a polyclonal
   antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody used in of the present invention is an
 5 monoclonal antibody. In a further embodiment, the antibody used in of the present
   invention is a human monoclonal antibody. In another further embodiment, the antibody
   used in of the present invention is a humanized antibody. In another further embodiment,
   the antibody used in of the present invention is a chimeric antibody. In another further
   embodiment, the antibody used in of the present invention is a monoclonal antibody
10 originating entirely from a mammalian species different from humans. In a further
   embodiment, the antibody used in of the present invention is a fully murine monoclonal
   antibody.
           In one embodiment, the antibody used in the invention is glycosylated in a
   eukaryotic cell. In another embodiment, the antibody used in the invention further
15 comprises a chelator linker for attaching a radioisotope. In a further embodiment, the
   antibody used in the invention is in a substantially isolated form.
           A monoclonal antibody refers to a composition comprising a homogeneous
   antibody population having a uniform structure and specificity. Typically a monoclonal
   antibody is an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous
20 antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except
   for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts.
   Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific and each monoclonal antibody is typically
   directed against a single epitope, which is in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations
   which typically include different antibodies directed against different epitopes. That an
25 antibody is monoclonal is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by
   any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention
   may be produced by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256,
   495 (1975), or may be produced by recombinant DNA methods. Monoclonal antibodies
   may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in, for
30 example, Clackson et al., Nature 352, 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222,
   581-597 (1991).
           Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from any suitable source. Thus, for
   example, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from hybridomas prepared from
   murine splenic B cells obtained from mice immunized with an antigen of interest, for
                                                     40

   instance in form of cells expressing the antigen on the surface, or a nucleic acid
   encoding an antigen of interest. Monoclonal antibodies may also be obtained from
   hybridomas derived from antibody-expressing cells of immunized humans or non-human
   mammals such as rats, dogs, primates, etc.
 5          Alternatively, the cloned antibody genes can be expressed in other expression
   systems, including prokaryotic cells, such as microorganisms, such as E. coli, for the
   production of single chain Fv antibodies, algi, as well as insect cells. Furthermore, the
   antibodies can be produced in transgenic non-human animals, such as in milk from
   sheep and rabbits or in eggs from hens, or in transgenic plants. See for instance Verma,
10 R., et al., J.Immunol.Meth. 216, 165-181 (1998); Pollock, et al., J.Immunol.Meth. 231,
   147-157 (1999); and Fischer, R., et al., Biol.Chem. 380, 825-839 (1999).
            In one embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies directed against CD38 may
   be generated using transgenic or transchromosomal mice carrying parts of the human
   immune system rather than the mouse system. Such transgenic and transchromosomic
15 mice include mice referred to herein as HuMAb mice and KM mice, respectively, and are
   collectively referred to herein as "transgenic mice". A human monoclonal antibody
   generated in such mice may be abbreviated as HuMab.
            The HuMAb mouse contains a human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that
   encodes unrearranged human heavy (p and y) and        K light chain immunoglobulin
20 sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p and       K
   chain loci (Lonberg, N. et al., Nature 368, 856-859 (1994)). Accordingly, the mice exhibit
   reduced expression of mouse IgM or      K and in response to immunization, the introduced
   human heavy and light chain transgenes, undergo class switching and somatic mutation
   to generate high affinity human IgG,K monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg, N. et al. (1994),
25 supra; reviewed in Lonberg, N. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113, 49-101
   (1994), Lonberg, N. and Huszar, D., Intern. Rev. Immunol. Vol. 13 65-93 (1995) and
   Harding, F. and Lonberg, N. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci 764 536-546 (1995)). The preparation
   of HuMAb mice is described in detail in Taylor, L. et al., Nucleic Acids Research 20,

            The HCo7 mice have a JKD disruption in their endogenous light chain (kappa)
   genes (as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 821-830 (1993)), a CMD disruption in
 5 their endogenous heavy chain genes (as described in Example 1 of WO 01/14424), a
   KCo5 human kappa light chain transgene (as described in Fishwild et al., Nature
   Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996)), and a HCo7 human heavy chain transgene (as
   described in US 5,770,429).
            The HCo12 mice have a JKD disruption in their endogenous light chain (kappa)
10 genes (as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 821-830 (1993)), a CMD disruption in
   their endogenous heavy chain genes (as described in Example 1 of WO 01/14424), a
   KCo5 human kappa light chain transgene (as described in Fishwild et al., Nature
   Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996)), and a HCo12 human heavy chain transgene (as
   described in Example 2 of WO 01/14424). In the KM mouse strain, the endogenous
15 mouse kappa light chain gene has been homozygously disrupted as described in Chen
   et al., EMBO J. 12, 811-820 (1993) and the endogenous mouse heavy chain gene has
   been homozygously disrupted as described in Example 1 of WO 01/09187. This mouse
   strain carries a human kappa light chain transgene, KCo5, as described in Fishwild et
   al., Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996). This mouse strain also carries a human
20 heavy chain transchromosome composed of chromosome 14 fragment hCF (SC20) as
   described in WO 02/43478.
            The KM mouse contains a human heavy chain transchromosome and a human
   kappa light chain transgene. The endogenous mouse heavy and light chain genes also
   have been disrupted in the KM mice such that immunization of the mice leads to
25 production of human immunoglobulins rather than mouse immunoglobulins. Construction
   of KM mice and their use to raise human immunoglobulins is described in detail in WO
   02/43478.Splenocytes from these transgenic mice may be used to generate hybridomas
   that secrete human monoclonal antibodies according to well known techniques.
            Human monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies used in the present invention, or
30 antibodies used in the present invention originating from other species may also be
   generated transgenically through the generation of another non-human mammal or plant
   that is transgenic for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences of interest
   and production of the antibody in a recoverable form therefrom. In connection with the
   transgenic production in mammals, antibodies may be produced in, and recovered from,
                                                   42

   the milk of goats, cows, or other mammals. See for instance US 5,827,690, US
   5,756,687, US 5,750,172 and US 5,741,957.
            Further, human antibodies used in the present invention or antibodies used in the
   present invention from other species may be generated through display-type
 5 technologies, including, without limitation, phage display, retroviral display, ribosomal
   display, and other techniques, using techniques well known in the art and the resulting
   molecules may be subjected to additional maturation, such as affinity maturation, as
   such techniques are well known in the art (see for instance Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol.
   Biol. 227, 381 (1991) (phage display), Vaughan et al., Nature Biotech 14, 309 (1996)
10 (phage display), Hanes and Plucthau, PNAS USA 94, 4937-4942 (1997) (ribosomal
   display), Parmley and Smith, Gene 73, 305-318 (1988) (phage display), Scott TIBS 17,

   43-68 (1992), Chiswell and McCafferty TIBTECH 10 80-84 (1992), and US 5,733,743).
15 If display technologies are utilized to produce antibodies that are not human, such
   antibodies may be humanized, for instance as described elsewhere herein.
            Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in for instance US
   6,054,297, US 5,886,152 and US 5,877,293. Also, the use of Ig cDNA for construction of
   chimeric immunoglobulin genes is known in the art (see for instance Liu et al., PNAS
20 USA 84, 3439 (1987) and J.Immunol. 139, 3521 (1987
            Anti-CD38 antibodies may be recovered from recombinant combinatorial
   antibody libraries, such as a scFv phage display library, which may be made with human
   VL and   VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived from human lymphocytes. Methods for
   preparing and screening such libraries are known in the art. There are a number of
25 commercially available kits for generating phage display libraries. There are also other
   methods and reagents that may be used in generating and screening antibody display
   libraries (see for instance US 5,223,409, WO 92/18619, WO 91/17271, WO 92/20791,

   88, 7978-7982 (1991)). Suitable VL and      VH nucleic acid sequences may be selected
   using any appropriate method. For example, VL and        VH nucleic acids may be selected by
   employing the epitope imprinting methods described in WO 93/06213. Antibody libraries,
   such as scFv libraries may be prepared and screened using known and suitable
 5 methods (with human CD38-containing peptides as antigen(s)), such as those described
   in for instance W092/01047, McCafferty et al., Nature 348, 552-554 (1990) and Griffiths
   et al., EMBO J 12, 725-734 (1993). Such antibody libraries are features of the present
   invention that may be used therapeutically to provide a more comprehensive immune
   response; as tools in screening methods for immunogenic peptides, small molecules,
10 other anti-CD38 antibodies (e.g., by way of competition assays), and the like; and/or in
   diagnostic methods and compositions (e.g., an immunoassay chip comprising a panel of
   such antibodies optionally in association with other antibodies may be prepared by
   standard techniques). Once initial human VL and      VH  segments are selected, "mix and
   match" experiments, in which different pairs of the initially selected VL and   VH segments
15 are screened for CD38-containing peptide binding, may be performed to select desirable
   VLNH    pair combinations. For example, reactivity of the peptides may be determined by
   ELISA or other suitable epitope analysis methods (see for instance Scott, J. K. and
   Smith, G. P. Science 249, 386-390 (1990), Cwirla et al., PNAS USA 87, 6378-6382
   (1990), Felici et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222, 301-310 (1991) and Kuwabara et al., Nature
20 Biotechnology 15, 74-78 (1997) for discussion of such techniques and principles).
   Antibodies may be selected by their affinity for antigen and/or by their kinetics of
   dissociation (off-rate) from antigen (see for instance Hawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol. 226,
   889-896 (1992)).
            High-affinity antibody peptides, such as human single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab
25 antibody fragments, may also be isolated from such libraries using a panning technique
   in which the antigen of interest is immobilized on a solid surface, such as microtiter
   plates or beads (see for instance Barbas and Burton, Trends. Biotechnol. 14, 230-234
   (1996) and Aujame et al., Hum. Antibodies 8, 155-68 (1997). Phage display of large
   naive libraries also makes it possible to isolate human antibodies directly without
30 immunization (see for instance de Haard et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274(26), 18218-18230
   (1999)).
            Antibodies suitable for use in the present invention may be selected based on
   their ability to provide the ability of complement fixation, or not. There are a number of
   isotypes of antibodies that are capable of complement fixation and CDC, including,
                                                      44

   without limitation, the following: murine IgM, murine IgG2a, murine IgG2b, murine IgG3,
   human IgM, human IgG1, and human IgG3. Those isotypes that do not include, without
   limitation, human IgG2 and human IgG4. Isotype determination and other methods for
   modifying the complement fixation and CDC functional characteristics of antibodies are
 5 known in the art.
            Anti-CD38 antibodies used in the present invention may be prepared by
   recombinant expression in any suitable type of cells or animals. Suitable methods for
   antibody production are known in the art and include those described in for instance
   Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,
10 Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988), Harlow and Lane: Using Antibodies: A Laboratory
   Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1999)), US 4,376,110 and Ausubel et al.,
   eds., Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley
   InterScience N.Y., (1987, 1992). Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the
   hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256, 495 (1975), or by other
15 well-known, subsequently-developed methods (see, e.g., Goding, Monoclonal
   Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Hybridomas
   useful in the production of anti-CD38 antibodies of the present invention are also
   provided by the present invention. Such hybridomas may be formed by chemical fusion,
   electrical fusion, or any other suitable technique, with any suitable type of myeloma,
20 heteromyeloma, phoblastoid cell, plasmacytoma or other equivalent thereof and any
   suitable type of antibody-expressing cell. Transformed immortalized B cells may also be
   used to efficiently produce antibodies of the present invention and are also provided by
   the present invention. Such cells may be produced by standard techniques, such as
   transformation with an Epstein Barr Virus, or a transforming gene. (See, e.g.,
25 "Continuously Proliferating Human Cell Lines Synthesizing Antibody of Predetermined
   Specificity," Zurawaki, V. R. et al., in Monoclonal Antibodies, ed. by Kennett R. H. et al.,
   Plenum Press, N.Y. 1980, pp 19-33.).
            Recombinant cells comprising exogenous nucleic acids encoding anti-CD38
   antibodies may be prepared by any suitable technique (e.g., transfection/transformation
30 with a naked DNA plasmid vector, viral vector, invasive bacterial cell vector or other
   whole cell vector, etc., comprising a antibody-encoding sequence (or sequences)
   delivered into the cell by calcium phosphate-precipitation facilitated transfection,
   receptor-mediated targeting and transfection, biolistic delivery, electroporation, dextran
   mediated transfection, liposome-mediated transformation, protoplast fusion, direct
                                                     45

   microinjection, etc.). Methods of transforming/transfecting cells are well known in the art
   (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor
   Laboratory Press (2d Edition, 1989 and 3rd Edition, 2001) and F. Ausubel et al., ed.
   Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley InterScience New
 5 York (1987). Such recombinant cells are a feature of the present invention.
            Cell lines available as hosts for recombinant protein expression are well known in
   the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type
   Culture Collection (ATCC). These include, inter alia, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,
   NSO, SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells
10 (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), A549 cells, and a number
   of other cell lines. Other cell lines that may be used are insect cell lines, such as Sf9
   cells. When nucleic acids (or nucleic acid-containing vectors) encoding proteins, such as
   anti-CD38 antibodies), are introduced into mammalian host cells, proteins may be
   produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression
15 of the protein in the host cells or by secretion of the protein into the culture medium in
   which the host cells are grown. Antibodies may be recovered from the culture medium
   using standard protein purification methods. Antibodies may also be recovered from host
   cell lysates when directly expressed without a secretory signal.
            When recombinant expression vectors encoding anti-CD38 antibody genes are
20 introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host
   cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells
   or for secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown.
   The purification of antibodies from cell cultures, cell lysates, and animals (e.g., from the
   ascites fluid of a transgenic animal producing anti-CD38 antibodies) may be achieved by
25 application of any number of suitable techniques known in the art including, e.g.,
   immunoaffinity column purification; sulfate precipitation; chromatofocusing; preparative
   SDS-PAGE, and the like.
            Human monoclonal antibodies of the present invention may also be produced by
   a variety of other techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology,
30 e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein, Nature
   256, 495 (1975). Other techniques for producing monoclonal antibody may also be
   employed, e.g. phage display techniques using libraries of human antibody genes. In
   one embodiment, anti-CD38 antibodies of the present invention produced by use of
   hybridomas generated in a murine system. Hybridoma production in the mouse is a very
                                                       46

   well established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of
   immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g., murine
   myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also known.
            To generate fully human monoclonal antibodies to CD38, transgenic or
 5 transchromosomal mice containing human immunoglobulin genes (e.g., HCo12, HCo7 or
   KM mice) may be immunized with an enriched preparation of CD38 antigen and/or cells
   expressing CD38, as described, for example, by Lonberg et al., (1994), supra, Fishwild
   et al., (1996), supra, and WO 98/24884. Alternatively, mice may be immunized with DNA
   encoding human CD38. The mice may be 6-16 weeks of age upon the first infusion. For
10 example, an enriched preparation (5-50 pg) of the CD38 antigen may be used to
   immunize the HuMAb mice intraperitoneally. In the event that immunizations using a
   purified or enriched preparation of the CD38 antigen do not result in antibodies, mice
   may also be immunized with cells expressing CD38, e.g., a cell line, to promote immune
   responses.
15          Cumulative experience with various antigens has shown that the HuMAb
   transgenic mice respond best when initially immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) or
   subcutaneously (s.c.) with CD38 expressing cells in complete Freund's adjuvant,
   followed by every other week i.p. immunizations (up to a total of 10) with CD38
   expressing cells in PBS. The immune response may be monitored over the course of the
20 immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The
   plasma may be screened by FACS analysis, and mice with sufficient titers of anti-CD38
   human immunoglobulin may be used for fusions. Mice may be boosted intravenously
   with CD38 expressing cells for Examples 4 and 3 days before sacrifice and removal of
   the spleen.
25          To generate hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies to human
   CD38, splenocytes and lymph node cells from immunized mice may be isolated and
   fused to an appropriate immortalized cell line, such as a mouse myeloma cell line. The
   resulting hybridomas may then be screened for the production of antigen-specific
   antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized
30 mice may be fused to SP2/0 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1581) with
   50% PEG (w/v). Cells may be plated at approximately 1 x 105 per well in flat bottom
   microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing
   besides usual reagents 10% fetal Clone Serum, 5-10% origen hybridoma cloning factor
   (IGEN) and 1X HAT (Sigma). After approximately two weeks, cells may be cultured in
                                                    47

   medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells may then be screened by
   ELISA for human kappa-light chain containing antibodies and by FACS analysis using
   CD38 expressing cells for CD38 specificity. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs,
   medium may be observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas
 5 may be replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-CD38
   monoclonal antibodies may be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable
   subclones may then be cultured in vitro to generate antibody in tissue culture medium for
   characterization.
           Human antibodies of the present invention may also be produced in a host cell
10 transfectoma using, for example, a combination of recombinant DNA techniques and
   gene transfection methods as is well known in the art, see for instance Morrison, S.,
   Science 229, 1202 (1985).
           For example, to express the antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, DNAs
   encoding partial or full-length light and heavy chains, may be obtained by standard
15 molecular biology techniques (for instance PCR amplification, site directed mutagenesis)
   and may be inserted into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked
   to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this context, the term
   "operatively linked" is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated into a vector
   such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their
20 intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The
   expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with
   the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy
   chain gene may be inserted into separate vectors or, more typically, both genes are
   inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes may be inserted into the
25 expression vector by standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites
   on the antibody gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are
   present). The light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies described herein
   may be used to create full-length antibody genes of any antibody isotype by inserting
   them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain
30 constant regions of the desired isotype such that the   VH segment is operatively linked to
   the CH segment(s) within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL
   segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression
   vector may encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a
   host cell. The antibody chain gene may be cloned into the vector such that the signal
                                                    48

   peptide is linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal
   peptide may be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide (i.e.,
   a signal peptide from a non-immunoglobulin protein).
            In addition to the antibody chain genes, the recombinant expression vectors carry
 5 regulatory sequences that allows and control the expression of the antibody chain genes
   in a host cell. Furthermore, the recombinant expression vectors may carry additional
   sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g.,
   origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene
   facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see for
10 instance US 4,399,216, US 4,634,665 and US 5,179,017). For example, typically the
   selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or
   methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Examples of
   selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in
   dhfr-host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418
15 selection).
            For expression of the light and heavy chains, the expression vector(s) encoding
   the heavy and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The
   host cells may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, such as mammalian, host cells. For instance
   antigen binding fragments may be expressed in prokaryotic host cells and full-length
20 antibodies may be expressed in eukaryotic host cells.
            In one embodiment the antibodies are expressed in eukaryotic cells, such as
   mammalian host cells. Examples of mammalian host cells for expressing the
   recombinant antibodies of the present invention include CHO cells (including dhfr-CHO
   cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, PNAS USA 77, 4216-4220 (1980), used with a
25 DHFR selectable marker, for instance as described in R. J. Kaufman and P. A. Sharp,
   Mol. Biol. 159, 601-621 (1982)), NS/0 myeloma cells, COS cells, HEK293 cells and
   SP2.0 cells. In particular for use with NS/0 myeloma cells, another example of a
   expression system is the GS (glutamine synthetase) gene expression system disclosed
   in W087/04462, W089/01036 and EP338 841.
30          The antibody genes may be expressed in other expression systems, including
   prokaryotic cells, such as microorganisms, e.g. E. coli for the production of scFv
   antibodies, algi, as well as insect cells. Furthermore, the antibodies may be produced in
   transgenic non-human animals, such as in milk from sheep and rabbits or eggs from
   hens, or in transgenic plants. See for instance Verma, R. et al., J.Immunol.Meth. 216,
                                                      49

    165-181 (1998), Pollock et al., J.Immunol.Meth. 231, 147-157 (1999) and Fischer, R. et
   al., Biol.Chem. 380, 825-839 (1999).
   Bispecific and multispecific antibodies
 5          In one embodiment of the present invention, the antibody used may be
   derivatized or linked to another functional molecule, for instance another peptide or
   protein (such as a Fab' fragment) to generate a bispecific or multispecific molecule which
   binds to multiple binding sites or target epitopes. For example, an antibody used in the
   present invention may be functionally linked (for instance by chemical coupling, genetic
10 fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other binding molecules,
   such as another antibody, peptide or binding mimetic.
            Accordingly, the present invention includes the use of bispecific and multispecific
   molecules comprising at least one first binding specificity for CD38 and a second binding
   specificity for a second target epitope. In one embodiment of the present invention, the
15 second target epitope is an Fc receptor, e.g., human FcyRI (CD64) or a human Fca
   receptor (CD89), or a T cell receptor, e.g., CD3. In one embodiment, the present
   invention provides bispecific and multispecific molecules capable of binding both to
   FcyR, FcaR or FceR expressing effector cells (e.g., monocytes, macrophages or
   polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs)), and to target cells expressing CD38. These bispecific
20 and multispecific molecules target CD38 expressing cells to effector cell and trigger Fc
   receptor-mediated effector cell activities, such as phagocytosis of CD38 expressing
   cells, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), cytokine release, or generation of
   superoxide anion.
            In one embodiment, the bispecific and multispecific molecules used in the
25 present invention comprise as a binding specificity at least one further antibody,
   including, e.g., an Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, or a scFv. The further antibody may also be a
   light chain or heavy chain dimer, or any minimal fragment thereof such as a Fv or a
   single chain construct as described in Ladner et al., in US 4,946,778. The antibody may
   also be a binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as disclosed in US
30 2003/0118592 and US 2003/0133939.
            In one embodiment, the binding specificity for an Fc receptor is provided by a
   human monoclonal antibody, the binding of which is not blocked by human
   immunoglobulin G (IgG). As used herein, the term "IgG receptor" refers to any of the
   eight y-chain genes located on chromosome 1. These genes encode a total of twelve
                                                     50

   transmembrane or soluble receptor isoforms which are grouped into three Fc* receptor
   classes: FcyRI (CD64), FcyRlI (CD32), and FcyRlIl (CD16). In one embodiment, the Fcy
   receptor is a human high affinity FcyRI. The production and characterization of these
   monoclonal antibodies are described by Fanger et al., in WO 88/00052 and in US
 5 4,954,617. These antibodies bind to an epitope of FcyRI, FcyRlI or FcyRlIl at a site
   which is distinct from the Fcy binding site of the receptor and, thus, their binding is not
   blocked substantially by physiological levels of IgG. Specific anti-FcyRI antibodies useful
   in the present invention are mAb 22, mAb 32, mAb 44, mAb 62 and mAb 197. In other
   embodiments, the anti-Fcy receptor antibody is a humanized form of mAb 22 (H22). The
10 production and characterization of the H22 antibody is described in Graziano, R.F. et al.,
   J. Immunol. 155(10), 4996-5002 (1995) and WO 94/10332. The H22 antibody producing
   cell line was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection on November 4, 1992
   under the designation HA022CL1 and has the accession No. CRL 11177.
            In one embodiment, the binding specificity for an Fc receptor is provided by an
15 antibody that binds to a human IgA receptor, e.g., an Fca receptor (Fcal (CD89)), the
   binding of which in one embodiment is not blocked by human immunoglobulin A (IgA).
   The term "IgA receptor" is intended to include the gene product of one a-gene (FcaRl)
   located on chromosome 19. This gene is known to encode several alternatively spliced
   transmembrane isoforms of 55 to 110 kDa. FcaRl (CD89) is constitutively expressed on
20 monocytes/macrophages, eosinophilic and neutrophilic granulocytes, but not on non
   effector cell populations. FcaRl has medium affinity for both IgAl and IgA2, which is
   increased upon exposure to cytokines such as G-CSF or GM-CSF (Morton, H.C. et al.,
   Critical Reviews in Immunology 16, 423-440 (1996)). Four FcaRl-specific monoclonal
   antibodies, identified as A3, A59, A62 and A77, which bind FcaRI outside the IgA ligand
25 binding domain, have been described (Monteiro, R.C. et al., J. Immunol. 148, 1764
   (1992)).
            FcaRI, FcyRI, FcyRlI and FcyRlIl, especially FcyRlI and FcyRlIl, are examples of
   trigger receptors for use in the present invention because they (1) are expressed
   primarily on immune effector cells, e.g., monocytes, PMNs, macrophages and dendritic
30 cells; (2) are expressed at high levels (for instance 5,000-100,000 per cell); (3) are
   mediators of cytotoxic activities (for instance ADCC, phagocytosis); and (4) mediate
   enhanced antigen presentation of antigens, including self-antigens, targeted to them.
            Exemplary bispecific antibody molecules comprise (i) two antibodies one with a
   specificity to CD38 and another to a second target that are conjugated together, (ii) a
                                                     51

   single antibody that has one chain specific to CD38 and a second chain specific to a
   second molecule, and (iii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to CD38 and a
   second molecule. Typically, the second target/second molecule is a molecule other than
   CD38. In one embodiment, the second molecule is a cancer antigen/tumor-associated
 5 antigen such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate specific antigen (PSA),
   RAGE (renal antigen), a-fetoprotein, CAMEL (CTL-recognized antigen on melanoma),
   CT antigens (such as MAGE-B5, -B6, -C2, -C3, and D; Mage-12; CT10; NY-ESO-1,
   SSX-2, GAGE, BAGE, MAGE, and SAGE), mucin antigens (e.g., MUC1, mucin-CA125,
   etc.), ganglioside antigens, tyrosinase, gp75, C-myc, Mart1, MelanA, MUM-1, MUM-2,
10 MUM-3, HLA-B7, and Ep-CAM. In one embodiment, the second molecule is a cancer
   associated integrin, such as a5P3 integrin. In one embodiment, the second molecule is
   an angiogenic factor or other cancer-associated growth factor, such as a vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth
   factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), angiogenin, and receptors
15 thereof, particularly receptors associated with cancer progression (for instance one of
   the HER1-HER4 receptors). Other cancer progression-associated proteins discussed
   herein may also be suitable second molecules. In one embodiment, the second
   molecule is a molecule expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells such as
   CD138.
20          In one embodiment, a bispecific antibody used in the present invention is a
   diabody.
            Bispecific and multispecific antibodies used in the present invention may be
   made using chemical techniques (see for instance D. M. Kranz et al., PNAS USA 78,
   5807 (1981)), "polydoma" techniques (See US 4,474,893) or recombinant DNA
25 techniques.
   Conjugates
            In one embodiment, the present invention uses a CD38 antibody conjugated to a
   therapeutic moiety, such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an
30 immunosuppressant, or a radioisotope. Such conjugates are referred to herein as
   "immunoconjugates". Immunoconjugates which include one or more cytotoxins are
   referred to as "immunotoxins".
           A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to (e.g., kills)
   cells. For a description of these classes of drugs which are well known in the art, and
                                                     52

   Pharmacological Basis Of Therapeutics, 8th Ed., Macmillan Publishing Co., 1990.
   Additional techniques relevant to the preparation of antibody immunotoxins are provided
   in for instance Vitetta, Immunol. Today 14, 252 (1993) and US 5,194,594.

   invention include taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine,
   mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin,
   daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, 1-dehydro

   diphtheria A chain and active fragments thereof and hybrid molecules), ricin toxin (such
20 as ricin A or a deglycosylated ricin A chain toxin), cholera toxin, a Shiga-like toxin (SLT-1,
   SLT-II, SLT-IIV), LT toxin, C3 toxin, Shiga toxin, pertussis toxin, tetanus toxin, soybean

25 charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin,
   restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin toxins. Therapeutic agents, which may be
   administered in combination with an antibody as described elsewhere herein, may also
   be candidates for therapeutic moieties useful for conjugation to an antibody used in the
   present invention. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide
30 possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, an
   enzymatically active toxin, or active fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin A,
   pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor or
   interferon-y; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines,
   interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte macrophage
                                                       53

   colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), or
   other growth factors and apotopic inducing protein isolated from mitochondria.
             Conjugates of antibodies, and such cytotoxic moieties may be made using a
   variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents. Examples of such reagents include
 5 SPDP, IT, bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such a dimethyl adipimidate HCI, active
   esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate, aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, bis-azido
   compounds such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine, bis-diazonium derivatives

10 dinitrobenzene and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, docetaxel, paclitaxel
   and vinorelbin).
            In one embodiment, the present invention uses an anti-CD38 antibody that is
   conjugated to an immunomodulator, such as an immunomodulating cytokine, stem cell
   growth factor, lymphotoxin (such as a TNF such as TNFa), or a hematopoietic factor.
15 Examples of such molecules that may be useful as conjugates include IL-1, IL-2, IL-3,
   IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-21, colony stimulating factors (such as granulocyte
   colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor
   (GM-CSF)), interferons (such as IFNa, IFN@, and IFNy) the stem cell growth factor
   designated "S1 factor," erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin, active fragments thereof,
20 derivatives thereof, variants thereof, or a combination of any thereof.
            Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moieties to antibodies, are well
   known, see for instance Arnon et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of
   Drugs In Cancer Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et
   al., (eds.), pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985), Hellstrom et al., "Antibodies For Drug
25 Delivery", in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al., (eds.), pp. 623-53

   Therapy: A Review", in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications,

   (Academic Press 1985) and Thorpe et al., "The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties Of
   Antibody-Toxin Conjugates", Immunol. Rev. 62, 119-58 (1982).
           Additionally useful conjugate substituents include anti-cancer retinoids. Taxane
   conjugates (see for instance Jaime et al., Anticancer Res. 21(2A), 1119-28 (2001),

   promoting the treatment of cancer (see, generally, Trail et al., Cancer Immunol
 5 Immunother. 52(5), 328-37 (2003)).
   Formulation and mode-of-administration
            The agents used in the present invention may be formulated as a pharmaceutical
   composition with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other
10 known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as
   those disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition,
   Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1995.
            The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known
   adjuvants and excipients should be suitable for the chosen compound used in the
15 present invention and the chosen mode of administration. Suitability for carriers and
   other components of pharmaceutical compositions is determined based on the lack of
   significant negative impact on the desired biological properties of the chosen compound
   or pharmaceutical composition (e.g., less than a substantial impact (10% or less relative
   inhibition, 5% or less relative inhibition, etc.) on antigen binding.
20          A pharmaceutical composition used in the present invention may also include
   diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, detergents (e. g., a nonionic detergent, such as Tween
   80), stabilizers, stabilizers (e. g., sugars or protein-free amino acids), preservatives,
   tissue fixatives, solubilizers, and/or other materials suitable for inclusion in a
   pharmaceutical composition.
25          The actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical
   compositions may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is
   effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient,
   composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected
   dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity
30 of the particular compositions employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of
   administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular
   compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds
   and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the
                                                         55

   age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being
   treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
            The pharmaceutical composition may be administered by any suitable route and
   mode. Suitable routes of administering a compound of the present invention in vivo and
 5 in vitro are well known in the art and can be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art.
             The compounds used in the present invention may be administered via any
   suitable route, such as an oral, nasal, inhalable, topical (including buccal, transdermal
   and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral route
            In one embodiment, one or more of the compounds used in the present invention
10 is administered orally, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier.
   The active ingredient may be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule,
   compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. Pharmaceutical
   compositions which are suitable for oral administration include ingestible tablets, buccal
   tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like containing
15 such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. To allow oral administration, it
   may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a
   material to prevent its inactivation.
            In one embodiment, one or more of the compounds used in the present invention
   are administered parenterally.
20          The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used
   herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration,
   usually by injection, and include epidermal, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial,
   intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal,
   intratendinous, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular,
25 subarachnoid, intraspinal, intracranial, intrathoracic, epidural and intrasternal injection
   and infusion.
            In one embodiment, the compound is administered by intravenous or
   subcutaneous injection or infusion.
            In one embodiment the compounds used in the present invention are
30 administered in crystalline form by subcutaneous injection, cf. Yang et al., PNAS USA
    100(12), 6934-6939 (2003).

   pharmaceutical compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and
   may be prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active
   ingredient which may be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage
   form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of
 5 administration. The amount of active ingredient which may be combined with a carrier
   material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the
   composition which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per
   cent, this amount will range from about 0.01% to about 99% of active ingredient, such as
   from about 0.1% to about 70%, for instance from about 1% to about 30%.
10           Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds used in the
   present invention, which may be used in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
   or in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated
   into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those
   of skill in the art. A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that retains the
15 desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired
   toxicological effects (see for instance Berge, S.M. et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66, 1-19 (1977)).
   Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition
   salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric,
   phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous acids and the like, as well as
20 from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl
   substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic
   sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth
   metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from
   nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine,

   buffers. Other carriers are well known in the pharmaceutical arts.
            Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or
   dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable
 5 solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active
   substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is
   incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions
   is contemplated.
            Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials,
10 such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of
   dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
            Pharmaceutical compositions comprises agents used in the present invention
   may also comprise pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants for instance (1) water
   soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate,
15 sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as
   ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT),
   lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents,
   such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid,
   phosphoric acid, and the like.

   solutions.
25          The pharmaceutical compositions used in the present invention may also contain
   one or more adjuvants appropriate for the chosen route of administration such as
   preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, preservatives or
   buffers, which may enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the pharmaceutical
   composition. Compounds of the present invention may for instance be admixed with
30 lactose, sucrose, powders (e.g., starch powder), cellulose esters of alkanoic acids,
   stearic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of
   phosphoric and sulphuric acids, acacia, gelatin, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidine,
   and/or polyvinyl alcohol. Other examples of adjuvants are QS21, GM-CSF, SRL-1 72,
   histamine dihydrochloride, thymocartin, Tio-TEPA, monophosphoryl-lipid A/micobacteria

   (ISCOMs), gerbu adjuvant, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, lipopolysaccharide, and
   polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid.
 5          Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization
   procedures and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for
   example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. In addition,
   prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the
   inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
10          Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention
   may also include a suitable salt therefore. Any suitable salt, such as an alkaline earth
   metal salt in any suitable form (e.g., a buffer salt), may be used in the stabilization of the
   compound used in the present invention. Suitable salts typically include sodium chloride,
   sodium succinate, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium
15 sulfate, and calcium chloride. In one embodiment, an aluminum salt is used to stabilize a
   compound used in the present invention in a pharmaceutical composition, which
   aluminum salt also may serve as an adjuvant when such a composition is administered
   to a patient.
            The compounds used in the present invention may be prepared with carriers that
20 will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release
   formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery
   systems. Such carriers may include gelatin, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl distearate,
   biodegradable, biocompatible polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides,
   polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid alone or with a wax, or
25 other materials well known in the art. Methods for the preparation of such formulations
   are generally known to those skilled in the art. See e.g., Sustained and Controlled
   Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York,
    1978.
            To administer compositions by certain routes of administration, it may be
30 necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to
   prevent its inactivation. For example, the compound used in the method of the invention
   may be administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a
   diluent. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional
   liposomes (Strejan et al., J. Neuroimmunol. 7, 27 (1984)).
                                                     59

           Depending on the route of administration, the active compound may be coated in
   a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions
   that may inactivate the compound. For example, the compound may be administered to
   a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes. Liposomes include
 5 water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Strejan et al., J.
   Neuroimmunol. 7, 27 (1984)).
           In one embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of the present
   invention are formulated in liposomes. In a further embodiment, the liposomes include a
   targeting moiety. In a further embodiment, the compounds in the liposomes are delivered
10 by bolus injection to a site proximal to the desired area, e.g., the site of inflammation or
   infection, or the site of a tumor. The composition must be fluid to the extent that easy
   syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage
   and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as
   bacteria and fungi.
15         In one embodiment, the compounds used in the present invention may be
   formulated to prevent or reduce their transport across the placenta. This may be done by
   methods known in the art, e.g., by PEGylation of the compounds or by use of F(ab') 2
   fragments. Further references can be made to Cunningham-Rundles C et al., J Immunol
   Methods. 152, 177-190 (1992) and to Landor M., Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 74,
20 279-283 (1995).
           Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for parenteral administration include sterile
   aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
   preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and
   agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any
25 conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in
   the pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds
   may also be incorporated into the compositions.
           Pharmaceutical compositions for injection must typically be sterile and stable
   under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition may be formulated
30 as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug
   concentration. The carrier may be a aqueous or nonaqueous solvent or dispersion
   medium containing for instance water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene
   glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils,
   such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. The proper fluidity
                                                     60

   may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the
   maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of
   surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example,
   sugars, polyalcohols such as glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the
 5 composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions may be brought about
   by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example,
   monostearate salts and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions may be prepared by
   incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with
   one or a combination of ingredients e.g. as enumerated above, as required, followed by
10 sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the
   active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the
   required other ingredients e.g. from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile
   powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, examples of methods of
   preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of
15 the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile
   filtered solution thereof.

15 Dosages and treatment regimens
             Treatment according to the present invention includes a "therapeutically effective
   amount" of the medicaments used. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an
   amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired
   therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount may vary according to factors such
20 as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the
   medicaments to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective
   amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody
   portion are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. In the context of the
   present combination therapy, a therapeutic amount includes amounts that are
25 therapeutically effective only in combination with the other compounds, e.g. amounts
   that would be too low to be effective in monotherapy.
            A "therapeutically effective amount" for tumor therapy may also be measured by
   its ability to stabilize the progression of disease. The ability of a compound to inhibit
   cancer may be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human
30 tumors. Alternatively, this property of a composition may be evaluated by examining the
   ability of the compound to inhibit cell growth or to induce apoptosis by in vitro assays
   known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic
   compound may decrease tumor size, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a subject.
   One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such
                                                      64

   factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular
   composition or route of administration selected.
           Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a
   therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided
 5 doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or
   increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Parenteral
   compositions may be formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and
   uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units
   suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a
10 predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired
   therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The
   specification for the dosage unit forms of the present invention are dictated by and
   directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the
   particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of
15 compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.
           The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the anti-CD38 antibodies
   used in the present invention depend on the disease or condition to be treated and may
   be determined by the persons skilled in the art. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a
   therapeutically effective amount of an anti-CD38 antibody used in the present invention
20 is about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-50 mg/kg, for example about 0.1-20 mg/kg,
   such as about 0.1-10 mg/kg, for instance about 0.5, about such as 0.3, about 1, or about
   3 mg/kg. In another embodiment, he antibody is administered in a dose of 1 mg/kg or
   more, such as a dose of from 1 to 20 mg/kg, e.g. a dose of from 5 to 20 mg/kg, e.g. a
   dose of 8 mg/kg.
25         A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art may readily determine
   and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For
   example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the medicament employed in
   the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the
   desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is
30 achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a composition of the present invention will
   be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a
   therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors
   described above. Administration may be intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or
   subcutaneous, and for instance administered proximal to the site of the target. If desired,
                                                     65

   the effective daily dose of a pharmaceutical composition may be administered as two,
   three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals
   throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. While it is possible for a compound
   of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the
 5 compound as a pharmaceutical composition as described above.

   thereof. Cell lysates may also be useful in such methods and compositions. Cellular
   "vaccines" in clinical trials that may be useful in such aspects include Canvaxin TM,
   APC-8015 (Dendreon), HSPPC-96 (Antigenics), and Melacine@ cell lysates. Antigens
   shed from cancer cells, and mixtures thereof (see for instance Bystryn et al., Clinical
 5 Cancer Research Vol. 7, 1882-1887, July 2001), optionally admixed with adjuvants such
   as alum, may also be components in such methods and combination compositions.
            In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
   the application of an internal vaccination method. Internal vaccination refers to induced
   tumor or cancer cell death, such as drug-induced or radiation-induced cell death of tumor
10 cells, in a patient, that typically leads to elicitation of an immune response directed
   towards (i) the tumor cells as a whole or (ii) parts of the tumor cells including (a) secreted
   proteins, glycoproteins or other products, (b) membrane-associated proteins or
   glycoproteins or other components associated with or inserted in membranes, and/or (c)
   intracellular proteins or other intracellular components. An internal vaccination-induced
15 immune response may be humoral (i.e. antibody - complement-mediated) or cell
   mediated (e.g., the development and/or increase of endogenous cytotoxic T
   lymphocytes that recognize the internally killed tumor cells or parts thereof).
            In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
   administration of complement. Accordingly, the use of compositions comprising anti
20 CD38 antibodies with serum or complement is also within the scope of the present
   invention. In these compositions the complement is located in close proximity to the anti
   CD38 antibody, for instance by conjugation or may be suited for simultaneous
   administration. Alternatively, the anti-CD38 antibodies and the complement or serum
   may be administered separately.
25          In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
   administration of differentiation inducing agents, retinoic acid and retinoic acid analogues

   @1, inhibitors of VCAM or similar agents
            In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
10 administration of calcineurin-inhibitors (such as valspodar, PSC 833 and other MDR-1 or
   p-glycoprotein inhibitors), TOR-inhibitors (such as sirolimus, everolimus and rapamycin).
   and inhibitors of "lymphocyte homing" mechanisms (such as FTY720), and agents with
   effects on cell signaling such as adhesion molecule inhibitors (for instance anti-LFA,
   etc.).
15          In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
   radiotherapy.
            Radiotherapy may comprise radiation or associated administration of
   radiopharmaceuticals to a patient is provided. The source of radiation may be either
   external or internal to the patient being treated (radiation treatment may, for example, be
20 in the form of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT) or skeletal
   targeted radiotherapy). Radioactive elements that may be used in practicing such
   methods include, e.g., radium, cesium-137, iridium-192, americium-241, gold-198,
   cobalt-57, copper-67, technetium-99, iodide-1 23, iodide-1 31, and indium-1 11.
            In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
25 autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.
            In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
   orthopedic intervention.
            Orthopedic interventions may be used in the treatment of a disorder involving
   cells expressing CD38, such as multiple myeloma, to help control pain or retain function
30 or mobility. Such interventions may include physical therapy, splinting of bones to
   prevent or treat fractures, or surgical procedures (minor or major) to repair fractures.
            In a further embodiment, the combination therapy of the invention further includes
   delivery of one or more agents that promote access of the CD38 antibody or combination
   composition to the interior of a tumor. Such methods may for example be performed in
                                                     75

   association with the delivery of a relaxin, which is capable of relaxing a tumor (see for
   instance US 6,719,977). In one embodiment, the anti-CD38 antibody used in the present
   invention may be bonded to a cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Cell penetrating peptides
   and related peptides (such as engineered cell penetrating antibodies) are described in
 5 for instance Zhao et al., J Immunol Methods. 254(1-2), 137-45 (2001), Hong et al.,

   EXAMPLES
   EXAMPLE 1
   Manufacturing luciferase-transfected (Daudi-luc) cells
           Culture of Daudi cells (originating from Burkitt's lymphoma) was cultured in RPMI
 5 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Optimum C241, Wisent Inc., St.
   Bruno, QC, Canada), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 1
   mM sodium pyruvate (all derived from Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland).
   Medium was refreshed twice a week. Before transfection, cells were split and seeded out
   at 1-1.5 x 106 cells/ml to ensure viability and optimal growth.
10 Luciferase transfection
           8.2 x 106 CD38' Daudi cells were taken up in 350 pl RPMI (supplemented with
   10% dFCS, Gibco BRL) and transferred to an electroporation cuvet (Biorad, Hemel
   Hempstead, Herts, UK). Then, 40 pg gWIZ luciferase from GTS (Aldevron, Fargo, ND,
   USA) and 10 pg pPur vector (BD Biosciences, Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands), which
15 confers puromycin resistance, were added. After resting cells on ice for 10 minutes, cells
   were electroporated (250 V, 950 pF; Gene Pulser II, Biorad Laboratories GmbH,
   MOnchen, Germany). Cells were again rested on ice, and taken up in 40 ml RPMI
   (supplemented with 10% FCS). Then, cells were plated out in 96-well tissue culture
   plates (100 pl per well). After 48 hours, puromycin (final concentration: 1 pg/ml; Sigma
20 Aldrich Chemie BV, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) was added. Puromycin-resistant
   clones were further grown in 24-well tissue culture plates.
   Determination of luciferase activity
           Luciferase activity of cells was determined using the Luciferase Assay System
   (#E4030, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). 1x105 cells were centrifuged (13.500 rpm, 1
25 min) in an eppendorf centrifuge, and the pellet was washed in 100 pl PBS. After
   centrifugation (13.500 rpm, 1 min), pellet was lysed with 20 pl Reporter Lysis Buffer
   (Promega), frozen and thawed. After centrifugation (13,500 rpm, 1 min), 20 pl
   supernatant was discarded, and 100 pl luciferase assay reagent was added (in special
   luminometer tubes, Promega). Luminescence was measured (10 sec) in a luminometer
30 (LB9507, Berthold, Vilvoorde, Belgium).

   EXAMPLE 2
   Immunization of mice and generation of hybridomas
            Immunization protocol for -003
            HCo12 mice were immunized every fortnight with 20 pg purified HA-CD38. The
 5 first immunization was performed i.p. in the presence of 100 pl PBS, mixed with 100 pl
   Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). After this first immunization, subsequent boosts
   (13x) with purified HA-CD38 were performed in the presence of 100 pl PBS, mixed with
    100 pl Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) alternating s.c. and i.p. After titer
   development, mice were boosted with 20 pg HA-CD38 in PBS, i.v.
10          Immunization protocol for -005 and -024
            HCo12 mice were immunized every fortnight with 20 pg purified HA-CD38
   alternating with NIH-3T3-CD38 transfected cells. The first immunization was performed
   with 5 x 106 cells in 100 pl PBS, mixed with 100 pl CFA, i.p., the second and following
   immunizations with HA-CD38 s.c., in the presence of 100 pl PBS, mixed with 100 pl IFA.
15 The following immunizations with transfected cells were performed in the presence of
   200 pl PBS. After titer development, mice were boosted with 20 pg HA-CD38 in PBS, i.v.
            Generation of Hybridomas Producing Human Monoclonal Antibodies to CD38
            The mouse splenocytes were isolated from HCo12 mice and fused with PEG to a
   mouse myeloma cell line based upon standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas were
20 then screened for human antibody production by ELISA and for CD38 specificity using
   human CD38-transfected NS/0 cells by FACS analysis and recombinant HA-CD38
   protein binding by ELISA. Three hybridoma cell lines were selected expressing the
   human monoclonal anti-CD38 antibodies, -003, -005 and -024, respectively.
   EXAMPLE 3
25 Transfection of NIH cells with CD38
            The vector (pclpuroCD38) for producing NIH-3T3-CD38 cells was obtained from
   Prof. M. Glennie (Tenovus Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital,
   Southampton, UK). NIH-3T3 cells (DSMZ, ACC 59; 150,000 cells/well; 0.5 ml; 96-well
   flat-bottom plates, Greiner) were cultured in DMEM (supplemented with glucose [4.5 g/l],
30  10% FCS, L-glutamine, Na-pyruvate; BioWhittaker) for 24 h. Then, DNA (0.8 pg) and
   lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) were diluted in DMEM, and mixed
   (20 min, RT). Thereafter, the mixture (100 pl) was added to each well and incubated
   (ON, 370C).
                                                   79

   Screening for CD38 expression
            NIH-3T3-CD38 cells were washed (in 1 ml PBS) and trypsinized (200 pl, trypsin
   EDTA, BioWhittaker). Then, 1 ml of DMEM was added and the mixture pipetted into
   FACS tubes. After centrifugation (1200 rpm, 5 min), cells were washed in FACS Buffer
 5 (FB; PBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.02% NaN 3 ) and resuspended in 1 ml FB. After centrifugation
   (1200 rpm, 5 min), supernatant was removed and mouse anti-human CD38-PE was
   added (1/50 dilution, Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). After washing the cells
   twice in FB, cells were resuspended in FB for acquisition by flow cytometry.
   Expansion and selection
10          After trypsine treatment, cells were transferred to T25 flasks (Greiner) in DMEM
   (supplemented with glucose 4.5 g/l, 2 mM L-glutamine, and puromycin (2 pg/ml)
   BioWhittaker). Puromycin-resistant cells were tested for stable CD38 expression by flow
   cytometry after two weeks on puromycin-containing medium. NIH-3T3-CD38 selected
   cells were subcloned by limiting dilution. After expanding these cells, all 15 NIH-3T3
15 CD38 clones were screened for CD38 expression. CD38high NIH-3T3-CD38 cells were
   frozen in liquid nitrogen (-800C) until use.
   Culture of NIH-3T3-CD38 cells
            Cells are cultured in DMEM (supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/I), 10% FCS, 2
   mM L-glutamine, Na-pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin). Cells are passaged twice a week
20 by use of trypsin/EDTA and seeded in a concentration of 1x106 cells/T75 flask.
   CD38high NIH-3T3-CD38 cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen (-80 0 C) until use.
   Purification of HA-CD38 antigen
            Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) was coupled with anti
   CD38 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK). Column (column tube HR5/20 was packed to 12
25 cm bedheight, column volume 2.4 ml; maximum flow rate 0.5 ml/min) was equilibrated
   with at least 5 column volumes (CV) of PBS. Sample was filtrated and loaded to the
   column. Column was washed with PBS until signal returned to baseline (approximately 3
   CV). Elution was carried out with 0.1M glycine at pH 2. Eluted fractions were neutralized
   with 1% (v/v) 2 M Tris-HCI, pH 9.
30 Purification of anti-CD38 antibodies
            Human anti-CD38 antibodies were purified from tissue culture supernatants.
   First, the supernatants were filtered over 0.20 pM dead-end filter. Then, the supernatant
   was loaded on a 5 ml Protein A column (rProtein A FF, Amersham Bioscience) and
   eluted with 0.1 M citric acid-NaOH, pH 3. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 2
                                                     80

   M Tris-HCI, pH 9 and dialyzed O/N to 12.6 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4
   (B. Braun, Oss, The Netherlands). After dialysis samples were sterile filtered over 0.20
   pM dead-end filter.
   Purification of His-CD38 batches
 5         The protein is present in cell culture supernatant of His-CD38-expressing cells,
   with a DNA construct containing the sequence for the extracellular domain of CD38. An
   additional poly-His-tag sequence is included in the constructs and present at the N
   terminus of the protein. This tag enables purification with immobilized metal affinity
   chromatography. In this process, a chelator fixed onto the chromatographic resin is
10 charged with C02+ cations. Particularly, a sequence that includes 6 histidine amino acids
   strongly binds C02+. Therefore the His-tagged CD38 proteins bind strongly to such a
   column, while other proteins present in the culture supernatant will flow through the
   column or will be washed away. The strongly bound His-tagged CD38 proteins are then
   eluted with a buffer containing imidazole, which competes with the binding of His to C02+.
15 When sufficient His-CD38 is purified, the eluent is removed from the protein by buffer
   exchange on a desalting column.
   EXAMPLE 4
   Binding of -003, -005, and -024 to CD38-transfected CHO (CHO-CD38) cells, to Daudi
   luc cells and to fresh multiple mveloma (MM) tumor cells
20         After harvesting and counting, Daudi-luc cells, CHO cells transfected with CD38
   and control CHO cells were resuspended in PBS (1 x 106 cells/ml). Then, cells were put
   in 96-well V-bottom plates (100 pl/well) and washed twice in PBS-BSA (PBS
   supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% Na-azide). Thereafter, 50 pl antibody solution
   in PBS-BSA was added to the cells (40C, 30 min). After washing three times in PBS
25 BSA, 50 pl (1:400 dilution) of rabbit anti-human IgG-FITC in PBS-BSA was added (40C
   in the dark, 30 min). Cells were washed three times and specific binding of CD38
   antibodies to CHO-CD38 and Daudi-luc cells was detected by flow cytometry. HuMab
   KLH (a human monoclonal antibody against KLH (keyhole limpet haemocyanin)
   generated by Genmab B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands by use of the immunization
30 protocols described elsewhere herein) was used as a control. Figures 1 and 2 show that
   -003, -005, and -024 bind to CHO-CD38 cells and to Daudi-luc cells, albeit with different
   EC50 (Table 1). No binding to control CHO cells is observed (data not shown).

           Fresh MM tumor cells were obtained from Dr. Lokhorst (University Medical
   Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Tumor cells were isolated from bone marrow
   of multiple myeloma patients by Ficoll (Bio Whittaker; lymphocyte separation medium,
   cat 17-829E) gradient centrifugation. After harvesting and counting, MM cells (100,000
 5 cells/well) were resuspended with 25 pl FITC-labeled CD38-specific antibodies and 25 pl
   CD138. After incubation (40C, 30 min), cells were washed in PBS-BSA and PE-labeled
   goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd. Soham, UK) was
   added. After incubation (40C, 30 min) and washing of the cells in PBS-BSA,
   fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry.

20 Biosciences Europe GmbH, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) was added, and the mixture
   was incubated in a 37 0 C water bath for 1 hr. After washing of the cells (twice in PBS,
    1500 rpm, 5 min), the cells were resuspended in RPMl* and counted by trypan blue
   exclusion. Cells were brought at concentration of 1x105 cells/ml.
   Preparation of effector cells
25         Fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (healthy volunteers, UMC Utrecht,
   Utrecht, The Netherlands) were isolated from 40 ml of heparin blood by Ficoll (Bio
   Whittaker; lymphocyte separation medium, cat 17-829E) according to the manufacturer's
   instructions. After resuspension of cells in RPMIl*, cells were counted by trypan blue
   exclusion and brought at concentration of 1x107 cells/ml.

   ADCC set up
           50 pl of 5 1Cr-labeled targets cells were pipetted into 96-well plates, and 50 pl of
   antibody was added, diluted in RPMIl* (final concentrations 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 pg/ml). Cells
   were incubated (RT, 15 min), and 50 pl effector cells were added, resulting in an effector
 5 to target ratio of 100:1 (for determination of maximal lysis, 100 pl 5% Triton-X100 was
   added instead of effector cells; for determination of spontaneous lysis, 50 pl target cells
   and 100 pl RPMI++ were used). Cells were spun down (500 rpm, 5 min), and incubated
   (370C, 5% C02, 4 hr). After spinning down cells (1500 rpm, 5 min), 100 pl of supernatant
   was harvested into micronic tubes, and counted in gamma counter. The percentage
10 specific lysis was calculated as follows:
           (cpm sample- cpm target cells only)/(cpm maximal lysis - cpm target cells only)
   wherein cpm is counts per minute.
15         In Daudi-luc cells (Figure 4 and Table 2) -003, -005, and -024 induce lysis by
   ADCC, and -003, and -005 perform slightly better than rituximab (anti-CD20 mAb).
   Interestingly, also when fresh multiple myeloma tumor cells (obtained from Dr. H.
   Lokhorst, UMCU, The Netherlands) are used as target cells, ADCC is induced by -003,
   -005 and -024 (Figure 5A and Table 2).

            Target B-cells (fresh plasma cell leukemia tumor cells, JK6L and AMO-1 B-cell
   lines, obtained from Dr. T. Valerius, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany) were
   labeled with 20 pCi   5 1Cr (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 2 hours. After
 5 extensive washing in RPMI-10, cells were adjusted to 1x105 cells/ml. MNCs (50pl),
   sensitizing antibodies (50 pl), and RPMI-10 (50 pl) were added to round-bottom
   microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany). Assays were
   started by adding fresh plasma cell leukemia tumor cells, JK6L or AMO-1 cells (50 pl)
   giving a final volume of 200 pl. An effector to target (E:T) ratio of 40:1 was used. After
                                                                             51Cr release from
10 incubation (3 hr, 370C), assays were stopped by centrifugation, and
   triplicates was measured in counts per minute (cpm) in a scintillation counter.
   Percentage of cellular cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula:
   % specific lysis = (experimental cpm - basal cpm)/(maximal cpm - basal cpm) x 100
15
   with maximal    51Cr release determined by adding perchloric acid (3% final concentration)
   to target cells, and basal release was measured in the absence of sensitizing antibodies
   and effector cells.
            In both multiple myeloma cell lines (i.e. JK6L and AMO-1), lysis is induced with
20 both -003 and -005 (Figures 6 and 7), even when CD38 expression is low (AMO-1 cell
   line).
            -003, -005 and -024 induce ADCC of plasma cell leukemia primary tumor cells
   (Figure 5B).

25 Complement-dependent cytotoxicity
            After harvesting and counting of Daudi-luc cells, the viability of the cells should
   be > 90%. After washing (PBS), cells are resuspended at 2.0x10 6 cells/ml in RPMI-B
   (RPMI supplemented with 1% BSA). Thereafter, cells are put in 96-well round-bottom
   plates at 1x105 cells/well (50 pl/well). Then, 50 pl antibodies is added to the wells (final
30 concentration range between 0-100 pg/ml (three-fold dilutions in RPMI-B)). After
   incubation (RT, 15 min), 11 pl of pooled human serum (pool of 18 healthy donors) was
   added to each well (371C, 45 min). Wells were resuspended once and 120 pl was
   transferred to FACS tubes (Greiner). Then, 10 pl propidium iodide (Pl; Sigma-Aldrich
                                                      84

   flow cytometry (FACScalibur   TM
                                    , Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA) by
   measurement of the percentage of dead cells (corresponds to PI-positive cells).
           Figure 8 and Table 2 show that lysis of Daudi-luc cells is induced by -005 (-60%
 5 maximum lysis) and that lysis by -003 is only seen at very high antibody concentrations.
   -024 does not induce CDC in Daudi cells (data not shown). In CHO-CD38 cells, lysis is
   induced by both -003, -005, and -024 (Figure 9 and Table 3). Lysis by -003 is induced at
   higher concentrations. In tumor cells (all obtained from Dr. Lokhorst and Dr. Bloem,
   University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands), obtained from different MM
10 patients (A: 3% refractory tumor cells, B: 9% refractory tumor cells, C: 30-40% tumor
   cells, and D: 70% tumor cells), CDC-mediated lysis is observed in the presence of -005,
   but not in the presence of -003 (Figure 10). -024 also induced lysis of MM tumor cells
   (Figure 10E).

   Cross-block studies using FACS
           CHO-CD38 cells were incubated with an excess of unlabelled CD38-specific
   antibody (40C, 15 min). Then, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled CD38-specific
   antibodies (concentration approximates EC90 , 40C, 45 min). After twice washing the cells
20 with PBS-BSA, fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Figure 11 shows that
   unlabelled -003 blocks binding of FITC-labeled -003, whereas binding of FITC-labeled
   -005 is not blocked. Also unlabelled -005 blocks binding of FITC-labeled -005, whereas
   binding of FITC-labeled -003 is not blocked. -003 and -005 bind to different epitopes,
   because they do not compete for binding.

   Cross-blocking studies using ELISA
           Soluble human CD38 is coated on the surface of an ELISA plate. Coated CD38

   and subsequently biotinylated CD38-specific antibodies are added (concentration
   approximates EC90 , RT, 1 hour). After washing three times with PBS/Tween, horseradish
   peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidine is added and the mixture is incubated for 1
   hour at RT. The complex can be detected by addition of an ABTS-solution and the HRP
 5 mediated substrate conversion is measured using an ELISA reader at OD 405 nm.

   biotinylated CD38 is detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidine for 1 hr at RT. This
   complex can be detected by addition of an ABTS-solution (after washing with
   PBS/Tween) and the HRP mediated substrate conversion is measured using an ELISA
   reader at OD 405 nm.

   Reactivity with a panel of human tissues and cross-reactivity with cynomolqus tissue by
   immunohistochemistry
           Sections from frozen human tissue (obtained from Dr. H. Niessen, Free
   University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or monkey tissue (Inveresk
20 Research, Glasgow, Scotland) were cut at 6 pm and air-dried overnight. These cryostat
   sections were fixated in acetone (RT, 10 min) and air-dried (approx. 5 min). Thereafter,
   sections were incubated with 1x citric acid/phosphate buffer containing 0.1% H2 0 2 (pH
   5.8; Sigma), to block endogenous peroxidase. After 20 min at RT, sections were washed
   twice with PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST, RT, 5 min; Riedel de-Haen, Germany).
25 Then, sections were incubated with avidin (RT, 15 min; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark),
   washed twice with PBST, and incubated with biotin (RT, 15 min; DAKO) to block
   endogenous biotin. After washing the sections twice with PBST, sections were pre
   incubated with PBST** (PBST supplemented with 10% normal human serum (NHS,
   CLB, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and 10% normal goat serum (NGS; DAKO) (RT, 20
30 min). After blotting-off of the pre-incubation serum, sections were incubated with FITC
   labeled primary antibody diluted in 2% PBST** at the indicated concentrations (RT, 60
   min). Thereafter, sections were incubated with rabbit-anti-FITC (1:1000; DAKO) in 2%

   with goat-anti-rabbit-biotin (1:400; DAKO) in 2% PBST** (RT, 30 min). Then, sections
   were washed and incubated with SABC-HRP (1:100; DAKO) in 2% PBST** (RT, 30
   min). After washing the sections twice in PBST, they were incubated (RT, 10 min) with
 5 amino-ethyl-carbazole (AEC)-development solution (50 mM acetate buffer, pH4.9, 0.01%
   H20 2 ; Riedel-de-Haen). Finally, sections were washed in millipore H2 0 (5 min) and
   counterstained with hematoxylin (DAKO). By use of glycergel (370C), sections were fixed
   with cover slips, and studied by light microscopy (Axiovision-2; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY,
   USA).
10          Bronchial epithelium is stained with -003 and -005 (Figures 12B and13B) as well
   as striated muscle (myocytes, Figures 12C and 13C), macrophages, lymphocytes and
   plasma B cells (Figures 12A and 13A). -024 has a similar staining of striated muscle and
   bronchial epithelium, but staining was less intense. No staining of endothelial cells is
   observed, neither with -003 (Fig 14D), -005 (14E) nor -024 (data not shown), whereas
15 clear staining was observed with the positive control antibodies against endothelial cell
   markers CD31 (Fig 14A) and vWF (14B). Anti-KLH was used as negative control
   antibody (Fig 14C). -003 (Figure 12D) and -024 (data not shown) but not -005 (Figure
   13D) cross-react with cynomolgus monkey lymphoid tissue.

20 Cross-reactivity with cynomolqus or rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (PBMCs) by flow cytometry
            5 ml of cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood (Inveresk Research) were lysed by
   adding 4.5 ml shock buffer (1.7 mM NH4CL, 1 mM EDTA), 40 ml H2 0 and 450 pl 10%
   KHCO 3. After hemolysis cells were centrifuged (1200 rpm, 10 min) and washed thrice in
25 PBS. After counting cells with trypan blue, cells were resuspended in PBS-BSA (1x 106
   cell/ml).
             17.5 ml of rhesus monkey peripheral blood (BPRC, Rijswijk, The Netherlands)
   was diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1640 and layered on Ficoll (1.077 g/ml; BioWhittaker, cat. 17
   829E, lot no. 0148 32). After centrifugation (710 g, RT, 20 min), the interphase was
30 collected and washed twice in RPMI. After the last wash cells were resuspended in
   RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 1x10 5 cells/50 pl.
            Cells were transferred to 96-well plate (100,000 PBMCs/well), washed in FACS
   buffer (PBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.02% NaN3 ) and incubated with the primary antibodies (4'C,

   30 min). After washing in PBS-BSA, 50 pl FITC-labeled rb-anti-hlgG (DAKO, Glostrup,
   Denmark) was added (40C, 30 min). Finally, cells were collected in FACS tubes in a total
   volume of 150 pl. Samples were measured and analyzed by use of FACScalibur TM
   (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA).
 5          With flow cytometry cross-reactivity of -003 on cynomolgus lymphocytes (Figure
   15A) and monocytes (Figure 15B) was shown, but not of -005. Also in rhesus monkeys,
   cross-reactivity of -003 was observed on mononuclear cells, but not of -005 (Figure
   15C).
   EXAMPLE 12
10 Internalization experiments
            CHO-CD38 cells were stained with a saturating concentration of FITC-labeled
   CD38-specific antibodies (on ice, 30 min). After washing of cells (in RPMI1640
   supplemented with 10% FCS), one cell pool was warmed up to 370C to allow
   internalization, and the other pool was left on ice. At several time intervals (0-120 min)
15 cell aliquots were taken and transferred to ice-cold PBS-BSA to stop internalization. After
   washing samples twice with PBS-BSA, EtBr (diluted in PBS-BSA, final concentration 2
   mg/ml) was added to the samples to quench membrane-bound FITC. Fluorescence was
   measured by flow cytometry.
            Figure 16A and 16B show that -003 and -005 are internalized by CHO-CD38
20 cells within 5 minutes at 370C.
   EXAMPLE 13
   In vivo SCID-luciferase experiments
            In this model tumor cells are transfected with firefly luciferase. Upon
   administration of luciferin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) to the mice the
25 labeled cells can be detected in vivo by bioluminescent imaging using a highly sensitive
   CCD camera, cf. Wetterwald et al., American Journal of Pathology 160(3), 1143-1153
   (2002).
            Daudi cells were transfected with gWIZ luciferase from Gene Therapy Systems
   (San Diego, CA) and cultured in RPMI with 10% FCS, Pen/Strep, Sodium Pyruvate and
30 1 ptg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cells were analysed for luciferase expression (expressed in
   RLU/1 x 105 cells) in a luminometer and for CD38 expression by FACS. 2.5 x 106
   luciferase-transfected Daudi cells/mouse were injected i.v. into SCID mice. Mice were
                                                     88

   treated with -003, -005, isotype control antibody (HuMab-KLH) or rituximab (anti-CD20
   antibody). Antibodies were injected intraperitoneally. Four treatment settings were used
   (see Table 4). In the preventive setting, antibody (100 pg/mouse) and cells were
   administered simultaneously. In therapeutic setting I, antibody (300 pg/mouse) was
 5 administered 7 days after administration of cells. In therapeutic setting II, antibody (10
   pg/mouse) was administered 14 days after administration of cells. In therapeutic setting
   Ill, antibody (100 pg/mouse) was administered 7 days after administration of cells. For
   imaging, mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine/xylazine
   /atropine. Synthetic D-Luciferin (sodium salt, Molecular Probes) was given i.p. at a dose
10 of 25 mg/ml. Mice were then placed in a light tight box and after 3 min, imaging was
   started using a VersArray 1300B liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector (Roper Scientific).
   Photons emitted from the luciferase were counted over an exposure period of 5 min.
   Under illumination black and white images were made for reference. MetaVue software
   (Universal Imaging Corp) was used for data collection and image analysis. Statistical
15 significance of differences between groups was established using one-way analysis of
   variance with a Newman-Keuls post test using GraphPad PRISM version 3.02
   (Graphpad Software Inc).

   Apoptosis
            Apoptosis assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions
   (Annexin-V Apoptosis kit, BD Biosciences, Alphen a.d. Rijn, Netherlands). In short,
 5 CD38 mAbs were added to 2.5 x 10 5 cells (luciferase-transfected Daudi cells, in 0.5 ml
   RPMl** in a 24-wells plate), in a concentration of 5 pg/ml -003 or -005 or an anti-CD20
   antibodies alone or in the presence of cross-blocking rb-anti-hlgG (50 pg/ml).
            After incubation (370C, 5% C02, 20 hr), cells were harvested carefully, and
   washed with Binding Buffer (1200 rpm, 40C, 5 min, BD Biosciences). Pellet was
10 resuspended in 100 pl Binding Buffer. Then, 5 pl Annexin-V-FITC (BD Biosciences) and
    10 pl PI (BD Biosciences) was added to the suspension and incubated for 15 minutes at
   RT. 400 pl Binding Buffer was added and the samples were measured (PI readout in
   FL2). For analysis of apoptotic cells, all Annexin-V-positive cells were counted by flow
   cytometry using a FACScalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest pro software (BD
15 Biosciences). At least 10,000 events were collected for analysis. This population
   includes both PI-positive as well as PI-negative cells.
            Figure 18 shows that -003 and -005 do not induce apoptosis. However, after
   cross-linking, apoptosis of target cells is observed. -003 induced apoptosis after cross
   linking that was similar to apoptosis induced by an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab). -005
20 was less able to induce apoptosis after cross-linking. Similar results were obtained with
   RAMOS cells as target cells (data not shown).

   chow and water ad libitum. Prior to implantation, mice (three mice in each experimental
   group, day 0) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (NIMATEK,
30 EuroVet) and xylazine (Rompun, Bayer) at ratio 1:1. A small incision of the skin was
   made using surgical scissors. Inflamed synovial tissue from a patient with rheumatoid
   arthritis undergoing joint replacement surgery was implanted subcutaneously as a
   cluster of six small fragments (total 2-3 mm3) on each flank of the mouse. The wound
                                                     90

   was closed using Permacol cyanoacrylate glue. On day 1 of the experiment, remaining
   synovial tissue was analyzed in order to check for B cells in the inflamed synovial
   transplants. -005 (12 mg/kg) or control antibody (anti-KLH, 30 mg/kg) was injected (i.v.),
   in a volume of 200 pl on day 8 of the experiment. At the end of the experiment (day 14)
 5 mice were sacrificed by C02 inhalation and the synovial grafts were explanted. One of
   the grafts was snap-frozen in OCT compound (TissueTek, Sacura Finetek Europe) for
   further immunhistochemical analysis, and another one was frozen by immersion in liquid
   nitrogen for further RNA analysis.
            Immunohistochemistry
10          5 pM cryosections on SuperFrost (Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig) slides were
   prepared using LEICA CM1900 cryostate and stored at -800C. Thawed sections were
   fixed in acetone for 10 min, dried at room temperature and washed 3 x 5 min in PBS. All
   steps were performed at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
   blocked by incubation with PBS supplemented with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1%
15 sodium azide for 20 min. Slides were washed 3 x 5 min in PBS and incubated with 10%
   normal human serum (NHS) / 10% normal rabbit serum (NRbS) in PBS / 1% BSA for 30
   min. Next, primary antibody (mouse mAb) diluted in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA /
    10% NHS / 10% NRbS was incubated for 60 min. After 3 x 2 min washes in PBS, HRP
   conjugate (goat anti-mouse Ig-HRP; DAKO P0447) diluted 1:50 in PBS (supplemented
20 with 1% BSA / 10% NHS / 10% NRbS) was added for 30 min. Peroxidase signal was
   enhanced using TSA TM Biotin system (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, NEL700). Slides were
   washed 3 x 2 min in PBS and incubated with biotinyl tyramide diluted 1:1600 in
   amplification buffer for 30 min. After 3 x 2 min washes in PBS, streptavidin-HRP diluted
    1:400 in PBS (supplemented with 1% BSA) was added for 30 min. Slides were washed 3
25 x 2 min in PBS and incubated with DAB solution (DAKO Cytomation K3465) for 5 min.
   Color reaction was stopped with distilled water. Finally, slides were counterstained with
   hematoxyline (MERCK), washed with running water and covered with Kaiser's glycerin
   and cover slips.
            Scoring of staining intensity
30          Scoring of stained synovial tissue xenografts was performed in a blinded fashion
   by two trained persons. First the strongest section was selected from a series of sections
   and this reference section was awarded the maximum score 8. The staining intensity in
   the other sections was then scored on a scale of 0 to 8, relative to the reference section.
            Statistical analysis
                                                     91

            Scoring of staining intensity was analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA
   followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test using Graph Pad Prism version 4.01 (Graph
   Pad software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
            Figure 19 and Figure 21 show that the numbers of anti-CD38-positive plasma
 5 cells are reduced after treatment with -005. Staining of plasma cells with anti-CD138
   confirms that -005 results in reduced numbers of plasma cells (Figures 20 and 22).

   EXAMPLE 17
   Epitope mapping using site directed mutagenesis
           Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and quantified by Isogen Bioscience
   (Maarssen, The Netherlands). Primers were dissolved in H2 0 to 100 pmol/pl and stored
 5 at -20C. A summary of all PCR and sequencing primers is shown in Table 6. For PCR,
   PfuTurbo@ Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was
   used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction mix contained 200 pM
   mixed dNTPs (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands), 10 pmol of both the
   forward and reverse primer, 100 ng of genomic DNA or 1 ng of plasmid DNA and 1 unit
10 of PfuTurbo@ Hotstart DNA polymerase in PCR reaction buffer (supplied with
   polymerase) in a total volume of 20 pl. PCR reactions were carried out with a TGradient
   Thermocycler 96 (Whatman Biometra, Goettingen, Germany) using a 32-cycle program:
   denaturing at 950C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 950C for 30 sec, a 60-700C gradient (or
   another specific annealing temperature) for 30 sec, and 720C for 3 min; final extension at
15 72'C for 10 min. If appropriate, the PCR mixtures were stored at 4'C until further
   analysis or processing.
           Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed according to Sambrook (Sambrook,
   Russell et al. 2000) using gels of 50 ml, in 1 x Tris Acetate EDTA buffer. DNA was
   visualized by the inclusion of ethidium bromide in the gel and observation under UV light.
20 Gel images were recorded by a CCD camera and an image analysis system
   (GeneGnome; Syngene, via Westburg B.V., Leusden, The Netherlands).
           Purification of desired PCR fragments was carried out using a MinElute PCR
   Purification Kit (Qiagen, via Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands; product# 28006),
   according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated DNA was quantified by UV
25 spectroscopy (see below) and the quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
           Alternatively, PCR or digestion products were separated by agarose gel
   electrophoresis (for instance when multiple fragments were present) using a 1% Tris
   Acetate EDTA agarose gel. The desired fragment was excised from the gel and
   recovered using the QIAEX     || Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen; product# 20051), according to
30 the manufacturer's instructions.
           Optical density of nucleic acids was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1 000
   Spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Science, Maarssen, The Netherlands) according to the
   manufacturer's instructions. The DNA concentration was measured by analysis of the
                                                      96

   optical density (OD) at 260 nm (one   OD 26onm  unit = 50 pg/ml). For all samples, the buffer
   in which the nucleic acids were dissolved was used as a reference.
           Restriction enzymes and supplements were obtained from New England Biolabs
   (Beverly, MA, USA) or Fermetas (Vilnius, Lithuania) and used according to the
 5 manufacturer's instructions. DNA (100 ng) was digested with 5 units of enzyme(s) in the
   appropriate buffer in a final volume of 10 pl (reaction volumes were scaled up as
   appropriate). Digestions were incubated at the recommended temperature for a
   minimum of 60 min. For fragments requiring double digestions with restriction enzymes
   which involve incompatible buffers or temperature requirements, digestions were
10 performed sequentially. If necessary digestion products were purified by agarose gel
   electrophoresis and gel extraction.
           Ligations of DNA fragments were performed with the Quick Ligation Kit (New
   England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each ligation, vector
   DNA was mixed with approximately three-fold molar excess of insert DNA.
15         Plasmid DNA (1-5 pl of DNA solution, typically 2 pl of DNA ligation mix) was
   transformed into One Shot DH5a-T1R E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands;
   product# 12297-016) using the heat-shock method, according to the manufacturer's
   instructions. Next, cells were plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50
   pg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated for 16-18 h at 370C until bacterial colonies
20 became evident.
           Bacterial colonies were screened for the presence of vectors containing the
   desired sequences via colony PCR using the ThermoStart PCR Master Mix (Abgene, via
   Wetsburg, Leusden, The Netherlands; product# AB-938-DC15/b) and primers
   pConGiseq1 and pEE13.4seqrev2 (Table 6). Selected colonies were lightly touched
25 with a 20 pl pipette tip and touched briefly in 2 ml LB for small scale culture, and then
   resuspended in the PCR mix. PCR was performed with a TGradient Thermocycler 96
   using a 35-cycle program: denaturation at 950C for 15 min; 35 cycles of 940C for 30 sec,
   550C for 30 sec and 720C for 2 min; followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 720C.
   If appropriate, the PCR mixtures were stored at 40C until analysis by agarose gel
30 electrophoresis.
           Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli cultures using the following kits from
   Qiagen (via Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's
   instructions. For bulk plasmid preparation (50-150 ml culture), either a HiSpeed Plasmid
   Maxi Kit (product# 12663) or a HiSpeed Plasmid Midi Kit (product# 12643) was used.
                                                     97

   For small scale plasmid preparation ( 2 ml culture) a Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit
   (product# 27106) was used and DNA was eluted in 50 pl elution buffer (supplied with
   kit).
            Construction of HA-CD38 expression vector pEE13.4HACD38
 5          The extracellular domain of human CD38 was amplified from plasmid
   pClpuroCD38 (obtained from Prof. M. Glennie, Tenovus Research Laboratory,
   Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK) using primers cd38forha and
   cd38exrev. By this PCR reaction an HA-tag was introduced. This PCR product was used
   as template for a second PCR reaction with primers SPHMM38ex and cd38exrev. By
10 this PCR reaction, signal peptide SPHMM, restriction sites and an ideal Kozak sequence
   (GCCGCCACC) for optimal expression were introduced. After purification, this PCR
   fragment was cloned into expression vector pEE13.4 (Lonza Biologics) and the complete
   coding sequence was confirmed by sequencing with primers pConKseql,
   pEE13.4seqrev, cd38seq1for and cd38seq2rev (Table 6). This construct was named
15 pEE13.4HACD38
            Site-directed mutagenesis
            Three single mutant proteins of huCD38 was constructed, in which T was
   mutated to A at position 237 (T237A, SEQ ID No:32), Q was mutated to R at position
   272 (Q272R, SEQ ID No:33), or S was mutated to F at position 274 (S274F, SEQ ID
20 No:34). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange           || XL Site
   Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) according to the
   manufacturer's instructions. This method included the introduction of a silent extra
   restriction site or loss of a restriction site to screen for successful mutagenesis (extra
   Xbal site for T237A mutant, extra Bcgl site for Q272R mutant and loss of Sspl site for
25 S274F mutant). Briefly, 5 pl 10x reaction buffer, 1 pl oligonucleotide HACD38T237Afor2,
   HACD38Q272Rfor or HACD38S274Ffor (100 pmol/ pl), 1 pl oligonucleotide

   mix, 3 pl Quicksolution, 1 pl plasmid pEE13.4HACD38 (50 ng/pl) and 1 pl PfuUltra HF
   DNA polymerase were mixed in a total volume of 50 pl and amplified with a TGradient
30 Thermocycler 96 (Whatman Biometra, Goettingen, Germany; product# 050-801) using
   an 18-cycle program: denaturing at 950C for 1 min; 18 cycles of 950C for 50 sec, 600C
   for 50 sec, and 680C for 10 min. PCR mixtures were stored at 40C until further
   processing. Next, PCR mixtures were incubated with 1 pl Dpnl for 60 min at 370C to
   digest the pEE13.4HACD38 WT vector and stored at 40C until further processing. The
                                                         98

   reaction mixture was precipitated with 5 pl 3 M NaAc and 125 pl ethanol, incubated for
   20 minutes at -200C and spun down for 20 minutes at 40C at 14000xg. The DNA pellet
   was washed with 70% ethanol, dried and dissolved in 4 pl water. The total 4 pl reaction
   volume was transformed in One Shot Top 1ODH5a T1R competent E. coli cells
 5 (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions
   (Invitrogen). Next, cells were plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50
   pg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated for 16-18 h at 370C until bacterial colonies
   became evident. Colonies were screened by colony PCR using primers pConG1seq1
   and pEE13.4seqrev2 (Table 5) and digested with the relevant restriction enzymes to
10 screen for incorporation of the mutagenic oligonucleotide. 2 positive clones for each
   mutant were grown and plasmid DNA was isolated. The complete HACD38 coding
   sequence was determined using primers cd38seq1for, pConG1seq1 and
   pEE13.4seqrev2 to confirm the presence of the mutations and the absence of additional
   undesirable mutations.
15          DNA sequencing
            Plasmid DNA samples were sent to AGOWA (Berlin, Germany) for sequence
   analysis. Sequences were analyzed using Vector NTI advanced software (Informax,
   Oxford, UK).
            Transient expression in HEK-293F cells
20          Freestyle TM 293-F (a HEK-293 subclone adapted to suspension growth and
   chemically defined Freestyle medium, (HEK-293F)) cells were obtained from Invitrogen
   and transfected with pEE13.4HACD38 and with the three constructs carrying the
   mutations T237A, Q272R and S274F, according to the manufacturer's protocol using
   293fectin (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants of transfected cells were used in ELISA for
25 anti-CD38 binding studies.
           Anti-CD38 antibody binding
            ELISA plates (Greiner, # 655092) were coated O/N at 40 C with 1 pg anti-HA
   antibody (Sigma, # H-9658) and subsequently blocked with 2% chicken serum. Culture
   supernatants of transfected HEK293F cells were diluted, applied to the ELISA plates and
30 incubated for 1 hr at RT. After washing, serial dilutions of HuMabs -003 and -005 were
   added and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP
   conjugated goat-anti-human IgG antibodies. The assay was developed with ABTS
   (Roche, # 1112597) and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a
   spectrophotometer.
                                                    99

            As can been seen from Figures 23A-23C, both -003 and -005 bind to wt human
   CD38. The binding of -003 was not affected by the introduction of mutations T237A
   (Figure 23A), Q272R (Figure 23B) or S274F (Figure 23C). -005 was able to bind CD38
   harboring mutation T237A (Figure 23A). Binding of -005 to CD38 with mutation Q272R
 5 was severely affected (Figure 23B), both with respect to EC50 and maximum binding
   capacity. -005 was not able to bind to mutant CD38 wherein serine at position 274 was
   replaced by phenylalanine (Figure 23C).
            These data shows that -003 and -005 bind to different epitopes. Furthermore
   these studies revealed that binding of -005 to CD38 is sensitive to mutations at positions
10 272 and 274. Particularly S274 is essential for -005 binding to CD38.

   Induction of proliferation of PBMC
15          -003, -005 and -024 were tested in an assay essentially as described in Ausiello
   et al., Tissue antigens 56, 538-547 (2000). Briefly, PBMCs from healthy donors were
   cultured at 1x105 cells/well in flat bottom 96-well plates in the presence of antibodies
                                                    100

   (final concentration: 1.1 - 3.3 - 10 - 30 pg/ml) in 200 pl RPMIl*. Stimulation of cells with
   IL-15 (at 333 ng/ml; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was used as positive
   control. After a 4 day incubation at 370C, 30 pI 3H-thymidine (16.7 pCi/ml) was added,
   and culture was continued O/N.     3 H-thymidine incorporation was assessed using a
 5 Packard Cobra gamma counter (Packard Instruments, Meriden, DT, USA), according to
   the manufacturer's instructions. Data are shown as the mean cpm ( SEM) of PBMCs
   obtained from 10 donors. The results show that -003 and -005 do not induce significant
   proliferation of PBMCs (Figure 24A). Also -024 did not induce significant proliferation of
   PBMCs (data not shown).

   Induction of IL-6
            -003, -005 and -024 were tested in an assay as described in Ausiello et al.,
   Tissue antigens 56, 538-547 (2000). Briefly, PBMCs were cultured at 1x106 cells/well in
   48-well plates in the presence of 20 pg/ml of antibodies and 10 ng/ml LPS (Sigma
15 Aldrich Chemie, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) in 500 pl RPMI*. After an O/N
   incubation at 37 0 C, supernatant was harvested and stored at -20 0 C. The IL-6
   concentration was assessed by ELISA (IL-6 ELISA kit, U-CyTech Biosciences, Utrecht,
   The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are shown mean
   concentration in pg/ml ( SEM) from 7 donors. The results show that -003 and -005 does
20 not induce release of significant IL-6 levels (Figure 24B). Also -024 did not induce
   release of significant IL-6 levels (data not shown).

            -003, -005 and -024 were tested in an assay as described in Ausiello et al.,
25 Tissue antigens 56, 538-547 (2000). Briefly, PBMCs were cultured at 1x106 cells/well in
   48-well plates in the presence of 20 pg/ml of antibodies and 1 pg/ml OKT-3 (Sanquin,
   Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in 500 pl RPMIl*. After an O/N incubation at 37 0 C,
   supernatant was harvested and stored at -20 0 C. The IFN-y concentration was assessed
   by ELISA (IFN-y ELISA kit, U-CyTech Biosciences, Utrecht, The Netherlands) according
30 to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are shown mean concentration in pg/ml ( SEM)
   from 9 donors. The results show that -003 and -005 does not induce release of

   Affinity of binding of -003 and -005 to recombinant CD38
 5          Binding of -003 and -005 to CD38 was tested using surface plasmon resonance.
   Briefly, purified antibodies were immobilized on a CM-5 sensor chip (Biacore, Uppsala,
   Sweden) via anime coupling. HA-tagged CD38 (see Example 3) was flowed over, and
   the binding of antigen to mAb was detected by a change in refractive index at the
   surface of the chip using a Biacore 3000 (Biacore). The associated and rate constants
10 for -003 (Table 7) and -005 (Table 8) are summarized below, mean of 3 experiments
   SD, and show that both -003 and -005 have a high affinity for CD38.

   Epitope mapping
            Epitope mapping using PEPSCAN method
   According to known procedures (Geysen et al. 1984. Use of peptide synthesis to probe
   viral antigens for epitopes to a resolution of a single amino acid. Proc NatlAcad Sci USA
20 81:3998; Slootstra et al. 1996. Structural aspects of antibody-antigen interaction

   mer looped peptides were synthesized covering 138 amino acids at the C-terminus of
   human CD38. Furthermore, based on the sequence at the C-terminus single-looped
   peptides        of       different    size       were       made        covering     region
   KNIYRPDKFLQCVKNPEDSSCTSEI,                 region    CVHNLQPEKVQTLEAWVIHGG,             and
 5 region CLESIISKRNIQFSAKNIYRC. In addition, extra sets were designed to reconstruct
   double-looped       regions     that were     composed     of    SKRNIQFSCKNIYR         and
   EKVQTLEAWVIHGG.           Native cysteines were replaced by alanines. Peptides were
   screened in an ELISA-assay using credit-card format mini-PEPSCAN cards.
           Synthesis of peptides
10         The peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc-chemistry and deprotected
   using TFA with scavengers. Subsequently, the deprotected peptides were reacted on
   the microarray with an 0.5 mM solution of 2,6-bis(bromomethyl)pyridine or 2,4,6
   tris(bromomethyl)mesitylene in ammonium bicarbonate (20 mM, pH 7.9), supplemented
   with acetonitrile (1:1 [volume/volume]). The microarrays were gently shaken in the
15 solution for 30-60 min, while completely covered in the solution. Finally, the microarrays
   were washed extensively with excess of Millipore H2 0 and sonicated in disrupt-buffer
   containing 1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 0.1% @-mercaptoethanol, in PBS (pH 7.2) at 700C
   for 30 min, followed by sonication in millipore H2 0 for another 45 min.
           PEPSCAN ELISA-assay
20         The 455-well credit card-format polyethylene cards, containing the covalently
   linked peptides, were incubated with serum (e.g. diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution
   which contains 5% horse serum [volume/volume] and 5% ovalbumin [weight/volume])
   (40C, overnight). After washing, the peptides were incubated with rabbit- anti-human Ig
   peroxidase (dilution 1:1000, 250C, 1 hour), and after washing the peroxidase substrate
25 (2,2'-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate and 2 pl/ml 3% H2 0 2 ) was added. After one
   hour, the color development was measured with a CCD-camera and an image
   processing system. The set up consists of a CCD-camera with a 55 mm lens (Sony
   CCD Video Camera XC-77RR, Nikon micro-nikkor 55 mm f/2.8 lens), a camera adaptor
   (Sony Camera adaptor DC-77RR) and the Image Processing Software package
30 Optimas, version 6.5 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD 20910, U.S.A.; Optimas
   runs on a pentium    || computer system).
           Method for epitope representation
           Individual amino acids were identified by dipeptide motifs which represent the
   smallest unique units in the human CD38 amino acid sequence. All dipeptide motifs
                                                     103

   present in each of the 1164 peptides tested were awarded the ELISA value obtained for
   the respective whole peptide. To rank the dipeptide motifs from strong to poor binding, a
   relative signal was calculated by dividing the ELISA value obtained for each individual
   motif by the average ELISA value from all 1164 tested linear and looped peptides, and
 5 these were sorted for decreasing values. In this manner, amino acid contributions to
   conformational epitopes were considered. For each of the mAb tested, all dipeptide
   motifs scoring above 2.5 (i.e. ELISA values of peptides containing these motifs were at
   least 2.5 times the average ELISA value of those obtained with all 1164 peptides) were
   selected. The data were de-convoluted into single amino acid contributions represented
10 on the linear CD38 sequence by a scoring system. By walking along the linear CD38
   sequence and by using the unique dipeptide units as a reference point, one point was
   awarded each time a CD38 amino acid was present in this set of high scoring peptides.
            -003, 005 and -024 were all found to bind to the regions SKRNIQFSCKNIYR and
   EKVQTLEAWVIHGG of human CD38. -003 especially recognized the motifs RNIQF and
15 WVIH, -005 especially recognized the motifs KRN and VQTL.
   EXAMPLE 23
   Enzymatic activity
            The enzymatic activity of human CD38 was measured in an assay essentially as
   described in Graeff et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30260-30267 (1994). Briefly, substrate
20 NGD* (80 pM) was incubated with CD38 (0.6 pg/ml His-tagged extracellular domain of
   human CD38, see Example 3 regarding purification of His-CD38) in a buffer containing
   20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.0. The production of cGDPR can be monitored
   spectrophotometrically at the emission wavelength of 410 nm (excitation at 300 nm). In
   this example an excitation filter of 340  60 nm and an emission filter of 430  8 nm was
25 used.
            To test the effect of -003, -005 and -024 on the enzymatic activity of CD38,
   recombinant His-CD38 protein was pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature with
   various concentrations (30, 3, 0.3 and 0.03 pg/ml) of the different antibodies before
   adding the substrate NGD*.The production of cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) was recorded
30 at different time points after addition of antibodies (3, 6, 9, 12, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90
   min).
            Fig 25B shows that -005 has a pronounced inhibitory effect on the production of
   cGDPR. After 90 minutes, addition of 30 and 3 pg/ml -005 resulted in a 32% and 34%
                                                     104

   reduced production of cGDPR (Table 9). Similar results were observed in independent
   experiments using different batches of -005.
            No inhibitory effect on cGPDR production was observed after addition of -003
   (Figure 25B, Table 9), -024 (Figure 25D, Table 9) or anti-KLH (Figure 25A, Table 9).
 5          Based on these findings -005 is also expected to inhibit the synthesis of Cyclic
   ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD*. Inhibition of the synthesis of cADPR can be
   determined according to the HPLC method described in Munshi et al., J. Biol. Chem.

   Comparison of -003 and -005 with Morphosys antibody 3079.
            Antibodies -003 and -005 were functionally compared to Morphosys antibody
15 3079 (TH-3079). Methods for cloning and expression of Morphosys antibody TH-3079
   are described in Example 16. Methods for CDC are described in Example 6. Methods for
   ADCC are described in Example 5. Figure 26A shows that -005 and -003 and TH-3079
   induce CDC-mediated lysis of CD38-transfected CHO cells, with similar maximal lysis.
   When EC50 values are compared, -005 antibody is better than TH3079 in inducing lysis
20 of CHO-CD38 cells, with 2-times lower EC50 (see Table 10).
            Figure 26B shows that -005 is superior to TH-3079 in inducing CDC-mediated
   lysis of Daudi-luciferase cells, with maximal lysis by -005 being 2-3 times higher than by
   TH3079. When EC50 values are compared, -005 antibody is similar to TH-3079 in
   inducing lysis of Daudi-luciferase cells (see Table 10). -003 does not induce significant
25 CDC-mediated lysis of Daudi-luciferase cells.
            Figure 26C shows that in this experiment -005, -003 and TH-3079 mediate lysis
   of Daudi target cells via ADCC. No difference was found in (log) EC5 o and maximal lysis
   (Table 11, n=5).

   EXAMPLE 25
   Inhibition of cellular expressed CD38 enzymatic activity
   The enzymatic activity of cellular expressed human CD38 was measured in an assay
   essentially as described in Graeff et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30260-30267 (1994). Briefly,
10 substrate NGD (80 pM) was incubated with 105 CHO cells transfected with human CD38
   (CHO-CD38 cells) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.0 supplemented with 30
   pg/mI IgG1. The production of cGDPR can be monitored spectrophotometrically at the
   emission wavelength of 410 nm (excitation at 300 nm). In this example an excitation filter
   of 340  60 nm and an emission filter of 430  8 nm was used.
15          To test the effect of -005 and -003 on the enzymatic activity of cellular expressed
   CD38, CHO-CD38 cells were pre-incubated for 15' at room temp. with various
   concentrations (30, 3, 0.3 and 0.03 pg/ml) of the different antibodies before adding the
   substrate NGD. The production of cGDPR was recorded at different time points after
   addition of substrate NGD (3, 6, 9, 12, 30, 45, 60, 112 and 156 min).
20          After 156 minutes, addition of 30 and 3 pg/ml -005 resulted in a 21% and 18%
   reduced production of cGDPR. No inhibitory effect on cGPDR production was observed
   after addition of -003 or IgG1 control antibody (Table 12).

   Binding of antibody -005 to EBV transformed chimpanzee B cells
 5 After harvesting and counting, EBV transformed chimpanzee B cells (received from
    Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Department Immunobiology, Rijswijk, The
   Netherlands) were resuspended (1 x 106 cells/ml) in PBS-BSA (PBS supplemented with
   0.1% BSA and 0.02% Na-azide). Then, cells were put in 96-well V-bottom plates (100
   pl/well) and washed twice in PBS-BSA. Thereafter, 50 pl FITC-labeled -005 antibody
10 solution in PBS-BSA was added to the cells (40C, 30 min). Cells were washed three
   times and specific binding of -005 to EBV transformed chimpanzee B cells was detected
   by flow cytometry. FITC labeled HuMab-KLH (a human monoclonal antibody against
   KLH (keyhole limpet haemocyanin) generated by Genmab B.V., Utrecht, The
   Netherlands by use of the immunization protocols described elsewhere herein) was used
15 as a control. Figure 27 shows dose dependent binding of -005 to EBV transformed
   chimpanzee B cells. No dose dependent binding to EBV transformed chimpanzee B
   cells was observed with the control antibody HuMab-KLH.
   EXAMPLE 27
   In vitro combination therapy of antibody -005 with Dexamethasone and Bortezomib
20          Antibody -005 was tested for its capacity to induce cell death of the multiple
   myeloma cell line UM6 in vitro in a triple combination setting with Dexamethasone (Dex)
   and Bortezomib (Bor; Velcade@). Outcome of the triple treatment was compared to
   single drug treatments and double combo treatments.
            3x10 5 UM6 cells were incubated overnight at 37 0 C with medium alone, with Dex
25 (20 pM), with Bor (15 pM) or with the combination of Bor and Dex. After 23 hours, -005
   (10 pg/ml) was added, and 15 minutes after that, normal human serum was added and
   samples were incubated for another 45 minutes at 37 0C. Finally, 10 pl propidium iodide
   (Pl; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie B.V.; 10 pg/ml) was added, and cell lysis was detected by
                                                    107

   flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur T M (Becton Dickinson) by measurement of the
   percentage of PI-positive cells.
            As can be seen in Figure 28, the triple treatment exceeded lysis observed with
   any of the single or double combination treatments. This effect was observed in two
 5 independent experiments.
