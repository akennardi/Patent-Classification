                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0003]          The present disclosure is in the field of biosensors.
15                                     BACKGROUND
   [0004]          In the management of many conditions, the regular measurement of
   analytes in vivo is required. It has been a long-standing objective of both medical
   science and the military to implant sensors inside the human body that continuously
   and accurately determine changes in physiologic, metabolic, or fatigue status;
20 measure the concentration of biothreat or therapeutic agents in vivo; and provide early
   detection of disease prior to the onset of symptoms. Doing so non-invasively with
   minimal user maintenance is essential, and sensor longevity of months to years is
   crucial in actual user environments.
   [0005]          For example, measurement of glucose in the blood is essential in order
25 to ensure correct insulin dosing in diabetic patients. Furthermore, it has been
   demonstrated that in the long term care of the diabetic patient better control of the
   blood glucose levels can delay, if not prevent, the onset of retinopathy, circulatory
   problems and other degenerative diseases often associated with diabetes. Thus there is
   a need for reliable and accurate self-monitoring of blood glucose levels by diabetic
30 patients.
   [0006]          Currently, blood glucose is monitored by diabetic patients with the use
   of commercially available calorimetric test strips or electrochemical biosensors (e.g.
   enzyme electrodes), both of which require the regular use of a lancet-type instrument
   to withdraw a suitable amount of blood each time a measurement is made. On
                                                1

     WO 2012/048150                                                              PCT/US2011/055157
   average, the majority of diabetic patients would use such instruments to take a
   measurement of blood glucose twice a day. However, the US National Institutes of
   Health recently recommended that blood glucose testing should be carried out at least
   four times a day, a recommendation that has been endorsed by the American Diabetes
 5 Association. This increase in the frequency of blood glucose testing imposes a
   considerable burden on the diabetic patient, both in terms of financial cost and in
   terms of pain and discomfort, particularly in the long-term diabetic who has to make
   regular use of a lancet to draw blood from the fingertips. Thus, there is clearly a need
   for a better long-term glucose monitoring system that does not involve drawing blood
10 from the patient.
    [0007]          Over the last several decades; many attempts have been made to
   develop implanted sensors that provide frequent or continuous monitoring. For
   example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,756 to Gough et al., filed May 6, 1986, describes a
   sensor module for implantation in the body to monitor glucose and oxygen levels.
15 However, due to electrical failure, degradation of the analyte recognition element
   (typically an enzyme), component degradation and delamination, these sensors
   typically fail after a relatively short period of time (e.g.,. hours to days). Another
   major failure mode of in vivo sensors is not failure of the sensor itself, but rather
   changes in the tissue immediately adjacent to the sensor due to the implantation of the
20 sensor. The tissue at the interface of the sensor changes in such a way that it is no
   longer representative of the overall body state or disease state or analyte of interest.
    [0008]          U.S. Patent No. 7,228,159 describes a senor comprising a plurality of
   non-biodegradable sensing particles embedded in a biodegradable matrix for injection
   into the dermis. However, as the matrix degrades, the sensing particles are ingested
25 by macrophages and removed from the implant site. Similarly, U.S. Patent No.
   6,671,527 describes a sensor which is injected into epidermis and is ejected over time
   due to the normal sloughing of skin. U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0131773
   describes a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose) sensor made up of at least two different
   variants of an appropriate competitive binding assay.

   Billingsley et al. (2010) Anal. Chem. 82(9):3707-3713 and McShane et al. (2000)
   IEEE Engineeringin Medicine and Biology Magazine 19:36-45 describe implantation
   of analyte-sensing microspheres or nanospheres. These individual sensing particles
   are taken up by macrophages if they are too small, and can migrate through the tissue,
                                                  2

     WO 2012/048150                                                            PCT/US2011/055157
   which is not desirable for explanation and not desirable to have the fluorescent signal
   disperse in an uncontrolled way. If the sensing particles are too big to be taken up by
   macrophages, they undergo the typical foreign body response (FBR), which limits the
   proximity of capillaries with respect to the implant. As sensors become encapsulated
 5 by avascular tissue, they lose ability to accurately sense blood borne analytes and as
   they become engulfed by phagocytic cells (small particles), they lose contact with
   interstitial fluid, which is the compartment necessary to be sensed for components
   such as glucose. Therefore, current sensing technologies typically fail after only a
   short time in the body (e.g., 2-7 days for commercially available sensors).
10 [0010]            Thus, there remains a clear need for sensing technologies that are
   tissue integrating to provide long-term (e.g., weeks, months or years) and accurate
   readings by remaining in contact with interstitial fluid (not the internal cellular
   environment) and remaining in close proximity to the vasculature so that the
   interstitial fluid surrounding the sensor is in constant rapid equilibrium with nearby
15 capillaries.
                                           SUMMARY
   [0011]            Disclosed herein are tissue-integrating sensors, systems comprising
   these sensors and methods of using these sensors and systems for the measurement of
20 various analytes.
   [0012]            Currently, continuous analyte sensors for monitoring body chemistry
   (microdialysis, electrochemical, skin tattoo sensors, etc.) do not provide accurate,
   long-term data due to the progressively declining capillary density and/or foreign
   body response. The integration of capillaries into and throughout the sensor (sensing
25 media) is a major improvement over what currently exists. The capillary
   enhancement gives rise to improved accuracy and reduced lag time.
    [0013]           In one aspect, provided herein are a tissue-integrating sensor for
   detecting an analyte, the sensor comprising a tissue-integrating scaffold; and one or
   more sensing moieties, wherein the sensing moieties produce a detectable signal in
30 the presence of the analyte; and further wherein the sensor provides detection of the
   analyte when placed (e.g., implanted) into the tissue of a subject. The tissue
   integrating sensors as described herein can provide long-term detection of the
   analyte(s). In certain embodiments, the tissue-integrating scaffold consists of the one
   or more sensing moieties (e.g., polymeric sensing moieties formed into a scaffold).

   moieties in one or more of the layers) and/or one or more fibers.
   [00141          Any of the sensors described herein may further comprise additional
   components, for example, a coating on the exterior of the sensor and/or one or more
10 additional reference (calibration) moieties, for example for calibrating the signal
   detected from the sensing moieties.
   [0015]          In yet another aspect, provided herein is a system for detecting an
   analyte, the system comprising one or more of the tissue-integrating sensors as
   described herein; and an interrogator that generates (e.g., light that causes the sensing
15 moieties to emit light) and/or measures the signal produced by the sensing moieties.
   In certain embodiments, the system further includes one or more of the following: a
   detector, a signal receiver, a signal transmitter, a signal processing component, an
   energy storage component, a data storage component, a data transmitter, a data
   display device, a data processing component and combinations thereof.

   using the sensors and systems as described herein. In certain embodiments, provided
   herein is a method for detection of an analyte in a tissue of a subject, the method
   comprising integrating one or more sensors as described herein into the tissue and
   detecting the presence of the analyte.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    [0038]          Described herein are tissue-integrating sensors useful for accurate and
   optionally long term measurements of analytes in vivo. Also described herein are
20 methods of using these sensors for optical detection of various biochemical analytes.
   Using reversible binding ligands and/or chemistries, the implantable sensors, systems
   and methods described herein provide for continuous or semi-continuous collection of
   data of various biochemical analytes, optionally without the use of implantable
   hardware of any type and/or enzymatic and electrochemical detection methods.
25  [00391          In particular, the tissue-integrating sensors that are the subject of this
   invention remain in good contact (close proximity) to blood vessels and have direct
   access to measurements of interstitial fluid. The tissue-integrating scaffold
   encourages capillary growth into and/or nearby the sensing media. The sensing media
   is devoid of electronics, making the sensing media seem less foreign to the body than
30 implants that contain electronics. Additionally the tissue-integrating sensing media
   may have a modulus closer to the texture of tissue, thus enhancing the integration in
   the tissue.
   [0040]           Thus, unlike other devices, the sensors described herein allow
   capillaries to grow in close proximity to all regions of the sensor (e.g., on the surface
                                                  7

     WO 2012/048150                                                             PCT/US2011/055157
   and inside), which results in accurate analyte measurements, including over long term.
   Embedding, attaching or forming scaffolds out of nano-sized sensing elements results
   in tissue-integrating sensing media that allows in-growth, including of tissue and
   capillaries, in and/or around the sensors. Tissue integrating sensors minimize the
 5 foreign body response and/or promote vascularization. Capillary growth directly into
   and throughout the sensor allows unencumbered access to analytes-of interest in the
   blood (e.g. glucose, lactate, pyruvate, cortisol, ions, proteins, nucleic acids, alcohols,
   urea, etc.). The level of tissue integration and proximity of capillaries to all regions of
   the sensor will provide a close, stable relationship between the analyte concentration
10 in the blood and in the tissue surrounding the sensing media.
    [0041]           Advantages of the device and methods described herein include, but
   are not limited to: (1) providing devices that integrate into the subject (e.g., through
   tissue and/or capillary in-growth; (2) providing devices which can be implanted
   through syringe injection, meaning that no surgery is required to put the sensing
15 media in place in the body; (3) providing devices that do not include sensor
   electronics in the body; (4) providing devices comprising material(s) having
   properties more similar to actual tissue (e.g., modulus that is more similar to tissue's
   modulus and hydrogel water content) to allow a better acceptance into the tissue; (5)
   providing devices that accurately assess analyte(s) for long periods of time (e.g.,
20 greater than a week, typically weeks, months or years) and/or (6) providing devices of
   small dimensions which will give result in increased patent comfort and better
   acceptance by the body.
   [0042]           It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended
   claims, the singular forms a, "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the
25 content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a sensor
   comprising "a sensing moiety" includes devices comprising of two or more sensing
   moieties. Likewise, reference to "an analyte" refers to two or more analytes.
           Definitions
30 [0043]           The term "tissue integrating" refers to a material (e.g., scaffold) which,
   when integrated into living tissue remains in close proximity with the blood vessels of
   the tissue (e.g., capillaries). By "close proximity," is meant that the average distance
   from any point within the material (scaffold) implanted into the tissue to the nearest
                                                 8

      WO 2012/048150                                                           PCT/US2011/055157
    blood vessel is no greater than 100 microns more than the average distance from any
    point in the native (original) tissue to the nearest blood vessel.
    [0044]          By "long-term" is meant that the implant senses the analyte for greater
    than about 7 days, for example weeks, months, or years.
 5  [0045]          By "biodegradable" or "bioabsorbable" is meant that the material is
    capable of being broken down by the subject's body over a period of time, ranging
    from days to weeks to months or years.
    [0046]          By "water-soluble" is meant that the molecules of the material are
    capable of dissolving in water. Thus, biodegradable materials may include water
10  soluble biomaterials.
    [0047]          By "hydrogel" is meant a material that absorbs a solvent (e.g. water),
    undergoes rapid swelling without discernible dissolution, and maintains three
    dimensional networks capable of reversible deformation.
15          Sensing Media
    [0048]          Described herein are sensors (or sensing media) for implantation in a
    subject. The sensors are made up of tissue-integrating scaffolds and at least one
    sensing moiety.
20          A. Tissue Integrating Scaffolds
    [0049]        The sensors described herein typically comprise a tissue-integrating
   scaffold (also referred to as a matrix) material. Preferably, the tissue-integrating
   scaffold of the invention may be constructed with materials and/or micro-architecture
   such that the scaffold promotes tissue-integration and/or vascularization. For
25 example, porous scaffolds provide tissue biomaterial anchoring and promote in
   growth throughout the pores. The resulting "hallway" or "channel" pattern of tissue
   growth are healthy, space-filling masses that persist over time and promote host cell
   integration. Most or all of the pores of the biomaterials described herein are
   preferably interconnected (co-continuous). The co-continuous pore structure of the
30 biomaterials promotes space-filling in-growth of cells in the implant, which in turn

   to years) persistence of the implant's ability to act as a sensor. Alternative structures

  5  [00501           The tissue-integrating scaffold of the invention may comprise any
     material, including but not limited to synthetic polymers, naturally-occurring
     substances, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary synthetic polymers include, but are not
     limited to polyethylene glycol (PEG), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), silicone
     rubber, poly([epsilon]-caprolactone) dimethylacrylate, polysulfone, (poly)methy
10  methacrylate (PMMA), soluble Teflon-AF, (poly) ethylenetetrapthalate (PET,

    thereof. Exemplary naturally-occurring materials include, but are not limited to,
     fibrous or globular proteins, complex carbohydrates, glycosaminoglycans,

15  collagens of all types, elastin, hyaluronic acid, alginic acid, desmin, versican,
    matricelluar proteins such as SPARC (osteonectin), osteopontin, thrombospondin 1
    and 2, fibrin, fibronectin, vitronectin, albumin, chitosan etc. Natural polymers may be
    used as the scaffold or as an additive.
     [00511          In certain embodiments, the tissue-integrating scaffold comprises a
20  hydrogel. For example, the polymer scaffold may comprise a hydrogel, for example
    by reacting hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), poly (hydroxyethyl methacrylate),
    pHEMA. Furthermore, various comonomers can be used in combination to alter the
    hydrophilicity, mechanical and swelling properties of the hydrogel (e.g. PEG, NVP,
    MAA). Non-limiting examples of polymers include 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate,
25  polyacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N,N-Dimethylacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol)
    monomethacrylate (of varying molecular weights), diethylene glycol methacrylate, N

    include tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) (n) diacrylate (of
30  varying molecular weights), ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate, bisacrylamide
    and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of initiators include irgacure Series

   [0052]          The tissue-integrating scaffold may be a sphere-templated hydrogel,
   for instance an inverse colloid crystal, for example as described in U.S. Patent
   Publication No. 2008/0075752 to Ratner, et al. or other tissue integrating materials.
   [00531          The scaffold may be degradable, either by the body (biodegradable) or
 5 by the application of an external initiator to start or speed up the degradation process
   (e.g. UV, ultrasonics, radio frequency, or other exogenous sources to initiate
   degradation.). For example, the tissue-integrating scaffold may be comprised of any
   biodegradable or bioresorbable polymers, including but not limited to degradable
   forms of alginates, poly(lactic acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyanhydrides,
10 poly(glycolic acid), microporous polyesters, microporous polyethers and cross-linked

   [0055]          In certain embodiments, the tissue-integrating scaffold of the invention
   is constructed such that tissue response modifiers are released from the scaffold
   material to promote or enhance tissue-integration and vascularization.

     WO 2012/048150                                                             PCT/US2011/055157
    [0056]          In addition, the tissue-integrating scaffold of the invention may be
   constructed such that it has conduits, pores or pockets that are hollow or filled with
   degradable, angiogenic, or other substances (e.g. stem cells). As noted above, once in
   the body, the biodegradation of the material filling the conduits, pores or pockets,
 5 creates space for tissue, including capillaries to integrate with the material. The
   degradable material that initially fills the conduits, pores or pockets may enhance
   vessel growth or tissue growth within the scaffold. This architecture promotes new
   vessel formation and maintains healthy viable tissue within and around the implant.
    [00571          The tissue-integrating scaffold of the invention may be constructed
10 such that it is permeable to analytes of interest (e.g. glucose can diffuse into a tissue
   integrating hydrogel scaffold and reach the sensing moieties that are embedded within
   the hydrogel matrix).
    [0058]          FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a porous tissue-integrating
   implants described herein. The device as a whole is generally designated 10 and is
15 shown in cross-section in a three-dimensional block. FIG. 1 shows an embodiment in
   which all of the pores 5 are interconnected. The pores 5 are within the solid scaffold
   portions 15.
   [0059]           FIG. 2A depicts an exemplary embodiment of a porous tissue
   integrating implant as described herein following implantation and tissue in-growth.
20 The scaffold 15 is shown following growth of blood vessels 45, cells 50 and
   extracellular matrix material 55 (e.g., collagen) in and around the implant after
   implantation. FIGs. 2B and 2C show histology photographs of tissue (rat skin)
   including an integrated implant 15 as described herein. FIG. 2B shows the implant in
   the tissue 1 week following implantation and FIG. 2C shows the implant 1 month
25 following implantation into Sprague-Dawley rats. As shown, the tissue 19 grows into
   the implant, keeping the implant in close proximity to the blood vessels of the tissue
   and without a significant foreign body response. FIGs. 2D and 2E are reproductions
   of photographs showing immunohistochemistry staining for vasculature (using CD31
   antibodies) 1 week (FIG. 2D) and 1 month (FIG. 2E) following implantation into skin
30 (subcutaneous) of Sprague-Dawley rats. The approximate boundaries of the scaffold
   16 are shown as well as capillary ingrowth 18 into the implanted scaffold.
   [0060]           In certain embodiments, the tissue-integrating scaffold is made up
   solely or primarily of sensing moieties (see, e.g., FIGs. 5 and 6). For example,
   sensing particles can be bonded together using any suitable method (chemical,
                                                 12

    adhesive, thermal, etc.). In certain embodiments, the sensing particles comprise a
   polymer, for example PEG-coated particles (e.g., microspheres). In other
    embodiments, the scaffold comprises a polymer that itself is composed of sensing
   moieties. See, FIG. 6.
 5  [0061]          The tissue integrating implant can be of any suitable form, including,
   but not limited to block-like (or any thickness), cube-like, disk-shaped, cylindrical,
   oval, round, random or non-random configurations of fibers and the like. In certain
   embodiments, the sensor comprises one or more fibers, which may be organized in a
   non-random fashion (e.g., grid, layered grid, etc., see, FIG. 9E) or in a random fashion
10 (see, e.g., FIG. 9F).
            B. Sensing Moieties
    [0062]          The tissue-integrating scaffolds described herein are typically
   combined with (or made up of) sensing moieties that detect one or more analytes.
15  [0063]         Non-limiting examples of analytes that may be detected by the sensing
   moieties include oxygen, reactive oxygen species, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, cortisol,
   creatinine, urea, sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, vasopressin, hormones
   (e.g., Luteinizing hormone), pH, cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, insulin, leptins,
   small molecule drugs, ethanol, myoglobin, nucleic acids (RNAs, DNAs), fragments,
20 polypeptides, single amino acids and the like.
   [0064]          Any suitable moiety can be used to sense the analyte of interest,
   including not limited to analyte binding molecules (e.g. glucose binding proteins),
   competitive binding molecules (e.g. phenylboronic acid based chemistries), analyte
   specific enzymes (e.g. glucose oxidase), ion sensitive materials, or other analyte
25 sensitive molecules (e.g. oxygen sensitive dyes such as porphyrins). The sensing
   moieties may be in any form, for example, microspheres, nanospheres, fibers, etc. A
   single implant (tissue-integrating scaffold) typically includes a plurality of sensing
   moieties. In certain embodiments, the sensing moieties are all the same while in other
   embodiments, a mixture of two or more sensing moieties is used.
30 [0065]          To enhance or create a detectable signal, sensing molecules may be
   labeled with a reporter (e.g., one or more fluorophores, one or more gold particles,
   one or more quantum dots and/or one or more single-walled carbon nanotubes).
   Sensing molecules may also create a signal through swelling, optical diffraction,
   change in absorbance FRET, quenching.

   [00671          The sensing moiety element may comprise other molecules besides
   sensing molecules, such as carrier molecules/polymers (e.g. the sensing moiety
20 element may comprise PEG nanospheres, alginate particles or other carrier materials
   that contain sensing molecules). The sensing moiety element may also contain
   reference molecules or stabilizing molecules that do not sense any analytes, but that
   serves as calibrators (e.g., a reference dye or any substance that provides a reference
   signal to which the signal modulated by the analyte of interest may be compared for
25 calibration) or stabilizer (e.g. catalayse, any free-radical scavenger which helps
   preserve the sensing moieties or other stabilizer).
   [0068]          The sensing moiety element may be thermally responsive material,
   pressure-responsive material or materials that swell, shrink, change optical properties,
   or change other measurable properties in response to a stimulus.

           C. Sensing Media
   [0069]          The combination of the tissue-integrating scaffold with the analyte
   sensing moieties may be termed implantable sensing media, sensing media, tissue
                                                 14

   integrating sensor, tissue-integrating biosensor, tissue-integrating sensing media or
   variations thereof.
    [0070]          The analyte sensing moieties may be combined with the tissue
   integrating scaffolds in a variety of ways to produce tissue-integrating sensors. In
 5 some embodiments the sensing moieties are physically entrapped or chemically bound
   within the scaffold. In other embodiments, the sensing moieties are attached directly
   (e.g., via covalent or noncovalent linkages) to the surface of the tissue- integrating
   scaffold and may optionally be covered by an exterior coating. The purpose of the
   exterior coating is described as, but not limited to the following: to hold the sensing
10 moieties in place, to protect the sensing moieties from external forces, to limit/impede
   diffusion of various molecules and/or to provide a desired exterior surface, and to
   conduct or transduce the sensing signal from the chemistry to the scaffold and/or
   external detector.
    [00711          In some embodiments the tissue-integrating scaffold itself is composed
15 of sensing moieties where the sensing moieties are in the form of particles (spherical
   or other shapes) that are bonded together (e.g. chemically, thermally, pressure, etc) or
   where the polymer itself provides the sensing capability (e.g. stimuli-sensitive
   polymers).
   [0072]          In another embodiment, the tissue-integrating scaffold is composed of
20 distinct layers where sensing moieties are physically entrapped or chemically bound
   to or within specific layers of the scaffold, and other layers provide other features
   such as mechanical strength, elasticity, conductivity or other properties.
   [00731          In another embodiment, the tissue-integrating scaffold is composed of
   a polymer that swells or shrinks in response to a stimulus (e.g. concentration of an
25 analyte of interest, temperature, or other stimuli). The shrinking or swelling may
   cause optical change (e.g. due to light diffraction, change in distances between gold
   nanoparticles contained within the matrix, or other interaction (Aleexev et al and
   Aslan, et al)).
   [0074]          Table 1 below provides a matrix showing how sensing moieties can be
30 combined with tissue-integrating scaffolds in a variety of ways to tissue-integrating
   sensing media.

    [0075]           In certain embodiments, the implant (sensing media) further comprises
    additional moieties (e.g., non-sensing or additional sensing moieties different from the
    sensing moieties), for example reference (or calibration) moieties. Reference or
    calibration moieties include, but are not limited to, dyes, fluorescent particles,
 5  lanthanides, nanoparticles, microspheres, quantum dots or other additives or elements
    of the implant whose signal does not change due to the presences of the analyte (e.g.,
    glucose). See, e.g., Chaudhary et al. (2009) Biotechnology and Bioengineering
    104(6):1075-1085. Fluctuations in the reference (calibration) signal(s) can be used to
    correct or calibrate the sensing signal(s). Reference signals might fluctuate due to
10 changes in the amount of light reaching the implant (ambient light changes,
    fluctuating LED or laser source). Sensing signals would also be subject to
   fluctuations in the amount of light reaching the implant; however it is desirable that
   the signal of interest only fluctuates based on analyte (e.g., glucose) fluctuations.
   Therefore the reference signal is used to correct or calibrate the sensing signal when it
15 fluctuates due to influences other than changes in glucose concentration. Reference
   signals might also fluctuate due to changes in the reference moiety itself (e.g.
   photodegratation, chemical degradation). The sensing signal(s) would have the same
   degradation or a rate of degradation that is relatable to the reference to allow for
   correction or calibration by the reference. Reference signals might also fluctuate due
20 to physiological fluctuations that alter the light propagation through tissue (e.g.
   dehydration, oxygenation, blood flow). Sensing signals would be affected in the same
   way or in a way that is relatable to the reference fluctuations thereby permitting
   correction or calibration of the sensing signal by the one or more references. Thus,
   the sensing signal can be calibrated by reference to the signal(s) obtained from the
25 calibration (reference) moieties.
   [0076]           In certain embodiments, the sensing moieties detect glucose and the
   reference moiety comprises a molecule that measures (produces a detectable signal in
   the presence of) oxygen (02). As noted above, the sensing moieties can comprise an
   enzyme, for example glucose oxidase which is specific for the substrate glucose. The
30 reaction of glucose oxidase causes the substrate glucose to be converted to D
   glucono-1,5-lactone, which then hydrolyzes to gluconic acid. Oxygen is consumed
   and converted to H 2 0 2 . The reduction of 02 in the vicinity of the enzyme can be
   measured by using an 0 2-sensitive fluorescent dye, such as a porphyrin dye. These
   dye molecules are quenched in the presence of 02, so the reduction of 02 by the
                                                17

     WO 2012/048150                                                           PCT/US2011/055157
    action of GOx, causes an increase in fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence
    emitted from the 02 calibration moieties is thus proportional to the concentration of
    glucose in the sensor.
    [0077]          The concentration of 02 in the tissue can also vary physiologically,
 5 thereby changing or limiting the reaction of the enzyme in the sensing moieties.
   Therefore, the 02 concentration in the sensor can be measured independent of the
   glucose concentration. Such a reference measurement of 02 would allow corrections
   to be made to the glucose-specific signal from the sensing moieties.
    [0078]          In another embodiment, an analyte-specific enzyme that causes a
10 change in pH would require the use of a separate pH-sensitive fluorescent dye with an
   emission spectral peak different and distinguishable from the analyte-specific dye
   reporting on the activity of the analyte-specific enzyme, for example when the sensing
   moieties comprise, urease used for measuring urea.
    [00791          In still further embodiments, the sensing moieties comprise a first
15 fluorescent dye and the reference molecule comprises a second (different) fluorescent
   dye. As noted above, the sensing moieties may utilize an analyte-specific chemistry
   that includes a ligand receptor moiety and an analyte analogue moiety. One of the
   binding members is labeled with a fluorescent dye and the other binding member is
   labeled with a dye that quenches the fluorescent dye when the analyte analogue
20 moiety binds to the ligand receptor moiety. Non-limiting examples include
   glycodendrimer, which binds to Concanavalin A, wherein the Concanavalin A is
   labeled with Alexafluor 647 and the glycodendrimer is labeled with QDY21 dark
   quencher. Concanavalin A binds to glucose and the glycodendrimer competes with
   glucose for the binding to Concanavalin A. The chemistry is immobilized as
25 described in this invention within the tissue-integrating scaffold and implanted into
   the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. To measure glucose in the tissue, the tissue
   integrating scaffold is illuminated from a patch reader on top of the skin above the
   implant with 650nm light at desired intervals over the long-term life of the implant
   (e.g., every 5-60 minutes over a period of 90 days or more). The amount of
30 fluorescent signal (e.g., from a molecule such as Alexafluor 647) detected is
   proportional to the concentration of glucose in the tissue. However, over the long
   term life of the implants described herein, the dye can photobleach, i.e., the amount of
   fluorescent signal emitted back through the skin at a given glucose concentration is
                                               18

     WO 2012/048150                                                            PCT/US2011/055157
    diminished. Thus, a reduction of fluorescence due to photobleaching can make it
    appear that analyte is at a lower concentration than it really is.
    [0080]          To correct for this effect, a separate internal photobleaching control is
    employed. In certain embodiments, the separate internal control is a second
 5  fluorescent dye, different from the fluorescent molecule included in the sensing
   moieties (e.g., Alexafluor 750 in the reference moieties when the sensing moieties
   comprise Alexafluor 647), which included immobilized in the scaffold. The
   fluorescence of reference moieties is not affected by the concentration of glucose, and
   both the first (e.g., Alexafluor 647) and second (e.g., Alexafluor 750) fluorescent dyes
10 have predictable and well-characterized photobleaching rates. To control for the
   photobleaching of the dye of the sensing moieties, the fluorescence is measured for
   both dyes. The fluorescence value of the dye in the reference moieties can then be
   used to correct for any photobleaching of the dye in the sensing moieties.
    [0081]          In another embodiment, internal reference control materials can be
15 employed that facilitate correcting for tissue optical variation. The tissue-integrating
   implanted biosensor typically resides 3-4 mm under the surface of the scan. It is well
   known that in skin excitation light and emitted fluorescent light in the near infrared
   range are highly scattered as the light traverses the tissue between the reader patch
   and the implant. The extent of absorption and scattering is affected by physical
20 properties such as temperature or by tissue composition, including but not limited to
   variations in blood perfusion, hydration, and melanin concentration. Skin variations
   can occur between users or between different time points for a single patient, and
   these variations can affect the fluorescence excitation and emissions signals causing
   in accurate signals for the analyte-specific signal. Accordingly, a separate
25 fluorescence molecule with emission spectra distinguishable from the analyte-specific
   fluorescence can be immobilized into the scaffold. The fluorescence from the
   molecule can be measured separately from the analyte-specific fluorescence to
   measure a signal that informs about variations in tissue composition. The dye
   selected is based on having a similar response to tissue variations as the analyte
30 specific dye. Dyes such as Alexafluor 750, various quantum dots (QD's), or
   lanthanide dye nanocrystals all can provide this capability.

   [0090]          Tissue-integrating sensors comprised of one or more cylindrical shaped

   [0091]          It will be apparent that the overall dimensions of the sensing media
   (implantable sensor) will vary according to the subject and/or the analyte(s) to be
   measured. Typically, the implant will be between about .001 mm to 2 mm in
   thickness (or any value therebetween) and between 1 mm and 1 cm in diameter (or an
 5 equivalent cross sectional area of a non-circular shape, for example length/width) and
   15 mm in length or less, for example a disk shaped sensor that is 2mm or less thick
   and 10 mm or less in diameter. In certain embodiments, the approximate sensor size
   is approximately 100-1000 microns in diameter and the length is between 0.25 mm
   and 10 mm. The size of the tissue-integrating sensing media in disk form is typically
10 2mm or less thick and 10 mm or less in diameter.

   material, or it may be several pieces or particles of tissue-integrating sensing material.
   It may be injected with a carrier substance (e.g. saline, PBS with anti-inflammatory
   drugs or other tissue-response modifiers). Furthermore, the sensing media may be
15 implanted into any part of the subject, including, for example, shoulder, arm, leg,
   abdomen, etc. Preferably, the sensing media is implanted into the skin, for example,
   the epidermis, the dermis and or the subcutaneous layer of skin.
           Systems
20 [00931          Another aspect of the present invention is a tissue-integrating
   biosensor system for semi-continuous, continuous and/or long-term use within a
   mammalian body. A biosensor system as described herein comprises the tissue
   integrating biosensor (described above). Other components include one or more of the
   following: interrogator, illuminator, detector, signal receiver, signal transmitter, signal
25 processing component, energy storage component, data storage component, data
   transmitter, data display, data processing component and combinations thereof. One
   or more of these other components may be incorporate into a wearable patch that
   resides over the sensor to detect the sensor signal, or they may be integrated into a
   hand held or other device, which is periodically held over the implanted sensor to take
30 the measurement. See, FIG. 18.

   interrogator. Figure 19A shows a patch 85 including an interrogator and/or detector
   that may be worn continuously above implanted sensor. FIG. 19B shows a module 90
   that can be placed above implanted sensor as desired to interrogate and/or detect

   continuous or discrete measurements. Non-limiting examples of such modules
   include hand-held devices such as wands and the like. FIG. 19C depicts how a field
   95 that can be used to interrogate (monitor) the subject remotely. Any of the systems
   described herein may further include an additional component 97 that delivers one or
 5 more therapeutics (e.g., analytes) to the subject based on the measurements obtained
   from the sensor (e.g., an insulin pump that delivers glucose to form a closed loop
   artificial pancreas). Although depicted separated from the interrogator/detector, it
   will be apparent that the delivery device 97 may be incorporated into the system (e.g.,
   interrogator and/or detector). The delivery device 97 may be controlled by the
10 operator based on the measurements from the sensor or may be controlled by the data
   reader directly (e.g., smart phone) or remotely (e.g., telemedicine).
   [0095]           The tissue-integrating scaffold combined with (or comprised of) the
   one or more sensing moieties are the necessary elements in the tissue-integrating
   sensor system. Thus, the combination of analyte sensing moieties with tissue
15 integrating scaffolds comprises the tissue-integrating sensor that is implanted in the
   body. This tissue-integrating sensor is one component of the biosensor system for
   continuous monitoring or long-term use within the mammalian body. Other
   components, including, for example, means to read the signal coming from the tissue
   integrating biosensor, show, collect and/or transmit the signal coming from the
20 implanted biosensor. In certain embodiments, the signal is read directly by the human
   eye. In other embodiments, the signal reader comprises one or more of the
   following: a hand-held device that detects biosensor signals; a removable patch that
   resides over the area of the tissue integrating biosensor to continuous or semi
   continuous detection of biosensor signals; an implant near, but not touching the
25 tissue-integrating sensing media and/or an implant near and touching a portion of the
   tissue-integrating sensing media.
   [0096]          The implant may send signal to a watch, a cell phone, a hand-held
   device, a computer or other data collection and/or read-out device, either directly or,
   alternatively, via the signal reader. The data may or may not first be processed before
30 sending to these devices and/or these devices may process data received. Data may
   further be relayed to a database, an email account a cell phone or other storage,
   processing or display.
   [0097]          The invention works by means of chemical, physical and biological

   space (e.g. glucose, urea, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, glutamate, cortisol, acetone,
   ethanol and other molecules) also diffuse to the surface and/or into the tissue
   integrating scaffold and have some interaction with the sensing moieties. In one
 5 embodiment, the tissue integrating scaffold is composed of a biomaterial that has
   sensing moieties contained and/or attached on the exterior of the scaffold. When the
   analyte diffuses to the surface and interacts with the sensing moieties, a measurable
   signal is produced (e.g. fluorescence), which is the measured by a detector (signal
   reader) that is inside or outside the body, but not immediately touching the tissue
10 integrating biosensor. In another embodiment, the tissue integrating scaffold is
   composed of a polymer with mesh size large enough to permit molecules of interest to
   diffuse inside the scaffold. The sensing moieties are contained within the polymer
   scaffold. When the analyte diffuses into the hydrogel of the tissue-integrating scaffold
   and interacts with the sensing moieties, a measurable signal is produced (e.g.
15 fluorescence), which is the measured by a detector (signal reader) that is inside or
   outside the body, but not immediately touching the tissue-integrating biosensor.
   [0098]           In another embodiment, the tissue-integrating scaffold is composed of
   a polymer with mesh size large enough to permit molecules of interest to diffuse
   inside the scaffold. The sensing moieties compose the polymer scaffold. When the
20 analyte diffuses into the tissue-integrating scaffold and interacts with the sensing
   moieties of the scaffold, a measurable signal is produced (e.g. fluorescence), which is
   the measured by a detector that is inside or outside the body, but not immediately

   [00991           It will be apparent that one or more analytes can be assayed, and that
25 these analytes are selected by the operator, for example, based on the recommendation
   of medical personnel, based on interest of monitoring of health and well-being, based
   on specific biological threats, or based on any other rationale for which the subject
   has interest to monitor analytes continually or periodically. Typically, the subject
   would inject, have injected, implant or have implanted the tissue-integrating biosensor
30 or biosensors for the specific analyte or analytes of interest in the tissue to be
   monitored. The implant can be placed anywhere in the subject. In certain
   embodiments, the sensing media is injected into the skin (e.g., the dermis or
   subcutaneously). In other embodiments, the sensor is integrated into alternative spots,

   [01001           FIG. 18 is a schematic cross-section of a skin sample showing an
   exemplary embodiment in which the sensing media (tissue integrating implant) 15 is
 5 implanted into the subcutaneous tissue 70 of a subject's skin. Also shown are the
   epidermis 60, the dermis 65 and an optional signal reader 75, depicting as a patch on
   the surface of the skin. In this embodiment, the detector patch sends interrogation
   light to the tissue integrating sensing media. The sensing moieties contained in the
   tissue-integrating sensing media 15, provide a measurable signal (e.g., fluorescence,
10 luminescence, magnetic, etc.) in a manner dependent on the concentration of the
   analyte(s) of interest. The signal (e.g., fluorescent light) is detected by the detector
   patch (signal receiver) 75. Also shown in FIG. 18 is optional data reader device 80
   that can receive process and/or display information received from the signal reader 75
   (e.g., patch). Non-limiting examples of data readers include cell phones, smart
15 phones, watches, computers, and the like. Data may be further relayed to a database,
   an email account, a cell phone or other storage, processing or display.
   [01011           The data obtained with the tissue-integrating biosensor system is used
   by persons to better understand and manage body chemistries (e.g., glucose in the
   case of diabetics, urea in the case of dialysis patients) and health status.
20  [0102]          Methods have long been sought for creating long-lasting in vivo
   analyte sensors. Reliable, consistent, and continuous sensor data can improve patient
   care. For example continuous glucose sensors are of great interest to populations with
   diabetes, and it has been shown that continuous glucose monitoring significantly
   improves health outcomes (The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Continuous
25 Glucose Monitoring Study Group). Other analytes such as lactate, pyruvate, glycerol,
   cortisol, urea, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, ions, hormones, cytokines, insulin,
   PSA, C reactive protein, biomarkers and a myriad of other analytes are of interest for
   monitoring of health. Currently, blood samples are withdrawn and analyzed in the lab
   for various analytes. More recently, bedside or hand-held analyzers for some
30 substances can give more immediate data in close proximity to the patients with quick
   turn-around time. Even more desirable is the ability to continually monitor analytes of
   interest to detect changes in states of health.

   [0103]           In addition to substances naturally produced in the body, real-time
   monitoring of exogenous substances is of interest. For example, over the course of
   administration of drugs or chemotherapeutic agents that have narrow ranges of
 5 effective concentration, in vivo monitoring can provide the clinician with feedback
   upon which to make adjustments to dosing to assure proper concentrations are
   achieved and maintained. Constant monitoring of food additives, sodium, alcohol,
   caffeine, nicotine, vitamin levels, lead, pesticides and a variety of other substances
   can help individuals and caregivers understand their intake and exposure to certain
10 chemicals and to take control of their own health.
   [0104]           Thus, the tissue-integrating biosensors can be used in the for personal
   monitoring, physician monitoring of patients, clinical research, animal research
   studies, and veterinary health for continuously or semi-continuously monitoring
   analyte concentrations inside a living body. Non-limiting examples of uses of the
15 sensors include for monitoring of diabetic health, dehydration, hemodialysis, acute
   respiratory distress, stress assessment, congestive heart failure, metabolism status,
   lifestyle, fitness and training, peripheral vascular resistance, hyonatramia, acute
   decompensated heart failure, fertility status (e.g., ovulation cycle), cancer detection
   (early, recurrent, etc.), inflammatory responses (various types), therapeutic drug,
20 including drug concentrations or drug response indicators, ethanol for example for
   alcoholism treatment, infection disease monitoring, pesticide monitoring, heavy metal
   monitoring and the like.
   [0105]           In vivo tissue-integrating biosensors for endogenous and exogenous
   analytes can be used day and night at home and during daily activities (work,
25 exercise, meals, etc). They can also be used in a care giving setting (e.g. hospital).
   They may be used in a continuous or intermittent fashion.
   [0106]           Unlike current biosensors, the sensors (also termed sensing media)
   described herein integrates with the tissue in which it is implanted. The tissue
   integrating sensing scaffold promotes capillary growth directly into the sensor itself
30 unlike all other marketed sensors or sensors in development (that are known to the
   authors at the time of submitting this patent).

            Methods
   [0107]         Another aspect of this invention is a method for making tissue
   integrating sensors. The method(s) for creating a tissue-integrating sensor comprises
   a process for combining the sensing moieties and the tissue-integrating scaffold in a
 5 manner that preserves the integrity of the sensing moieties sufficiently such that they
   produce measurable signal(s) in response to the analyte of interest.
   [0108]          It will be apparent that the relative amounts of scaffold, sensing
   moieties and/or reference moieties in the sensor will depend on the polymers and
   sensing moieties used. For example, in certain embodiments, the sensor will be made
10 with between about 2-95% vol/vol of a monomer or polymer (e.g., 2-85% vol/vol
   HEMA). Likewise, when present, the amount of cross-linker used will depend on the
   polymer, for example typically about .1 and 10% vol/vol of TEGDMA may be used.
   Water and or other solvents may be present in any amount (e.g., 5-95% vol/vol water
   or polyethylene glycol). Initiators may also present in any amount, for example 0.35
15 to 5% vol/vol of Irgacure. Sensing moieties may be present in any suitable amount,
   for example, oxygen sensing porphyrins (PdP) may be included at a concentration of
   about 200 nM to 1 nM. See, also, Example 1.
   [0109]          In some embodiments, the methods of the invention involve a tissue
   integrating sensor that is formed by embedding or containing the sensing moieties
20 within the tissue-integrating scaffold. The process may begin with combining the
   sensing moieties and the scaffold precursor (e.g. monomer, polymer beads, etc.),
   followed by the formation of the scaffold (e.g. polymerization around template beads,
   multiphoton polymerization, electrospinning, micro- and nano-printing fabrication
   techniques, polymer foaming, salt leaching, etc.) and the removal of any residuals
25 (e.g. dissolution of template beads, removal of unpolymerized monomers, etc.).
   [0110]          Non-limiting exemplary methods for embedding or containing the
   sensing moieties within the tissue-integrating scaffold include (but are not limited to):
   polymerization around template beads with or without subsequent dissolution, matrix
   or other structure, polymerization of a three-dimensional structure using multiphoton
30 polymerization or 3D printing, electrospinning of small fibers, sintering or melting
   scaffold precursor structures, or swelling scaffold to permit entry of sensing moieties
   followed by shrinking of scaffold. In certain embodiments, the method comprises
   polymerizing glucose sensing moieties (nanospheres) into an inverted crystal colloid
                                                27

     WO 2012/048150                                                            PCT/US2011/055157
   (ICC) scaffold. For example, glucose-sensing nanospheres are mixed with ICC
   scaffold pre-polymer during polymerization, causing the nanospheres to be integrated
   into the pHEMA scaffold as detailed in EXAMPLE 1.
   [0111]          In other embodiments, the tissue-integrating sensor is formed by
 5 immobilizing (conjugation or physical entrapment) the sensing moieties on (or to) the
   surface of the tissue-integrating scaffold. The process begins with an existing
   scaffold (e.g. extracellular matrix) or the forming of a scaffold (e.g. ICC, synthetic or
   processed ECM or PoreX Medpore), followed by the attachment of the sensing
   moieties to the scaffold. The method may also include a coating step that protects or
10 holds in place (e.g. physical entrapment) the sensing moieties to the scaffold. The
   coating may have the added benefit(s) of (1) protecting the surface chemistry from
   degradation (e.g. proteases); (2) a diffusion barrier (surface fouling); (3) improving
   the biocompatibility (e.g. PEG, chitosan, pHEMA, etc.); (4) altering or improving the
   surface characteristics (e.g. smoothness, pore size, hydrophilicity, etc.). The method
15 may also include step(s) for the sterilization of the tissue-integrating sensor prior to
   implantation (e.g. ethylene oxide gas, radiation) or in vitro use. Exemplary methods
   for immobilizing the sensing moieties on the tissue-integrating scaffold include, but
   are not limited to: conjugation chemistry, adsorption, electrostatics and covering with
   a continuous coating. Exemplary coatings include PEG, pHEMA and chitosan.
20 [0112]          In still further embodiments, the tissue-integrating sensor is formed by
   constructing a tissue-integrating scaffold made of the sensing moieties. The
   procedure begins with the sensing moieties of some physical dimension smaller than
   the desired scaffold features that are then processed into the tissue-integrating
   material or tissue-integrating precursor. Sensing particles may be bonded together in a
25 tissue-integrating structure through heat or chemical bonds. Pre-polymer solution
   composed of the sensing moieties may be crosslinked in the desired scaffold structure.
   Exemplary methods for constructing a tissue-integrating scaffold made OF the
   sensing moieties include, but are not limited to: bonding the sensing particles using
   heat, pressure or polymerization; electrospinning, thermal or UV initiated crosslinking
30 of sensing polymers into a tissue integrating structure, including multiphoton
   polymerization.
   [0113]          In additional embodiments, a sensing media as described herein is
   formed by tissue-integrating scaffold particles. The process begins with
   deconstructing a tissue-integrating scaffold into particles that maintain their tissue
                                                28

   integrating properties. The particles are mixed with the sensing moieties and then
   reconstructed into desirable scaffold form and function. One example is the
   particulation, e.g., extraction and powdering, of extracellular matrix (ECM) to create
   particles. The ECM particles are then combined with selected sensing moieties. The
 5 mixture may be injected as is or may be combined with a crosslinking agent or
   polymer (e.g. pHEMA) to add mechanically stability.
    [0114]        In some embodiments, a sensor that is formed by constructing simple or
   multi-layer fiber(s) implants. The sensing moiety is part of one or more of the base
   materials from which the fiber scaffold is created or the sensing moiety(ies) are
10 contained or compose one of the layers of sequential building up layers. Some
   example processes for producing such multi-layers fibers and/or for creating the
   layers on top of already formed fibers is extrusion, electrospinning, dip coating, spray
   forming, printing, stamping, rolling, multiphoton polymerization and plasma
   deposition.
15 [0115]           In forming any of the tissue-integrating sensors as described herein, the
   methods may also include step(s) for the sterilization of the tissue-integrating sensor
   prior to implantation (e.g. ethylene oxide gas) or in vitro use.

   immobilized in a hydrogel scaffold
   [0116]           The following describes one proposed method for making a tissue
   integrating sensor as described herein. This method involves the use of non
   crosslinked PMMA templating microspheres and pHEMA as the scaffold material.
25 The PMMA microsphere template was prepared using sieved PMMA spheres (36 um
   with a CV less than 5%) and placing the template beads between two glass slides with
   Teflon spacers. The sintering process included sonicating for at least 10 minutes (one
   or more times) to closely pack the beads. Following sonication, the template is heated
   to a sufficient temperature for a sufficient time to fuse the beads (for example, heat to
30 approximately 177 0C for 24 hours).
   [0117]           The general preparation of an oxygen sensing poly(2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate) (pHEMA) scaffold was performed as follows: HEMA 2-hydroxyehtyl
   methacrylate (56.9 %vol/vol), TEGDMA(triethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate) (2.7
   %vol/vol), ethylene glycol (16.7 %vol/vol), water (16.7 %vol/vol), the photoinitiator

   Irgacure 651 (0.2% vol/vol) and 6.7 %vol/vol of a 5 mM solution of Pd(II) meso
   Tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (PdP) were mixed, yielding a final concentration of
   335 uM PdP in the polymer precursor solution. Polymer, solvents and sensing
   reagents were mixed as described to achieve sufficiently high sensing chemistry
 5 concentration to measurably detect a change in signal through tissue.
    [0118]         The pre-polymer solution was filled into the PMMA. The solution was
   placed under vacuum to remove any bubbles and completely infiltrate the PMMA
   mold and then polymerized by exposing the mold to UV for 5-10 minutes. Next, the
   PMMA microspheres were dissolved by frequent exchange of dichloromethane or
10 other solvent system for 24-48 hours using a Soxhlet extractor or frequent volume
   changes.
    [0119]        Implants comprising reference moieties were also prepared as described
   above except instead of porphyrins, qtracker 800 quantum dots (Invitrogen, 50-800
   nM) were included in the scaffold.
15  [01201         The oxygen sensing media and reference moieties were injected with a
   trocar approximately 2 mm under the surface of mice skin (in different locations on
   the animal). Mice were imaged with Caliper whole animal imaging system (IVISTM)
   with an excitation of 535 nm and emission light was collected at 760nm under
   oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions.
20  [0121]         As shown in Figure 20, both the oxygen sensing implant ("02") and
   the reference moieties ("QD") produced a signal under oxygenated conditions (FIG.
   20A). However, under deoxygenated conditions, only the reference moieties
   produced a detectable signal (FIG. 20B).

    [0123]         The preparation of glucose sensing poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
   (pHEMA) scaffolds was done as follows. The polymer precursor solution was
 5 prepared by mixing HEMA 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (57.1% %vol/vol),
   TEGDMA(triethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate) (2.9 v%vol/vol), ethylene glycol (14.8
   %vol/vol) water (25.1 %vol/vol) and the photoinitiator Irgacure 651 (0.2 % vol/vol).
   Next, the dye/enzyme solution was prepared by adding 5 mg of glucose oxidase
   enzyme (GOx) and equimolar catalyze in 100 uL of DI water and then adding 10uL
10 of 1.5mM Pd(II) meso-Tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (PdP) in DMSO. The
   polymer precursor solution and the dye/enzyme solution were combined in a 1:1 ratio
   for a 39uM final concentration of GOx and 375 uM PdP. The pre-polymer solution
   was filled into the mold and placed under vacuum to remove any bubbles and
   completely infiltrate the PMMA-mold and then polymerized by exposing to UV for 5
15  10 minutes. Next the PMMA microspheres were dissolved by frequent exchange of
   dichloromethane or other solvent system for 24-48 hrs using a Soxhlet extractor or
   frequent volume changes.
    [01241         Disk of the glucose sensor scaffold material were punched from the
   rectangular pieces (microscope slide-shape) and fixed inside an automated flow
20 through system with a built in flourimeter. Glucose solutions (in PBS) of various
   concentrations were flowed over the sensor scaffold discs and fluorescence and
   lifetime readings were collected at various glucose concentrations over successive
   runs (e.g., PdP emission was measured as a function of glucose concentration).
    [0125]         As shown in Figure 21, the signal emitted from the sensor modulated
25 in response to glucose concentration.

   immobilized in a hydrogel scaffold

30 integrating sensor as described herein. This method involves the use of non
   crosslinked PMMA templating microspheres and pHEMA as the scaffold material.
   The PMMA microsphere template is prepared using sieved PMMA spheres (36 um
   with a CV less than 5%) and placing the template beads between two glass slides with
   Teflon spacers. The sintering process includes sonicating for 10 minutes (to closely

   pack the beads), then heating the template to 177'C for 24 hours to fuse the beads (the
   conditions will vary for different ovens and may also vary for different batches of
   beads).
    [01271          Polymer pre-cursor that will form the hydrogel scaffold is then
 5 prepared. The general preparation of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA)
   scaffold is as follows: In separate vials, two solutions are prepared: 0.89 ml of a 20%
   solution of APS (ammonium persulfate) in water and 0.3 ml of a 15% solution
   TEMED (tetramethylethylenediamine) in water. To a third vial the HEMA 2
   hydroxyehtyl methacrylate (9.26 ml), TEGDMA(triethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate)
10 (0.46 ml), ethylene glycol (2.6 ml) and water (2.68 ml) are added by volume
   measurement and mixed.
    [0128]          The TEMED solution is added to the main pre-polymer vial. Sensing
   nanospheres ranging from 2-95% volume of the total reactant volume (e.g. 5 ml of
    100-200 nm alginate nanospheres containing fluorescent glucose sensing chemistry)
15 are mixed with the pre-polymer solution. The pre-polymer solution is filled into the
   mold and then the APS solution added. The solution is placed under vacuum to
   remove any bubbles and completely infiltrate the PMMM-mold and then polymerized
   at room temperature for one hour. Next, the PMMA microspheres are dissolved by
   frequent exchange of dichloromethane or other solvent system for 24-48 hrs using a
20 Soxhlet extractor or frequent volume changes.
   Example 4: Implantation
   [01291           A tissue integrating sensor produced in rods that are 300-500 um in
   diameter and 5 mm long are placed in a 19-23 Gauge insertion needle, trochar,
25 modified biopsy device or other devices engineered for injection under the skin. The
   sensor is optionally dehydrated or compressed before insertion to allow for the use of
   a smaller insertion needle.
   [0130]           Upon insertion, skin is pinched up so that the insertion needle is placed
   parallel to the surface of the skin 1-4 mm beneath the surface. Fluid or a reverse
30 displacement plunger (or trochar) is used to leave the sensor in the tissue as the
   syringe is withdrawn. Insertion site may include any subcutaneous area, typically the
   abdomen, arm and thigh.
