[001]       This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 61/527,335, filed on August 25, 2011, and is a continuation-in-part of
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/486,754, filed on June 1, 2012, which claims
priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No 61/493,309, filed on
June 3, 2011, the entire disclosure of each of these applications being incorporated
herein in its entirety by this specific reference.
                                        BACKGROUND
[002]       The present invention generally relates to dermal filler compositions, and
more specifically relates to injectable dermal filler compositions for aesthetic and health
purposes.
[003]       Skin aging is a progressive phenomenon, occurs over time and can be
affected by lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco and sun exposure.
Aging of the facial skin can be characterized by atrophy, slackening, and fattening.
Atrophy corresponds to a massive reduction of the thickness of skin tissue. Slackening
of the subcutaneous tissues leads to an excess of skin and ptosis and leads to the
appearance of drooping cheeks and eye lids. Fattening refers to an increase in excess
weight by swelling of the bottom of the face and neck. These changes are typically
associated with dryness, loss of elasticity, and rough texture.
[004]       Ideally, injectable dermal      fillers should have the following properties:
biocompatibility; safety; stability at the implant site; and the ability to maintain their
volume, remain pliable, induce minimal foreign body reactions and not cause foreign
body granuloma. Many dermal fillers have been used, including autologous fat, bovine
collagen, paraffin, fluid silicone, poly-tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon, DuPont, Wilmington,
                                                  1

    WO 2013/028904                                                    PCT/US2012/052125
Del.) and polymer and silicone particles. Problems with grafts include uneven survival,
variable resorption, formation of nodules and donor-site morbidity.
[005]      For these reasons, polymer particle suspension fillers have been developed
and are fairly commonly used.         Fillers composed of resorbable materials include
collagen, hyaluronic acid, polymethylacrylate, dextran, polylactic acid substances and,
in recent decades, those consisting of viscous fluids or polymer particle suspensions.
These fillers have been used to correct soft-tissue defects, as well as fill in soft-tissue
volume around the lips and nasolabial region.
[006]      Currently available dermal filler materials can be broadly subcategorized as
nonbiodegradable (permanent) or biodegradable (temporary). The biodegradable
materials can be further subdivided into those of intermediate or long duration.
Permanent or nonresorbable fillers are encapsulated with fibrous tissue and escape
phagocytosis.       Examples of permanent dermal fillers include liquid silicone (eg,
Silikon*),   solid  silicon particles    in suspension   (eg,   Bioplastique*),   polymethyl
methacrylate microspheres with bovine collagen (eg, Artecoll*), acrylic hydrogel
particles with unmodified hyaluronic acid (eg, Dermalive*), calcium hydoxylapatite (eg,
Radiesse*, formerly called Radiance), and various polyacrylamide gel formulations (eg,
Aquamid*). Many of these permanent fillers are associated with a risk of delayed
foreign body-type reactions.
[007]      Common        medium-term    fillers-those that are resorbed       after several
months-include        hyaluronic   acid     derivatives, polylactic  acids    and    calcium
hydroxylapatite [CaHA]. Resorbable fillers eventually are phagocytosed.
[008]      Biodegradable dermal fillers are commonly based on hyaluronic acid (HA),
also known as hyaluronan.        Hyaluronan is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan that is
distributed widely throughout the human body in connective, epithelial, and neural
tissues. Hyaluronan is abundant in the different layers of the skin, where it has multiple
functions such as, e.g., to ensure good hydration, to assist in the organization of the
extracellular matrix, to act as a filler material; and to participate in tissue repair
mechanisms.       However, with age, the quantity of hyaluronan, collagen, elastin, and
                                                2

     WO 2013/028904                                                 PCT/US2012/052125
other matrix polymers present in the skin decreases. For example, repeated exposed
to ultra violet light, e.g., from the sun, causes dermal cells to both decrease their
production of hyaluronan as well as increase the rate of its degradation.              This
hyaluronan loss results in various skin conditions such as, e.g., imperfects, defects,
diseases and/or disorders, and the like.      For instance, there is a strong correlation
between the water content in the skin and levels of hyaluronan in the dermal tissue. As
skin ages, the amount and quality of hyaluronan in the skin is reduced. These changes
lead to drying and wrinkling of the skin.
[009]       Originally, dermal filler compositions comprising hyaluronan where made
from naturally-occurring polymers, which exist in an uncrosslinked state.         Although
exhibiting excellent biocompatibility and affinity for water molecules, naturally-occurring
hyaluronan exhibits poor biomechanical properties as a dermal filler.        One primary
reason is that because this polymer is uncrosslinked, it is highly soluble and, as such, is
cleared rapidly when administered into a skin region. This in vivo clearance is primarily
achieved by rapid degradation of the polymers, principally enzymatic degradation via
hyaluronidase and chemical degradation via free-radicals.            Thus, while still in
commercial use, compositions comprising uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymers tend to
degrade within a few days after administration and thus require fairly frequent
reinjection to maintain their skin improving effect.
[0010]      To minimize the effect of these in vivo degradation pathways, matrix
polymers are crosslinked to one another to form a stabilized hydrogel.             Because
hydrogels comprising crosslinked matrix polymers are a more solid substance, dermal
fillers comprising such hydrogels remain in place at the implant site longer. In addition,
these hydrogels are more suitable as a dermal filler because the more solid nature
thereof improves the mechanical properties of the filler, allowing the filler to better lift
and fill a skin region. Hyaluronan polymers are typically crosslinked with a crosslinking
agent to form covalent bonds between hyaluronan polymers.                Such crosslinked
polymers form a less water soluble hydrogel network that is more resistant to
degradation, and thus requires less frequent reinjection, than the non-crosslinked
hyaluronan compositions.

   WO 2013/028904                                                    PCT/US2012/052125
[0011]      Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid or AsA, is well known as an
antioxidant which reduces, and thereby neutralizes, reactive oxygen species such as
hydrogen peroxide, thus reducing oxidative stress for various clinical benefits, including
treating cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic inflammatory diseases, diabetes,
and conditions with severe burns. For example, among other benefits, vitamin C acts
as an anti-inflammatory, and promotes collagenesis and angiogenesis. Vitamin C is
known to promote collagenesis and/or angiogenesis by functioning as a cofactor in
enzymatic reactions to promote collagen formation, develop and maintain blood vessels
and cartilage. Vitamin C is known to inhibit biological functions of tyrosinase to prevent
melanin formation or lightening melanin pigmentation.
[0012]      Vitamin C is generally unstable upon exposure to air, light and heat. It is also
considered cytotoxic at certain levels. Vitamin C is normally derivatised to a stable form
for cosmetic applications. There are a few stabilized Vitamin C forms. Examples are L
ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G), ascobyl 3-aminopropyl phosphate(Vitagen), sodium
ascorbyl phosphate (AA2P), etc. When vitamin C (for example vitamin C derivative
AA2G) is physically mixed with hyaluronic acid gel and injected into the skin, the vitamin
C is fully released from the mixture in less than one week.
[0013]      It would be desirable to provide an injectable hylaluronic acid-based
composition with vitamin C, or another vitamin, having a sustained release rate, that is,
a release rate over weeks or even months rather than a few days. However, it has
proven difficult to develop stable, effective, sustained release dermal filler products
which include vitamins.      The present invention provides improved hyaluronic acid
based dermal filler compositions including conjugated vitamins, for example, vitamin
derivatives.
                                         SUMMARY
[0014]      The present invention provides novel dermal fillers useful for treating skin
conditions.    More specifically, the present invention provides effective, long lasting,
therapeutic dermal filler compositions generally comprising a biocompatible polymer, for

example, hyaluronic acid, and a vitamin, for example, vitamin C, for example a vitamin
C derivative.
[0015]      In one aspect of the invention, the polymer is a polysaccharide, for example,
hyaluronic acid. The hyaluronic acid includes a crosslinked component. The vitamin
may comprise vitamin C, for example, a Vitamin C derivative.        More specifically, the
vitamin C is at least one of L-ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G), ascobyl 3-aminopropyl
phosphate (Vitagen) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (AA2P).
[0016]      Vitamins are defined generally as any of a group of organic compounds that
are essential for normal growth and nutrition and are required in small quantities in the
diet because they cannot be synthesized by the body.
[0017]      In one aspect of the invention, the vitamin comprises a vitamin C derivative
known under the name AA2G, available from Hayashibara Company, Ltd, Okayama
Japan. These and other suitable compounds are described in detail in U.S. Patent No.

specifications of which are incorporated herein by this reference.
[0018]      In one aspect of the invention, the vitamin is a vitamin derivative, and is
covalently conjugated to the polymer by a suitable reaction process, for example,
etherification, amidization and estherification.
[0019]      The conjugation degree is up to about 5 mol%, up to about 10 mol%, up to
about 15 mol%, up to about 20 mol%, up to about 25 mol%, up to about 30 mol%, or

active vitamin C under endogenous enzymatic conditions. Typical endogenous
enzymes are a-glucosdiase, phosphatase, and hyalurondiase.
[0022]     In another aspect of the invention, the active vitamin C released from the
injectable dermal fillers has anti-aging effects by functioning as a radical scavenger.
[0023]     In yet another aspect of the invention, the active vitamin C released from the
injectable dermal filler stimulates interfacial collagenesis between gel and tissue
interface.

provided, including introducing into the skin a composition in accordance with the
invention.
[0025]     High molecular weight HA (sometimes herein referred to as "HMW HA") as
used herein, generally describes a hyaluronic acid having a molecular weight of at least
about 1.0 million Daltons (mw > 106 Da or 1 MDa) to about 4.0 MDa. For example, the
high molecular weight HA in the present compositions may have a molecular weight of
about 2.0 MDa.       In another example, the high molecular weight HA may have a
molecular weight of about 2.8 MDa.
[0026]     Low molecular weight HA (sometimes herein referred to as "LMW HA") as
used herein, generally describes a hyaluronic acid having a molecular weight of less
than about 1.0 MDa.        Low molecular weight HA can have a molecular weight of
between about 200,000 Da (0.2 MDa) to less than about 1.0 MDa, for example,
between about 200,000 Da (0.2 MDa) to about 990,000 Da (.99MDa), for example,
between about 300,000 Da (0.3 M Da) to about 750,000 Da. (0.75 MDa).

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0044]     In one aspect of the invention, dermal filler compositions are provided, the
compositions     generally comprising    a biocompatible polymer, for example,            a
polysaccharide such as a crosslinked hyaluronic acid, and a vitamin C derivative
covalently conjugated to the polymer. The composition is provides sustained release of
the vitamin C for skin neocollagenesis as well as other therapeutic or cosmetic benefits.
When introduced into the skin, for example intradermally, the composition reacts with
endogeneous enzymes in the body, and over time, bioactive vitamin C is generated in
vivo, via enzymatic cleavages. As vitamin C is released from the composition over a
period of weeks or months, its attendant benefits are made available to the body.

[0048]     In   an   exemplary     embodiment        of  the   invention,   the   polymer    is
glycosaminoglycan.     The hydrogel composition disclosed herein can further comprise
two or more different glycosaminoglycan polymers.                As used herein, the term
"glycosaminoglycan" is synonymous with "GAG" and "mucopolysaccharide" and refers
to long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide units. The
repeating unit consists of a hexose (six-carbon sugar) or a hexuronic acid, linked to a
hexosamine (six-carbon sugar containing nitrogen) and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts thereof. Members of the GAG family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or
hexuronic acid unit they contain, such as, e.g., glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, galactose,
galactosamine, glucosamine) and may also vary in the geometry of the glycosidic
linkage.    Any glycosaminoglycan polymer is useful in the hydrogel compositions
disclosed herein with the proviso that the glycosaminoglycan polymer improves a
condition of the skin. Non-limiting examples of glycosaminoglycans include chondroitin
sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, hyaluronan.         Non-limiting examples of an
acceptable salt of a glycosaminoglycans includes sodium salts, potassium salts,
magnesium salts, calcium salts, and combinations thereof. Glycosaminoglycan and
their resulting polymers useful in the hydrogel compositions and methods disclosed
herein are described in, e.g., Piron and Tholin, Polysaccharide Crosslinking, Hydrogel

  [0049]     Aspects of the present invention provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
 comprising a chondroitin sulfate polymer. As used herein, the term "chondroitin sulfate
  polymer" refers to an unbranched, sulfated polymer of variable length comprising
 disaccharides of two alternating monosaccharides of D-glucuronic acid (GIcA) and N
 acetyl-D-galactosamine (GaINAc) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.           A
 chondroitin sulfate polymer may also include D-glucuronic acid residues that are
 epimerized into L-iduronic acid (IdoA), in which case the resulting disaccharide is
  referred to as dermatan sulfate. A chondroitin sulfate polymer can have a chain of over
  100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and
 quantities.   Chondroitin sulfate polymers are an important structural component of
 cartilage and provide much of its resistance to compression.       Any chondroitin sulfate
  polymer is useful in the compositions disclosed herein with the proviso that the
 chondroitin sulfate polymer improves a condition of the skin.     Non-limiting examples of
  pharmaceutically acceptable salts of chondroitin sulfate include sodium chondroitin
 sulfate,   potassium   chondroitin  sulfate,  magnesium     chondroitin   sulfate, calcium
 chondroitin sulfate, and combinations thereof.
  [0050]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
 comprising a keratan sulfate polymer.        As used herein, the term "keratan sulfate
  polymer" refers to a polymer of variable length comprising disaccharide units, which
 themselves     include  p-D-galactose    and   N-acetyl-D-galactosamine      (GaINAc)  and
  pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Disaccharides within the repeating region of
  keratan sulfate may be fucosylated and N-Acetylneuraminic acid caps the end of the
 chains. Any keratan sulfate polymer is useful in the compositions disclosed herein with
                                              11

the proviso that the keratan sulfate polymer improves a condition of the skin.            Non
limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of keratan sulfate include
sodium keratan sulfate, potassium keratan sulfate, magnesium keratan sulfate, calcium
keratan sulfate, and combinations thereof.
[0051]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
comprising a hyaluronan polymer. As used herein, the term "hyaluronic acid polymer"
is synonymous with "HA polymer", "hyaluronic acid polymer", and "hyaluronate polymer"
refers to an anionic, non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan polymer comprising disaccharide
units, which      themselves    include   D-glucuronic  acid and    D-N-acetylglucosamine
monomers, linked together via alternating P-1,4 and P-1,3 glycosidic bonds and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Hyaluronan polymers can be purified from
animal and non-animal sources. Polymers of hyaluronan can range in size from about
5,000 Da to about 20,000,000 Da.               Any hyaluronan polymer is useful in the
compositions disclosed herein with the proviso that the hyaluronan improves a condition
of the skin. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of hyaluronan
include sodium hyaluronan, potassium hyaluronan, magnesium hyaluronan, calcium
hyaluronan, and combinations thereof.
[0052]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
comprising a crosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymer.             As used herein, the term
"crosslinked"    refers to the     intermolecular bonds joining the individual polymer
molecules, or monomer chains, into a more stable structure like a gel.            As such, a
crosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymer has at least one intermolecular bond joining at
least one individual polymer molecule to another one.                   The crosslinking of
glycosaminoglycan polymers typically result in the formation of a hydrogel.              Such
hydrogels have high viscosity and require considerable force to extrude through a fine
needle.    Glycosaminoglycan polymers disclosed herein may be crosslinked using
dialdehydes     and    disulfides    crosslinking  agents   including,    without   limitation,
multifunctional PEG-based crosslinking agents, divinyl sulfones, diglycidyl ethers, and
bis-epoxides, biscarbodiimide.         Non-limiting examples of hyaluronan crosslinking
agents include multifunctional PEG-based crosslinking agents like pentaerythritol
tetraglycidyl ether (PETGE), divinyl sulfone (DVS),         1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether

[0094]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein that exhibits a complex modulus, an elastic modulus, a viscous
modulus and/or a tan 5. The compositions as disclosed herein are viscoelastic in that
the composition has an elastic component (solid-like such as, e.g., crosslinked
glycosaminoglycan polymers) and a viscous component (liquid-like such as, e.g.,
uncrosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymers or a carrier phase) when a force is applied
(stress, deformation).     The rheological attribute that described this property is the
complex modulus (G*), which defines a composition's total resistance to deformation.
The complex modulus is a complex number with a real and imaginary part: G*=G'+iG".
The absolute value of G* is Abs(G*) = Sqrt(G' 2 +G" 2 ). The complex modulus can be
defined as the sum of the elastic modulus (G') and the viscous modulus (G"). Falcone,

[0095]     Elastic modulus, or modulus of elasticity, refers to the ability of a hydrogel
material to resists deformation, or, conversely, an object's tendency to be non
permanently deformed when a force is applied to it. Elastic modulus characterizes the
firmness of a composition and is also known as the storage modulus because it
describes the storage of energy from the motion of the composition.           The elastic
modulus describes the interaction between elasticity and strength (G' = stress/strain)
and, as such, provides a quantitative measurement of a composition's hardness or
softness. The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress-strain
                                            28

curve in the elastic deformation region: A = stress/strain, where A is the elastic modulus
in Pascal's; stress is the force causing the deformation divided by the area to which the
force is applied; and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the original
state of the object. Although depending on the speed at which the force is applied, a
stiffer composition will have a higher elastic modulus and it will take a greater force to
deform the material a given distance, such as, e.g., an injection. Specifying how
stresses are to be measured, including directions, allows for many types of elastic
moduli to be defined.      The three primary elastic moduli are tensile modulus, shear
modulus, and bulk modulus.
[0096]     Viscous modulus is also known as the loss modulus because it describes the
energy that is lost as viscous dissipation. Tan 5 is the ratio of the viscous modulus and
the elastic modulus, tan 5 = G"/G'. Falcone, supra, 2009. For tan 5 values disclosed in
the present specification, a tan 5 is obtained from the dynamic modulus at a frequency
of 1 Hz. A lower tan 5 corresponds to a stiffer, harder, or more elastic composition.

[00100]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein having a transparency and/or translucency. Transparency (also called
pellucidity or diaphaneity) is the physical property of allowing light to pass through a
material, whereas translucency (also called translucence or translucidity) only allows
light to pass through diffusely. The opposite property is opacity. Transparent materials
are clear, while translucent ones cannot be seen through clearly.         The silk fibroin

hydrogels disclosed herein may, or may not, exhibit optical properties such as
transparency and translucency. In certain cases, e.g., superficial line filling, it would be
an advantage to have an opaque hydrogel.          In other cases such as development of a
lens or a "humor" for filling the eye, it would be an advantage to have a translucent
hydrogel. These properties could be modified by affecting the structural distribution of
the hydrogel material. Factors used to control a hydrogel's optical properties include,
without limitation, polymer concentration, gel crystallinity, and hydrogel homogeneity.
[00101]    When light encounters a material, it can interact with it in several different
ways. These interactions depend on the nature of the light (its wavelength, frequency,
energy, etc.) and the nature of the material. Light waves interact with an object by some
combination of reflection, and transmittance with refraction.         As such, an optically
transparent material allows much of the light that falls on it to be transmitted, with little
light being reflected. Materials which do not allow the transmission of light are called
optically opaque or simply opaque.
[00102]    In an embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is optically
transparent.    In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition transmits, e.g.,
about 75% of the light, about 80% of the light, about 85% of the light, about 90% of the
light, about 95% of the light, or about 100% of the light.          In other aspects of this

[00106]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a composition disclosed

properties necessary to administer the composition into a skin region of an individual
using an injection device with a fine needle. As used herein, the term "fine needle"
refers to a needle that is 27 gauge or smaller. Injectability of a composition disclosed

the art.
[00107]    In aspect of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is

[00109]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein that exhibits cohesivity.      Cohesivity, also referred to as cohesion
cohesive attraction, cohesive force, or compression force is a physical property of a
material, caused by the intermolecular attraction between like-molecules within the
material that acts to unite the molecules. Cohesivity is expressed in terms of grams
force (gmf). Cohesiveness is affected by, among other factors, the molecular weight
ratio of the initial free glycosaminoglycan polymer, the degree of crosslinking of
glycosaminoglycan polymers, the amount of residual free glycosaminoglycan polymers
following crosslinking, and the pH of the hydrogel composition. A composition should
be sufficiently cohesive as to remain localized to a site of administration. Additionally,
in certain applications, a sufficient cohesiveness is important for a composition to retain
its shape, and thus functionality, in the event of mechanical load cycling. As such, in
one embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits cohesivity, on par
with water.     In yet another embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein
exhibits sufficient cohesivity to remain localized to a site of administration.        In still
another embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits sufficient
cohesivity to retain its shape.       In a further embodiment, a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein exhibits sufficient cohesivity to retain its shape and functionality.
[00110]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein that exhibits a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity. As used herein,
the term "osmolarity" refers to the concentration of osmotically active solutes in solution.
As used herein, the term "a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity" refers to an

osmolarity in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living
organism.     As such, administration of a hydrogel composition as disclosed herein
exhibits an osmolarity that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental
effect when administered to a mammal. Osmolarity is expressed in terms of osmoles of
osmotically active solute per liter of solvent (Osmol/L or Osm/L). Osmolarity is distinct
from molarity because it measures moles of osmotically active solute particles rather
than moles of solute. The distinction arises because some compounds can dissociate
in solution, whereas others cannot. The osmolarity of a solution can be calculated from
the following expression: Osmol/L = 7 pi     n1i Ci, where p is the osmotic coefficient, which
accounts for the degree of non-ideality of the solution; q is the number of particles (e.g.
ions) into which a molecule dissociates; and C is the molar concentration of the solute;
and i is the index representing the identity of a particular solute. The osmolarity of a
hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be measured using a conventional method
that measures solutions.
[00111]     In an embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits a
physiologically-acceptable osmolarity.      In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel
composition exhibits an osmolarity of, e.g., about 100 mOsm/L, about 150 mOsm/L,
about 200 mOsm/L, about 250 mOsm/L, about 300 mOsm/L, about 350 mOsm/L, about
400 mOsm/L, about 450 mOsm/L, or about 500 mOsm/L.                   In other aspects of this
embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolarity of, e.g., at least 100
mOsm/L, at least 150 mOsm/L, at least 200 mOsm/L, at least 250 mOsm/L, at least 300
mOsm/L, at least 350 mOsm/L, at least 400 mOsm/L, at least 450 mOsm/L, or at least
500 mOsm/L. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits
an osmolarity of, e.g., at most 100 mOsm/L, at most 150 mOsm/L, at most 200
mOsm/L, at most 250 mOsm/L, at most 300 mOsm/L, at most 350 mOsm/L, at most
400 mOsm/L, at most 450 mOsm/L, or at most 500 mOsm/L. In still other aspects of
this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolarity of, e.g., about 100
mOsm/L to about 500 mOsm/L, about 200 mOsm/L to about 500 mOsm/L, about 200
mOsm/L to about 400 mOsm/L, about 300 mOsm/L to about 400 mOsm/L, about 270

[00112]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein that exhibits substantial stability. As used herein, the term "stability" or
"stable" when referring to a hydrogel composition disclosed herein refers to a
composition that is not prone to degrading, decomposing, or breaking down to any
substantial or significant degree while stored before administration to an individual. As
used herein, the term "substantial heat stability", "substantially heat stable", "autoclave
stable", or "steam sterilization stable" refers to a hydrogel composition disclosed herein
that is substantially stable when subjected to a heat treatment as disclosed herein.
[00113]    Stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be determined by
subjecting a hydrogel composition to a heat treatment, such as, e.g., steam sterilization
at normal pressure or under pressure (e.g., autoclaving). Preferably the heat treatment
is carried out at a temperature of at least about 100    OC for between about one minute
and about 10 minutes. Substantial stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein
can be evaluated 1) by determining the change in the extrusion force (AF) of a hydrogel
composition disclosed herein after sterilization, where the change in extrusion force less
2N is indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (the
extrusion force of a hydrogel composition with the specified additives) minus (the
extrusion force of the a hydrogel composition without the added additives); and/or 2) by
determining the change in rheological properties of a hydrogel composition disclosed
herein after sterilization, where the change in tan 5 1 Hz of less than 0.1 is indicative of
a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (tan 5 1 Hz of gel
formulation with additives) minus (tan 5 1 Hz of gel formulation without additives). As
such, a substantially stable hydrogel composition disclosed herein retains one or more
of the following characteristics after sterilization: homogeneousness, extrusion force,
cohesiveness, hyaluronan concentration, agent(s) concentration, osmolarity, pH, or
other rheological characteristics desired by the hydrogel before the heat treatment.

processed using a heat treatment of, e.g., at least 100 C, at least 105 C, at least 110
 C, at least 115 C, at least 120 C, at least 125 C, or at least 130 C. In yet other

[00115]    Long term stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be
determined by subjecting a hydrogel composition to a heat treatment, such as, e.g.,
storage in an about 45       0C  environment for about 60 days.      Long term stability of a
hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be evaluated 1) by assessing the clarity and
color of a hydrogel composition after the 45         0C  heat treatment, with a clear and
uncolored hydrogel composition being indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel
composition; 2) by determining the change in the extrusion force (AF) of a hydrogel
composition disclosed herein after the 45        0C  heat treatment, where the change in
extrusion force less 2N is indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition as
measured by (the extrusion force of a hydrogel composition with the specified additives
before the 45      0C   heat treatment) minus (the extrusion force of the a hydrogel
composition with the specified additives after the 45      0C  heat treatment); and/or 3) by
determining the change in rheological properties of a hydrogel composition disclosed
herein after sterilization, where the change in tan 5 1 Hz of less than 0.1 is indicative of
a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (tan 5 1 Hz of gel
formulation with the specified additives before the 45    0C  heat treatment) minus (tan 5 1

an auxiliary. An excipient generally is mixed with an active ingredient, or permitted to
dilute or enclose the active ingredient and can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid agent. It
is also envisioned that a pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein can include
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that facilitate processing of an
active ingredient into pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. Insofar as any
pharmacologically acceptable excipient is not incompatible with the active ingredient, its
use in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is contemplated.                   Non-limiting
examples     of pharmacologically acceptable excipients can              be found     in,   e.g.,

buffers include acetate buffers, borate buffers, citrate buffers, neutral buffered salines,
phosphate buffers, and phosphate buffered              salines.    Any concentration of a
pharmaceutically acceptable buffer can be useful in formulating a pharmaceutical
composition disclosed herein, with the proviso that a therapeutically effective amount of
the active ingredient is recovered using this effective concentration of buffer.         Non
limiting examples of concentrations of physiologically-acceptable buffers occur within
the range of about 0.1 mM to about 900 mM. The pH of pharmaceutically acceptable
buffers may be adjusted, provided that the resulting preparation is pharmaceutically
acceptable.    It is understood that acids or bases can be used to adjust the pH of a
pharmaceutical composition as needed. Any buffered pH level can be useful in
formulating a pharmaceutical composition, with the proviso that a therapeutically
effective amount of the matrix polymer active ingredient is recovered using this effective
pH level.     Non-limiting examples of physiologically-acceptable pH occur within the
range of about pH 5.0 to about pH 8.5. For example, the pH of a hydrogel composition
disclosed herein can be about 5.0 to about 8.0, or about 6.5 to about 7.5, about 7.0 to
about 7.4, or about 7.1 to about 7.3.

[00123]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method of treating a
soft tissue condition of an individual by administering a hydrogel composition disclosed
herein.    As used herein, the term "treating," refers to reducing or eliminating in an
individual a cosmetic or clinical symptom of a soft tissue condition characterized by a
soft tissue imperfection, defect, disease, and/or disorder; or delaying or preventing in an
individual the onset of a cosmetic or clinical symptom of a condition characterized by a
soft tissue imperfection, defect, disease, and/or disorder.        For example, the term
"treating" can mean reducing a symptom of a condition characterized by a soft tissue
defect, disease, and/or disorder by, e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at
least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or at least 100%. The
effectiveness of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein in treating a condition
characterized by a soft tissue defect, disease, and/or disorder can be determined by
observing one or more cosmetic, clinical symptoms, and/or physiological indicators
associated with the condition. An improvement in a soft tissue defect, disease, and/or
disorder also can be indicated by a reduced need for a concurrent therapy. Those of
skill in the art will know the appropriate symptoms or indicators associated with specific
soft tissue defect, disease, and/or disorder and will know how to determine if an
individual is a candidate for treatment with a compound or composition disclosed
herein.
[00124]     A hydrogel composition is administered to an individual.       An individual is
typically a human being of any age, gender or race. Typically, any individual who is a
candidate for a conventional procedure to treat a soft tissue condition is a candidate for
a method disclosed herein. Although a subject experiencing the signs of aging skin is
an adult, subjects experiencing premature aging or other skin conditions suitable for
treatment (for example, a scar) can also be treated with a hydrogel composition
                                             42

   WO 2013/028904                                                    PCT/US2012/052125
disclosed herein.     In addition, the presently disclosed hydrogel compositions and
methods may apply to individuals seeking a small/moderate enlargement, shape
change or contour alteration of a body part or region, which may not be technically
possible or aesthetically acceptable with existing soft tissue implant technology. Pre
operative evaluation typically includes routine history and physical examination in
addition to thorough informed consent disclosing all relevant risks and benefits of the
procedure.
[00125]    The hydrogel composition and methods disclosed herein are useful in treating
a soft tissue condition. A soft tissue condition includes, without limitation, a soft tissue
imperfection, defect, disease, and/or disorder. Non-limiting examples of a soft tissue
condition include breast imperfection, defect, disease and/or disorder, such as, e.g., a
breast augmentation,      a breast reconstruction, mastopexy, micromastia, thoracic
hypoplasia, Poland's syndrome, defects due to implant complications like capsular
contraction and/or rupture; a facial imperfection, defect, disease or disorder, such as,
e.g., a facial augmentation, a facial reconstruction, a mesotherapy, Parry-Romberg
syndrome, lupus erythematosus profundus, dermal divots, scars, sunken checks, thin
lips, nasal imperfections or defects, retro-orbital imperfections or defects, a facial fold,
line and/or wrinkle like a glabellar line, a nasolabial line, a perioral line, and/or a
marionette line, and/or other contour deformities or imperfections of the face; a neck
imperfection, defect, disease or disorder; a skin imperfection, defect, disease and/or
disorder; other soft tissue imperfections, defects, diseases and/or disorders, such as,
e.g., an augmentation or a reconstruction of the upper arm, lower arm, hand, shoulder,
back, torso including abdomen, buttocks, upper leg, lower leg including calves, foot
including plantar fat pad, eye, genitals, or other body part, region or area, or a disease
or disorder affecting these body parts, regions or areas; urinary incontinence, fecal
incontinence, other forms of incontinence; and gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD).     As used herein, the term "mesotherapy" refers to a non-surgical cosmetic
treatment technique of the skin involving           intra-epidermal,  intra-dermal,  and/or
subcutaneous injection of an agent administered as small multiple droplets into the
epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, and/or the dermis.

and/or cosmetic measures: increased breast size, altered breast shape, altered breast
contour, sustained engraftment, reduction in the risk of capsular contraction, decreased
rate of liponecrotic cyst formation, improved patient satisfaction and/or quality of life,
and decreased use of breast implant.
[00128]    As another example, effectiveness of the compositions and methods in
treating a facial soft tissue may be manifested by one or more of the following clinical
and/or cosmetic measures: increased size, shape, and/or contour of facial feature like
increased size, shape, and/or contour of lip, cheek or eye region; altered size, shape,
and/or contour of facial feature like altered size, shape, and/or contour of lip, cheek or
eye region shape; reduction or elimination of a wrinkle, fold or line in the skin;
resistance to a wrinkle, fold or line in the skin; rehydration of the skin; increased
elasticity to the skin; reduction or elimination of skin roughness; increased and/or
improved skin tautness; reduction or elimination of stretch lines or marks; increased

[00132]     Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, administering a hydrogel
composition disclosed herein.         As used herein, the term "administering" means any
delivery mechanism that provides a composition disclosed herein to an individual that
potentially results in a clinically, therapeutically, or experimentally beneficial result. The
actual delivery mechanism used to administer a composition to an individual can be
determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art by taking into account factors,
including, without limitation, the type of skin condition, the location of the skin condition,
the cause of the skin condition, the severity of the skin condition, the degree of relief
desired, the duration of relief desired, the particular composition used, the rate of
excretion of the particular composition used, the pharmacodynamics of the particular
composition used, the nature of the other compounds included in the particular
composition used, the particular route of administration, the particular characteristics,
history and risk factors of the individual, such as, e.g., age, weight, general health and
the like, or any combination thereof. In an aspect of this embodiment, a composition
disclosed herein is administered to a skin region of an individual by injection.
[00133]     The route of administration of a hydrogel composition to an individual patient
will typically be determined based on the cosmetic and/or clinical effect desired by the
individual and/or physician and the body part or region being treated. A composition
disclosed herein may be administered by any means known to persons of ordinary skill
in the art including, without limitation, syringe with needle, a pistol (for example, a
hydropneumatic-compression           pistol), catheter,   topically, or  by   direct   surgical
                                               46

implantation. The hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be administered into a
skin region such as, e.g., a dermal region or a hypodermal region. For example, a
hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be injected utilizing needles with a diameter
of about 0.26 mm to about 0.4 mm and a length ranging from about 4 mm to about 14
mm. Alternately, the needles can be 21 to 32 G and have a length of about 4 mm to
about 70 mm.       Preferably, the needle is a single-use needle.      The needle can be
combined with a syringe, catheter, and/or a pistol.
[00134]    In addition, a composition disclosed herein can be administered once, or over
a plurality of times. Ultimately, the timing used will follow quality care standards. For
example, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be administered once or over
several sessions with the sessions spaced apart by a few days, or weeks.                For
instance, an individual can be administered a hydrogel composition disclosed herein
every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days or every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. The administration a
hydrogel composition disclosed herein to an individual can be on a monthly or bi
monthly basis or administered every 3, 6, 9, or 12 months.
[00135]    For a breast soft tissue replacement procedure, the route of administration
may include axillary, periareolar, and/or inframammary routes.          Alternatively or in
addition,   a composition     may be delivered       through  a transaxillary endoscopic
subpectoral approach.      For a facial soft tissue replacement procedure, the route of
administration can be frontal, temporal, zygomatic, periocular, amdibula, perioral or chin
routes.   In urinary incontinence procedures, the route of administration may include
transurethral or periurethral routes. Alternatively or in addition, administration may be
delivered via an antegrade route. The routes discussed herein do not exclude the use
of multiple routes to achieve the desired clinical effect.
[00136]    Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a dermal region.      As
used herein, the term "dermal region" refers to the region of skin comprising the
epidermal-dermal junction and the dermis including the superficial dermis (papillary
region) and the deep dermis (reticular region). The skin is composed of three primary
layers: the epidermis, which provides waterproofing and serves as a barrier to infection;
the dermis, which serves as a location for the appendages of skin; and the hypodermis
                                             47

   WO 2013/028904                                                      PCT/US2012/052125
(subcutaneous adipose layer).        The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and is
nourished by diffusion from the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the
epidermis are keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkels cells.
[00137]    The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of
connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly
connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane.                   It also harbors many
Mechanoreceptor/nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains
the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels
and blood vessels. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste
removal from its own cells as well as from the Stratum basale of the epidermis. The
dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the
epidermis, called the papillary region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular
region.
[00138]    The papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. It is
named for its fingerlike projections called papillae that extend toward the epidermis. The
papillae provide the dermis with a "bumpy" surface that interdigitates with the
epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin. The reticular
region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of
dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration
of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein
fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Also located
within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands,
receptors, nails, and blood vessels. Tattoo ink is held in the dermis. Stretch marks from
pregnancy are also located in the dermis.
[00139]    The hypodermis lies below the dermis. Its purpose is to attach the dermal
region of the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood
vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue and elastin. The main cell
types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes (the hypodermis contains 50% of
body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.

of the invention have shown clear advantages over physical mixing of vitamin C with HA
in terms of release profile. The conjugated HA gels are stable enough in simple in-vitro
release condition ( no enzymes involved). It is envisioned that the conjugated vitamin C
gels show sustained release with aid of enzymes. In case of conjugated AA2G gels
through etherification, the release of active Vitamin C is triggered by a-glucosidase
and/or hyaluronidase. In terms of conjugated Vitagen or AA2P gels via amidization, the
release of active vitamin C is triggered by phosphatase. In case of conjugated AA2G
gels, the release of active vitamin C is triggered by hydrolysis and glucosidase.
[00144]      In some embodiments, the dermal fillers have a sustained bioavailability. For
example, dermal fillers are provided which, when introduced into the skin of a human
being, (for example, intradermally or subdermally into a human being for the correction
of soft tissue defects of voids in the face), release ascorbic acid (or other vitamin) into
the human being for at least about 1 months and up to about 20 months or more.
[00145]      For example, to predict a sustained Vitamin C efficacy in coordinate with filler
duration, an estimation on conjugated degree is made. This estimation was based on
the formulation of AA2G conjugation to HA via etherification. The formulation is stable
under physiological conditions but start to release of Ascorbic acid (AsA) by a
glucosidase which is attached to the cell membrane. Release of AsA happens at the
filler/cell interface due to the fact that a-glucosidase is attached to cell membrane.

Further release of AsA from HA-AA2G will be accompanied by HA degradation to make
AA2G available to fibroblasts. The release of AsA is thus depending on AA2G
conjugation degree and duration of HA.         A gel with conjugation degree of 5 mol%
approximately could release active Vitamin C in a period of at least up to 1 month, for
example, between 3 -5 months; a gel with 10 mol % conjugation degree could release
active Vitamin C in a period up to 6-8 months; a gel with 15 mol% conjugation degree
could release active Vitamin C in a period up to 10- months; 30 mol% up to one and
half years.

[00146]     In an embodiment of the invention, a dermal filler is provided comprising
hyaluronic acid crosslinked with a Star-PEG epoxide and having a vitamin C derivative
(for example, one of AA2G (Ascorbic acid 2-Glucoside), Vitagen (3-aminopropyl-L
ascorbyl phosphate) and SAP (sodium ascorbyl phosphate)) conjugated to the
hyaluronic acid with a degree of conjugation of between about 5 mol% and about 40
mol%.

[00147]    Methods of making this dermal filler include reacting pentaerythritol glycidal
ether (Star-PEG epoxide) with ascorbic acid 2-Glucoside (AA2G) at a ratio, reaction
temperature and reaction time suitable for achieving a composition containing AA2G
capped by 4-arm epoxides (AA2G-4 arm epoxides),           unreacted 4-arm epoxides and
free AA2G.      The 4 arm epoxide capped AA2G (AA2G-4 arm epoxides) is conjugated
to hyaluronic acid via the epoxyl group. The unreacted 4 arm epoxides serves as a
crosslinker to crosslink hyaluronic acid and as a conjugation agent to further conjugate
AA2G.
[00148]    In another embodiment of the invention, a dermal filler is provided comprising
hylauronic acid crosslinked with BDDE and having a vitamin C derivative (for example,
one   of AA2G       (Ascorbic  acid   2-Glucoside),  Vitagen    (3-aminopropyl-L-ascorbyl
phosphate) and SAP (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) conjugated to the hyaluronic acid
with a degree of conjugation of between about 3 mol% and about 15 mol%.
[00149]    Methods of making this dermal filler include reacting BDDE with ascorbic acid
2-Glucoside (AA2G)      at a ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time suitable for
achieving a composition containing AA2G capped by BDDE (AA2G-BDDE), unreacted
BDDE and free AA2G. The BDDE capped AA2G (AA2G-BDDE) is conjugated to
hyaluronic acid via the epoxyl group.The unreacted BDDE serves as a crosslinker to
crosslink hyaluronic acid and as a conjugation agent to further conjugate AA2G.
[00150]    Figure 9 is a Table showing the effect of a-glucosidase concentration on AsA
release from AA2G -PBS solution. The conversion of AA2G to AsA depends on the
concentration of a-glycosidase. AA2G converted AsA almost completely in 15 minutes
when a-glycosidase concentration is 6.3 unit/ml. When a-glycosidase concentration is
4.7 units/ml, It took 30 minutes to completely convert AA2G to AsA. Further decease a
glycosidase concentration resulted in slow conversion of AA2G to AsA.
[00151]    Figure 10 shows a representation of a        release profile of free AsA from
conjugated dermal fillers in accordance with the invention (sustained release) (AA2G
conversion in mol% versus reaction time).       AA2G     completely converted to AsA in

AA2G/Juvederm* mix in 40 minutes. AA2H/HA conjugates showed a time dependence
of AA2G conversion to AsA.
[00152]     Figure 11 A and 11 B show additional release data for various dermal fillers in
accordance with the invention. More specifically, conversion of AA2G to AsA in HA
AA2G gels is dependant on a-glycosidase              concentration.  High   a-glycosidase
concentration resulted in a fast conversion of AA2G to AsA. For a given a-glycosidase
concentration, different formulations showed different profiles of AA2G to AsA.
[00153]     In exemplary embodiments of the invention, a HA/AA2G conjugated gel
composition is provided having the following specifications:
[00154]    The composition has a G' is in a range of 50-300 Pa, a HA concentration in a
range of between about 10 to about 30mg/ml, and a Vitamin C (e.g. AA2G) conjugation
degree in a range of between about 3 to about 15 mol%.
[00155]     For example, in one embodiment, the composition is made from a mixture of
LMW/HMW HA (90/10 w/w), has a HA concentration of about 15 mg/ml, a G' of about
200 Pa, and a vitamin C conjugation of about 10 mol%.
[00156]     In another embodiment, the composition is made from a mixture of
LMW/HMW HA (90/10 w/w), has a HA concentration of about 17.5 mg/ml, a G' of about
240 Pa, and a vitamin C conjugation of about 10 mol%.
[00157]     In yet another embodiment, the composition is made from a mixture of
LMW/HMW HA (90/10 w/w), has a HA concentration of about 24 mg/ml, a G' of about
300 Pa, and a vitamin C conjugation of about 10 mol%.
[00158]     In one aspect of the invention, methods for treating skin are provided
comprising introducing a composition into the skin of a patient, the composition
comprising hyaluronic acid and a vitamin C derivative covalently conjugated to the
hyaluronic acid, wherein a degree of conjugation is between about 3 mol% and about
40 mol%, thereby achieving improved           collagenesis in the skin.         In certain
embodiments, the hyaluronic acid comprises a low molecular weight HA, more
specifically, a low molecular weight HA having a molecular weight of between about
                                            53

300 K Daltons and about 500 K Daltons. Further, the hyaluronic acid comprises least
80% w/w, for example, about 90% w/w of a low molecular weight HA, for example, a
low molecular weight HA having a molecular weight of between about 300 K Daltons
and about 500 K Daltons.     Further, the hyaluronic acid may comprise up to or no more
than about 20% w/w, or up to or no more than 10% w/w, of a high molecular weight
hyaluronic acid, more specifically, a high molecular weight HA having a molecular
weight of between about 1.0 Million Dalton (M Daltons) to about 3.0 M Daltons. The
hyaluronic acid of the composition is a crosslinked hyaluronic acid as described
elsewhere herein.      In some embodiments, the composition includes an amount of
uncrosslinked hyaluronic acid, for example, between 0.5% up to 5% w/w uncrosslinked
HA, for example, about 1% uncrosslinked HA, for example, about 0.95% uncrosslinked
HA.
[00159]      For purposes of the present disclosure, "degree of conjugation" as used
herein is defined as molar percentage of conjugant, e.g., AA2G, to the repeating unit of
hyaluronic acid (e.g., HA dimer). Thus, 10 mol% conjugation degree means every 100
HA repeat units contain 10 conjugated AA2G. Degree of conjugation can be calculated
using the method illustrated in Example 2 below, or other methods known to those of
skill in the art.

[00160]     400.6 mg of low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMW HA) was hydrated in
1802 mg of 1 wt% NaOH in a syringe for about 30min. 800.7 mg of AA2G was put in a
vial, followed by 713.7 mg of BDDE and 1416.8 mg of 10% NaOH. T he above solution
(pH >12) was allowed to react in a 50 OC water bath for about 20min, before adding to
the hydrated HA. After the addition, the mixture was mixed about 20 times by passing
back and forth between 2 syringes. The mixed paste was put in a vial and in a about 50
0C   water bath for about 2.5 hours.      223.5 mg of 12M HCI was added to 9.05 g
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH7.4. After about 2.5 hours, the HA-AA2G gel was
formed. The gel was cut into pieces, and the HCI-PBS solution was added to it. The
gel was allowed to neutralize and swell overnight on an orbital shaker. The gel was

sized through a -60 pm screen and mixed about 20 times by passing back and forth
between 2 syringes. The gel was put in a 15,000 MWCO RC dialysis bag and dialyzed
in PBS, pH 7.4 buffer. The dialysis went on for about 185 hours, with frequent change
of PBS buffer. After the dialysis, the gel was put in a syringe and stored in a 4 OC
refrigerator.

[00161]     The weight of gel as described in Example 1 was noted right before dialysis,
and after dialysis. The assumption was made that the gel was about 1g/mL after
dialysis. The dialysis was stopped at the point where no notable AA2G was coming out
per > 8 hours in 1L of PBS. The AA2G was measured at 260nm using UV/Vis
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000C, ThermoScientific). The calibration curve of AA2G
was calculated using different concentration of AA2G in 2% HA (A@260nm = 1.4838
[AA2G(mM)]).

[00166]     An oscillatory parallel plate rheometer (Anton Paar, Physica MCR 301) was
used to measure the properties of the gel obtained in Example 1. The diameter of plate
used was 25 mm. The gap between the plates was set at 1 mm. For each
measurement, a frequency sweep at a constant strain was run first, before the strain

sweep at a fixed frequency. The G' (storage modulus) was obtained from the strain
sweep curve at 1% strain. The value is 1450 Pa for the gel.

and 1402.0 mg of 10% NaOH. The above solution (pH >12) was allowed to react in a
50  0C water bath for -20min, before adding to the hydrated HA. After the addition, the
mixture was mixed -20 times by passing back and forth between 2 syringes. The mixed
paste was put in a vial and in the 50 C water bath for -2.5 hours. 140.9 mg of 12M HCI
was added to 9.0053 g PBS, pH7.4. After -2.5 hours, the HA-AA2G gel was formed.
The gel was cut into pieces, and the HCI-PBS solution was added to it. The gel was

was sized through a -60 pm screen and mixed about 20 times by passing back and
forth between 2 syringes. The gel was put in a 20,000 MWCO CE dialysis bag and
dialyzed in PBS, pH7.4 buffer. The dialysis went on for about 114 hours, with frequent
change of PBS buffer. After the dialysis, the gel was put in a syringe and stored in a 4
0C  refrigerator. The conjugation degree and gel rheological properties are measured in
a procedure as described in Examples, 2 and 3. The conjugation degree is about 10
mol%. Gel storage modulus is about 240 Pa.

The gel was hydrated with PBS buffer and dialyzed against PBS buffer to remove
unreacted AA2P. The finally gel was characterized as described in Examples 2 and 3 to
determine the conjugation degree and gel rheological properties.          The conjugation
degree is about 20 mol%. The storage modulus (G') is about 500 Pa.

 starting material and BDDE as a crosslinker: AA2G conjugation degree is about
            10 mol%; HA concentration is 24 mq/mi; the G' is about 300 Pa.
[00180]     About 800 mg of AA2G was weighed in a 20 ml vial and about 1284 mg of
10.7% w/w NaOH was added.            The vial was capped and vortexed to completely
dissolve the AA2G. The vial was centrifuged at about 2000 rpm for about 15 seconds
to collect the solution to the bottom. The cap of the vial was removed and       about 260
mg of BDDE was added. The vial was capped and placed into a pre heated water bath
at about 50 OC for about 30 min.
[00181]     About 360.0 mg of LMW HA and about 40 mg of HMW HA were placed in a
10 ml capped syringe. The HA was compressed to about the 4ml mark of the syringe
using the plunger. About 1540 mg of 2% w/w NaOH solution was added to hydrate the
HA for about 30 minutes. The plunger was removed from one of the syringes containing
the hydrating HA and carefully transferred with the aid of a pipette the content of the
premix vial into the syringe containing hydrating HA. The plunger was put back into the
syringe containing hydrating HA/AA2G/premix solution. This was mixed back and forth
at least 10 times by syringe-to-syringe mixing. The plunger was taken off from one of
the syringes and the other plunger was completely pushed to the end of the syringe.
The syringe was disconnected from the connector and the reaction mixture was
transferred to a vial. The vial was capped and placed into the water bath of 50 0C and
crosslinked for 2.5 hrs. After the reaction was completed, the vial was opened and the
gel was cut into at least 6-12 pieces with the aid of a small stainless steel spatula. The
gel was placed in an orbital shaker, and gently shaken for about 48 h.

[00182]    After about 48 hours of neutralization and swelling the gel was transferred
into a 20 ml syringe and sized through a 60 pm pore size mesh. The sized gel was
mixed back and forth at least about 10 times by syringe-to-syringe mixing. The gel was
transferred into a dialysis tube of MWCO 20,000 and dialyzed for about 5 days to
remove unreacted AA2G and BDDE. The gel was then transferred to 0.8 ccs of COC
syringes and centriguged at about 4000 to about 5000 rpm for about 5 min to remove
air bubbles. The gels were sterilized under autoclave conditions. AA2G conjugation
degree and gel rheological properties were measured in a procedure as described in
Example 2 and 3. The conjugation degree was about 10 %. Gel storage modulus was
about 300 Pa. The gel concentration was about 24 mg/ml.

             Formulation of a HA/BDDE Dermal Filler Product with AA2G
[00185]    To any of the gels described in the above Examples, after dialysis, a suitable
amount of free HA gel may be added to the gel to improve and modify gel cohesivity
and/or injectability. For example, free HA fibers are swollen in a phosphate buffer

solution, in order to obtain a homogeneous viscoelastic gel ("free" HA gel).            This
uncrosslinked gel is added, before the dialysis step, to the HA/BDDE crosslinked gel
obtained in Example 1 (for example, to obtain a composition having between about 1%
to about 5%, w/w free HA).        The resulting gel is then filled into Ready-to-Fill sterile
syringes and autoclaved at sufficient temperatures and pressures for sterilization for at
least about 1 minute. After autoclaving, the final HA/AA2G product is packaged and
distributed to physicians to use as a dermal filler.

               Formulation of HA-AA2G Dermal Filler including Lidocaine
[00186]     The procedure of Example 17 is followed, but after the dialysis step and
before the addition of free HA gel, lidocaine chlorohydrate (lidocaine HCI) is added to
the mixture. The (lidocaine HCI) in powder form was may first be solubilized in WFI and
filtered through a 0.2 pm filter. Dilute NaOH solution is added to the cohesive HA/AA2G
gel in order to reach a slightly basic pH (for example, a pH of between about 7.5 and
about 8). The lidocaine HCI solution is then added to the slightly basic gel to reach a
final desired concentration, for example, a concentration of about 0.3% (w/w).          The
resulting pH of the HA/AA2G/lidocaine mixture is then about 7 and the HA
concentration is about 24 mg/mL. Mechanical mixing is performed in order to obtain a
proper homogeneity in a standard reactor equipped with an appropriate blender
mechanism.

[00187]     Additives such as retinoic acid (AKA, tretinoin), adapalence and alpha-lipoic
acid contain carboxyl functional group (-COOH). These additives are conjugated to HA
hydrogels via esterifications using EDC chemistry. An example for the conjugations in
accordance with an embodiment of the invention is described as follows:
[00188]     200 mg of HMW HA is hydrated in 10 ml of pH 4.8 MES buffer in 60 cc
syringe. In another syringe, 200 mg of retinoic acid is dissolved in 5 ml of water-acetone

mixture (water/acetone volume ratio 1:3). The above two syringes are mixed via a
syringe connector for about 20 times. Then 197.7 mg of EDC and 149 mg of NHS are
dissolved separately in 6 ml of water in a separate syringe. The syringe containing EDC
and NHS is connected the syringe containing with HA and retinoic acid to allow
reactants to mix at least for 20 times by passing back and forth between 2 syringes.
The mixtures are stored in one syringe and soaked in 370C bath for 4 hrs. The gels are
dialyzed against isopropanol to remove unconjugated Retinoic acid, and then dialyzed
against PBS buffer under aseptic conditions. The gels are packaged into sterilized
syringes and stored at 4 C.

 Conjugations of additives containing hydroxyl functional group to HA hydrogels.
[00189]      Additives such as retinol (AKA, tretinoin), catalase, dimethylaminoethanol and

to HA hydrogels via esterifications using EDC chemistry. A typical example for the
conjugations is described as follows:
[00190]      200 mg of HMW HA is hydrated in 10 ml of pH 4.8 2-(N-morpholino)
ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer in 60 cc syringe. In another syringe, 200 mg of retinol
acid is dissolved in 5 ml of water-acetone mixture (water/acetone volume ratio 1:3). The
above two syringes are mixed via a syringe connector for about 20 times. Then 197.7
mg of EDC and 149 mg of NHS are dissolved separately in 6 ml of water in a separate
syringe. The syringe containing EDC and NHS is connected the syringe containing with
HA and retinol to allow reactants to mix at least for 20 times by passing back and forth
between 2 syringes. The mixtures are stored in one syringe and soaked in 370C bath
for 4 hrs. The gels are dialyzed against isopropanol to remove unconjugated retinol,
and then dialyzed against PBS buffer under aspect conditions. The gels are packaged
into sterilized syringes and stored at 4 C.

[00191]     This is essentially a two-step process. Step one: Crosslinked HA hydrogels,
e.g. Juvederm* or Restylane* (Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, Scottsdale, AZ),
are treated with EDC/NHS to activate the carboxyl group of HA. Step 2: the activated
HA hydrogels are treated with additives containing hydroxyl groups. Additives
containing    hydroxyl groups are retinol,      catalase, dimethylaminoethanol     and g
Tocopherol hydroxyl functional group (-OH).
[00192]     A typical examples for the conjugation of additives to crosslinked HA gels is
as follows:
[00193]     2 gm of Juvederm* gel is mixed with 200 gm of EDC and 150 mg of NHS at
room temperature. Then 200mg of retinol in 3 ml of acetone-water mixture is added.
The above mixture is reacted at 37 OC for 4 hrs. The gels are dialyzed against
isopropanol to remove unconjugated retinol, and then dialyzed against PBS buffer
under aseptic conditions. The gels are packaged into sterilized syringes and stored at 4
 0C.

beneficial dermal fillers. These additives are conjugated to HA via amidization
chemistry. A typical example for conjugating is described as follows:
[00195]     200.3 mg of HMW HA is hydrated in 10 ml of MES pH 5.4 buffer water. 20 mg
of EGF in 100 mg of MES solution is added. To above mixture, 197.7 mg of EDC and
149 mg are added. The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to react at 37 0C for 4 hrs.
After the reaction completes, the gel is further dialyzed against isopropanol and then
dialyzed against PBS buffer under aseptic conditions. The gels are packaged into
sterilized syringes and stored at 4 C.

Release of AA2G was monitor by UV absorption at 260 nm. The release of AA2G form
the gel versus release time is shown in Figure 7. The results showed that most of AA2G

[00204]     In a vial, about 250 mg HA-AA2G gel (density of the gel equals about 1
gram/mL) was added into 2.25 mL PBS buffer and mixed well. 0.25 mL a-glucosidase
solution was then added and mixed well. The vial was sealed. The final concentration
of a-glucosidase was about 6.0 units/mL.

[00207]     One sample was taken at each time point. Each sample was titrated with the
DCIP solution until the light blue color no longer disappears. The volume of DCIP
consumed was recorded.
[00208]     The released Vitamin C amount was calculated based on the concentration
and volume of DCIP.
[00209]     Release results:
[00210]     Figure 11A shows the release of active vitamin C, AsA, (in mole%) from
different HA-AA2G samples as a function of release time (for example, if AsA released
is 20 mol%, this means that 20% AA2G converted to AsA).
                                         Example 25
                      In-vitro collagenesis from HA-AA2G conjugates
[00211]     To measure collagen production in vitro we used a colorimetric Picro Sirius
red assay (Figure13). Human skin fibroblast cells were cultured for 24 hours in serum
containing media. At 24 hours that media was replaced with serum free, vitamin C free
media     plus fragments       from  HA gels generated     by  hyaluronidase treatment.
Hyaluronidase breaks the gel into soluble fragments but does not free conjugated
AA2G or Vitagen from the HA backbone. The cells were cultured for an additional 7
days after which the cells were removed from the wells leaving only the extracellular
matrix produced by the cells. The collagen in this extracellular matrix was stained with
                                              68

Picro Sirius red and solubilized in a sodium hydroxide solution and the collagen content
was measured by the absorbance of red light (Figure 14). The darker the solution, the
more collagen produced by the cells. See Figure 13.
[00212]     Using this method we tested several HA-Vitamin C gels and compared them
to fragments of HA gel without Vitamin C (Juvederm* Ultra Plus).        The objective of this
method was to test if the fragments from HA-Vitamin C gels could increase collagen
deposition by dermal fibroblasts compared to HA without vitamin C. Figure 14 shows
the results from one of many studies. In Figure 14, one can see that both HA-AA2G
and HA-Vitagen        gels increase collagen production by fibroblasts compared to
Juvederm* Ultra Plus. All of the data was normalized to the production of collagen by
fibroblasts in the presence of 3 mM ascorbic acid.
                                          Example 26
                        In-vivo collagenesis from 4 weeks implant
[00213]     In-vivo study in a 4 week rat model has shown that vitamin C conjugated
hydrogels,     e.g.   HA-AA2G      gels   in  accordance  with    the   invention,   promote
neocollagenesis and cell activation in comparison to Juvederm* Ultra Plus (HA gel
without AA2G) as well as in comparison to a physical mixture of HA with 10 mol %
AA2G (non-conjugated, physical mix of HA and AA2G).
[00214]     One method for evaluating the tissue response to filler formulations is to
evaluate the type and concentration of collagen I at the implant/tissue interface after the
4 weeks in vivo. If the material is bioinert, than the concentration, type and distribution
of collagen adjacent to the implant should be similar to the collagen in control tissue. If
the material is bioactive then there will be an increase in local collagen concentration.
Since    this   effect  is  localized   to   the  tissue directly   adjacent   to   the  gel,
immunohistochemistry was used to measure the relative distribution of collagen I as a
function of distance from the gel/tissue interface compared to control regions after 4
weeks of implantation in the subcutaneous tissue of Sprague Dawley rats. HA gels with
conjugated AA2G induced an increase in local collagen density in the tissue within 80
microns of the implant compared to Juvederm* Ultra Plus or HA physically mixed with
                                               69

AA2G.      Figure 15 shows relative concentration of collagen type I as a function of
distance from the gel/tissue boundary.
[00215]     Also evaluated was histology the ingrowth of tissue into the gel bolus. The
ingrown collagen was stained with Herovici's polychrome and used image analysis
techniques to estimate the percentage of tissue ingrowth into the gel bolus. There was
a statistically significant increase in tissue ingrowth into the HA gel conjugated to AA2G
after 4 weeks in vivo compared with Juvederm* Ultra Plus or HA physically mixed with
AA2G. Fig. 16 shows % tissue ingrowth into gels at 4 week's implantation.

[00216]     This example illustrates the use of compositions and methods disclosed
herein for a facial disorder.
[00217]     A 58-year-old woman presented with a lean face. She felt her face looked
old, sad and bitter because of the less fullness of her cheek contour.        Pre-operative
evaluation of the person includes routine history and physical examination in addition to
thorough informed consent disclosing all relevant risks and benefits of the procedure.
The physician evaluating the individual determines that she is a candidate for
administration of the dermal filler compositions and methods disclosed herein.
[00218]     A composition of the invention, such as described in EXAMPLE 17, is
provided in a 20 mL syringe.           One-holed blunt infiltration cannulas (3 mm inner
diameter) are used to place about 15 mL of the composition in the syringe
subcutaneously and under superficial musculoaponeurotix system into the left and right
checks.
[00219]     The individual is monitored for approximately 7 days.            The physician
evaluates the treatment area and determines that the treatment was successful. The
woman's cheeks are fuller than prior to treatment, Both the woman and her physician
are satisfied with the results of the procedure because she looks younger than she did
when she came in for treatment.

[00226]     A composition such as that made as described in Example 16, is provided in
10 mL syringes. The physician injects a small amount of the composition below the
skin in each depressed or pitted area of the patient's jawline to raise the area to match
the surrounding skin.
[00227]     The individual returns for a follow up visit with the physician in 14 days. The
physician evaluates the patient and determines that the treatment was successful. The
man reports he is satisfied with the results of the procedure because his skin is more
smooth in appearance and the acne scarring is substantially less visible. Approximately
six months after the procedure, the man returns for a follow up treatment. He reports to
the physician that his quality of life has greatly improved since the procedure and he is
no longer shy about his appearance.
