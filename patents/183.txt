                        ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0100]    A method and corresponding system for supporting authentication
processing of commercial transactions conducted over a communications network
between consumers and merchants.            Payment information for a commercial
transaction  between   a   consumer      and   a   merchant   is  received over the
communications network. The payment information identifies a payment instrument
supporting an authenticated payment program.         A determination is made as to
whether to authenticate the consumer using the authenticated payment program
based on authentication criteria defined by the merchant.           The consumer is
authenticated   over  the   communications       network  in   accordance  with the
authenticated payment program if authentication is determined to be appropriate
based on the authentication criteria defined by the merchant.

            ELECTRONIC PAYMENT PROCESSING METHOD AND SYSTEM
               WITH SMART/AUTHENTICATE FIELDS AND DEFINITIONS
 [0001]     This application claims the benefit of both U.S. Provisional Application No.
 61/317,425, filed March 25, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/299,390, filed
 January 29, 2010, incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
                                      BACKGROUND
 [0002]    The present exemplary embodiments relate generally to e-commerce. They
find particular application in conjunction with payment brand selection and/or consumer
authentication, to conduct a commercial transaction over a communications network
(e.g., the Internet), and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, it
is to be appreciated that the present exemplary embodiments are also amenable to
other like applications.
[0003]     By way of background, Internet commerce, or e-commerce as it is otherwise
known, relates to the buying and selling of products and/or services between
consumers and merchants over the Internet or other like transactional exchanges of
information. The convenience of shopping over the Internet has sparked considerable
interest in e-commerce on behalf of both consumers and merchants. Internet sales, or
like transactions, have been typically carried out using standard credit cards, for
example, from Visa@, MasterCard@, Discover@, American Express@, or the like, or
standard debit cards, such as check cards or automated teller machine (ATM) cards
which directly access funds from an associated deposit account or other bank account.
[0004]     FIGURE 1 illustrates one example of an authorization process for an e
commerce transaction. When a consumer 102 seeks to purchase a product and/or
service from a merchant 104, they complete a checkout process in which they typically
provide the merchant 104 with payment information, or at least enough information to
identify and/or locate payment information.     Payment information typically identifies a
payment instrument, such as a credit card, associated with a payment brand.           Upon
receiving the payment information, the merchant 104 authorizes the transfer of funds
                                              1

       WO 2011/094556                                                   PCT/US2011/022945
  using an authorization supply chain 106. The authorization supply chain 106 typically
  includes an optional payment gateway 108, a payment processor 110 (e.g., the
 merchant's financial institution or acquiring bank), a payment brand network 112, an
 issuing bank 114, and the like, In certain embodiments, the merchant 104 connects
 directly with the payment processor 110, whereby the payment gateway 108 is optional.
 [0005]      While widely used for more traditional face-to-face transactions, use of these
 standard cards in connection with e-commerce presents certain difficulties, including
 difficulties concerning authentication or positive identification of the cardholder. For
 example, maintaining consumer confidence in security has become difficult with
 increased reports of fraud.      The resulting apprehension is also fueled by consumer
 uncertainty of the reputation and/or integrity of a merchant with whom the consumer is
 dealing. Questionable security of the consumer's card information or other personal
 information (e.g., address, card number, phone number, and the like) typically submitted
 along with a traditional e-commerce transaction serves to increase apprehension even
 more. Additionally, cardholders, merchants and financial institutions are all concerned
 about safeguarding against fraudulent or otherwise unauthorized transactions.
 [0006]      Accordingly, various payment brand networks have implemented programs
 (or initiatives) aimed at safeguarding against fraud.           For example, Visa@ and
 MasterCard@ both support authentication programs in which the bank or financial
 institution issuing the card (i.e., the issuing bank) authenticates a cardholder. FIGURE
2 illustrates one such exemplary authentication program. As shown, a consumer 202
(e.g., employing a suitable web browser or the like) attempts to purchase products
and/or services (e.g., over the Internet) from a merchant 204. As is known in the art,
the illustrated authorization supply chain 206 includes an optional payment gateway
208, a payment processor 210, a payment brand network 212, and an issuing bank 214.
[0007]       At a point of checkout, the consumer 202 selects an appropriate payment
method based on the authentication programs supported by the merchant 204. At this
point, the consumer 202 fills out an on-line checkout form including a payment
instrument, a card number, an expiration date, etc. Based on the payment information,
the merchant 204, via a plug-in 216 installed on their servers, passes a verify enrollment
request (VEReq) message to a directory server 218 suitably operated by the payment
                                                2

     WO 2011/094556                                                    PCT/US2011/022945
 brand network      212.   The directory server 218 includes a database associating
 participating merchants with their payment processor and a database associating card
 number ranges with locations or addresses (e.g., universal resource locator (URL)
 addresses) of issuing banks' access control servers (ACSs). The VEReq message is a
 request to verify the enrollment of the card in the authentication program, and it contains
 the card number provided by the consumer 202.
 [0008]      Based on the card number range stored within the directory server 218, the
 VEReq message is sent to an ACS or attempts server 220, If the consumer and/or the
 issuing bank do not participate in a payment program, the VEReq message is sent to an
 attempts server typically operated by the payment brand network 212. Otherwise, the
 VEReq message is sent to the appropriate URL address for the issuing bank's ACS
 server. In either case, a response (i.e., a verify enrollment response (VERes)) to the
 VEReq message is returned to the merchant 204 via the directory server 218. That is to
 say, the ACS or attempts server 220 responds with a VERes message to the directory
 server 238, which is then passed back to the plug-in 216. Where the ACS or attempts
 server 220 is an ACS, the enrollment status of the card is also verified.
 [0009]     Based on the VERes message (i.e., if positive), the plug-in 216 redirects the
consumer's browser to the ACS or attempts server 220 by passing it a payer
authentication request (PAReq) message generated by the plug-in 216. The consumer
202 then completes an authentication process or attempts directly with the ACS or
attempts server 220. The ACS or attempts server 220 authenticates the consumer 202,
if applicable, and responds to the merchant 204 with a payer authentication response
(PARes) message, including a digital signature. The plug-in 206 validates the digital
signature of the PARes and extracts the authentication status and other specified data
that is to be used by the merchant 204 during the payment authorization process carried
out via the authorization supply chain 206. For example, the merchant 204 sends an
authorization and/or sale transaction to their payment gateway 208 along with the data
elements received from the PARes. The payment gateway 208 routes the data to the
payment processor 210 based on the payment processor's specification. The payment
processor 210 then sends the data via the appropriate payment brand network 212 to
the issuing bank 214 for settlement.

      WO 2011/094556                                                  PCT/US2011/022945
  [00101    With industry momentum swinging in the direction of authentication of
  consumers, more and more merchants are implementing authenticated payment
  programs, such as the aforementioned example, for the first time. With these initial
  implementations, merchants run the risk of introducing an authenticated payment
  program in a way that could disrupt their current checkout process. Further, merchants
 are responsible for remaining current with program           protocols that can change
 periodically. That is to say, as the authentication protocols are updated and/or changed
 by the respective payment brand networks, the merchants are responsible for updating
 and/or changing their plug-ins to reflect those updates and/or changes being mandated
 by the payment brand networks.
 [0011]     Even more, when using authentication programs, the payment brand
 networks often ensure participating merchants that fraudulent transactions and other
 charge backs, as they are known in the art, will not be the merchants' responsibility
 provided the specified protocols have been followed. However, there are considerable
 burdens placed upon the merchants to participate in the authentication programs. For
 example, typical installation of the merchant plug-in can be overly burdensome using up
 resources (e.g., computing power, memory, data storage capacity, etc.) the merchant
 would otherwise prefer to devote to other tasks. Often, the plug-in can be extremely
 large and/or cumbersome to implement on the merchant's server. Moreover, for a
 merchant that participates in a plurality of such authentication programs for multiple
 payment brand networks, the burden can be that much more (i.e., requiring a separate
 plug-in for each individual authentication program they wish to support), especially
considering that each payment brand network may have its own particular protocols,
data fields that are employed in the respective messages, specific data format
requirements, etc.
[0012]      To address some of these concerns, a universal merchant platform (UMP),
shown in FIGURE 3, may be employed. For detailed a detailed discussion regarding
the universal merchant platform, refer, for example, to U.S. Patent No. 7,051,002
entitled "Universal Merchant Platform for Payment Authentication" and U.S. Patent
Publication No. 2006/0282382 entitled "Universal Merchant Platform for Payment
Authentication," the disclosures of which are both incorporated herein by reference.

       WO 2011/094556                                                  PCT/US2011/022945
 [0013]       Generally, the UMP serves as a centraIled merchant processing system for
 authenticated pa yments, allowing a merchant to securely and easily accommodate
 authentication of consumers in accordance with a variety of authentication programs
 implemented by payment brand networks, and to process electronic transactions
 through any payment network using a single platform.         It also enables merchants to
 process these payments, regardless of which payment network they are to be routed
 through, with a single implementation. Moreover, it allows them or a funding source to
 use the established underlying payment processing infrastructure to process their credit
 and/or debit payment instruments at participating merchant sites.
 [0014]       While the UMP addresses some of the abovenoted concerns, there is still
 room for improvement. For example, known embodiments of the UMP are a "one size
 fits all solutions" in the sense that a merchant either employs an authenticated payment
 program or does not. Therefore, merchants run the risk of introducing an authenticated
 payment program in a way that could disrupt their current checkout process, even when
 employing known embodiments of the UMP.
 [0015]      The present invention contemplates a new and improved system and/or
 method which overcomes the above-referenced problems and others.

[0017]       Various details of the present disclosure are hereinafter summarized to
provide a basic understanding. This summary is not an extensive overview of the
disclosure and is intended neither to identify certain elements of the disclosure, nor to
delineate the scope thereof. Rather, the primary purpose of the summary is to present

      WO 2011/094556                                                  PCT/US2011/022945
 certain concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form prior to the more detailed
 description that is presented hereinafter.
 [0018]      In accordance with one aspect, a method and system are provided for
 supporting authentication processing of commercial transactions conducted over a
 communications network between consumers and merchants. Payment information for
 a commercial transaction between a consumer and a merchant is received over the
 communications network.        The payment information identifies a payment instrument
 supporting an authenticated payment program. A determination is made as to whether
 to authenticate the consumer using the authenticated payment program based on
 authentication criteria defined by the merchant. The consumer is authenticated over the
 communications network in accordance with the authenticated payment program if
 authentication is determined to be appropriate based on the authentication criteria
 defined by the merchant.
 [0019]      In accordance with another aspect, a system for supporting authentication
 processing of commercial transactions conducted over a communications network
 between consumers and merchants. The system includes a universal merchant
 platform and a decision engine.         The universal merchant platform provides the
 merchants, over the communications network, a common interface to one or more
authenticated payment programs and includes merchant accounts for each of the
 merchants, wherein each of the merchant accounts include authentication criteria
defined by a corresponding merchant. The decision engine determines whether to
authenticate the consumers in accordance with the authenticated payment programs
based on the authentication criteria defined by the merchants.
[0020]      One advantage resides in the ability to cross reference data, even from rival
payment brands or methods, to decide whether or not the consumer ought to go
through an authentication step.
[0021]      Another advantage resides in the ability to allow merchants to selectively
authenticate their respective consumers.
[0022]      Another advantage resides in the ability to authenticated payment programs
in an intelligent fashion that does not completely disrupt current checkout processes.

 [0023]     Another advamage resides in the ability of merchants to receive all the
 benefits of authenticated payment programs as it relates to consumers they want to pin
 point.
 [0024]     Another advantage resides in the ability to allow merchants to begin
 understanding authenticated payment programs, including those aspects pertaining to
 consumer behavior, data transmission to the processor, interchange qualifications,
 chargeback protection, and the like, in an organic way.
 [0025]     Another advantage resides in the ability to allow merchants to strategically
 deploy payment brands that suit their consumers' needs, while mitigating their own risk.

      WO 2011/094556                                                PCT/US2011/022945
                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [00331     With reference to FIGURE 4, a payment processing system 400 according to
 aspects of the present disclosure is provided. The system 400 suitably includes one or
 more consumers 402, one or merchants 404, an optional third party provider 406 of a
 universal merchant platform (UMP) 408, an authentication supply chain 410, an
 authorization supply chain 412, and the like, interconnected by a communications
 network 414.      The communications network 414 is typically the Internet, but other
 communications networks are contemplated.          For example, the communications
 network 414 may include one or more of a local area network, a wireless network, and
the like.
 [0034]     The consumers 402 electronically purchase products and/or services from the
merchants 404 over the communications network 414 via graphical user interfaces,
such as e-commerce websites, of the merchants 404.         Suitably, the consumers 402
employ web browsers to access the graphical user interfaces and purchase the
products and/or services. However, it is to be appreciated that other means of
electronically purchasing the products and/or services are contemplated. To purchase
the products and/or services over the communications network 414, the consumers 402
submit payment information, directly or indirectly, to the merchants 404.       As noted
above, the payment information         is submitted  indirectly if information allowing
identification of the payment information from another source is provided. The payment
information suitably identifies a payment instrument, such as a card number and an
expiration date.     Further, the consumers 402 suitably employ payment instruments
supporting authenticated payment programs. For example, one of the consumers 402
purchases a product and/or service from one of the merchants 404 using a Visa@ credit
card supporting Verified by Visa@.
[0035]      Each of the consumers 402 is suitably embodied by a digital processing
device 418, such as a computer, smart phone, PDA, and the like, connected to the
communications network 416. Each of the digital processing devices 416 includes one
or more of a communications unit 418, a memory 420, a display 422, a user input
device 424, a processor 426, and the like. The communications units 418 allow the
digital processing devices 416 to interact with other components connected to the
                                             8

       WO 2011/094556                                                   PCT/US2011/022945
 communications network 414.          The memories 420 include computer executable
 instructions for performing the abovenoted functions associated with the consumers
 402.    The displays 422 display the graphical user interfaces (e.g., via web browsers)
 facilitating consumer interaction with the digital processing devices 416. The user input
 devices 424 allow the consumers 402 to interact with the graphical user interfaces. The
 processors 426 execute the computer executable instructions on the memories 420.
 [0036]      The merchants 404 provide the consumers 402 the graphical user interfaces,
 suitably e-commerce websites, via the communications network 414. The graphical
 user interfaces suitably allow the consumers 402 to purchase products and/or services
 electronically over the communications network 414, which entails checking out and
 submitting payment information to the merchants 404. Payment information typically
 identifies at least a payment brand and a payment instrument. In certain embodiments,
the UMP 408 is employed to select payment brands to present to the consumers 402
during check out, for example.         When the merchants 404 receive the payment
 information from the consumers 402, the merchants 404 suitably, but not necessarily,
employ the UMP 408 to partially or wholly complete the transaction. For example, the
 merchants 404 employ the UMP 408 for authentication.          It is contemplated that UMP
408 may be employed by the merchants 404 to define when to authenticate the
consumers 402, as described in detail below.
[0037]       To use the UMP 408, each of the merchants 404 suitably registers with the
third party provider 406.       This includes the merchants 404 providing merchant
information (e.g., financial information, physical address, category of good or services
sold, Internet address, email address, authentication criteria, payment brand criteria,
etc.) to the third party provider 406. As discussed below, the authentication criteria
suitably define when the UMP 408 authenticates consumers for a merchant, and the
payment brand criteria suitably define what payment brands are presented to the
consumers of the merchant, as determined by the UMP 408. Typically, the merchant
information is provided over the communications network 414 via a graphical user
interface, such as a web interface, offered by the third party provider 406. However,
other means of providing the merchant information, such as via a telephone, are
contemplated. Additionally, the merchant information is suitably modifiable, optionally
                                              9

      WO 2011/094556                                                   PCT/US2011/022945
 via th   graphical user interface and/or the communications n work 414.           In certain
 embodiments, registration may further include signing and/or executing an agreement of
 the third party provider 406.
 [0038]      Further, to use the UMP 408, each of the merchants 404 suitably augments
their graphical user interface to employ the UMP 408.        For example, a merchant may
 add a hosted iFrame linking their graphical user interface to the third party provider 406.
Advantageously, this allows easy integration with the UMP 408, especially for
 presenting allowed payment brands to the consumers 402.
 [0039]      Where the UMP 408 is not employed, the merchants 404 include plug-ins 428
and decision engines 430. The plug-ins 428 allow the merchants 404 to support
authenticated payment programs and typically behave as the plug-in 216 of FIGURE 2.
The decision engines 430 allow the merchants 404 to selectively authenticate the
consumers 402 based on one or more authentication factors and/or selectively present
payment brands to the consumers 402 based on one or more payment brand factors.
Advantageously, this allows the merchants 404 to strategically deploy payment brands
that suit the consumers 402 needs, while mitigating their own risk. Another advantage
resides in the ability to employ authenticated payment programs in an intelligent fashion
that does not completely disrupt current checkout processes.
[0040]      The authentication factors typically include one or more of the following:
            1.    Currency Amount: The merchants 404 can create thresholds on the
transaction amounts they want to authenticate on. For example, a merchant may
specify that they only want to authenticate transactions over $500.
            2.    Country Currency: The merchants 404 can pick and choose which
currency or currencies they want to authenticate with.       For example, a merchant can
specify they only want to only authenticate consumers who are paying in Russian
Rubles.
            3.    BIN (Bank Identification Number) Range:        The merchants 404 can
authenticate consumers attempting to complete a transaction with a card having a
particular BIN number. A BIN number refers to the first 6 digits of a card and identifies
bank name, country, and card type. For example, a merchant can specify they only
want to authenticate cards from Bank of America@ cardholders who are located in India
                                              10

      WO 2011/094556                                                  PCT/US2011/022945
 and have debit cards.      This is advantageous in that some countries, such as India,
 always require authentication.
            4.   Acquirer Merchant ID (MID):      The merchants 404 can choose to
 authenticate for a particular MID associated with a transaction. An MID is provided to
the merchants 404 by corresponding acquiring banks and a merchant may have more
than one MID.       For example, a merchant can specify they only want to authenticate
transactions employing a particular MID.
            5.   Access Control Server (ACS) URL:       The merchants 404 can choose
whether to authenticate based on an ACS URL of the issuing bank or the bank's ACS
 provider. For example, a merchant may not want to perform authentication with banks
who receive their ACS service from a certain ACS provider.
           6.    Enrollment / Registering during Shopping:     The merchants 404 can
choose to ask the consumers 402 to enroll in an authenticated payment program during
the checkout process and authenticate the consumers 402 based upon this.                For
example, a merchant may not want to authenticate consumers who enrolled and/or
 registered during shopping.
           7.    Central Servers: Some payment brands, such as Visa®, operate a
server that oversees bank performance in certain countries and/or regions, such as the
 United States. In some cases, the information received back from these servers does
not fit merchants' needs or data managing capabilities, so the merchants 404 truncate
this URL because of its length. According to this factor, the merchants 404 can choose
not to authenticate cardholders who come under the surveillance of a central server
system.
           8.    Billing and Shipping Information: The merchants 404 can choose to
authenticate the       consumers 402 based on       associated  billing and/or shipping
information.   For example, a merchant may not want to authenticate consumers who
enter different billing and shipping information.
           9.    Attempts: A consumer goes through the attempts process if they have
not enrolled their card in a payment program or the issuing bank is not participating in
the payment program.        The merchants 404 can choose whether to authenticate the
consumers 402 based on whether they go through the attempts process.
                                              11

      WO 2011/094556                                                 PCT/US2011/022945
            10. ACS Performance: An authentication program may involve multiple third
 parties to enable accompanying protocols and/or processes,      In certain embodiments,
 these third parties may be monitored and corresponding data logged to provide the
 merchants 404 the ability to tune-out and/or turn-off sub-performing third parties and/or
 any part of the network.     For example, a merchant may not want to authenticate
 cardholders who belong to a bank with below average ACS performance.
            11.  Date and Time Frames: The merchants 404 can choose to authenticate
 during ortain time periods throughout the day (e.g., EST, PST, and/or CST). For
 example, a merchant may only want to authenticate consumers who shop during the
 merchant's highest fraud time frame on 12/21 from 12:00am EST to 3:00am EST.
            12. True A/B Test: The merchants 404 can perform tests on sets or batches
of transactions with an authentication program on and then off. For example, a
 merchant may want to authenticate on every other transaction.
            13. Consumer Shopped with Before: The merchants 404 can choose to
authenticate based on whether the consumers 402 have previously shopped with the
merchants 404, optionally, within a predetermined amount of time, such as the last 30
days.    For example, a merchant may only want to offer authentication to consumers
who have gone through the authentication process smoothly in the past 30 days. To
identify a consumer, a card number is suitably employed.      However, other information
may be employed to identify a consumer, such as a phone number.                 In certain
embodiments, information from previous transactions may also be employed.               For
example, if a consumer employed a different payment brand to complete a previous
transaction, a merchant may choose to authenticate.       Additionally or alternatively, in
certain embodiments, where the UMP 408 is employed, information may be shared
across the merchants 404. For example, if a consumer used a particular payment
brand with a first merchant, a second merchant could use this information to determine
whether to authenticate.
           14. Consumer Shopped with Before and Authenticated: The merchants 404
can choose to authenticate based on whether the consumers 402 have previously
shopped with the merchants 404 and successfully authenticated, optionally, within a
predetermined amount of time, such as the last 30 days. For example, a merchant may
                                           12

      WO 2011/094556                                                   PCT/US2011/022945
only want to authenticate cardholders who have successfully authenticated in the past
30 days. To identify a consumer a card number is suitably employed. However, other
information may be employed to identify a consumer, such as a phone number.
            15. Abandonment of Transaction: The merchants 404 can choose to
authenticate based on whether the consumers 402 previously abandoned transactions.
In certain embodiments, the authentication decision may be based on when and/or how
many previous transactions were abandoned.          For example, a merchant may want to
authenticate a consumer that abandoned a transaction within the last 30 days.             In
certain embodiments, where the UMP 408 is employed, information may be shared
across the merchants 404.
            16.  Product Codes: The merchants 404 can choose to authenticate based
on products codes.         For example, a merchant can choose to authenticate all
transactions involving products of a particular class, as identified by product codes.
[0041]      The payment brand factors typically include one or more of the following:
            1.   Currency Amount: The merchants 404 can identify which payment
brands they want to offer for transactions based on the transaction amounts.             For
example, a merchant may specify that they only want to allow a certain payment brand
for transactions over $500.
            2.   Country Currency: The merchants 404 can pick and choose which
payment brands they want to allow the consumers 402 to use based on currency or
currencies. For example, a merchant can specify they only want to only want to allow
consumers who are paying in Russian Rubles to use a certain payment brand.
            3.   Billing and Shipping Information: The merchants 404 can choose which
payment brands to present to the consumers 402 based on billing and/or shipping
information. For example, a merchant may not want to allow a consumer to pay with a
certain payment brand if they enter different billing and shipping information.
            4.   Product Codes: The merchants 404 can choose what payment brands to
allow based on products codes. For example, a merchant can choose to allow payment
with a certain payment brand for all transactions involving products of a particular class,
as identified by product codes.
                                            13

     WO 2011/094556                                                PCT/US2011/022945
            5.   IP Location: The merchants 404 can choose what payment brands to
allow based on internet protocol (IP) location. For example, a merchant can choose to
allow payment with a certain payment brand for all IP addresses associated with
 Russia.
            6.   Country: The merchants 404 can choose what payment brands to allow
based on country.      In certain embodiments, country is determined from the shipping
information and/or the billing information. For example, a merchant can choose to allow
payment with a certain payment brand for transactions shipped to Russia.
            7.   Repeat Payment Brand Consumers:       The merchants 404 can choose
what payment brands to present to the consumers 402 based on what payment brands
the consumers 402 have successfully used for payment in the past.             In certain
embodiments, where the UMP 408 is employed, information may be shared across the
merchants 404.
            8.   Date and Time Frames: The merchants 404 can choose what payment
brands to allow during certain time periods throughout the day (e.g., EST, PST, and/or
CST). For example, a merchant may only want to allow a certain payment brand during
the merchant's highest fraud time frame on 12/21 from 12:00am EST to 3:00am EST.
            9.   True A/B Test: The merchants 404 can perform tests on sets or batches
of transactions with different combinations of one or more payment brands.           For
example, a merchant may want to provide a particular combination of payment brands
on every other transaction.
            10.  Risk Assessment: The merchants 404 can choose which payment
brands to offer to the consumers 402 based on risk assessments of the consumers 402.
For example, when a consumer is determined to be "high risk", a merchant can offer a
payment brand where they assume no liability.
            11. Fraud Score: The merchants 404 can choose which payment brands to
offer to the consumers 402 based on fraud scores of the consumers 402. For example,
a merchant may offer a particular payment brand if the fraud score of a consumer is
within a certain range.
            12. Consumer Shopped with Before: The merchants 404 may choose
payment brands to present to the consumers 402 based on whether the consumers 402
                                            14

      WO 2011/094556                                                 PCT/US2011/022945
 have previously shopped with the merchants 404, optionally, within a predetermined
 amount of time, such as the last 30 days. For example, a merchant may only want to
 offer certain payment brands to consumers who have gone through the authentication
 process smoothly in the past 30 days.       To identify a consumer, a card number is
 suitably employed.     However, other information may be employed to identify a
consumer, such as a phone number.             In certain embodiments, information from
 previous transactions may also be employed. Additionally or alternatively, in certain
embodiments, where the UMP, information may be shared across the merchants 404.
            13. Consumer Shopped with Before and Authenticated: The merchants 404
 may choose which payment brands to present to the consumers 402 based on whether
the consumers 402 have previously shopped with the merchants 404 and successfully
authenticated, optionally, within a predetermined amount of time, such as the last 30
days.    For example, a merchant may only want to offer certain payment brands to
consumers who have successfully authenticated in the past 30 days.          To identify a
consumer, a card number is suitably employed.         However, other information may be
employed to identify a consumer, such as a phone number.
            14.  BIN (Bank Identification Number) Range:       The merchants 404 can
choose which payment brands to present to the consumers 402 based on a provided
BIN number. A BIN refers to the first 6 digits of a card and identifies bank name,
country, and card type.
            15. Authorization Result: The merchants 404 can choose what payment
brands to present the consumers 402 after a transaction is denied authorization. For
example, a merchant who is unable to accept a credit based transaction can display
additional payment options after a transaction is denied authorization.
[0042]      To allow the merchants 404 to selectively choose which of the consumers
402 to authenticate and/or which payment brands to offer to the consumers 402, the
decision engines 430 allow the merchants 404 to establish authentication criteria and/or
payment brand criteria using the foregoing factors. Suitably a graphical user interface is
employed, optionally, accessible via the communications network 414. However, other
means of defining the criteria are contemplated.     For example, the telephone may be
employed to define the criteria.   It is contemplated that the criteria may be modified
                                            15

      WO 2011/094556                                                     PCT/US2011/022945
 once generated.       In certain embodiments, the merchants 404 may select from one or
  more predefined profiles of criteria rather than defining their own criteria.
  [0043]     The criteria are suitably defined using one or more rules, which match based
 on the factors, such as IP Location or Attempts, noted above. In certain embodiments,
 the factors may employ data collected from previous transactions (i.e., there may be a
 feedback loop). Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, the priorities of the
 rules may be defined.           For example, a rule specifying that authentication or a
 particularly payment brand should be employed for transactions employing Rubles may
 take priority over a rule specifying transactions less than $500 do not require
 authentication or may not use the particular payment brand.
 [0044]      A rule suitably includes match criteria and an action to perform if the match
 criteria are met. Depending upon whether the rule is being applied to authentication or
 payment brand, actions include enable or disable authentication or allow or disallow a
 defined set of one or more payment brands. It is contemplated that an action may be
 explicit or implicit. An action may be implicitly known if all defined rules or a grouping of
 rules are defined to perform the same action, such as enable authentication. To define
the match criteria, Boolean logic based on the factors noted above is typically
employed. However, it is to be understood that other approaches to defining the match
criteria, such as fuzzy logic and/or thresholding weighted summations of the factors,
may also be employed.
[0045]       One or more servers 432 connected to the communications network 414
suitably embody each of the merchants 404. Each of the servers 432 includes one or
more of a communications unit 434, a memory 436, a processor 438, and the like. The
communications units 434 allow the servers 432 to interact with other components
connected to the communications network 414. The memories 436 include computer
executable instructions for performing the abovenoted functions associated with the
merchants 404. The processors 438 execute the computer executable instructions on
the memories 436. Further, in certain embodiments, the servers 432 include the plug
ins 428 and the decision engines 428. Suitably, the plug-ins 428 and the decision
engines 430 are embodied by computer executable instructions stored on computer
readable mediums, where the processors 438 execute the computer executable
                                               16

      WO 2011/094556                                                     PCT/US2011/022945
 instructions,   In some emodiments the computer readable mediums may be the
 memories 436.
 [0046]     The third party provider 406 facilitates the completion of transactions between
the consumers 402 and the merchants 404 by way of the UMP 408. As noted above,
the third party provider 406 is not a necessary party to the system 100. Among other
things, the UMP 408 provides the merchants 404 with a unified interface from which to
carry out authenticated payment programs for different payment instruments, such as a
credit cards and/or debits card.       Advantageously, this allows the merchants 404 to
offload the work involved with          staying current with protocols associated with
authenticated payment protocols and reduces the amount of resources the merchants
404 have to expend on implementing authenticated payment programs.                  In certain
embodiments, the UMP 408 further allows the merchants 404 to employ the UMP 408
for settlement (i.e., the authorization and capture of funds) and/or payment brand
selection.
[0047]      The UMP 408 suitably includes a decision engine 440 allowing the merchants
404 to selectively authenticate the consumers 402 based on one or more authentication
factors and/or selectively present payment brands to the consumers 402 based on one
or more payment brand factors.          Examples of these factors are described above.
Advantageously, this allows the merchants 404 to strategically deploy payment brands
that suit the consumers 402 needs, while mitigating their own risk. Another advantage
resides in the ability to utilize authenticated payment programs in an intelligent fashion
that does not completely disrupt current checkout processes.           Suitably, the decision
engine 440 employed by the UMP 408 includes the same functionality as the decision
engines 430 employed by the merchants 404.
[0048]      To use the UMP 408, each of the merchants 404 suitably registers with the
third party provider 406. The merchant registration process begins with the third party
provider 406 receiving merchant information (e.g., financial information, physical
address, category of good or services sold,               Internet address, email address,
authentication criteria,    payment     brand   criteria,   etc.) from  a  merchant.       The
authentication criteria suitably define when the UMP 408 authenticates consumers for a
merchant, and the payment brand criteria suitably define what payment brands are
                                              17

      WO 2011/094556                                                   PCT/US2011/022945
 present to the consumers of the merchant, as determined by the UMP 408, Suitably,
 such information is collected via a graphical user interface, such as a web interface, via
 the communications network 414, but other means of collecting the information, such as
 via a telephone, are contemplated.
 [00491     In certain embodiments, upon receiving the merchant information, the third
 party provider 406 evaluates the worthiness of the merchant for participation with the
 UMP 408. To evaluate the worthiness of the merchant, a predetermined or otherwise
 selected algorithm that acts on quantifiable values representing the merchant
 information is employed.       In this manner, the merchant's credit worthiness may be
 determined and/or the merchant's reliability and/or reputation for customer service and
 sound business practice may be determined using objective, subjective, or a
combination of objective and subjective criteria.           Advantageously, the verification
 program ensures that the merchant is able to meet potential obligations.              If the
 merchant is unworthy, a notification is suitably sent to the merchant and the merchant
registration process ends.
[0050]      Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, a merchant agreement is
forwarded to the merchant.        It is contemplated that the merchant agreement is sent
upon receiving the merchant information or, if an evaluation is performed, after a
determination that the merchant is suitable for participation with the UMP 408. Suitably,
the merchant agreement is sent to the merchant by way of the communications network
414, but other means are contemplated, such as by mail. The merchant agreement
typically outlines the rights and responsibilities and/or duties of the merchant with
respect to their participation in the UMP 408.         After the merchant physically signs,
electronically signs, or otherwise executes the merchant agreement, it is returned to the
third party provider 406 by, for example, the communications network 414 or mail.
[0051]      Upon receipt of the executed merchant agreement, or upon receipt of the
merchant information if no merchant agreement is provided to the merchant, the third
party provider 406 creates and maintains a record of one or more of the merchant
information, the merchant's approval, the merchant agreement, and the like in one or
more databases 442. In certain embodiments, the third party provider 406 further
                                                18

      WO 2011/094556                                                   PCT/US2011/022945
 forwards to the merchant software and/or documentation as to how to integrate with the
 UMP 408, so as to allow the merchant to employ the UMP 408 with the consumers 402.
 [0052]     After registration with the third party provider 406, the merchant information,
 including the authentication criteria and/or the payment brand criteria, is suitably
 modifiable.   Suitably, modification of the merchant information is performed via the
 communications network 414 using a graphical user interface similar to that used for
 registration. However, as above, other means of modifying the merchant information
 are contemplated.     For example, the merchant information may be modified via the
 telephone.
 [0053]     One or more servers 444 connected to the communications network 414
 suitably embody the third party provider 406. Each of the servers 444 includes one or
 more of a communications unit 446, a memory 448, a processor 450, and the like. The
 communications units 446 allow the servers 444 to interact with other components
 connected to the communications network 414. The memories 448 include computer
executable instructions for performing the abovenoted functions associated with the
third party provider 406. The processors 450 execute the computer executable
 instructions on the memories 448.        Further, the servers 444 include the UMP 408.
Suitably, the UMP 408 is embodied by computer executable instructions stored on
computer readable mediums, where the computer executable instructions are executed
by the processors 450. In some embodiments, the computer readable mediums may be
the memories 448.
[0054]      The authentication supply chain 410 facilitates authentication, which is
typically conducted as described above in connection with FIGURE                   2.    The
authentication supply chain 410 suitably includes one or more directory servers, such as
the directory server 218 of FIGURE 2, and one or more access control servers (ACSs)
and/or attempt servers, such as the ACS or attempts server 220. As noted above, the
directory servers are employed to determine whether payment instruments are enrolled
in an authenticated payment program and the URL to be used for authentication, and
the ACSs authenticate the consumers 402.            Attempt servers act as ACSs, even if
authentication is not available due to lack of enrollment of the consumer and/or the
issuer, allowing the authentication process to proceed.         A payment brand network
                                              19

      WO 2011/094556                                                  PCT/US2011/022945
typically operates the directory servers and attempts servers. The issuer of a payment
instrument typically operates an ACS for the payment instrument
[0055]      The authorization supply chain 412 facilitates settlement (ie., authorization
and capture of funds) after successful authentication. The authorization supply chain
412 typically includes an optional payment gateway, a payment processor (e.g., a
merchants financial institution or acquiring bank), a payment brand network (e.g., a
credit card network), an issuing bank, and the like. In certain embodiments, merchants
connect directly with the payment processor, whereby the payment gateway is optional.
A traditional authorization process is illustrated in FIGURE 1.
[0056]      With reference to FIGURE 5, a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a
payment process incorporating an authenticated payment program is provided. After
browsing a graphical user interface, such as an e-commerce website, of a merchant
502 and selecting products and/or services to purchase, a consumer 504 completes a
checkout process in which they provide the merchant 502 with payment information. To
do so, the consumer 504 enters the payment information, or at least enough information
to identify and/or locate the payment information, on one or more checkout pages of the
graphical user interface. As noted above, the payment information typically identifies a
payment brand and a payment instrument corresponding to the payment brand.              In
certain embodiments, a decision engine 506 of a universal merchant platform (UMP)
508, as described above, determines which payment brands are allowed. For example,
the checkout pages may include an iFrame linking to the UMP 508 for identifying the
payment brand and/or the payment instrument.
[0057]     After receiving the payment information from the consumer 504, the merchant
502 performs a CMPI lookup request to the UMP 508. Such a request typically includes
the payment information collected from the consumer 504. Based on this information,
the UMP 508 determines whether authentication is appropriate using the decision
engine 506, as described above, and/or instantiates a merchant plug-in for the pending
transaction between the consumer 504 and the merchant 502. Insofar as authentication
is determined to be inappropriate, the merchant 502 is notified thereof (not shown) and
traditional settlement processes are carried.        Suitably, the merchant 502 performs
settlement via an authorization supply chain 510, but it is contemplated that the UMP
                                              20

508 performs settlement via the authorization supply chain 510 on behalf of the
merchant 502. Insofar as authentication is determined to be appropriate, the merchant
plug-in proceeds to authenticate the consumer 504.
[00581     Authentication typically, but not necessarily, includes the merchant plug-in
generating a VEReq message and providing it to a directory server 512 maintained by a
payment brand network 514 of the payment instrument. The directory server 512 then
passes the VEReq message to an ACS or attempts server 516 typically maintained by
the payment brand network 514 or an issuing bank 518 of the payment instrument,
depending upon whether the ACS or attempts server 516 is an ACS or an attempts
server. The ACS or attempts server 516 generates a VERes message and provides the
VERes message to the directory server 512 in response to the VEReq message, which
the directory server 512 then returns to the UMP 508. Insofar as enrollment verification
succeeds, the UMP 508 generates a PAReq message and provides the merchant 502
with the PAReq message.        The merchant 502, in turn, provides the message to the
consumer 504 and the consumer 504 directly authenticates, if appropriate, with the ACS
or attempts server 516. Thereafter, the consumer 502 returns a PARes message to the
merchant 502, which is passed to the UMP 508. The UMP 508 extracts the ECI/CAAV
and/or the ECI/UCAF from the PARes message and verifies the same. The ECI/CAAV
and/or ECI/UCAF are typically provided to the merchant 502 next.
[0059]     Once authentication is completed, assuming it is successful, settlement is
carried out in which the funds for products and/or services of the transaction are
transferred from the consumer 504 to the merchant 502. Typically, this is performed
using the authorization supply chain 510, which typically includes an optional payment
gateway 520, a payment processor 522, the payment brand network 514, and the
issuing bank 518. As discussed above, the payment gateway 520 is optional in that the
merchant 502 can directly connect with the payment processor 522.          Suitably, the
merchant 502 performs the settlement process, as illustrated, but the UMP 508 may
alternatively perform the settlement process.
[0060]     With reference to FIGURE 6, a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a
payment process incorporating an authenticated payment program is provided. After
browsing a graphical user interface, such as an e-commerce website, of a merchant

 602 and selecting products and/or services to purchase, a consumer 604 completes a
 checkout process in which they provide the merchant 602 with payment information. To
 do so, the consumer 604 enters the payment information, or at least enough information
 to identify and/or locate the payment information, on one or more checkout pages of the
 graphical user interface. As noted above, the payment information typically identifies a
 payment brand and a payment instrument corresponding to the payment brand.             In
 certain embodiments, a decision engine 606 of the merchant 602, as described above,
 determines which payment brands are allowed.
 [0061]      After receiving the payment information from the consumer 604, the merchant
 602 determines whether authentication is appropriate using the decision engine 606, as
described above, and/or instantiates a plug-in 608 for the pending transaction between
the consumer 604 and the merchant 602. Insofar as authentication is determined to be
inappropriate, the merchant 602 carries out traditional settlement processes suitably via
an authorization supply chain 610. Insofar as authentication is determined to be
appropriate, the merchant plug-in proceeds to authenticate the consumer 504.
[0062]       Authentication typically, but not necessarily, includes the plug-in 608
generating a VEReq message and providing it to a directory server 612 maintained by a
payment brand network 614 of the payment instrument. The directory server 612 then
passes the VEReq message to an ACS or attempts server 616 typically maintained by
the payment brand network 614 or an issuing bank 618 of the payment instrument,
depending upon whether the ACS or attempts server 616 is an ACS or an attempts
server. The ACS or attempts server 616 generates a VERes message and provides the
VERes message to the directory server 612 in response to the VEReq message, which
the directory server 612 then returns to the plug-in 608. Insofar as enrollment
verification succeeds, the plug-in 608 generates a PAReq message and provides the
merchant 602 with the PAReq message. The merchant 602, in turn, provides the
message to the consumer 604 and the consumer directly authenticates, if appropriate,
with the ACS or attempts server 616. Thereafter, the consumer 604 returns a PARes
message to the merchant 602, which is passed to the plug-in 608. The plug-in 608
extracts the ECI/CAAV and/or the ECI/UCAF from the PARes message and verifies the
same.

 [0063]     Once authentication is completed, assuming it is successful, settlement is
