                              DESCRIPTION
   Title of Invention
     TONER, DEVELOPER, AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS
 5 Technical Field
           The present invention relates to a toner, a developer, and
   an image forming apparatus.
   Background Art
10         In recent years, toners have been desired to have small
   particles size and hot offset resistance for giving high quality
   output images, low temperature fixing ability for energy saving,
   and heat resistant storage stability for resisting
   high-temperature, high-humidity environments during storage or
15 transport after production.    Particularly, low temperature fixing
   ability is very important quality of a toner, as power consumption
   for fixing occupies a large part in the power consumption for an
   entire image forming process.
           Conventionally, toners produced by a kneading and
20 pulverizing method have been used.       The toner produced by the
   kneading and pulverizing method have problems that it is
   difficult to reduce the particle size thereof, and shapes of
   particles are uneven and a particle diameter distribution thereof
   is broad, which result in unsatisfactory quality of output images,
25 and a large quantity of energy is required for fixing such toner.
                                      1

   In the case where wax (i.e., a releasing agent) is added to the
   toner for improving fixing ability, moreover, the toner produced
   by the kneading and pulverizing method contains a large amount
   of the wax present near toner surfaces, as a kneaded product is
 5 cracked from an interface of wax during pulverizing.      As a result
   of this, a releasing effect is exhibited, but on the other hand, the
   toner tends to cause toner deposition (i.e., filming) on a carrier, a
   photoconductor, and a blade.      Therefore, such toner is not
   satisfactory in view of its characteristics on the whole.
10         To encounter the aforementioned problems associated with
   the kneading and pulverizing method, a production method of a
   toner in accordance with a polymerization method has been
   proposed.    A toner produced by the polymerization method is
   easily produced as small particles, has a sharp particle diameter
15 distribution compared to that of the toner produced by the
   pulverizing method, and can encapsulate a releasing agent
   therein.    As a production method of a toner in accordance with
   the polymerization method, proposed is a method for producing a
   toner using an elongation reaction product of urethane-modified
20 polyester as a toner binder, for the purpose of improving low
   temperature fixing ability, and hot offset resistance (see PTL 1).
           Moreover, proposed is a production method of a toner,
   which is excellent in all of heat resistant storage stability, low
   temperature fixing ability, and hot offset resistance, as well as
25 excellent in powder flowability and transfer ability, when a toner
                                      2

   is produced as a small-diameter toner (see PTLs 2 and 3).
           Further, disclosed is a production method of a toner having
   a maturing step for producing a toner binder having a stable
   molecular weight distribution, and achieving both low
 5 temperature fixing ability and (see PTLs 4 and 5).
           However, these proposed techniques do not provide a toner
   having a high level of low temperature fixing ability, which has
   been demanded in recent years.
           For the purpose of achieving a high level of low
10 temperature fixing ability, therefore, proposed is a toner
   containing a resin including a crystalline polyester resin, and a
   releasing agent, and having a phase separation structure, where
   the resin and the releasing agent (e.g., wax) are incompatible to
   each other in the form of sea-islands (see PTL 6).
15         Moreover, proposed is a toner containing a crystalline
   polyester resin, a releasing agent, and a graft polymer (see PTL
   7).
           These proposed techniques can achieve low temperature
   fixing, as the crystalline polyester resin is rapidly melted,
20 compared to a non-crystalline polyester resin.     Even when the
   crystalline polyester resin, which forms islands in the sea-island
   phase separation structure, is melted, however, the
   non-crystalline polyester resin, which forms sea occupying the
   majority of the structure, is not yet melted.    Since fixing cannot
25 be carried out unless both the crystalline polyester resin, and the
                                      3

    non-crystalline polyester resin are melted to a certain extent,
    these techniques do not achieve a high level of low temperature
    fixing ability, a level of which has been desired to be higher.
            Also, although the recent demands for further
  5 improvements in qualities have required toners to be excellent
    not only in low temperature fixing ability, hot offset resistance,
    and heat resistant storage stability but also in image gloss and
    coloring ability, such toners have not been obtained.
            Under such circumstances, there is currently a demand for
10  a toner excellent not only in low temperature fixing ability, hot
    offset resistance, and heat resistant storage stability but also in
    image gloss and coloring ability.

    Description of Embodiments
    (Toner)
           A toner of the present invention includes at least a
    polyester resin, preferably further includes a crystalline
20  polyester resin, and if necessary, further includes other
    components such as a colorant.
           The polyester resin contains a diol component and a
    crosslink component as constituent components thereof.
           The diol component contains an aliphatic diol having 3 to
25  10 carbon atoms in an amount of 50 mol% or more.
                                       6

           The crosslink component contains a trihydric or higher
   aliphatic alcohol.
           The toner has a glass transition temperature (Tg1st) of
   20'C to 50'C, where the glass transition temperature (Tg1st) is
 5 measured in first heating in differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) of the toner.
           One conceivable method for improving low temperature
   fixing ability of a toner is lowering the glass transition
   temperature or the molecular weight of a polyester resin (e.g., a
10 non-crystalline polyester resin) so that the polyester resin melt
   with a crystalline polyester resin.    However, it can easily be
   imagined that when simply lowering the glass transition
   temperature or the molecular weight of the polyester resin to
   lower its melt viscosity, the resultant toner will be degraded in
15 heat resistant storage stability and hot offset resistance upon
   fixing.
           In the toner of the present invention, the polyester resin
   includes a diol component, and the diol component contains an
   aliphatic diol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms in an amount of 50
20 mol% or more.     This diol component lowers the glass transition
   temperature and the melt viscosity, ensuring the low
   temperature fixing ability.     In addition, the polyester resin
   contains a trihydric or higher aliphatic alcohol as a crosslink
   component.     This trihydric or higher aliphatic alcohol makes the
25 polyester resin have a branched structure in its molecular
                                      7

   skeleton, so that the molecular chain thereof becomes a
   three-dimensional network structure.       As a result, the polyester
   resin has such rubber-like properties as to deform at low
   temperature but not flow, enabling the toner to retain heat
 5 resistant storage stability and hot offset resistance.
          It is also possible to use, for example, a trivalent or higher
   carboxylic acid or an epoxy as the crosslink component.       In this
   case, however, a fixed image obtained by fixing the resultant with
   heat may not show sufficient glossiness since many trivalent or
10 higher carboxylic acids are aromatic compounds or a density of
   ester bonds of the crosslink components becomes higher.        Use of
   a crosslinking agent such as an epoxy needs crosslinking reaction
   after polymerization for the polyester, which makes it difficult to
   control the distance between crosslinked points, potentially
15 leading to failure to obtain intended viscoelasticity and/or
   degradation in image density or glossiness due to unevenness in
   the fixed image.    The reason why the unevenness in the fixed
   image arises is that the epoxy tends to react with an oligomer
   formed during the production of the polyester to form portions
20 having a high crosslinked density.
   <Polyester resin>
          The polyester resin contains a diol component and a
   crosslink component as constituent components, and preferably
   further contains a dicarboxylic acid component as a constituent
25 component.
                                      8

          The polyester resin is preferably a non-crystalline
   polyester resin.
          The diol component in the polyester resin contains an
   aliphatic diol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms in an amount of 50
 5 mol% or more, preferably 80 mol% or more, more preferably 90
   mol% or more.
           Examples of the aliphatic diol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms
   include 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol,

10 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol,
   1,10-decanediol, and 1,12-dodecanediol.
           Preferably, the number of carbon atoms of the main chain
   of the diol component constituting the non-crystalline polyester
   resin which is one preferable example of the polyester resin is an
15 odd number, and the diol component has an alkyl group in a side
   chain thereof.
           Preferably, the number of carbon atoms of the main chain
   of the aliphatic diol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms is an odd number,
   and the aliphatic diol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms has an alkyl
20 group in a side chain thereof.    It is preferably an aliphatic diol
   represented by the following General Formula (1):
           HO-(CR1R2),-OH --.    General Formula (1)
          where R1 and R 2 each independently represent a hydrogen
   atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, n is an odd
25 number of 3 to 9, and in units repeated by n, R's may be identical
                                      9

   to or different from each other and R 2 s may be identical to or
   different from each other.
           In the polyester resin, the crosslink component contains a
   trihydric or higher aliphatic alcohol, and preferably contains a
 5 trihydric or tetrahydric aliphatic alcohol from the viewpoints of
   obtaining good glossiness of a fixed image and good image density.
   The crosslink component may consist of the trihydric or higher
   aliphatic alcohol.
           Examples of the trihydric or higher aliphatic alcohol
10 include glycerin, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane,
   pentaerythritol, sorbitol, and dipentaerythritol.
           An amount of the crosslink component in the constituent
   components of the polyester resin is not particularly limited and
   may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose,
15 but is preferably 0.5% by mass to 5% by mass, more preferably 1%
   by mass to 3% by mass.
          An amount of the trihydric or higher aliphatic alcohol in
   polyhydric alcohol components serving as the constituent
   components of the polyester resin is not particularly limited and
20 may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose,
   but is preferably 50% by mass to 100% by mass, more preferably
   90% by mass to 100% by mass.
          In the polyester resin, the dicarboxylic acid component
   preferably contains an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 4 to 12
25 carbon atoms, and preferably contains the aliphatic dicarboxylic
                                     10

   acid having 4 to 12 carbon atoms in an amount of 50 mol% or
   more.
          Also, in the polyester resin, the dicarboxylic acid
   component preferably contains the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid
 5 having 4 to 12 carbon atoms in an amount of less than 60 mol%.
          Examples of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 4 to 12
   carbon atoms include succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid,
   pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, and
   decanedioic acid.
10        The polyester resins may be used alone or in combination
   with other polyester resins.
          The other polyester resins include, for example, a diol
   component and a dicarboxylic acid component as constituent
   components thereof.    Note that, the other polyester resins may
15 or may not contain an aliphatic diol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms
   as the constituent components thereof.     The other polyester
   resins may or may not contain the crosslink component as the
   constituent components thereof.
          The polyester resin preferably contains a urethane bond, a
20 urea bond, or both, since it is more excellent in adhesion onto
   recording media such as paper.     Also, as a result of containing a
   urethane bond, a urea bond, or both in the polyester resin, the
   urethane bond or the urea bond behaves as a pseudo-crosslinking
   point to increase rubber-like properties of the polyester resin.
25 As a result, the obtained toner is more excellent in heat resistant
                                    11

   storage stability and hot offset resistance.

   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include diamine, trivalent or higher amine,
   amino alcohol, amino mercaptan, amino acid, and compounds in
25 which the amino groups of the foregoing compounds are blocked.
                                    16

   These may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof.
          Among them, diamine, and a mixture of diamine and a
   small amount of trivalent or higher amine are preferable.
          The diamine is not particularly limited and may be
 5 appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include aromatic diamine, alicyclic diamine,
   and aliphatic diamine.   The aromatic diamine is not particularly
   limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose.    Examples thereof include phenylene diamine,
10 diethyl toluene diamine, and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane.
   The alicyclic diamine is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dimethyldicyclohexyl
   methane, diaminocyclohexane, and isophorone diamine.       The
15 aliphatic diamine is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include ethylene diamine, tetramethylene
   diamine, and hexamethylene diamine.
          The trivalent or higher amine is not particularly limited
20 and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended
   purpose.   Examples thereof include diethylene triamine, and
   triethylene tetramine.
          The amino alcohol is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
25 Examples thereof include ethanol amine, and hydroxyethyl
                                   17

   aniline.
          The aminomercaptan is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include aminoethyl mercaptan, and
 5 aminopropyl mercaptan.
          The amino acid is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include aminopropionic acid, and aminocaproic
   acid.
10        The compound where the amino group is blocked is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose.     Examples thereof include a ketimine
   compound where the amino group is blocked with ketone such as
   acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and an
15 oxazoline compound.
          A molecular structure of the polyester resin can be
   confirmed by solution-state or solid-state NMR, X-ray diffraction,
   GC/MS, LC/MS, or IR spectroscopy.      Simple methods thereof
   include a method for detecting, as a polyester resin, one that does
20 not have absorption based on SCH (out-of-plane bending
   vibration) of olefin at 965 cm-1  10 cm-1 and 990 cm-1    10 cm-1 in
   an infrared absorption spectrum.
          An amount of the polyester resin is not particularly
   limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
25 intended purpose, but it is preferably 50 parts by mass to 90
                                    18

    parts by mass, more preferably 70 parts by mass to 85 parts by
    mass, relative to 100 parts by mass of the toner.    When the
    amount thereof is smaller than 50 parts by mass, low
    temperature fixing ability, and hot offset resistance of a resulting
  5 toner may be impaired.     When the amount thereof is greater
    than 90 parts by mass, heat resistant storage stability of the
    toner may be impaired, and glossiness of an image obtained after
    fixing and coloring ability may reduce.     When the amount
    thereof is within the aforementioned more preferable range, it is
1   advantageous because all of the low temperature fixing ability,
    hot offset resistance, and heat resistant storage stability excel.
    <Crystalline polyester resin>
           The crystalline polyester resin exhibits thermofusion
    characteristics in which viscosity is drastically decreases at
15  temperature around fixing onset temperature, as the crystalline
    polyester resin has crystallinity.   By using the crystalline
    polyester resin having the aforementioned characteristics
    together with the polyester resin in the toner, the heat resistant
    storage stability of the toner is excellent up to the melt onset
20  temperature owing to crystallinity, and the toner drastically
    decreases its viscosity at the melt onset temperature because of
    melting of the crystalline polyester resin.   Along with the drastic
    decrease in viscosity, the crystalline polyester resin is melt
    together with the polyester resin, to drastically decrease their
25  viscosity to thereby be fixed.   Accordingly, a toner having
                                      19

   excellent heat resistant storage stability and low temperature
   fixing ability can be obtained.   Moreover, the toner has excellent
   results in terms of a releasing width (a difference between the
   minimum fixing temperature and hot offset occurring
 5 temperature).
          The crystalline polyester resin is obtained from a
   polyhydric alcohol and a polyvalent carboxylic acid or a
   derivative thereof such as a polyvalent carboxylic acid anhydride
   and a polyvalent carboxylic acid ester.
10        Note that, in the present invention, the crystalline
   polyester resin is one obtained from a polyhydric alcohol and a
   polyvalent carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof such as a
   polyvalent carboxylic acid anhydride and a polyvalent carboxylic
   acid ester, as described above, and a resin obtained by modifying
15 a polyester resin, for example, the aforementioned prepolymer
   and a resin obtained through cross-link and/or chain elongation
   reaction of the prepolymer do not belong to the crystalline
   polyester resin.
   -Polyhydric alcohol
20         The polyhydric alcohol is not particularly limited and
   may be appropriately selected depending on the intended
   purpose.    Examples thereof include diol, and trihydric or higher
   alcohol.
            Examples of the diol include saturated aliphatic diol.
25 Examples of the saturated aliphatic diol include linear chain
                                     20

   saturated aliphatic diol, and branched-chain saturated aliphatic
   diol.  Among them, linear chain saturated aliphatic diol is
   preferable, and C2-C12 linear chain saturated aliphatic diol is
   more preferable.    When the saturated aliphatic diol has a
 5 branched-chain structure, crystallinity of the crystalline
   polyester resin C may be low, which may lower the melting point.
   When the number of carbon atoms in the saturated aliphatic diol
   is greater than 12, it may be difficult to yield a material in
   practice.   The number of carbon atoms is therefore preferably 12
10 or less.
           Examples of the saturated aliphatic diol include ethylene
   glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol,
   1,6-hexanediol, 1,7-heptanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,9-nonanediol,
   1,10-decanediol, 1,11-undecanediol, 1,12-dodecanediol,
15 1,13-tridecanediol, 1,14-tetradecanediol, 1,18-octadecanediol,
   and 1,14-eicosanedecanediol.     Among them, ethylene glycol,
   1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,10-decanediol,
   and 1,12-dodecanediol are preferable, as they give high
   crystallinity to a resulting crystalline polyester resin, and give
20 excellent sharp melt properties.
            Examples of the trihydric or higher alcohol include
   glycerin, trimethylol ethane, trimethylolpropane, and
   pentaerythritol.    These may be used alone or in combination of
   two or more thereof.
25 -Polyvalent carboxylic acid
                                     21

          The polyvalent carboxylic acid is not particularly limited
   and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended
   purpose.    Examples thereof include divalent carboxylic acid, and
   trivalent or higher carboxylic acid.
 5        Examples of the divalent carboxylic acid include:
   saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, such as oxalic acid, succinic
   acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic
   acid, 1,9-nonanedicarboxylic acid, 1,10-decanedicarboxylic acid,
   1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic acid, 1, 14-tetradecanedicarboxylic
10 acid, and 1,18-octadecanedicarboxylic acid; aromatic dicarboxylic
   acid of dibasic acid, such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid,
   terephthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, malonic
   acid, and mesaconic acid; and anhydrides of the foregoing
   compounds, and lower (C1-C3) alkyl ester of the foregoing
15 compounds.
          Examples of the trivalent or higher carboxylic acid include
   1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid, 1,2,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid,
   1,2,4-naphthalene tricarboxylic acid, anhydrides thereof, and
   lower (C1-C3) alkyl esters thereof.
20         Moreover, the polyvalent carboxylic acid may contain,
   other than the saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or aromatic
   dicarboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid containing a sulfonic acid
   group.   Further, the polyvalent carboxylic acid may contain,
   other than the saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or aromatic
25 dicarboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid having a double bond.
                                     22

   These may be used alone or in combination of two or more
   thereof.
          The crystalline polyester resin is preferably composed of a
   linear chain saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 4 to 12
 5 carbon atoms and a linear chain saturated aliphatic diol having 2
   to 12 carbon atoms.    Specifically, the crystalline polyester resin
   preferably contains a constituent unit derived from a saturated
   aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and a
   constituent unit derived from a saturated aliphatic diol having 2
10 to 12 carbon atoms.    As a result of this, crystallinity increases,
   and sharp melt properties improve, and therefore it is preferable
   as excellent low temperature fixing ability of the toner is
   exhibited.
          A melting point of the crystalline polyester resin is not
15 particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 60'C to 80'C.     When
   the melting point thereof is lower than 60'C, the crystalline
   polyester resin tends to be melted at low temperature, which may
   impair heat resistant storage stability of the toner.     When the
20 melting point thereof is higher than 80'C, melting of the
   crystalline polyester resin with heat applied during fixing may be
   insufficient, which may impair low temperature fixing ability of
   the toner.
          A molecular weight of the crystalline polyester resin is not
25 particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
                                     23

   on the intended purpose.     Since those having a sharp molecular
   weight distribution and low molecular weight have excellent low
   temperature fixing ability, and heat resistant storage stability of
   a resulting toner lowers as an amount of a low molecular weight
 5 component, an o-dichlorobenzene soluble component of the
   crystalline polyester resin preferably has the weight average
   molecular weight (Mw) of 3,000 to 30,000, number average
   molecular weight (Mn) of 1,000 to 10,000, and Mw/Mn of 1.0 to 10,
   as measured by GPC.      Further, it is more preferred that the
10 weight average molecular weight (Mw) thereof be 5,000 to 15,000,
   the number average molecular weight (Mn) there be 2,000 to
   10,000, and the Mw/Mn be 1.0 to 5.0.
           An acid value of the crystalline polyester resin is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
15 on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 5 mgKOH/g or
   higher, more preferably 10 mgKOH/g or higher for achieving the
   desired low temperature fixing ability in view of affinity between
   paper and the resin.    Meanwhile, the acid value thereof is
   preferably 45 mgKOH/g or lower for the purpose of improving hot
20 offset resistance.
           A hydroxyl value of the crystalline polyester resin is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 0 mgKOH/g to 50
   mgKOH/g, more preferably 5 mgKOH/g to 50 mgKOH/g, for
25 achieving the desired low temperature fixing ability and
                                     24

   excellent charging properties.
          A molecular structure of the crystalline polyester resin can
   be confirmed by solution-state or solid-state NMR, X-ray
   diffraction, GC/MS, LC/MS, or IR spectroscopy.     Simple methods
 5 thereof include a method for detecting, as the crystalline
   polyester resin, one that has absorption based on 6CH
   (out-of-plane bending vibration) of olefin at 965 cm-1   10 cm-1
   and 990 cm-1    10 cm-1 in an infrared absorption spectrum.
          An amount of the crystalline polyester resin is not
10 particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 3 parts by mass to 20
   parts by mass, more preferably 5 parts by mass to 15 parts by
   mass, relative to 100 parts by mass of the toner.    When the
   amount thereof is smaller than 3 parts by mass, the crystalline
15 polyester resin does not give sufficient sharp melt properties,
   which may lead to insufficient low temperature fixing ability of a
   resulting toner.   When the amount thereof is greater than 20
   parts by mass, a resulting toner may have low heat resistant
   storage stability, and tends to cause fogging of an image.   When
20 the amount thereof is within the aforementioned more preferable
   range, it is advantageous because a resulting toner is excellent in
   terms of both high image quality and low temperature fixing
   ability.
   <Other components>
                                    25

           Examples of other components include a releasing agent,
   colorant, charge controlling agent, external additive, a flow
   improving agent, a cleaning improving agent, and a magnetic
   material.
 5 -Releasing agent
           The releasing agent is appropriately selected from those
   known in the art without any limitation.
           Examples of wax serving as the releasing agent include:
   natural wax, such as vegetable wax (e.g., carnauba wax, cotton
10 wax, Japan wax and rice wax), animal wax (e.g., bees wax and
   lanolin), mineral wax (e.g., ozokelite and ceresine) and
   petroleum wax (e.g., paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax and
   petrolatum).
          Examples of the wax other than the above natural wax
15 include synthetic hydrocarbon wax (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch wax
   and polyethylene wax; and synthetic wax (e.g., ester wax, ketone
   wax and ether wax).
          Further, other examples of the releasing agent include
   fatty acid amides such as 12-hydroxystearic acid amide, stearic
20 amide, phthalic anhydride imide and chlorinated hydrocarbons;
   low-molecular-weight crystalline polymers such as acrylic
   homopolymers (e.g., poly-n-stearyl methacrylate and
   poly-n-lauryl methacrylate) and acrylic copolymers (e.g.,
   n-stearyl acrylate-ethyl methacrylate copolymers); and
25 crystalline polymers having a long alkyl group as a side chain.
                                    26

           Among them, hydrocarbon wax, such as paraffin wax,
   microcrystalline wax, Fischer-Tropsch wax, polyethylene wax,
   and polypropylene wax, is preferable.
           A melting point of the releasing agent is not particularly
 5 limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose, but it is preferably 60'C to 80'C.   When the
   melting point thereof is lower than 60'C, the releasing agent
   tends to melt at low temperature, which may impair heat
   resistant storage stability.   When the melting point thereof is
10 higher than 80'C, the releasing agent is not sufficiently melted to
   thereby cause fixing offset even in the case where the resin is
   melted and is in the fixing temperature range, which may cause
   defects in an image.
           An amount of the releasing agent is appropriately selected
15 depending on the intended purpose without any limitation, but it
   is preferably 2 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass, more preferably
   3 parts by mass to 8 parts by mass, relative to 100 parts by mass
   of the toner.   When the amount thereof is smaller than 2 parts
   by mass, a resulting toner may have insufficient hot offset
20 resistance, and low temperature fixing ability during fixing.
   When the amount thereof is greater than 10 parts by mass, a
   resulting toner may have insufficient heat resistant storage
   stability, and tends to cause fogging in an image.    When the
   amount thereof is within the aforementioned more preferable
25 range, it is advantageous because image quality and fixing
                                     27

   stability can be improved.
   -Colorant
           The colorant is appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose without any limitation, and examples thereof
 5 include carbon black, a nigrosin dye, iron black, naphthol yellow
   S, Hansa yellow (10G, 5G and G), cadmium yellow, yellow iron
   oxide, yellow ocher, yellow lead, titanium yellow, polyazo yellow,
   oil yellow, Hansa yellow (GR, A, RN and R), pigment yellow L,
   benzidine yellow (G and GR), permanent yellow (NCG), vulcan
10 fast yellow (5G, R), tartrazinelake, quinoline yellow lake,
   anthrasan yellow BGL, isoindolinon yellow, colcothar, red lead,
   lead vermilion, cadmium red, cadmium mercury red, antimony
   vermilion, permanent red 4R, parared, fiser red,
   parachloroorthonitro anilin red, lithol fast scarlet G, brilliant
15 fast scarlet, brilliant carmine BS, permanent red (F2R, F4R,
   FRL, FRLL and F4RH), fast scarlet VD, vulcan fast rubin B,
   brilliant scarlet G, lithol rubin GX, permanent red F5R, brilliant
   carmine 6B, pigment scarlet 3B, Bordeaux 5B, toluidine Maroon,
   permanent Bordeaux F2K, Helio Bordeaux BL, Bordeaux 10B,
20 BON maroon light, BON maroon medium, eosin lake, rhodamine
   lake B, rhodamine lake Y, alizarin lake, thioindigo red B,
   thioindigo maroon, oil red, quinacridone red, pyrazolone red,
   polyazo red, chrome vermilion, benzidine orange, perinone
   orange, oil orange, cobalt blue, cerulean blue, alkali blue lake,
25 peacock blue lake, Victoria blue lake, metal-free phthalocyanine
                                     28

   blue, phthalocyanine blue, fast sky blue, indanthrene blue (RS
   and BC), indigo, ultramarine, iron blue, anthraquinone blue, fast
   violet B, methyl violet lake, cobalt purple, manganese violet,
   dioxane violet, anthraquinone violet, chrome green, zinc green,
 5 chromium oxide, viridian, emerald green, pigment green B,
   naphthol green B, green gold, acid green lake, malachite green
   lake, phthalocyanine green, anthraquinone green, titanium
   oxide, zinc flower, and lithopone.
           An amount of the colorant is not particularly limited and
10 may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose,
   but it is preferably 1 part by mass to 15 parts by mass, more
   preferably 3 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass, relative to 100
   parts by mass of the toner.
           The colorant may be used as a master batch in which the
15 colorant forms a composite with a resin.    Examples of the binder
   resin kneaded in the production of, or together with the master
   batch include, other than the aforementioned crystalline
   polyester resin, polymer of styrene or substitution thereof (e.g.,
   polystyrene, poly-p-chlorostyrene, and polyvinyl); styrene
20 copolymer (e.g., styrene-p-chlorostyrene copolymer,
   styrene-propylene copolymer, styrene-vinyl toluene copolymer,
   styrene-vinyl naphthalene copolymer, styrene-methyl acrylate
   copolymer, styrene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-butyl
   acrylate copolymer, styrene-octyl acrylate copolymer,
25 styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, styrene-ethyl
                                    29

   methacrylate copolymer, styrene-butyl methacrylate copolymer,
   styrene-methyl a-chloromethacrylate copolymer,
   styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-vinyl methyl ketone
   copolymer, styrene-butadiene copolymer, styrene-isoprene
 5 copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile-indene copolymer,
   styrene-maleic acid copolymer, and styrene-maleic acid ester
   copolymer); and others including polymethyl methacrylate,
   polybutyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate
   polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, epoxy resin, epoxy polyol
10 resin, polyurethane, polyamide, polyvinyl butyral, polyacrylic
   acid resin, rosin, modified rosin, a terpene resin, an aliphatic or
   alicyclic hydrocarbon resin, an aromatic petroleum resin,
   chlorinated paraffin, and paraffin wax.     These may be used
   independently, or in combination.
15         The master batch can be prepared by mixing and kneading
   the colorant with the resin for the master batch.    In the mixing
   and kneading, an organic solvent may be used for improving the
   interactions between the colorant and the resin.     Moreover, the
   master batch can be prepared by a flashing method in which an
20 aqueous paste containing a colorant is mixed and kneaded with a
   resin and an organic solvent, and then the colorant is transferred
   to the resin to remove the water and the organic solvent.     This
   method is preferably used because a wet cake of the colorant is
   used as it is, and it is not necessary to dry the wet cake of the
25 colorant to prepare a colorant.    In the mixing and kneading of
                                     30

   the colorant and the resin, a high-shearing disperser (e.g., a
   three-roll mill) is preferably used.
   -Charge controlling agent
          The charge controlling agent is appropriately selected
 5 depending on the intended purpose without any limitation, and
   examples thereof include nigrosine dyes, triphenylmethane dyes,
   chrome-containing metal complex dyes, molybdic acid chelate
   pigments, rhodamine dyes, alkoxy amines, quaternary
   ammonium salts (including fluorine -modified quaternary
10 ammonium salts), alkylamides, phosphorus, phosphorus
   compounds, tungsten, tungsten compounds, fluorine active
   agents, metal salts of salicylic acid, and metal salts of salicylic
   acid derivatives.
          Specific examples thereof include: nigrosine dye
15 BONTRON 03, quaternary ammonium salt BONTRON P-51,
   metal-containing azo dye BONTRON S-34, oxynaphthoic
   acid-based metal complex E-82, salicylic acid-based metal
   complex E-84 and phenol condensate E-89 (all manufactured by
   ORIENT CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES CO., LTD); quaternary
20 ammonium salt molybdenum complex TP-302 and TP-415 (all
   manufactured by Hodogaya Chemical Co., Ltd.); LRA-901; boron
   complex LR-147 (manufactured by Japan Carlit Co., Ltd.); copper
   phthalocyanine; perylene; quinacridone; azo pigments; and
   polymeric compounds having, as a functional group, a sulfonic
25 acid group, carboxyl group, quaternary ammonium salt, etc.
                                     31

           An amount of the charge controlling agent is not
    particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
    on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 0.1 parts by mass to
    10 parts by mass, more preferably 0.2 parts by mass to 5 parts by
  5 mass, relative to 100 parts by mass of the toner.    When the
    amount thereof is greater than 10 parts by mass, the charging
    ability of the toner becomes excessive, which may reduce the
    effect of the charge controlling agent, increase electrostatic force
    to a developing roller, leading to low flowability of the developer,
1   or low image density of the resulting image.     These charge
    controlling agents may be dissolved and dispersed after being
    melted and kneaded together with the master batch, and/or resin.
    The charge controlling agents can be, of course, directly added to
    an organic solvent when dissolution and dispersion is performed.
15  Alternatively, the charge controlling agents may be fixed on
    surfaces of toner particles after the production of the toner
    particles.
    -External additive
           As for the external additive, other than oxide particles, a
20  combination of inorganic particles and hydrophobic-treated
    inorganic particles can be used.    The average primary particle
    diameter of the hydrophobic-treated particles is preferably 1 nm
    to 100 nm.    More preferred are 5 nm to 70 nm of the inorganic
    particles.
25         Moreover, it is preferred that the external additive contain
                                     32

   at least one type of hydrophobic-treated inorganic particles
   having the average primary particle diameter of 20 nm or
   smaller, and at least one type of inorganic particles having the
   average primary particle diameter of 30 nm or greater.
 5 Moreover, the external additive preferably has the BET specific
   surface area of 20 m 2 /g to 500 m 2 /g.
           The external additive is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include silica particles, hydrophobic silica,
10 fatty acid metal salts (e.g., zinc stearate, and aluminum
   stearate), metal oxide (e.g., titania, alumina, tin oxide, and
   antimony oxide), and a fluoropolymer.
           Examples of the suitable additive include hydrophobic
   silica, titania, titanium oxide, and alumina particles.    Examples
15 of the silica particles include R972, R974, RX200, RY200, R202,
   R805, and R812 (all manufactured by Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.).
   Examples of the titania particles include P-25 (manufactured by
   Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.); STT-30, STT-65C-S (both
   manufactured by Titan Kogyo, Ltd.); TAF-140 (manufactured by
20 Fuji Titanium Industry Co., Ltd.); and MT-150W, MT-500B,
   MT-600B, MT-150A (all manufactured by TAYCA
   CORPORATION).
           Examples of the hydrophobic treated titanium oxide
   particles include: T-805 (manufactured by Nippon Aerosil Co.,
25 Ltd.); STT-30A, STT-65S-S (both manufactured by Titan Kogyo,
                                     33

   Ltd.); TAF-500T, TAF-1500T (both manufactured by Fuji
   Titanium Industry Co., Ltd.); MT-100S, MT-100T (both
   manufactured by TAYCA CORPORATION); and IT-S
   (manufactured by ISHIHARA SANGYO KAISHA, LTD.).
 5        The hydrophobic-treated oxide particles,
   hydrophobic-treated silica particles, hydrophobic-treated titania
   particles, and hydrophobic-treated alumina particles are
   obtained, for example, by treating hydrophilic particles with a
   silane coupling agent, such as methyltrimethoxy silane,
10 methyltriethoxy silane, and octyltrimethoxy silane.       Moreover,
   silicone oil-treated oxide particles, or silicone oil-treated
   inorganic particles, which have been treated by adding silicone
   oil optionally with heat, are also suitably used as the external
   additive.
15         Examples of the silicone oil include dimethyl silicone oil,
   methylphenyl silicone oil, chlorophenyl silicone oil, methyl
   hydrogen silicone oil, alkyl-modified silicone oil,
   fluorine-modified silicone oil, polyether-modified silicone oil,
   alcohol-modified silicone oil, amino-modified silicone oil,
20 epoxy-modified silicone oil, epoxy-polyether-modified silicone oil,
   phenol-modified silicone oil, carboxyl-modified silicone oil,
   mercapto-modified silicone oil, methacryl-modified silicone oil,
   and a-methylstyrene-modified silicone oil.
           Examples of the inorganic particles include silica,
25 alumina, titanium oxide, barium titanate, magnesium titanate,
                                     34

   calcium titanate, strontium titanate, iron oxide, copper oxide,
   zinc oxide, tin oxide, quartz sand, clay, mica, wollastonite,
   diatomaceous earth, chromic oxide, cerium oxide, red iron oxide,
   antimony trioxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, barium
 5 sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, silicon carbide,
   and silicon nitride.   Among them, silica and titanium dioxide are
   preferable.
          An amount of the external additive is not particularly
   limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
10 intended purpose, but it is preferably 0.1 parts by mass to 5 parts
   by mass, more preferably 0.3 parts by mass to 3 parts by mass,
   relative to 100 parts by mass of the toner.
          The average particle diameter of primary particles of the
   inorganic particles is not particularly limited and may be
15 appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but it
   is preferably 100 nm or smaller, more preferably 3 nm to 70 nm.
   When it is smaller than the aforementioned range, the inorganic
   particles are embedded in the toner particles, and therefore the
   function of the inorganic particles may not be effectively
20 exhibited.   When the average particle diameter thereof is
   greater than the aforementioned range, the inorganic particles
   may unevenly damage a surface of a photoconductor, and hence
   not preferable.
   -Flowability improving agent
25        The flowability improving agent is not particularly limited
                                    35

   and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended
   purpose so long as it is capable of performing surface treatment of
   the toner to increase hydrophobicity, and preventing
   degradations of flow properties and charging properties of the
 5 toner even in a high humidity environment.      Examples thereof
   include a silane-coupling agent, a sililation agent, a
   silane-coupling agent containing a fluoroalkyl group, an organic
   titanate-based coupling agent, an aluminum-based coupling
   agent, silicone oil, and modified silicone oil. It is particularly
10 preferred that the silica or titanium oxide be used as hydrophobic
   silica or hydrophobic titanium oxide treated with the
   aforementioned flow improving agent.
   -Cleanability improving agent
           The cleanability improving agent is not particularly
15 limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose so long as it can be added to the toner for the
   purpose of removing the developer remained on a photoconductor
   or primary transfer member after transferring.      Examples
   thereof include: fatty acid metal salt such as zinc stearate,
20 calcium stearate, and stearic acid; and polymer particles
   produced by soap-free emulsion polymerization, such as
   polymethyl methacrylate particles, and polystyrene particles.
   The polymer particles are preferably those having a relatively
   narrow particle size distribution, and the polymer particles
25 having the volume average particle diameter of 0.01 pim to 1 ptm
                                     36

   are preferably used.
   -Magnetic material
           The magnetic material is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
 5 Examples thereof include iron powder, magnetite, and ferrite.
   Among them, a white magnetic material is preferable in terms of
   a color tone.
   <Glass transition temperature (Tglst)>
           The toner has a glass transition temperature (Tg1st) of
10 20'C to 50'C, preferably 25'C to 50'C, where the glass transition
   temperature (Tglst) is measured in the first heating in
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the toner.
           If the Tg of a conventional toner is lowered to be about
   50'C or lower, the conventional toner tends to cause aggregation
15 of toner particles influenced by temperature variations during
   transportation or storage of the toner in summer or in a tropical
   region.    As a result, adherence of the toner arises in a toner
   bottle, or within a developing unit.    Moreover, supply failures
   due to clogging of the toner in the toner bottle, and formation of
20 defected images due to toner adherence are likely to occur.
           The toner of the present invention has lower Tg than that
   of a conventional toner.    However, the polyester resin, which is a
   low Tg component in the toner, has a non-linear chain structure,
   and therefore the toner of the present invention can maintain
25 heat resistant storage stability.    Especially in the case where
                                     37

   the polyester resin has a urethane bond or urea bond having high
   cohesive force, an effect of maintaining heat resistant storage
   stability becomes significant.
           A glass transition temperature (Tg2nd) of the toner, where
 5 the glass transition temperature (Tg2nd) is measured in the
   second heating in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the
   toner, is not particularly limited and may be appropriately
   selected depending on the intended purpose, but it is preferably
   00 C to 30'C, preferably 10'C to 30'C.
10         A difference (Tg1st - Tg2nd) between the glass transition
   temperature (Tg1st) of the toner as measured in the first heating
   in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the glass
   transition temperature (Tg2nd) of the toner as measured in the
   second heating in DSC is not particularly limited and may be
15 appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but it
   is preferably 00 C or more (i.e., Tg1st > Tg2nd), more preferably
   10'C or more.     The upper limit of the difference is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but the difference (Tglst - Tg2nd) is
20 preferably 50'C or less.
           When the toner of the present invention contains a
   crystalline polyester resin, the crystalline polyester resin and the
   polyester resin, which are present in a non-compatible state
   before heating (before the first heating), become in a compatible
25 state after heating (after the first heating).
                                      38

           When the Tg1st of the toner is less than 20'C, the toner
    has poor heat resistant storage stability, causes blocking within a
    developing unit, and causes filming on a photoconductor.      When
    the Tg1st thereof is more than 50'C, the toner has poor low
  5 temperature fixing ability.
           When the Tg2nd of the toner is less than 00 C, the fixed
    image (printed matter) may be degraded in blocking resistance,
    whereas when it is more than 30'C, sufficient low temperature
    fixing ability and glossiness cannot be obtained in some cases.
10  <Volume average particle diameter>
           The volume average particle diameter of the toner is not
    particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
    on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 3 ptm to 7 pim.
    Moreover, a ratio of the volume average particle diameter to the
1   number average particle diameter is preferably 1.2 or less.
    Further, the toner preferably contains toner particles having the
    volume average particle diameter of 2 pm or smaller, in an
    amount of 1% by number to 10% by number.
    <Calculation methods and analysis methods of various properties
20  of toner and constituent component of toner>
           The Tg, acid value, hydroxyl value, molecular weight, and
    melting point of the polyester resin, the crystalline polyester
    resin, and the releasing agent may be each measured.
    Alternatively, each component may be separated from an actual
25  toner by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or the like, and
                                     39

   separated each component may be subjected to the analysis
   methods described later, to thereby calculate Tg, molecular
   weight, melting point, and mass ratio of a constituent component.
           Separation of each component by GPC can be performed,
 5 for example, by the following method.
           In GPC using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a mobile phase, an
   eluate is subjected to fractionation by means of a fraction
   collector, a fraction corresponding to a part of a desired molecular
   weight is collected from a total area of an elution curve.
10        The collected eluates are concentrated and dried by an
   evaporator or the like, and a resulting solid content is dissolved
   in a deuterated solvent, such as deuterated chloroform, and
   deuterated THF, followed by measurement of 'H-NMR.          From an
   integral ratio of each element, a ratio of a constituent monomer of
15 the resin in the elution composition is calculated.
          As another method, after concentrating the eluate,
   hydrolysis is performed with sodium hydroxide or the like, and a
   ratio of a constituent monomer is calculated by subjecting the
   decomposed product to a qualitative or quantitative analysis by
20 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
           Note that, in the case where the method for producing a
   toner produces toner base particles by generating the polyester
   resin through a chain-elongation reaction and/or crosslink
   reaction of the non-linear chain reactive precursor and the curing
25 agent, the polyester resin may be separated from an actual toner
                                     40

   by GPC or the like, to thereby determine Tg thereof.
   Alternatively, a polyester resin is separately generated through a
   chain-elongation reaction and/or crosslink reaction of the
   non-linear chain reactive precursor and the curing agent, and Tg
 5 may be measured on the synthesized polyester resin.
   <<Separation unit for toner constituent components>>
          An example of a separation unit for each component during
   an analysis of the toner will be specifically explained hereinafter.
          First, 1 g of a toner is added to 100 mL THF, and the
10 resulting mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at 25 0 C, to thereby a
   solution in which soluble components are dissolved.
          The solution is then filtered through a membrane filter
   having an opening of 0.2 pim, to thereby obtain the THF soluble
   components in the toner.
15        Next, the THF soluble components are dissolved in THF, to
   thereby prepare a sample for measurement of GPC, and the
   prepared sample is supplied to GPC used for molecular weight
   measurement of each resin mentioned above.
          Meanwhile, a fraction collector is disposed at an eluate
20 outlet of GPC, to fraction the eluate per a certain count.    The
   eluate is obtained per 5% in terms of the area ratio from the
   elution onset on the elution curve (raise of the curve).
          Next, each eluted fraction, as a sample, in an amount of 30
   mg is dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated chloroform, and to this
25 solution, 0.05% by volume of tetramethyl silane (TMS) is added
                                     41

    as a standard material.
           A glass tube for NMR having a diameter of 5 mm is charged
    with the solution, from which a spectrum is obtained by means of
    a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus (JNM-AL 400,
  5 manufactured by JEOL Ltd.) by performing multiplication 128
    times at temperature of 23'C to 25'C.
           The monomer compositions and the compositional ratios of
    the polyester resin, the crystalline polyester resin, and the like
    contained in the toner are determined from peak integral ratios
1   of the obtained spectrum.
            For example, an assignment of a peak is performed in the
    following manner, and a constituent monomer component ratio is
    determined from each integral ratio.
           The assignment of a peak is as follows:
15         Around 8.25 ppm: derived from a benzene ring of
    trimellitic acid (for one hydrogen atom)
           Around the region of 8.07 ppm to 8.10 ppm: derived from a
    benzene ring of terephthalic acid (for four hydrogen atoms)
           Around the region of 7.1 ppm to 7.25 ppm: derived from a
20  benzene ring of bisphenol A (for four hydrogen atoms)
           Around 6.8 ppm: derived from a benzene ring of bisphenol
    A (for four hydrogen atoms), and derived from a double bond of
    fumaric acid (for two hydrogen atoms)
           Around the region of 5.2 ppm to 5.4 ppm: derived from
25  methine of bisphenol A propylene oxide adduct (for one hydrogen
                                      42

   atom)
           Around the region of 4.0 ppm to 5.0 ppm: derived from
   methylene of an aliphatic alcohol (for two hydrogen atoms)
           Around the region of 3.7 ppm to 4.7 ppm: derived from
 5 methylene of a bisphenol A propylene oxide adduct (for two
   hydrogen atoms), and derived from methylene of a bisphenol A
   ethylene oxide (for four hydrogen atoms)
           Around the region of 2.2 ppm to 2.6 ppm: derived from
   methylene of an aliphatic carboxylic acid (for two hydrogen
10 atoms)
           Around 1.6 ppm: derived from a methyl group of bisphenol
   A and an aliphatic alcohol (for 6 hydrogen atoms).
           From these results, for example, the extracted product
   collected in the fraction in which the polyester resin occupies 90%
15 or more in the peak integral ratio in the spectrum can be treated
   as the polyester resin.
           Similarly, the extracted product collected in the fraction in
   which the crystalline polyester resin occupies 90% or more in the
   peak integral ratio in the spectrum can be treated as the
20 crystalline polyester resin.
   <<Measurement methods of melting point and glass transition
   temperature (Tg)>>
           In the present invention, a melting point and a glass
   transition temperature (Tg) can be measured, for example, by
25 means of a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) system
                                     43

   (Q-200, manufactured by TA Instruments Japan Inc.).
           Specifically, a melting point and glass transition
   temperature of a sample are measured in the following manners.
           Specifically, first, an aluminum sample container charged
 5 with about 5.0 mg of a sample is placed on a holder unit, and the
   holder unit is then set in an electric furnace.   Next, the sample
   is heated (first heating) from -80'C to 150'C at the heating rate
   of 10 'C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere.     Then, the sample is
   cooled from 150 0 C to -80'C at the cooling rate of 10 'C/min,
10 followed by again heating (second heating) to 150'C at the
   heating rate of 10 'C/min.      DSC curves are respectively
   measured for the first heating and the second heating by means
   of a differential scanning calorimeter (Q-200, manufactured by
   TA Instruments Japan Inc.).
15        The DSC curve for the first heating is selected from the
   obtained DSC curve by means of an analysis program stored in
   the Q-200 system, to thereby determine glass transition
   temperature of the sample with the first heating.      Similarly, the
   DSC curve for the second heating is selected, and the glass
20 transition temperature of the sample with the second heating can
   be determined.
          Moreover, the DSC curve for the first heating is selected
   from the obtained DSC curve by means of the analysis program
   stored in the Q-200 system, and an endothermic peak top
25 temperature of the sample for the first heating is determined as a
                                      44

   melting point of the sample.    Similarly, the DSC curve for the
   second heating is selected, and the endothermic peak top
   temperature of the sample for the second heating can be
   determined as a melting point of the sample with the second
 5 heating.
           In the case where a toner is used as a sample, glass
   transition temperature for the first heating is represented as
   Tg1st, and glass transition temperature for the second heating is
   represented as Tg2nd in the present specification.
10        Moreover, in the present specification, the endothermic
   peak top temperatures and glass transition temperatures of the
   polyester resin, the crystalline polyester resin, and other
   constituent components, such as the releasing agent, for the
   second heating are regarded as melting point and Tg of each
15 sample, unless otherwise stated.
   <Production method of toner>
          A production method of the toner is not particularly
   limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose, but the toner is preferably granulated by
20 dispersing, in an aqueous medium, an oil phase containing the
   polyester resin, preferably further containing the crystalline
   polyester resin, and if necessary, further containing the releasing
   agent and the colorant.
          Also, the toner is more preferably granulated by
25 dispersing, in an aqueous medium, an oil phase containing: as the
                                    45

   polyester resin, a polyester resin which is a prepolymer
   containing a urethane bond, a urea bond, or both; and a polyester
   resin not containing a urethane bond, a urea bond, or both;
   preferably further containing the crystalline polyester resin; and
 5 if necessary, further containing the curing agent, the releasing
   agent, the colorant, etc.
          As one example of such a production method of the toner, a
   conventionally dissolution suspension method is listed.    As one
   example of the production method of the toner, a method for
10 forming toner base particles while extending the polyester resin
   through a chain-elongation reaction and/or cross-link reaction
   between the prepolymer and the curing agent will be described
   hereinafter.   In such a method, a preparation of an aqueous
   medium, preparation of an oil phase containing a toner material,
15 emulsification and/or dispersion of the toner material, and
   removal of an organic solvent are carried out.
   -Preparation of aqueous medium (aqueous phase)
          The preparation of the aqueous phase can be carried out,
   for example, by dispersing resin particles in an aqueous medium.
20 An amount of the resin particles in the aqueous medium is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 0.5 parts by mass to
   10 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the aqueous
   medium.
25        The aqueous medium is not particularly limited and may
                                    46

   be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include water, a solvent miscible with water,
   and a mixture thereof.    These may be used independently, or in
   combination.    Among them, water is preferable.
 5        The solvent miscible with water is not particularly limited
   and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended
   purpose.   Examples thereof include alcohol, dimethyl formamide,
   tetrahydrofuran, cellosolve, and lower ketone.    The alcohol is
   not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected
10 depending on the intended purpose.     Examples thereof include
   methanol, isopropanol, and ethylene glycol.    The lower ketone is
   not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected
   depending on the intended purpose.     Examples thereof include
   acetone and methyl ethyl ketone.
15 -Preparation of oil phase
          The oil phase containing the toner materials can be
   prepared by dissolving or dispersing, in an organic solvent, toner
   materials containing: at least a polyester resin which is a
   prepolymer containing a urethane bond, a urea bond, or both; a
20 polyester resin not containing a urethane bond, a urea bond, or
   both; and the crystalline polyester resin, and if necessary,
   further containing the curing agent, the releasing agent, the
   colorant, etc.
          The organic solvent is not particularly limited and may be
25 appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but it
                                    47

   is preferably an organic solvent having a boiling point of lower
   than 150'C, as removal thereof is easy.
          The organic solvent having the boiling point of lower than
   150'C is not particularly limited and may be appropriately
 5 selected depending on the intended purpose.      Examples thereof
   include toluene, xylene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, methylene
   chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane,
   trichloroethylene, chloroform, monochlorobenzene,
   dichloroethylidene, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl
10 ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone.     These may be used alone or
   in combination of two or more thereof.
          Among them, ethyl acetate, toluene, xylene, benzene,
   methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon
   tetrachloride are particularly preferable, and ethyl acetate is
15 more preferable.
   -Emulsification or dispersion
          The emulsification or dispersion of the toner materials can
   be carried out by dispersing the oil phase containing the toner
   materials in the aqueous medium.      In the course of the
20 emulsification or dispersion of the toner material, the curing
   agent and the prepolymer are allowed to carry out a
   chain-elongation reaction or cross-link reaction.
          The reaction conditions (e.g., the reaction time and
   reaction temperature) for generating the prepolymer are not
25 particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
                                    48

   on a combination of the curing agent and the prepolymer.
           The reaction time is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but it
   is preferably 10 minutes to 40 hours, more preferably 2 hours to
 5 24 hours.
           The reaction temperature is not particularly limited and
   may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose,
   but it is preferably 00 C to 150'C, more preferably 40'C to 98'C.
           A method for stably forming a dispersion liquid containing
10 the prepolymer in the aqueous medium is not particularly limited
   and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended
   purpose.    Examples thereof include a method in which an oil
   phase, which has been prepared by dissolving and/or dispersing a
   toner material in a solvent, is added to a phase of an aqueous
15 medium, followed by dispersing with shear force.
           A disperser used for the dispersing is not particularly
   limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose.     Examples thereof include a low-speed
   shearing disperser, a high-speed shearing disperser, a friction
20 disperser, a high-pressure jetting disperser and an ultrasonic
   wave disperser.
           Among them, the high-speed shearing disperser is
   preferable, because it can control the particle diameters of the
   dispersed elements (oil droplets) to the range of 2 pm to 20 pm.
25         In the case where the high-speed shearing disperser is
                                     49

   used, the conditions for dispersing, such as the rotating speed,
   dispersion time, and dispersion temperature, may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
           The rotational speed is not particularly limited and may be
 5 appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but it
   is preferably 1,000 rpm to 30,000 rpm, more preferably 5,000 rpm
   to 20,000 rpm.
           The dispersion time is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but it
10 is preferably 0.1 minutes to 5 minutes in case of a batch system.
           The dispersion temperature is not particularly limited and
   may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose,
   but it is preferably 00 C to 150'C, more preferably 40'C to 98'C
   under pressure.    Note that, generally speaking, dispersion can
15 be easily carried out, as the dispersion temperature is higher.
           An amount of the aqueous medium used for the
   emulsification or dispersion of the toner material is is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 50 parts by mass to
20 2,000 parts by mass, more preferably 100 parts by mass to 1,000
   parts by mass, relative to 100 parts by mass of the toner material.
           When the amount of the aqueous medium is smaller than
   50 parts by mass, the dispersion state of the toner material is
   impaired, which may result a failure in attaining toner base
25 particles having desired particle diameters.     When the amount
                                     50

   thereof is greater than 2,000 parts by mass, the production cost
   may increase.
           When the oil phase containing the toner material is
   emulsified or dispersed, a dispersant is preferably used for the
 5 purpose of stabilizing dispersed elements, such as oil droplets,
   and gives a shape particle size distribution as well as giving
   desirable shapes of toner particles.
           The dispersant is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
10 Examples thereof include a surfactant, a water-insoluble
   inorganic compound dispersant, and a polymer protective colloid.
   These may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof.
   Among them, the surfactant is preferable.
           The surfactant is not particularly limited and may be
15 appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include an anionic surfactant, a cationic
   surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, and an amphoteric surfactant.
           The anionic surfactant is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
20 Examples thereof include alkyl benzene sulfonic acid salts,
    x-olefin sulfonic acid salts and phosphoric acid esters.  Among
   them, those having a fluoroalkyl group are preferable.
   -Removal of organic solvent
           A method for removing the organic solvent from the
25 dispersion liquid such as the emulsified slurry is not particularly
                                     51

   limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose.    Examples thereof include: a method in which
   an entire reaction system is gradually heated to evaporate out
   the organic solvent in the oil droplets; and a method in which the
 5 dispersion liquid is sprayed in a dry atmosphere to remove the
   organic solvent in the oil droplets.
           As the organic solvent removed, toner base particles are
   formed.    The toner base particles can be subjected to washing
   and drying, and can be further subjected to classification.   The
10 classification may be carried out in a liquid by removing small
   particles by cyclone, a decanter, or centrifugal separator, or may
   be performed on particles after drying.
           The obtained toner base particles may be mixed with
   particles such as the external additive, and the charge controlling
15 agent.   By applying a mechanical impact during the mixing, the
   particles such as the external additive can be prevented from fall
   off from surfaces of the toner base particles.
           A method for applying the mechanical impact is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
20 on the intended purpose.    Examples thereof include: a method
   for applying impulse force to a mixture by a blade rotating at
   high speed; a method for adding a mixture into a high-speed air
   flow and accelerating the speed of the flow to thereby make the
   particles crash into other particles, or make the composite
25 particles crush into an appropriate impact board.
                                    52

           A device used for this method is appropriately selected
    depending on the intended purpose without any limitation, and
    examples thereof include ANGMILL (product of Hosokawa Micron
    Corporation), an apparatus produced by modifying I-type mill
  5 (product of Nippon Pneumatic Mfg. Co., Ltd.) to reduce the
    pulverizing air pressure, a hybridization system (product of Nara
    Machinery Co., Ltd.), a kryptron system (product of Kawasaki
    Heavy Industries, Ltd.) and an automatic mortar.
    (Developer)
1          A developer of the present invention contains at least the
    toner, and may further contain appropriately selected other
    components, such as carrier, if necessary.
           Accordingly, the developer has excellent transfer
    properties, and charging ability, and can stably form high quality
15  images.    Note that, the developer may be a one-component
    developer, or a two-component developer, but it is preferably a
    two-component developer when it is used in a high speed printer
    corresponding to recent high information processing speed,
    because the service life thereof can be improved.
20         In the case where the developer is used as a one-component
    developer, the diameters of the toner particles do not vary largely
    even when the toner is supplied and consumed repeatedly, the
    toner does not cause filming to a developing roller, nor fuse to a
    layer thickness regulating member such as a blade for thinning a
25  thickness of a layer of the toner, and provides excellent and
                                     53

   stable developing ability and image even when it is stirred in the
   developing device over a long period of time.
           In the case where the developer is used as a
   two-component developer, the diameters of the toner particles in
 5 the developer do not vary largely even when the toner is supplied
   and consumed repeatedly, and the toner can provide excellent
   and stabile developing ability even when the toner is stirred in
   the developing device over a long period of time.
   <Carrier>
10        The carrier is appropriately selected depending on the
   intended purpose without any limitation, but it is preferably a
   carrier containing a core, and a resin layer covering the core.
   -Core
          A material of the core is appropriately selected depending
15 on the intended purpose without any limitation, and examples
   thereof include a 50 emu/g to 90 emu/g manganese-strontium
   (Mn-Sr) material, and a 50 emu/g to 90 emu/g
   manganese-magnesium (Mn-Mg) material.         To secure a
   sufficient image density, use of a hard magnetic material such as
20 iron powder (100 emu/g or higher), and magnetite (75 emu/g to
   120 emu/g) is preferable.   Moreover, use of a soft magnetic
   material such as a 30 emu/g to 80 emu/g copper-zinc material is
   preferable because an impact applied to a photoconductor by the
   developer born on a bearing member in the form of a brush can be
25 reduced, which is an advantageous for improving image quality.
                                    54

          These may be used alone or in combination of two or more
   thereof.
          The volume average particle diameter of the core is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
 5 on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 10 pim to 150 ptm,
   more preferably 40 pim to 100 pm.     When the volume average
   particle diameter thereof is smaller than 10 pim, the proportion of
   fine particles in the distribution of carrier particle diameters
   increases, causing carrier scattering because of low
10 magnetization per carrier particle.    When the volume average
   particle diameter thereof is greater than 150 Pim, the specific
   surface area reduces, which may cause toner scattering, causing
   reproducibility especially in a solid image portion in a full color
   printing containing many solid image portions.
15         In the case where the toner is used for a two-component
   developer, the toner is used by mixing with the carrier.    An
   amount of the carrier in the two-component developer is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 90 parts by mass to
20 98 parts by mass, more preferably 93 parts by mass to 97 parts by
   mass, relative to 100 parts by mass of the two-component
   developer.
          The developer of the present invention may be suitably
   used in image formation by various known electrophotographies
25 such as a magnetic one-component developing method, a
                                     55

   non-magnetic one-component developing method, and a
   two-component developing method.
   (Developer accommodating container)
          A developer accommodating container of the present
 5 invention accommodates the developer of the present invention.
   The container thereof is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected from known containers.        Examples
   thereof include those having a cap and a container main body.
          The size, shape, structure and material of the container
10 main body are not particularly limited.      The container main
   body preferably has, for example, a hollow-cylindrical shape.
   Particularly preferably, it is a hollow-cylindrical body whose
   inner surface has spirally-arranged concavo-convex portions
   some or all of which can accordion and in which the developer
15 accommodated can be transferred to an outlet port through
   rotation.  The material for the developer-accommodating
   container is not particularly limited and is preferably those from
   which the container main body can be formed with high
   dimensional accuracy.     Examples thereof include polyester
20 resins, polyethylene resins, polypropylene resins, polystyrene
   resins, polyvinyl chloride resins, polyacrylic acids, polycarbonate
   resins, ABS resins and polyacetal resins.
          The above developer accommodating container has
   excellent handleability; i.e., is suitable for storage,
25 transportation, and is suitably used for supply of the developer
                                      56

   with being detachably mounted to, for example, the
   below-described process cartridge and image forming apparatus.
   (Image forming apparatus and image forming method)
          An image forming apparatus of the present invention
 5 includes at least an electrostatic latent image bearing member,
   an electrostatic latent image forming unit, and a developing unit,
   and if necessary, further includes other units.
          An image forming method of the present invention
   includes at least an electrostatic latent image forming step and a
10 developing step, and if necessary, further includes other steps.
          The image forming method can suitably be performed by
   the image forming apparatus, the electrostatic latent image
   forming step can suitably be performed by the electrostatic latent
   image forming unit, the developing step can suitably be
15 performed by the developing unit, and the other steps can
   suitably be performed by the other units.
   <Electrostatic latent image bearing member>
          The material, structure, and size of the electrostatic latent
   image bearing member are not particularly limited and may be
20 appropriately selected from those known in the art.     Regarding
   the material, the electrostatic latent image bearing member is,
   for example, an inorganic photoconductor made of amorphous
   silicon or selenium, or an organic photoconductor made of
   polysilane or phthalopolymethine.      Among them, an amorphous
25 silicon photoconductor is preferred since it has a long service life.
                                     57

          The amorphous silicon photoconductor may be, for example,
   a photoconductor having a support and an electrically
   photoconductive layer of a-Si, which is formed on the support
   heated to 50'C to 400 0 C with a film forming method such as
 5 vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering, ion plating, thermal CVD
   (Chemical Vapor Deposition), photo-CVD or plasma CVD.
   Among them, plasma CVD is suitably employed, in which gaseous
   raw materials are decomposed through application of direct
   current or high-frequency or microwave glow discharge to form an
10 a-Si deposition film on the support.
          The shape of the electrostatic latent image bearing
   member is not particularly limited and may be appropriately
   selected depending on the intended purpose, but it is preferably a
   hollow-cylindrical shape.   The outer diameter of the electrostatic
15 latent image bearing member having a hollow-cylindrical shape
   is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected
   depending on the intended purpose, but it is preferably 3 mm to
   100 mm, more preferably 5 mm to 50 mm, particularly preferably
   10 mm to 30 mm.
20 <Electrostatic latent image forming unit and electrostatic latent
   image forming step>
          The electrostatic latent image forming unit is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose so long as it is a unit configured to form
25 an electrostatic latent image on the electrostatic latent image
                                    58

   bearing member.     Examples thereof include a unit including at
   least a charging member configured to charge a surface of the
   electrostatic latent image bearing member and an exposing
   member configured to imagewise expose the surface of the
 5 electrostatic latent image bearing member to light.
          The electrostatic latent image forming step is not
   particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose so long as it is a step of forming an
   electrostatic latent image on the electrostatic latent image
10 bearing member.     The electrostatic latent image forming step
   can be performed using the electrostatic latent image forming
   unit by, for example, charging a surface of the electrostatic latent
   image bearing member and then imagewise exposing the surface
   thereof to light.
15 -Charging member and charging
          The charging member is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.
   Examples thereof include contact-type charging devices known
   per se having, for example, an electrically conductive or
20 semiconductive roller, brush, film and rubber blade; and
   non-contact-type charging devices utilizing corona discharge such
   as corotron and scorotron.
          The charging can be performed by, for example, applying
   voltage to the surface of the electrostatic latent image bearing
25 member using the charging member.
                                    59

          The charging member may have any shape like a charging
   roller as well as a magnetic brush or a fur brush.  The shape
   thereof may be suitably selected according to the specification or
   configuration of the image forming apparatus.
 5        The charging member is not limited to the aforementioned
   contact-type charging members.      However, the contact-type
   charging members are preferably used from the viewpoint of
   producing an image forming apparatus in which the amount of
   ozone generated from the charging members is reduced.
10 -Exposing member and exposure
          The exposing member is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the purpose so long as it
   attains desired imagewise exposure on the surface of the
   electrophotographic latent image bearing member charged with
15 the charging member.     Examples thereof include various
   exposing members such as a copy optical exposing device, a rod
   lens array exposing device, a laser optical exposing device, and a
   liquid crystal shutter exposing device.
          A light source used for the exposing member is not
20 particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending
   on the intended purpose.    Examples thereof include conventional
   light-emitting devices such as a fluorescent lamp, a tungsten
   lamp, a halogen lamp, a mercury lamp, a sodium lamp, a
   light-emitting diode (LED), a laser diode (LD) and an
25 electroluminescence (EL) device.
                                    60

            Also, various filters may be used for emitting only light
    having a desired wavelength range.       Examples of the filters
    include a sharp-cut filter, a band-pass filter, an infrared cut filter,
    a dichroic filter, an interference filter and a color temperature
  5 conversion filter.
            The exposure can be performed by, for example, imagewise
    exposing the surface of the electrostatic latent image bearing
    member to light using the exposing member.
            In the present invention, light may be imagewise applied
1   from the side facing the support of the electrostatic latent image
    bearing member.
    <Developing unit and developing step>
            The developing unit is not particularly limited and may be
    appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long
15  as it is a developing unit containing a toner for developing the
    electrostatic latent image formed on the electrostatic latent
    image bearing member to thereby form a visible image.
            The developing step is not particularly limited and may be
    appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long
20  as it is a step of developing the electrostatic latent image formed
    on the electrostatic latent image bearing member with a toner, to
    thereby form a visible image.     The developing step can be
    performed by the developing unit.
            The developing unit may employ a dry or wet developing
25  process, and may be a single-color or multi-color developing unit.
                                      61

          The developing unit is preferably a developing device
   containing: a stirring device for charging the toner with friction
   generated during stirring; a magnetic field-generating unit fixed
   inside; and a developer bearing member configured to bear a
 5 developer containing the toner on a surface thereof and to be
   rotatable.
          In the developing unit, toner particles and carrier
   particles are stirred and mixed so that the toner particles are
   charged by friction generated therebetween.      The charged toner
1o particles are retained in the chain-like form on the surface of the
   rotating magnetic roller to form magnetic brushes.     The
   magnetic roller is disposed proximately to the electrostatic latent
   image developing member and thus, some of the toner particles
   forming the magnetic brushes on the magnet roller are
15 transferred onto the surface of the electrostatic latent image
   developing member by the action of electrically attractive force.
   As a result, the electrostatic latent image is developed with the
   toner particles to form a visual toner image on the surface of the
   electrostatic latent image developing member.
20 <Other units and other steps>
          Examples of the other units include a transfer unit, a
   fixing unit, a cleaning unit, a charge-eliminating unit, a recycling
   unit, and a controlling unit.
          Examples of the other step include a transfer step, a fixing
25 step, a cleaning step, a charge-eliminating step, a recycling step,
                                     62

   and a controlling step.
   -Transfer unit and transfer step
           The transfer unit is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long
 5 as it is a unit configured to transfer the visible image onto a
   recording medium.       Preferably, the transfer unit includes: a
   primary transfer unit configured to transfer the visible images to
   an intermediate transfer member to form a composite transfer
   image; and a secondary transfer unit configured to transfer the
10 composite transfer image onto a recording medium.
           The transfer step is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long
   as it is a step of transferring the visible image onto a recording
   medium.      In this step, preferably, the visible images are
15 primarily transferred to an intermediate transfer member, and
   the thus-transferred visible images are secondarily transferred to
   the recording medium.
           For example, the transfer step can be performed using the
   transfer unit by charging the photoconductor with a transfer
20 charger to transfer the visible image.
           Here, when the image to be secondarily transferred onto
   the recording medium is a color image of several color toners, a
   configuration can be employed in which the transfer unit
   sequentially superposes the color toners on top of another on the
25 intermediate transfer member to form an image on the
                                      63

   intermediate transfer member, and the image on the
   intermediate transfer member is secondarily transferred at one
   time onto the recording medium by the intermediate transfer
   unit.
 5         The intermediate transfer member is not particularly
   limited and may be appropriately selected from known transfer
   members depending on the intended purpose.         For example, the
   intermediate transfer member is preferably a transferring belt.
           The transfer unit (including the primary- and secondary
10 transfer units) preferably includes at least a transfer device
   which transfers the visible images from the photoconductor onto
   the recording medium.      Examples of the transfer device include
   a corona transfer device employing corona discharge, a transfer
   belt, a transfer roller, a pressing transfer roller and an adhesive
15 transferring device.
           The recording medium is not particularly limited and may
   be appropriately selected depending on the purpose, so long as it
   can receive a developed, unfixed image.      Examples of the
   recording medium include plain paper and a PET base for OHP,
20 with plain paper being used typically.
   -Fixing unit and fixing step
           The fixing unit is not particularly limited and may be
   appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose as long
   as it is a unit configured to fix a transferred image which has
25 been transferred on the recording medium, but is preferably
                                      64

   known heating-pressurizing members.        Examples thereof
   include a combination of a heat roller and a press roller, and a
   combination of a heat roller, a press roller and an endless belt.
           The fixing step is not particularly restricted and may be
 5 appropriately selected according to purpose, as long as it is a step
   of fixing a visible image which has been transferred on the
   recording medium.      The fixing step may be performed every time
   when an image of each color toner is transferred onto the
   recording medium, or at one time (at the same time) on a
10 laminated image of color toners.
           The fixing step can be performed by the fixing unit.
           The heating-pressurizing member usually performs
   heating preferably at 80'C to 200'C.
           Notably, in the present invention, known photofixing
15 devices may be used instead of or in addition to the fixing unit
   depending on the intended purpose.

    drum 10 serving as the electrostatic latent image bearing member
    (hereinafter may be referred to as a "photoconductor 10"), a
    charging roller 20 serving as the charging unit, an exposing
20  device 30 serving as the exposing unit, a developing device 40
    serving as the developing unit, an intermediate transfer member
    50, a cleaning device 60 serving as the cleaning unit which
    includes a cleaning blade and a charge-eliminating lamp 70
    serving as the charge-eliminating unit.
25         The intermediate transfer member 50 is an endless belt
                                        67

   and designed so as to be movable in a direction indicated by an
   arrow by three rollers 51 which are disposed inside the belt and
   around which the belt is stretched.    A part of the three rollers 51
   also functions as a transfer bias roller which may apply a
 5 predetermined transfer bias (primary transfer bias) to the
   intermediate transfer member 50.      Also, a cleaning device 90
   including a cleaning blade is disposed near the intermediate
   transfer member 50.     Further, a transfer roller 80 serving as the
   transfer unit which can apply a transfer bias for transferring
10 (secondary transferring) a developed image (toner image) onto
   transfer paper 95 serving as a recording medium is disposed near
   the intermediate transfer member 50 facing the intermediate
   transfer member 50.     In addition, around the intermediate
   transfer member 50, a corona charging device 58 for applying a
15 charge to the toner image transferred on the intermediate
   transfer member 50 is disposed between a contact portion of the
   electrostatic latent image bearing member 10 with the
   intermediate transfer member 50 and a contact portion of the
   intermediate transfer member 50 with the transfer paper 95 in a
20 rotational direction of the intermediate transfer member 50.
          The developing device 40 includes a developing belt 41
   serving as the developer bearing member; and a black developing
   unit 45K, a yellow developing unit 45Y, a magenta developing
   unit 45M and a cyan developing unit 45C which are arranged
25 around the developing belt 41.     Here, the black developing unit
                                     68

    45K includes a developer container 42K, a developer supply roller
    43K and a developing roller 44K.      The yellow developing unit
    45Y includes a developer container 42Y, a developer supply roller
    43Y and a developing roller 44Y.      The magenta developing unit
  5 45M includes a developer container 42M, a developer supply
    roller 43M and a developing roller 44M.       The cyan developing
    unit 45C includes a developer container 42C, a developer supply

    41 is an endless belt which is rotatably stretched around a
1   plurality of belt rollers and is partially in contact with the
    electrostatic latent image bearing member 10.
            In the color image forming apparatus 100 illustrated in
    FIG. 1, the charging roller 20 uniformly charges a surface of the
    photoconductor drum 10, and then the exposing device 30
15  imagewise-exposes the photoconductor drum 10 to form an
    electrostatic latent image.    Next, the electrostatic latent image
    formed on the photoconductor drum 10 is developed with a toner
    supplied from the developing device 40 to form a toner image.
    Further, the toner image is transferred (primarily transferred)
20  onto the intermediate transfer member 50 by voltage applied
    from the roller 51 and then transferred (secondarily transferred)
    onto transfer paper 95.    As a result, a transferred image is
    formed on the transfer paper 95.      Notably, a residual toner
    remaining on the photoconductor drum 10 is removed by the
25  cleaning device 60, and the photoconductor drum 10 is once
                                      69

   charge-eliminated by the charge-eliminating lamp 70.
           FIG. 2 is a schematic structural view of another example of
   an image forming apparatus of the present invention.       An image
   forming apparatus 100B has the same configuration as the image
 5 forming apparatus 100A illustrated in FIG. 1 except that the
   developing belt 41 is not included and that, around the
   photoconductor drum 10, the black developing unit 45K, the
   yellow developing unit 45Y, the magenta developing unit 45M
   and the cyan developing unit 45C are disposed facing directly to
10 the electrostatic latent image bearing member.
           FIG. 3 is a schematic structural view of still another
   example of an image forming apparatus of the present invention.
   The color image forming apparatus illustrated in FIG. 2 includes
   a copying device main body 150, a paper feeding table 200, a
15 scanner 300 and an automatic document feeder (ADF) 400.
           An intermediate transfer member 50 which is an endless
   belt is disposed at a central part of the copying device main body
   150.   The intermediate transfer member 50 is stretched around
   support rollers 14, 15 and 16 and can rotate in a clockwise
20 direction in FIG. 3.   Near the support roller 15, a cleaning device
   for the intermediate transfer member 17 is disposed to remove a
   residual toner remaining on the intermediate transfer member 50.
   On the intermediate transfer member 50 stretched around the
   support rollers 14 and 15, a tandem type developing device 120 is
25 disposed in which four image forming units 18 of yellow, cyan,
                                     70

   magenta and black are arranged in parallel so as to face to each
   other along a conveying direction thereof.     The exposing device
   21 serving as the exposing member is disposed in proximity to the
   tandem type developing device 120.       Further, a secondary
 5 transfer device 22 is disposed on a side of the intermediate
   transfer member 50 opposite to the side on which the tandem type
   developing device 120 is disposed.     In the secondary transfer
   device 22, the secondary transfer belt 24 which is an endless belt
   is stretched around a pair of rollers 23, and the transfer paper
10 conveyed on the secondary transfer belt 24 and the intermediate
   transfer member 50 may contact with each other.        Here, a fixing
   device 25 serving as the fixing unit is disposed in proximity to the
   secondary transfer device 22.     The fixing device 25 includes a
   fixing belt 26 which is an endless belt and a press roller 27 which
15 is disposed so as to be pressed against the fixing belt.
           Here, in the tandem type image forming apparatus, a sheet
   inverting device 28 is disposed near the secondary transfer device
   22 and the fixing device 25 for inverting the transfer paper in the
   case of forming images on both sides of the transfer paper.
20         Next, a method for forming a full-color image
   (color-copying) using the tandem type developing device 120 will
   be explained.    First, a color document is set on a document table
   130 of the automatic document feeder (ADF) 400.        Alternatively,
   the automatic document feeder 400 is opened, the color document
25 is set on a contact glass 32 of the scanner 300, and the automatic
                                     71

   document feeder 400 is closed.
           When a start button (not shown) is pressed, the scanner
   300 activates after the color document is conveyed and moved to
   the contact glass 32 in the case the color document has been set
 5 on the automatic document feeder 400, or right away in the case
   the color document has been set on the contact glass 32, so that a
   first travelling body 33 and a second travelling body 34 travel.
   At this time, a light is irradiated from a light source in the first
   travelling body 33, the light reflected from a surface of the
10 document is reflected by a mirror in the second travelling body 34
   and then is received by a reading sensor 36 through an imaging
   lens 35.   Thus, the color document (color image) is read to
   thereby form black, yellow, magenta and cyan image information.
           The image information of black, yellow, magenta, and cyan
15 are transmitted to the image forming units 18 (black image
   forming unit, yellow image forming unit, magenta image forming
   unit, and cyan image forming unit) in the tandem type developing
   device 120, and toner images of black, yellow, magenta, and cyan
   are formed in the image forming units.     As illustrated in FIG. 4,
20 the image forming units 18 (black image forming unit, yellow
   image forming unit, magenta image forming unit, and cyan image
   forming unit) in the tandem type developing device 120 include:
   electrostatic latent image bearing members 10 (black
   electrostatic latent image bearing member 10K, yellow
25 electrostatic latent image bearing member 10Y, magenta
                                     72

   electrostatic latent image bearing member 10M, and cyan
   electrostatic latent image bearing member 10); a charging
   device 160 configured to uniformly charge the electrostatic latent
   image bearing members 10; an exposing device configured to
 5 imagewise-expose to a light (L illustrated in FIG. 4) the
   electrostatic latent image bearing members based on color image
   informations to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding
   to color images on the electrostatic latent image bearing
   members; a developing device 61 configured to develop the
10 electrostatic latent images with color toners (black color toner,
   yellow color toner, magenta color toner, and cyan color toner) to
   form a toner image of the color toners; a transfer charger 62
   configured to transfer the toner image onto the intermediate
   transfer member 50; a cleaning device 63; and a
15 charge-eliminating unit 64.   Each image forming unit 18 can
   form monochrome images (black image, yellow image, magenta
   image, and cyan image) based on image formations of colors.
   Thus formed black image (i.e., black image formed onto the black
   electrostatic latent image bearing member 10K), yellow image
20 (i.e., yellow image formed onto the yellow electrostatic latent
   image bearing member 10Y), magenta image (i.e., magenta image
   formed onto the magenta electrostatic latent image bearing
   member 10M), and cyan image (i.e., cyan image formed onto the
   cyan electrostatic latent image bearing member 10)      are
25 sequentially transferred (primarily transferred) onto the
                                    73

   intermediate transfer member 50 which is rotatably moved by the
   support rollers 14, 15 and 16.    The black image, the yellow image,
   the magenta image, and the cyan image are superposed on the
   intermediate transfer member 50 to thereby form a composite
 5 color image (color transfer image).
           Meanwhile, on the paper feeding table 200, one of paper
   feeding rollers 142 is selectively rotated to feed a sheet (recording
   paper) from one of the paper feeding cassettes 144 equipped in
   multiple stages in a paper bank 143.     The sheet is separated one
10 by one by a separation roller 145 and sent to a paper feeding path
   146.   The sheet (recording paper) is conveyed by a conveying
   roller 147 and is guided to a paper feeding path 148 in the
   copying device main body 150, and stops by colliding with a
   registration roller 49.   Alternatively, a paper feeding roller 142
15 is rotated to feed a sheet (recording paper) on a manual feed tray
   54.   The sheet (recording paper) is separated one by one by a
   separation roller 52 and is guided to a manual paper feeding path
   53, and stops by colliding with the registration roller 49.
   Notably, the registration roller 49 is generally used while
20 grounded, but it may also be used in a state that a bias is being
   applied for removing paper dust on the sheet.      Next, by rotating
   the registration roller 49 in accordance with the timing of the
   composite toner image (color transferred image) formed on the
   intermediate transfer member 50, the sheet (recording paper) is
25 fed to between the intermediate transfer member 50 and the
                                     74

   secondary transfer device 22.    Thereby, the composite toner
   image (color transferred image) is transferred (secondarily
   transferred) by the secondary transfer device 22 onto the sheet
   (recording paper) to thereby form a color image on the sheet
 5 (recording paper).    Notably, a residual toner remaining on the
   intermediate transfer member 50 after image transfer is removed
   by the cleaning device for the intermediate transfer member 17.
          The sheet (recording paper) on which the color image has
   been transferred is conveyed by the secondary transfer device 22,
10 and then conveyed to the fixing device 25.     In the fixing device
   25, the composite color image (color transferred image) is fixed on
   the sheet (recording paper) by the action of heat and pressure.
   Next, the sheet (recording paper) is switched by a switching claw
   55, and discharged by a discharge roller 56 and stacked in a paper
15 discharge tray 57.    Alternatively, the sheet is switched by the
   switching claw 55, and is inverted by the inverting device 28 to
   thereby be guided to a transfer position again.    After an image is
   formed similarly on the rear surface, the recording paper is
   discharged by the discharge roller 56 stacked in the paper
20 discharge tray 57.
   (Process cartridge)
          A process cartridge of the present invention is molded so
   as to be mounted to various image forming apparatuses in an
   attachable and detachable manner, including at least an
25 electrostatic latent image bearing member configured to bear an
                                     75

   electrostatic latent image thereon; and a developing unit
   configured to develop the electrostatic latent image borne on the
   electrostatic latent image bearing member with the developer of
   the present invention to form a toner image.    Note that, the
 5 process cartridge of the present invention may further include
   other units, if necessary.
          The developing unit includes at least a developer
   accommodating container that accommodates the developer of the
   present invention, and a developer bearing member configured to
10 bear and transfer the developer accommodated in the developer
   accommodating container.      Note that, the developing unit may
   further include, for example, a regulating member configured to
   regulate the thickness of the borne developer.
          FIG. 5 illustrates one example of the process cartridge of
15 the present invention.    A process cartridge 110 includes a
   photoconductor drum 10, a corona charging device 52, a
   developing device 40, a transfer roller 80, and a cleaning device
   90.

25 liquid)>
                                    86

           A reaction vessel equipped with a stirring bar and a
   thermometer was charged with 683 parts of water, 11 parts of a
   sodium salt of sulfuric acid ester of methacrylic acid-ethylene
   oxide adduct (ELEMINOL RS-30, manufactured by Sanyo
 5 Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 138 parts of styrene, 138 parts of
   methacrylic acid, and 1 part of ammonium persulfate, and the
   resulting mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at 400 rpm, to
   thereby obtain a white emulsion.      The obtained emulsion was
   heated to have the system temperature of 75'C, and was then
10 allowed to react for 5 hours.   To the resultant, 30 parts of a 1%
   ammonium persulfate aqueous solution was added, followed by
   aging for 5 hours at 75'C, to thereby obtain an aqueous dispersion
   liquid of a vinyl resin (a copolymer of styrene/methacrylic
   acid/sodium salt of sulfuric acid ester of methacrylic acid
15 ethylene oxide adduct), i.e., [particle dispersion liquid].
           The [particle dispersion liquid] was measured by means of
   LA-920 (manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd.), and as a result, the
   volume average particle diameter thereof was found to be 0.14 ptm.
   Part of the [particle dispersion liquid] was dried, and a resin
20 component thereof was isolated.
   <Preparation of aqueous phase>
           Water (990 parts), 83 parts of the [particle dispersion
   liquid], 37 parts of a 48.5% aqueous solution of sodium
   dodecyldiphenyl ether disulfonate (ELEMINOL MON-7,
25 manufactured by Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd.), and 90 parts
                                     87

   of ethyl acetate were mixed and stirred, to thereby obtain an
   opaque white liquid.    The obtained liquid was used as [aqueous
   phase].
   <Emulsification and removal of solvent>
 5         To a container charged with the [oil phase], 1,200 parts of
   the [aqueous phase] was added, and the resulting mixture was
   mixed by means of a TK Homomixer at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes,
   to thereby obtain [emulsified slurry].
           A container equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer
10 was charged with the [emulsified slurry], followed by removing
   the solvent therein at 30'C for 8 hours.    Thereafter, the
   resultant was matured at 45'C for 4 hours, to thereby obtain
    [dispersion slurry].
   <Washing and drying>
15         After subjecting 100 parts of the [dispersion slurry] to
   filtration under the reduced pressure, the resultant was
   subjected twice to a series of treatments (1) to (4) described below,
   to thereby produce [filtration cake]:
           (1): ion-exchanged water (100 parts) was added to the
20 filtration cake, followed by mixing with TK Homomixer (at 12,000
   rpm for 10 minutes) and then filtration;
           (2): 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (100 parts)
   was added to the filtration cake obtained in (1), followed by
   mixing with TK Homomixer (at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes) and
25 then filtration under reduced pressure;
                                     88

           (3): 10% by mass hydrochloric acid (100 parts) was added
   to the filtration cake obtained in (2), followed by mixing with TK
   Homomixer (at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes) and then filtration;
   and
 5         (4): ion-exchanged water (300 parts) was added to the
   filtration cake obtained in (3), followed by mixing with TK
   Homomixer (at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes) and then filtration.
           The [filtration cake] was dried with an air-circulating
   drier at 45'C for 48 hours, and then was caused to pass through a
10 sieve with a mesh size of 75 pLm, to thereby prepare [toner base
   particles 1].
           The toner base particles 1 (100 parts by mass),
   hydrophobic silica having an average particle diameter of 100 nm
   (0.6 parts by mass), titanium oxide having an average particle
15 diameter of 20 nm (1.0 part by mass), and hydrophobic silica fine
   powder having an average particle diameter of 15 nm (0.8 parts
   by mass) were mixed together in a Henschel mixer to thereby
   obtain toner 1.
   <Production of carrier>
20         To 100 parts by mass of toluene, 100 parts by mass of a
   silicone resin (organo straight silicone), 5 parts by mass of
   y-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropyltrimethoxy silane, and 10 parts by
   mass of carbon black were added, and the resultant mixture was
   dispersed by means of a homomixer for 20 minutes, to thereby
25 prepare a resin layer coating liquid.    To surfaces of spherical
                                     89

   magnetite particles having the average particle diameter of 50
   ptm (1,000 parts by mass), the resin layer coating liquid was
   applied by means of a fluidized bed coating device, to thereby
   prepare a carrier.
 5 <Production of developer>
           By means of a ball mill, 5 parts by mass of the toner and 95
   parts by mass of the carrier were mixed, to thereby produce a
   developer.    Next, each of the produced developers was evaluated
   for various properties in the following manner.
10        The following evaluations were performed.       The results
   are shown in Table 4.
   <Offset resistance>
           Each of the developers was charged into a unit of IMAGIO
   MP C4300 (product of Ricoh Company, Ltd.) and a rectangular
15 solid image of 2 cm x 15 cm was formed on PPC paper sheets
   (Type 6000 <70W> A4 long grain (product of Ricoh Company,
   Ltd.) so that the toner was deposited in an amount of 0.40 mg/cm 2 .
   In the formation of the images, the surface temperature of the
   fixing roller was changed, and whether offset, in which an image
20 remaining after development of the solid image is fixed in other
   places than the intended places, occurred was observed to
   evaluate offset resistance.   Note that, the lowest temperature at
   which no offset occurred is defined as a minimum fixing
   temperature.

   container, which was then left to stand in a thermostat bath of
   50'C for 24 hours, followed by cooling to 24'C.   The thus-treated
   toner was measured for penetration degree according to the
