   Abstract
   The invention relates to a method of modernizing a elevator installation for serving at least
 5 one floor (20, 20', 20") in at least one building, which elevator installation comprises at
   least one elevator (A, B, C) with at least one elevator car (11, 11', 11") and at least one
   elevator control (5, 5', 5"). An elevator car (11,      11', 11") is controlled by the elevator
   control (5, 5', 5"). At least one destination call terminal (4, 4') for input of at least one
   destination call and/or for recognition of at least one identification code is installed on at
10 least one input floor. At least one destination call signal is generated by the destination
   call terminal (4, 4') for an input destination call and/or for a recognised identification code.
   At least one destination call control (6) is installed. The destination call terminal (4, 4') is,
   for communication of the destination call signal, connected with the destination call control
   (6). At least one start floor signal for a journey of the elevator car (11, 11', 11") to an input
15 floor of the destination call terminal (4, 4') and at least one destination floor signal for a
   journey of the elevator car (11,       11', 11") from the input floor to a destination floor
   associated with the destination call signal and/or the identification code are generated by
   the destination call control (6). The start floor signal and the destination floor signal are
   communicated by the destination call control (6) via the interface (5.3, 5.3', 5.3") to the
20 elevator control (5, 5', 5").

                Method and Apparatus For Modernizing an Elevator Installation
   Field of the Invention
   The invention disclosure relates to a method and system technologies for modernizing an
 5 elevator installation.
   Background of the Invention
   Elevator installations for transporting persons/goods are relatively long-term capital cost
   items with service lives of 20 years and more. If after a lengthy period of time, a general
10 overhaul of an elevator installation is contemplated, then the components of the elevator
   installation are often technologically old, which requires the exchange to a greater or
   lesser extent of the elevator components. This is generally referred to as modernization.
   Using known methods of modernization of an elevator installation, the transport capacity of
15 the elevator installation during the modernization is, in the best scenario, maintained.
   However, the transport capacity is often reduced during modernization.           If in an elevator
   installation with, for example, three elevators an elevator is exchanged then this means a
   temporary reduction in the transport capacity by 33%. However, during the modernization
   the users do not want to suffer any losses in convenience and are still to be transported as
20 quickly and directly as possible.      Long waiting times and/or inconvenient transfers are
   perceived to be undesirable.
   EP1935824A1,       which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of
   modernizing an elevator installation in which existing floor terminals for call input of floor
25 calls and existing car terminals for call input of car calls are replaced by destination call
   terminals for input of destination calls. The destination call terminals communicate the
   destination calls to a call detection unit for evaluation of the destination calls. The call
   detection unit is connected with an existing group control and now communicates, in place
   of the floor calls and the car calls, destination calls to the group control. The group control
30 selects, for serving the destination call, an elevator car of the elevator installation and
   initially moves the elevator car to the input floor of the destination call and from there to the
   destination floor of the destination call.

                                                  2
   Summary of the Invention
   In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of modernizing an elevator
   installation for serving at least one floor in at least one building, where the elevator
   installation includes at least one elevator with at least one elevator car and at least one
 5 elevator control. As part of the modernization, at least one destination call terminal is
   installed for allowing the input of at least one destination call and/or for recognition of at
   least one identification code. At least one destination call signal is generated by the
   destination call terminal for an input destination call and/or for a recognised identification
   code. At least one destination call control is installed.    The destination call terminal is
10 connected with the destination call control for communication of the destination call signal.
   Based on the destination call signal, the destination call control generates at least one
   start floor signal for a journey of the elevator car to the input floor of the destination call
   terminal and at least one destination floor signal for a journey of the elevator car from the
   input floor to the destination floor associated with the destination call signal and/or the
15 identification code.      The start floor signal and the destination floor signal are
   communicated by the destination call control to the elevator control via an interface to the
   elevator control.
   According to this aspect, the destination call control is connected via an existing interface
20 of the elevator control and thus a destination call signal indicating a start floor signal and a
   destination floor signal can be communicated in a simple and quick manner to the existing
   elevator control. This existing interface of the elevator control is in the form of a serial
   interface, and in particular a serial maintenance interface.
25 According to an embodiment of the present method, a known interface of the elevator
   installation can be used. Thus, no communications lines of the elevator installation have
   to be identified and connected with inputs and outputs of a call detection unit according to
   EP1 935824A1. This saves time and work and is also less susceptible to error.
30 According to an embodiment of the present method, a communications protocol of the
   maintenance interface is used; however, the protocol is used for a different purpose,
   namely for modernization of the elevator installation.
   One signal line is used to connect the destination call control and the elevator control. The
35 start floor signal is communicated by the destination call control via the signal line to the

                                                    3
   elevator control. The destination floor signal is also communicated by the destination call
   control via the signal line to the elevator control.
    In this manner, the destination call control and the existing elevator control are connected
 5 in a simple and quick manner via a signal line. This has an unexpected effect, namely that
   a simple, quick, permanent and conclusive modernization of the elevator installation is
   achieved in a 'Plug & Play' manner using an existing elevator control with a new
   destination call control.
10 As part of the modernization, at least one destination call terminal communications line is
   installed for connection of the destination call terminal and the destination call control. The
   input destination call is communicated as at least one destination call signal via at least the
   destination call terminal communications line to the destination call control. In the case of
   an identification code input by a user, the identification code is communicated as at least
15 one destination call signal by the destination call terminal via the destination call terminal
   communications line to the destination call control and at least one stored destination call
   is associated by the destination call control with the identification code which was input.
    In this way, the destination call terminal and the destination call control are connectible in a
20 simple and quick manner via a signal line, and that an input destination call and/or an input
   identification code can be communicated via the signal line.
   According to one embodiment, the elevator installation to be modernized includes at least
   one existing floor terminal for input of a floor call at an input floor. The existing floor
25 terminal is connected with the elevator control. The existing elevator installation also
   includes at least one existing car terminal for input of a car call which indicates a
   destination floor. The existing car call terminal is also connected with the elevator control.
   An elevator car is controlled by the elevator control in accordance with a communicated
   floor call to travel to an input floor and the elevator car is further controlled by the elevator
30 control in accordance with a communicated car call to then travel to the destination floor.
   As part of the modernization, at least one destination call terminal is installed on the input
   floors served by the elevator installation. The existing floor terminals and car call terminal
   is/are made inaccessible. The result is that the existing floor terminals or the existing car
   terminal is/are no longer present for users, so that also no double input of calls and no
35 confusion of users can occur.

                                                    4
   According to one embodiment, the elevator installation to be modernized includes at least
   one existing destination terminal for input of a destination call at an input floor. The existing
   destination call terminal is connected with the elevator control. An elevator car is controlled
 5 by the elevator control in accordance with a communicated destination call to travel to an
   input floor and the elevator car is further controlled by the elevator control in accordance
   with a communicated destination call to then travel to the destination floor. As part of the
   modernization, at least one destination call terminal is installed on the floors served by the
   elevator installation. The existing destination terminal is made inaccessible. The result is
10 that the existing destination terminal is no longer present for users, so that also no double
   input of calls and no confusion of users can occur.
   According to one embodiment, instead of installing at least one destination call terminal
   for input of at least one destination call and/or for input of at least one identification code,
15 at least one existing destination call terminal on at least one input floor is used for
   generating at least one destination call signal and/or an identification code. At least one
   destination call control is installed which receives from the existing destination call terminal
   said destination call signal and/or said identification code. Said destination call control
   generates at least one start floor signal for a journey of the elevator car to an input floor of
20 the existing destination call terminal and at least one destination floor signal for a journey
   of the elevator car from said input floor to a destination floor associated with the
   destination call signal and/or the identification code. The destination call control is
   connected with at least one elevator control of the elevator installation by way of at least
   one interface such that the start floor signal and the destination floor signal are
25 communicated by the destination call control via the interface to the elevator control. The
   result is that an existing destination call terminal is reused with a newly installed
   destination call control. This method and system is cost-efficient because of the reuse of
   the existing destination call terminal and it is highly efficient because of the newly installed
   destination call control which comprises faster hardware and improved software in
30 comparison to a 10 or 20 year old group control.
   If the elevator installation is operated with at least one group control, the group control is
   separated from the elevator control.       In other words, the elevator control is logged off
   and/or functionally disconnected from the group control.            This may be achieved, for
35 example, by communicating a logging-off signal from the destination call control to the

                                                    5
   elevator control and the logging-off signal causes the elevator control to log off at the
   group control.
   As a result, the existing group control of the elevator installation is made redundant, since
 5 the destination call control directly communicates with the individual elevator controls.
   A modernized elevator installation is operated in accordance with the present method for
   modernization. At least one journey by at least one most favorable elevator car from the
   input floor to the destination floor with shortest possible waiting time and/or shortest
10 possible destination time is determined by the destination call control for at least one
   destination call signal communicated by the destination call terminal.
   The optimal and/or most favorable car allocation for a journey up to the destination floor is
   carried out by the destination call control, which is more efficient than the selection of an
15 elevator car for serving a floor call using the existing group control.
   The elevator interface is used by the destination call control in accordance with at least
   one protocol of the elevator control.        The start floor signal is communicated by the
   destination call control to the elevator control in accordance with the protocol of the
20 elevator control. The destination floor signal is also communicated to the elevator control
   by the destination call control in accordance with the protocol of the elevator control.
   As a result, the commands to the elevator control are in accordance with the known
   protocol of the interface, and are usable for the purpose of modernization of the elevator
25 installation.
   A start floor signal is communicated by the destination call control to the elevator control
   via the interface in accordance with a protocol of the elevator control as if it were a floor
   call of an existing floor terminal at the input floor or a destination call of an existing
30 destination call terminal at the input floor. The start floor signal is communicated by the
   destination call control to the elevator control via the interface in accordance with at least
   one protocol of the elevator control as a floor call and/or destination call at the input floor
   for example indicating either travel destination in an upward direction or a downward
   direction. Similarly, a destination floor signal is communicated by the destination call
35 control to the elevator control in accordance with at least one protocol of the elevator

                                                    6
   control as if it were a car call in an elevator car or a destination call at the input floor
   specifying the destination floor, with the travel destination either in an upward direction or a
   downward direction. The destination floor signal is communicated by the destination call
   control to the elevator control via the interface in accordance with at least one protocol of
 5 the elevator control as a car call or destination call to the destination floor.
   The different commands of the interface protocol are selectively usable for the purpose of
   the modernization of the elevator installation. Thus, a command "car call" can be used not
   only as a start floor signal, but also as a destination floor signal.
10
   The current availability of an elevator may be communicated by the elevator control via the
   interface to the destination call control. Also, the current loading of the elevator may be
   communicated by the elevator control to the destination call control via the interface.
   Further, the current position of the elevator car in the elevator shaft may also be
15 communicated by the elevator control to the destination call control via the interface.
   In this way, the destination call control obtains from the elevator controls multiple items of
   information using the protocol of the interface.
20 The current availability which is communicated by the elevator control may be used by the
   destination call control for determination of a journey from the input floor to the destination
   floor by the most favorable elevator car, with one or both of the shortest possible waiting
   time and/or the shortest possible destination time. The current loading information which
   may be communicated by the elevator control is used by the destination call control for
25 determination of a journey from the input floor to the destination floor by the most favorable
   elevator car, with one or both of the shortest possible waiting time and/or the shortest
   possible destination time. The current elevator car position in the elevator shaft which is
   communicated by the elevator control may be used by the destination call control for
   determination of a journey from the input floor to the destination floor by the most favorable
30 elevator car, with either one or both of the shortest possible waiting time and/or the
   shortest possible destination time.
   The destination call control obtains from the elevator one or more items of information,
   such as the availability of an elevator, the current loading of an elevator and the current
35 position of the elevator car using the protocol of the elevator control interface and can use

                                                     7
   these items of information for determination of a most favorable car allocation.
   The current position of the elevator car in the elevator shaft may be communicated by the
   elevator control to the destination call control via the interface. The most favorable journey
 5 by an elevator car from the input floor to the destination floor with shortest possible waiting
   time and/or the shortest possible destination time is determined by the destination call
   control for at least one destination call signal communicated by the destination call
   terminal.   A start floor signal at the input floor is communicated by the destination call
   control via the interface to the elevator control of the most favorable elevator car. The
10 destination call control monitors whether the current position of the most favorable elevator
   car in the elevator shaft corresponds with the input floor. As soon as the current position
   of the most favorable car in the elevator shaft corresponds with the input floor, a
   destination floor signal is communicated by the destination call control to the elevator
   control of the most favourable car via the interface control.
15
   The destination call control monitors the current position of the most favorable elevator car
   in the elevator shaft and the destination floor signal is communicated to the elevator
   control of the most favorable elevator car only when the most favorable elevator car has
   arrived at the input floor.
20
   A destination call acknowledgement signal is communicated by the destination call control
   to that destination call terminal which has communicated the destination call signal to the
   destination call control. The destination call acknowledgement signal is communicated by
   the destination call control via the destination call terminal communications line to that
25 destination call terminal which has communicated the destination call signal to the
   destination call control. The destination call acknowledgement signal may be optically
   and/or acoustically output on an input/output device of the destination call terminal. The
   destination call acknowledgement signal may also indicate the most favorable elevator car.
    Further, the destination call acknowledgement signal may also indicate the determined
30 arrival time at the start floor, as well as the determined arrival time at the destination floor.
    In this way, the user receives from the destination call control and/or from the destination
   call terminal a destination call acknowledgement signal as feedback to a destination call.
35  In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a system and method for

                                                     8
   performing the modernizing of an elevator installation are provided.            A destination call
   terminal for input of either a destination call or for input of an identification code is installed
   on an input floor. The destination call terminal generates a destination call signal based
   on a destination call which is input by a user at the destination call terminal. Alternatively,
 5 the destination call terminal may be used to receive an identification code provided by the
   user. At least one destination call control is installed.       The destination call terminal is,
   connected with the destination call control in order to communicate the destination call
   signal and/or the received identification code. The destination call control generates, for a
   communicated destination call signal, a start floor signal for a journey of the elevator car
10 first to the input floor of the destination call terminal, and a destination floor signal for the
   journey of the elevator car from the input floor to the destination floor associated with the
   destination call and/or identification code. The destination call control is connected with at
   least one elevator control via at least one interface. The destination call control
   communicates the start floor signal and the destination floor signal to the elevator control
15 via the interface.
   A system having a destination call terminal and destination call control is connected with
   an existing elevator control by way of an existing elevator interface and a destination call
   signal having a start floor signal and destination floor signal is thus communicated in a
20 simple and quick manner to the existing elevator control.
   A programmed processor executing a computer program stored in computer readable
   memory may be used as part of the present invention for performing and realizing the
   method of operating a modernized elevator installation.
25
   The programmed processor and the computer program can be provided and maintained
   simply and quickly in order to perform the method of operating a modernized elevator
   installation.

   Description of Preferred Embodiments
   Figs. 1 and 2 show a schematic view of a part of exemplifying embodiments of an elevator
20 installation which is to be modernized. Further details are illustrated in Fig. 5 which shows
   a part of a floor 20, 20', 20" of the elevator installation, which is to be modernized,
   according to Figs. 1 and 2.       The elevator installation is installed in a building with, for
   example, three floors 20, 20', 20". Several elevator cars 11, 11', 11" move in at least one
   elevator shaft 10. For example, the elevator installation includes three elevators A, B, C
25 each with a respective elevator car 11,         11', 11".  Each elevator car 11, 11', 11" is
   connected with a respective counterweight 14, 14', 14" by way of at least one respective
   support structure 8, 8', 8".     Each support structure 8, 8', 8" is driven by a respective
   elevator drive 15, 15', 15". Access to the elevator cars 11, 11', 11" takes place from the
   floors 20, 20', 20" via respective floor doors 1, 1', 1" and car doors 13, 13', 13". The floor
30 doors 1, 1', 1" and car doors 13, 13', 13" of the elevator cars 11, 11', 11" are opened and
   closed in co-ordinated manner by at least one respective door drive 9, 9', 9". For example,
   a door drive 9, 9', 9" is arranged on each respective elevator car 11, 11', 11".             Each
   elevator A, B, C is controlled by a respective elevator control 5, 5', 5". The elevator control
   5, 5', 5" controls the rotational direction, the speed and the braking of the door drive 9, 9',

                                                     11
   9" and of the elevator drive 15, 15', 15". In the exemplifying embodiments of Figs. 7 to 12
   the elevator control 5, 5', 5" is for that purpose directly connected with a door drive 9, 9', 9"
   by way of at least one door drive communications line 109, 109', 109" and the elevator
   control 5, 5', 5" is directly connected with an elevator drive 15, 15', 15" by way of at least
 5 one elevator drive communications line 115, 115', 115". The door drive communications
   line 109, 109', 109" and the elevator drive communications line 115, 115', 115" are, for
   example, signal lines on which at least one electrical voltage signal and/or at least one
   electrical current signal is conducted. The door drive communications line 109, 109', 109"
   leads from at least one output 5.2, 5.2', 5.2" of the elevator control 5, 5', 5" to the door
10 drive 9, 9', 9". The elevator drive communications line 115, 115', 115" leads from at least
   one output 5.2, 5.2', 5.2" of the elevator control 5, 5', 5" to the door drive 15, 15', 15". For
   example, the elevator drives 15, 15', 15" together with the elevator controls 5, 5', 5" are
   arranged in an engine room 3 above the elevator shaft 10.
15 In accordance with Figs. 2 and 5, for input of a floor call at least one existing floor terminal
   2, 2', 2" is located at at least one floor 20, 20', 20". As shown in Fig. 5, there may be one
   existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" located on each floor 20, 20', 20" near each elevator A, B,
   C. The existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" has at least one call button for input of a floor call.
   The existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" often has two call buttons for combined input of a floor
20 call and the travel direction (upwards or downwards) desired by the user. In accordance
   with Fig. 1, for input of a destination call at least one existing destination call terminal 2*,
   2**, 2** is located at at least one floor 20, 20', 20". The existing destination call terminal 2*,
   2**, 2*** has at least one call button for input of a destination call. The exemplifying
   embodiments of an elevator installation, which is to be modernized, in accordance with
25 Figs. 1, 7 and 9 includes a group control 7. The exemplifying embodiment of an elevator
   installation, which is to be modernized, in accordance with Figs. 2 and 11 has no group
   control 7.     In the exemplifying embodiments of Figs. 7 and 9 an existing destination
   terminal 2*, 2**, 2*** is directly connected with at least one group control 7 for
   communicating a destination call by way of at least one floor terminal communications line
30 102, 102', 102". In the exemplifying embodiment of Fig. 11 an existing floor terminal 2, 2',
   2" is directly connected with at least one elevator control 5, 5', 5" for communicating an
   input floor call by way of at least one floor terminal communications line 102, 102', 102".
   The floor call is communicated as at least one call input floor signal to the group control 7
   or to the elevator control 5, 5', 5"; alternatively the destination call is communicated as at
35 least one destination call signal to the group control 7 or to the elevator control 5, 5', 5".

                                                    12
   The floor terminal communications line 102, 102', 102" is, for example, a signal line on
   which at least one electrical voltage signal or at least one electrical current signal is
   conducted. The floor terminal communications line 102, 102', 102" begins at at least one
   output 2.1, 2.1', 2.1" of the existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" or existing destination call
 5 terminal 2*, 2**, 2*** and ends at at least one input 7.1, 71', 7.1" of the group control 7 or
   alternatively at at least one input 5.1, 5.1', 5.1" of the elevator control 5, 5', 5". The floor
   call and/or the destination call indicates to the group control 7 and/or the elevator control 5,
   5', 5" the input floor from which a user would like to be moved in the building by an
   elevator A, B, C. A destination call indicates additionally the destination floor to which a
10 user would like to be moved in the building by an elevator A, B, C. A call input floor call
   signal which is transmitted to the group control 7 and/or to the elevator control 5, 5', 5" is
   confirmed by the group control 7 and/or by the elevator control 5, 5', 5" by a call input floor
   acknowledgement signal. The call input floor acknowledgement signal is transmitted from
   the input 7.1, 7.1', 7.1" of the group control 7 via the floor terminal communications line
15 102, 102', 102" to the output 2.1, 2.1', 2.1" of the existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" and output
   on at least one output device in the form of a display (e.g., lamp) and/or audibly (e.g., on a
   loudspeaker) at the existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2". Alternatively, a destination call signal
   which is transmitted to the group control 7 and/or to the elevator control 5, 5', 5" is
   confirmed by the group control 7 and/or by the elevator control 5, 5', 5" by a destination
20 call acknowledgement signal. The destination call acknowledgement signal is transmitted
   from the input 7.1, 7.1', 7.1" of the group control 7 via the floor terminal communications
   line 102, 102', 102" to the output 2.1, 2.1', 2.1" of the existing destination call terminal 2*,
   2**, 2*** and output on at least one output device in the form of a display (e.g., lamp)
   and/or audibly (e.g., on a loudspeaker) at the existing destination call terminal 2*, 2**, 2***.
25 The communication between the floor 2, 2', 2" and the group control 7 or the elevator
   control 5, 5', 5" may thus be bidirectional.
   For serving the floor call, the group control 7 selects an elevator car 11, 11', 11". The
   selected elevator car 11, 11', 11" may be that elevator car 11, 11', 11" which serves the
30 floor call and/or destination call as quickly as possible, i.e., with the shortest possible
   waiting time for the user. The waiting time is typically the time period between the call
   input and the opening of floor door 1, 1', 1" and car door 13, 13', 13" of an elevator car 11,
   11', 11" on the input floor. The group control 7 is also located in, for example, the engine
   room 3. The group control 7 is directly connected with the elevator control 5, 5', 5" via at
35 least one elevator control communications line 105, 105', 105".             In the exemplifying

                                                    13
   embodiment according to Fig. 7 the elevator control communications line 105, 105', 105" is
   at least one signal bus, in which each of the various components connected to the bus
   may be identified, e.g., each of the communications participants is uniquely identifiable by
   way of a signal bus address. The communication in the signal bus is bidirectional and may
 5 be realized by, for example, a bus system such as Local Operating Network (LON),
   Ethernet, etc. In the exemplifying embodiment according to Fig. 9 the elevator control
   communications line 105, 105', 105" is a signal line on which at least one electrical voltage
   signal and/or at least one electrical current signal is conducted.         The elevator control
   communications line 105, 105', 105" leads from at least one output 7.2, 7.2', 7.2" of the
10 group control 7 to at least one input 5.1, 5.1', 5.1" of the elevator control 5, 5', 5". The
   group control 7 selects an elevator car 11, 11', 11" in that it communicates at least one call
   input floor signal to the elevator control 5, 5', 5" of an elevator car 11, 11', 11".          In
   accordance with the communicated call input floor signal, the elevator drive 15, 15', 15" is
   so controlled by the elevator control 5, 5', 5" of the selected elevator car 11, 11', 11" so
15 that the selected elevator car 11, 11', 11" is moved to the call input floor. According to the
   communicated call input floor signal, the door drive 9, 9', 9" is so controlled by the elevator
   control 5, 5', 5" of the selected elevator car 11, 11', 11" so that the floor door 1, 1', 1" and
   the car door 13, 13', 13" are opened and the user can enter the selected elevator car 11,
   11', 11".
20
   The user then enters a car call in the elevator car 11, 11', 11" of the elevator A, B, C. In
   accordance with the exemplifying embodiment of Fig. 2 an existing car call terminal 12,
   12', 12" for input of a car call is located in each elevator car 11, 11', 11". The existing car
   call terminal 12, 12', 12" may be connected by way of at least one car call terminal
25 communications line 112, 112', 112" with the group control 7 and/or with the elevator
   control 5, 5', 5". In the exemplifying embodiment according to Fig. 11 the existing car call
   terminal communications line 112, 112', 112" is directly connected with the elevator control
   5, 5', 5". The car call terminal communications line 112, 112', 112" is, for example, a
   signal line on which at least one electrical voltage signal and/or at least one electrical
30 current signal is conducted. The car call terminal communications line 112, 112', 112"
   begins at at least one output 12.1, 12.1', 12.1" of the existing car call terminal 12, 12', 12"
   and ends at the input 7.1, 7.1', 7.1" of the group control 7 and/or at the input 5.1, 5.1', 5.1"
   of the elevator control 5, 5', 5". The car call is communicated as at least one destination
   floor signal to the group control 7 and/or to the elevator control 5, 5', 5". A destination floor
35 signal which is input at the group control 7 and/or at the elevator control 5, 5', 5" is

                                                   14
   confirmed by the group control 7 and/or the elevator control 5, 5', 5" by a destination floor
   acknowledgement signal.        The destination floor acknowledgement signal is transmitted
   from the input 7.1, 7.1', 7.1" of the group control 7 via the car call terminal communications
   line 112, 112', 112" to the output 12.1, 12.1', 12.1" of the existing car call terminal 12, 12',
 5  12" and issued at at least one output device in the form of a visual display (e.g., a lamp)
   and/or audibly (e.g., on a loudspeaker) at the existing car call terminal 12, 12', 12". The
   communication between the car call terminal 12, 12', 12" and the group control 7 and/or
   the elevator control 5, 5', 5" may thus be bidirectional. The elevator drive 15, 15', 15" is so
   controlled by the elevator control 5, 5', 5" such that the elevator car 11, 11', 11" is moved
10 to the destination floor. After the elevator car 11, 11', 11" has arrived at the destination
   floor the door drive 9, 9', 9" is so controlled by the elevator control 5, 5', 5" such that the
   floor door 1, 1', 1" and the car door 13, 13', 13" are opened and the user can leave the
   elevator car 11, 11', 11".
15 The elevator control 5, 5', 5" includes at least one interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3". The interface
   5.3, 5.3'. 5.3" is, for example, a serial interface such as Recommended Standard 232
   (RS232), Recommended Standard 422 (RS422), Universal Serial Bus (USB), etc. At least
   one input 25.1 of at least one maintenance device 25 is temporarily connectible with the
   interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" by way of at least one communication link, for example a
20 communication line or a wireless communication connection 125. The interface 5.3, 5.3',
   5.3" is thus a maintenance interface. The communication between the elevator control 5,
   5', 5" and the maintenance device 25 takes place by way of the communications line 125
   in accordance with the protocol of the maintenance device, which may be a proprietary or
   standardized protocol.     The protocol can support a synchronous communication or an
25 asynchronous communication. The maintenance device 25 can communicate with several
   elevator controls 5, 5', 5". The communication can be unidirectional, for example, by at
   least two signal lines, but it can also be bidirectional, for example, by four signal lines.
   Neither the RS232 standard nor the RS422 standard provides a mechanical specification
   of a plug for the particular standard. Accordingly, the number of pins and pin layout of a
30 plug for the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" may be different and may depend on each application.
   Thus, D-sub plugs with 37, 25, 15 or even 9 pins may be used. However, type-A and type
   B plugs in accordance with the USB standard may also be used. The output voltages and
   difference voltages amount to a few volts of electrical direct voltage. According to the
    RS422 standard the maximum data transmission rate is 10 Mbps and the maximum line
35 length is 1200 metres.

                                                      15
   The maintenance device 25 is, for example, a portable computer such as a laptop, a
   smartphone, a mobile telephone, etc. The input 25.1 of the signal line 125 for the interface
   5.3, 5.3', 5.3", at least one input/output device and at least one electric power supply are
 5 arranged in at least one housing of the maintenance device 25. The input/output device
   may be in the form of a keyboard and/or a display screen and/or a touch screen, etc. The
   maintenance device 25 includes at least one processor and at least one computer
   readable data memory. At least one computer program from the computer readable data
   memory is executed by the processor. The computer program controls the maintenance
10 operation according to the protocol of the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3".           For example, a
   maintenance engineer maintains the elevator installation at regular and/or irregular
   intervals of a few weeks or a few months. For that purpose a maintenance engineer goes
   to the engine room 3 of the elevator installation and temporarily connects the maintenance
   device 25 by way of the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3' with the elevator control 5, 5', 5". The
15 maintenance engineer can input at least one command on the input/output device and
   communicate by way of the input 25.1 of the signal line 125 to the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3"
   at the elevator control 5, 5', 5". At least one item of information communicated by the
   elevator control 5, 5', 5" via the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" and the signal line 125 to the input
   25.1 of the maintenance device 25 is issued on the input/output device to the maintenance
20 engineer.
   The protocol of the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" is typically modular and includes at least one
   operations subsystem, a elevator drive subsystem and a door drive subsystem. A set of
   commands typically exists for each subsystem. The elevator control 5, 5', 5" is controlled
25 by a sequential series of commands. The elevator control 5, 5', 5" communicates at least
   one item of information for each communicated command. Depending on the respective
   protocol construction it is also possible for the elevator control 5, 5', 5" to communicate a
   plurality of items of information continuously and/or at regular intervals in time and/or at
   irregular intervals in time without command invitation.        The following, non-exclusive list

   -        "End" ends a communication.
   For modernization of the existing elevator installation at least one destination call terminal
35 4, 4' is installed on a floor 20, 20', 20". For example, at least one destination call terminal

                                                      17
   4, 4', is installed on each floor 20, 20', 20".       According to Fig. 6 two destination floor
   terminals 4, 4' are installed on each floor 20, 20', 20" at building walls between the floor
   doors 1, 1', 1" of the elevators A, B, C.         In principle, it is also possible to install the
   destination call terminal 4, 4' in isolation in a region spaced in front of the floor doors 1, 1',
 5 1" of the elevators A, B, C. At least one output 4.1, 4.1' for at least one destination call
   terminal communications line 104, 104', at least one input/output device and at least one
   electrical power supply may be arranged in the housing of the destination call terminal 4,
   4'. The input/output device is, for example, a keyboard, for example a numeric keypad,
   and/or a display screen and/or a touch screen and/or a card reader. The destination call
10 terminal 4, 4' includes at least one processor and at least one computer readable data
   memory. A computer program from the computer readable data memory may be executed
   by the processor. The computer program controls the output 4.1, 4.1' and/or the
   input/output device. The input of a destination call on the destination call terminal 4, 4' can
   be carried out by the user through input of at least one number sequence "33", "12", etc.,

   the destination call terminal 4, 4' can alternatively be carried out by the user by touching at
   least one functional designator such as "Lobby", "Library", etc., on a touch screen. The
   input of a destination call by way of the destination call terminal 4, 4' can alternatively be
   carried out by input of an identification code by the user using a card reader, wherein at
20 least one card with the stored identification code is held by the user at the card reader, the
   card transmits the identification code to the card reader and the card reader (either alone
   or in conjunction with other system components) recognizes the identification code. The
   card is, for example, a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) card.                At least one
   destination floor can be associated with a recognized identification code by the destination
25 call terminal 4, 4' and/or by at least one elevator call control 6.
   At least one destination call control 6 is installed for modernization of the existing elevator
   installation. According to Figs. 13 and 14, the destination call control 6 includes at least
   one programmed processor 60, at least one computer readable data memory 61, 61', at
30 least one input 6.1 for at least one destination call terminal communications line 104, 104',
   at least one output 6.2 for at least one signal line 125 to the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" and
   input 604 for power, e.g., from the electrical power supply. A computer program from the
   computer readable data memory 61, 61' may be executed by the programmed processor
   60.    According to the embodiment of Figs. 3 and 4 the destination call control 6 is an
35 independent electronic unit having its own housing, which, for example, is placed in the

                                                     18
   engine room 3. The destination call control 6 can also be an electronic insert in the form
   of, for example, a circuitboard, which circuitboard is arranged in the housing of an existing
   or new destination call terminal 2*, 2**, 2***, 4, 4' and/or in a housing of an existing or new
   elevator control and/or in a housing of an existing or new             group control.    In the
 5 exemplifying embodiments according to Figs. 8, 10 and 12 the destination call terminal
   communications line 104, 104' is at least one signal bus, in which the members of the bus
   may be separately identified and communicated with, e.g., each communications
   participant may be uniquely identifiable by way of a signal bus address.                    The
   communication in the signal bus is bidirectional and is realised by, for example, a bus
10 system such as a Local Operating Network (LON), Ethernet, etc. The computer program
   controls the communication by way of the input 6.1 with the destination call terminal 4, 4'
   and by way of the output 6.2 with the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" of the elevator control 5, 5',
   5".
15 The destination call terminal 4, 4' communicates to the destination call control 6, by way of
   the destination call terminal communications line 104, 104', an input destination call and/or
   a recognised identification code of a user as at least one destination call signal. Instead of
   installing destination call terminals 4, 4', it is also possible as shown in Fig. 10 to reuse
   existing destination call terminals 2*, 2**, 2*** for connecting them directly with the
20 destination call control 6 by means of at least one destination call terminal communications
   line 104, 104', 104". The destination call control 6 associates at least one destination call
   with an input identification code. For example, at least one destination call is stored in at
   least one computer readable data memory of the destination call control 6, which stored
   destination call can be associated with a particular identification code. In the case of a
25 destination call, a designation of a desired destination floor takes place, already at the time
   of call input, so that a car call is no longer necessary. Thus, the destination call control 6
   already knows the destination floor at the time of the call input and can therefore optimize
   not only the movement of an elevator car to the call input floor, but also the movement of
   the elevator car to the destination floor. The computer program of the destination call
30 control 6 determines, for a destination call signal, at least one most favorable car and/or
   call allocation. The most favorable call allocation denotes a journey by at least one most
   favorable elevator car 11, 11', 11" from the input floor to the destination floor which may
   have the shortest possible waiting time and/or the shortest possible destination time. The
   current availability of the elevator A, B, C and/or the current loading of the elevator A, B, C
35 and/or the current position of the elevator car 11, 11', 11" in the elevator shaft 10 may be

                                                     19
   used in the determination of the most favourable call allocation. The computer program of
   the destination call control 6 communicates with the elevator control 5, 5', 5" by way of the
   signal line 125 and the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" and knows the information regarding
   elevator status, i.e., the current availability of an elevator A, B, C, and/or the load state,
 5 i.e., the current loading of an elevator A, B, C, and/or the car position, i.e., the current
   position of the elevator car 11, 11', 11" in the elevator shaft 10. If this information is not
   present it may be requested by the destination call control 6 by a corresponding command
   via the signal line 125 to the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" at the elevator installation 5, 5', 5".
10 At least one start floor signal and at least one destination floor signal are generated for
   allocation of the most favorable call allocation.        In accordance with the protocol of the
   interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" information regarding the most favorable elevator car 11, 11', 11" is
   communicated as commands via the signal line 125 to the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" of the
   elevator control 5, 5', 5".       The computer program of the destination call control 6
15 communicates, by a first command, a start signal floor to the elevator control 5, 5', 5" of
   the most favorable elevator car 11, 11', 11" and, by a second command, a destination floor
   signal to the elevator control 5, 5', 5" of the most favorable elevator car 11, 11', 11".
   According to the particular protocol, the start floor signal corresponds to a "floor call", i.e.,
   a floor call to the input floor, and/or a "floor call upwards", i.e., a floor call to the input floor
20 with travel destination in an upward direction, and/or a "floor call downwards", i.e., a floor
   call to the input floor with travel destination in a downward direction, and/or a "car call", i.e.
   a car call to the input floor. According to the particular protocol, the destination floor signal
   corresponds to a "floor call", i.e., a floor call to the destination floor, and/or a "floor call
   upwards", i.e., a floor call to the destination floor with travel destination in an upward
25 direction, and/or a "floor call downwards", i.e., a floor call to the destination floor with travel
   destination in a downward direction, and/or a "car call", i.e., a car call to the destination
   floor.
   The computer program of the destination call control 6 confirms a most favorable call
30 allocation by at least one destination call acknowledgement signal. The destination call
   acknowledgement signal is transmitted from the input 6.1 of the destination control 6 via
   the destination call terminal communications line 104, 104' to the output 4.1, 4.1' of the
   destination call terminal 4, 4' and is optically and/or acoustically output on the input/output
   device of the destination call terminal 4, 4'.        For example, at least one most favorable
35 elevator car 11, 11', 11" and/or at least one determined arrival time at the start floor and/or

                                                    20
   the at least one determined arrival time at the destination floor is issued to the user as a
   destination call acknowledgement signal.
   As soon as the destination call terminal 4, 4' and the elevator call control 6 are installed,
 5 the existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" and/or the existing car call terminal 12, 12', 12" and/or
   the existing destination call terminal 2*, 2**, 2*** of the elevator installation are made
   inaccessible to users.     For example, at least one or all existing floor terminals 2, 2', 2"
   and/or the existing car call terminal 12, 12', 12" of the elevator installation are made
   inaccessible to users.      This takes place, for example, by removing the existing floor
10 terminal 2, 2' 2" and/or the existing car call terminal 12, 12', 12" or this takes place by
   installation of a covering in front of the existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2" and/or the existing
   car call terminal 12, 12', 12" in such a manner that the existing floor terminal 2, 2', 2"
   and/or the existing car call terminal 12, 12', 12" is no longer visible to or contactable by
   users. In addition, according to Figs. 8 and 10, an existing group control 7 of the elevator
15 installation is functionally separated from the elevator control 5, 5', 5" in that the elevator
   control communications line 105, 105', 105" between the group control 7 and the elevator
   control 5, 5', 5" is functionally and/or electrically and/or mechanically separated or
   otherwise does not allow the group control 7 to operate based on elevator control signals.
   If, according to Fig. 8, the existing destination call terminals 2*, 2**, 2*** communicate
20 directly with the group control 7 the floor terminal communications line 102, 102', 102" to
   the group control 7 may be functionally and/or electrically and/or mechanically separated
   or otherwise controlled so as to not allow the group control 7 to operate based on
   destination call signals from existing destination call terminals 2*, 2**, 2***. If the elevator
   installation does not have a group control 7, according to Fig. 12 the floor terminal
25 communications line 102, 102', 102" and/or the car call terminal communications line 112,
   112', 112" can be separated from the elevator control 5, 5', 5". If the elevator installation is
   operated with at least one group control 7, at least one logging-off signal may be
   communicated as a command by the destination call control 6 in accordance with the
   protocol of the interface 5.3, 5.3', 5.3" via the signal line 125 to the elevator control 5, 5',
30 5", which logging-off signal results in the elevator control 5, 5', 5" being logged off at the
   group control 7.
   Figs. 13 and 14 show two exemplifying embodiments of a destination call control 6. In the
   form of embodiment according to Fig. 13, two plug-in cards 601, 602 are directly
