                                BACKGROUND INFORMATION
[005]   A multitude of applications require a single turn coil. However, it is sometimes
desirable to increase the voltage provided by a capacitor or other power source to a
single turn coil to increase the loop voltage of the single turn coil. The need to
increase the voltage provided is typically due to the voltage rating of the capacitor or
an associated switch being less than needed for the application. Increasing the
voltage rating of the capacitor or the switch is often a cost prohibitive solution.
[006] One current solution is to provide a greater volt per turn to a single turn coil
than the capacitor could produce or the switch could accommodate using opposite
polarity voltages. However, the opposite polarity technique is limited to increasing
the loop voltage of the single turn coil to only double the voltage the capacitor can
produce.
[007] It is desirable to provide systems and methods that facilitate increasing the
loop voltage of a coil to any desired multiple of the voltage stored in the capacitor or
other power source.
[008] Alternatively or additionally, it is desirable to at least provide the public with a
useful choice.
                                          SUMMARY
[009] The embodiments described herein are directed to use of fractional turn
windings to produce a desired multiple of a voltage stored in a capacitor, a capacitor
bank, or other power source to which the coil is connected as the loop voltage around
the turns of a coil. More particularly, the embodiments described herein are directed
to systems and methods for multiplying the loop voltage of a single turn coil or a

multi-turn coil using multiple coil sections to multiply the loop voltage by a factor
equal to the number of coil arc sections.
[010] The systems and methods for producing fractional turn windings comprise
splitting the initial feed line from the capacitor by as many times as the desired total
multiple of the voltage in the capacitor, and applying the feeds to the respective
fractional turns or arc sections of the coil. For example, to double the loop voltage,
one would split the capacitor feed line into two feeds and apply them to connections
 180 degrees apart. Where the feed line is a coaxial cable, the center conductor of
each coaxial feed returns to the shield of the coaxial feed of the adjacent turn or arc
section of the coil. Accordingly the voltage can be increased by as many times as
the coil can be practically divided.
[011] The system and methods provided herein, which are directed to an inductively
coupled system, are fully utilizable in any AC circuit system
[012] Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the example
embodiments will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon

[026] The embodiments described herein are directed to multiplying the loop voltage
of a full effective single turn coil using multiple coil sections to multiply the loop
voltage by a factor equal to the number of coil arc sections. Other embodiments
described herein are directed to multiplying the loop voltage of multi-turn coils using
                                               6
10330462_.docx

multiple coil sections to multiply the loop voltage by a factor equal to the number of
coil arc sections.
[027] Turning to Figure 1, a conventional circuit 10 having a load comprising a single
turn coil 12 is depicted. A single turn coil, such as the single turn coil depicted in
Figure 1, can be used for a multitude of applications.
[028] As depicted in Figure 1, the single turn coil 12 includes an input end 11 and
output end 13 and is coupled to a capacitor or bank of capacitors 20 through a switch
30 preferably having ratings capable of delivering the charge or voltage stored in the
capacitor 20 into the load, i.e., the single turn coil 12. A transmission line 40, such
as, e.g., a coaxial cable, strip line or the like, includes a feed component 42F coupled
to the input 11 of the coil 12 and a return component 42R coupled to the output 13 of
the coil 12.
[029] In operation, a two-position or two-state switch mechanism 32 is closed to
transmit the voltage stored in the capacitor 20 to the coil 12. As noted above, the
loop voltage of the single turn coil 12 is limited to the voltage rating of the capacitor
20 or the switch 30.
[030] The embodiments described herein are directed to the use of fractional turn
windings to produce a desired multiple of a voltage stored in a capacitor, a capacitor
bank, or other power source to which the coil is connected as the loop voltage around
single or multi-turn coils. The systems and methods for producing fractional turn
windings comprise splitting the initial feed line from the capacitor by as many times
as the desired total multiple of the voltage in the capacitor, and applying the feeds to
the respective fractional turns or arc sections of the coil. For example, to double the
                                                7
10330462_.docx

loop voltage, one would split the capacitor feed line into two feeds and apply them to
connections 180 degrees apart. Where the feed line is a coaxial cable, the center
conductor of each coaxial feed returns to the shield of the coaxial feed of the
adjacent turn or arc section of the single turn coil. Accordingly the voltage can be
increased by as many times as the turn coil can be practically divided. In principle, a
larger coil can be divided more often. As such, the maximum number of divisions is
related to the finite size of the connections and minimum breakdown lengths between
positive and negative coil terminations.
[031] It is also noted that the power transmitted to the single turn coil is
advantageously increased as a greater current is drawn from the capacitor or
capacitor bank as the circuit inductance and transmission line resistance are both
lowered.
[032] Turning to Figure 2, a preferred embodiment of a circuit 100 having a load
comprising a single turn coil 110 that includes fractional turn windings 112, 115 and
118 is shown. Although depicted as having three electrically distinct fractional turn
windings segments or arc sections 112, 115 and 118 for exemplary purposes only, a
single turn coil with fractional turn windings preferable will have two or more
electrically distinct arc sections where the single turn coil can be divided into as many
arc sections that are practical. As depicted, the arc sections are azimuthally
symmetric but could be azimuthally asymmetric, i.e., have different arc lengths.
[033] The single turn coil 110 is coupled through a switch 130 to a capacitor, a bank
of capacitors or other power source 120 (capacitor). The switch 130 preferably
comprises a single two-position or two-state switch mechanism 131. The switch 130
                                              8
10330462_.docx

used to energize the coil can have drastically lower voltage requirements, but must
have higher current carrying capability if only one switch mechanism 131 is used as
depicted in Figure 2. The move towards solid state switches provides for a greater
current capability for a given voltage.
[034] As further depicted in Figure 2, the transmission feed line 140 from the
capacitor 120 is divided into three feeds 142F, 144F and 146F coupled to the inputs
 111, 114 and 117 of the three arc sections 112, 115 and 118, respectively. The
return current of each feed 142F, 144F and 146F, whether coaxial or strip line, flows
on the return path for the feed of another arc section, preferably the next arc section,
and in the case of a coaxial feed, the current of each coaxial feed flows on the shield
for the coaxial feed of another arc section. For example, the return 144R of the feed
 144F for the second arc section 115 is coupled to the output 113 of the first arc
section 112 and, thus, the return current of the feed 142F for the first arc section 112
flows on the return 144R of the feed 144F for the second arc section 115. Likewise,
the return 146R of the feed 146F for the third arc section 118 is coupled to the output
 116 of the second arc section 115 and, thus, the return current of the feed 144F for
the second arc section 115 flows on the return 146R of the feed 146F for the third arc
section 118. Further likewise, the return 142R of the feed 142F for the first arc
section 112 is coupled to the output 119 of the third arc section 118 and, thus, the
return current of the feed 146F for the third arc section 118 flows on the return 142R
of the feed 142F for the first arc section 112.
[035] As shown in Figure 3, an alternate embodiment of a circuit 200 includes a
switch 230 that preferably comprises two (2) three-position switch mechanisms 231
                                             9
10330462_.docx

and 232 operably coupling the split feeds 142F, 144F and 146F and split returns
 142R, 144R and 146R to the feed 141 F and return 141 R of the transmission feed line
 140 coming from the capacitor 120.
[036] However, each feed can also be controlled by a separate switch as depicted in
yet another alternate embodiment of a circuit 300 shown in Figure 4, thereby
reducing the current requirements on each individual switch, while retaining the
lowered voltage requirement enabled by the disclosed design. As shown in Figure 4,
a switch 330 preferably comprises separate switches 331, 332, 333, 334, 335 and
336 coupling the split feeds 142F, 144F and 146F and split returns 142R, 144R and
 146R, respectively, to the feed 141 F and return 141 R of the transmission feed line
 140 coming from the capacitor 120.
[037] In the case of multiple switches, however, timing jitter and synchronization
between switches would need to be adequately controlled. However, those skilled in
the art will readily recognize that many satisfactory designs can be devised to meet
this constraint
[038] Advantageously, the load inductance is reduced as a percentage of the total
coil arc sections. The stray inductance of the multiple feeds also reduces with the
increased number of feeds as all such feeds are seen by the circuit as being in
parallel. Similarly, the load inductances are also seen as being in parallel. The
relation of the closed loop voltage and inductance to the number M of coil turns and
the number N of arc sections is provide in Table 1 below.

[039] Turning to Figure 5, an alternate embodiment of a circuit 400 is shown having
a load comprising a multi turn coil 410, where M = 2, and fractional turn windings
412, 415, 418, 422 and 425. Although depicted as having five electrically distinct
fractional turn windings segments or arc sections 412, 415, 418, 422 and 425 for
exemplary purposes only, a multi turn coil with fractional turn windings preferable will
have two or more electrically distinct arc sections where the multi turn coil can be
divided into as many arc sections that are practical. As depicted, the arc sections are
azimuthally symmetric but could be azimuthally asymmetric, i.e., have different arc
lengths.
[040] The multi turn coil 410 is coupled through a switch 430 to a capacitor, a bank
of capacitors or other power source 420 (capacitor). The switch 430 preferably
comprises a single two-position or two-state switch mechanism 431. The switch 430
used to energize the coil can have drastically lower voltage requirements, but must
have higher current carrying capability if only one switch mechanism 431, such as a
solid state switch as noted above with regard to Figure 2.
[041] As depicted, the transmission feed line 440 from the capacitor 420 is divided
into five feeds 442F, 443F, 444F, 446F and 448F coupled to the inputs 411, 414,
417, 421, 424 of the five arc sections 412, 415, 418, 422, and 425 respectively. The
return current of each feed 442F, 443F, 444F, 446F and 448F, whether coaxial or
strip line, flows on the return paths 442R, 443R, 444R, 446R and 448R for the feed of
another arc section, preferably the next arc section, and in the case of a coaxial feed,
the current of each coaxial feed flows on the shield for the coaxial feed of another arc
                                            11
10330462_.docx

section. For example, the return 443R of the feed 443F for the second arc section
415 is coupled to the output 413 of the first arc section 412 and, thus, the return
current of the feed 442F for the first arc section 412 flows on the return 443R of the
feed 443F for the second arc section 415. Likewise, the return 444R of the feed
444F for the third arc section 418 is coupled to the output 416 of the second arc
section 415 and, thus, the return current of the feed 443F for the second arc section
415 flows on the return 444R of the feed 444F for the third arc section 418. Further
likewise, the return 446R of the feed 446F for the fourth arc section 422 is coupled to
the output 419 of the third arc section 418 and, thus, the return current of the feed
444F for the third arc section 418 flows on the return 446R of the feed 446F for the
fourth arc section 422. Also further likewise, the return 448R of the feed 448F for the
fifth arc section 425 is coupled to the output 423 of the fourth arc section 422 and,
thus, the return current of the feed 446F for the fourth arc section 422 flows on the
return 448R of the feed 448F for the fifth arc section 422. Yet further likewise, the
return 442R of the feed 442F for the first arc section 412 is coupled to the output 426
of the fifth arc section 425 and, thus, the return current of the feed 448F for the fifth
arc section 425 flows on the return 442R of the feed 442F for the first arc section
412.
[042] As noted from Table 1, the closed loop voltage CLV is defined as
         CLV = (V - N) / M
For the coil 410 of the circuit 400 depicted in Figure 5, where N = 5 arc sections, and
M = 2 turns, CLV = 5V / 2 or 2.5 V.

[043] Another alternate embodiment of a circuit 500 is depicted in Figure 6 as
having a load comprising a multi turn coil 510 having three turns (M=3) and includes
two fractional turn windings (N=2) 512 and 515 is shown. Although depicted as
having two electrically distinct fractional turn windings segments or arc sections 512
and 515 for exemplary purposes only, a multi turn coil having 3 or more turns (M > 3)
with fractional turn windings preferable will have four or more electrically distinct arc
sections (N > 4) where the multi turn coil can be divided into as many arc sections
that are practical. As depicted, the arc sections are azimuthally symmetric but could
be azimuthally asymmetric, i.e., have different arc lengths.
[044] The multi turn coil 510 is coupled through a switch 530 to a capacitor, a bank
of capacitors or other power source 520 (capacitor). The switch 530 preferably
comprises a single two-position or two-state switch mechanism 531. As depicted, the
transmission feed line 540 from the capacitor 520 is divided into two feeds 542F and
544Fcoupled to the inputs 511 and 514 of the two arc sections 512 and 515
respectively. The return current of each feed 542F and 544F, whether coaxial or strip
line, flows on the return paths 542R and 544R for the feed of other arc section, and in
the case of a coaxial feed, the current of each coaxial feed flows on the shield for the
coaxial feed of another arc section. For example, the return 544R of the feed 544F
for the second arc section 515 is coupled to the output 513 of the first arc section 512
and, thus, the return current of the feed 542F for the first arc section 512 flows on the
return 544R of the feed 544F for the second arc section 515.       Likewise, the return
542R of the feed 542F for the first arc section 512 is coupled to the output 516 of the
second arc section 515 and, thus, the return current of the feed 544F for the second

arc section 515 flows on the return 542R of the feed 542F for the first arc section
512.
[045] Turning to Figure 7, another alternate embodiment of a circuit 600 is depicted
as having a load comprising a multi turn coil 610 having more than a single turn
where a turn beyond the single turn does not include a full turn, i.e., the number M of
coil turns is a non-integer. Like the embodiments noted above, the coil 610 includes
fractional turn windings 612 and 615.     Although depicted as having two electrically
distinct fractional turn windings segments or arc sections 612 and 615 for exemplary
purposes only, the multi turn coil can be divided into as many arc sections that are
practical. As depicted, the arc sections are azimuthally symmetric but could be
azimuthally asymmetric, i.e., have different arc lengths.
[046] The multi turn coil 610 is coupled through a switch 630 to a capacitor, a bank
of capacitors or other power source 620 (capacitor). The switch 630 preferably
comprises a single two-position or two-state switch mechanism 631. As depicted, the
transmission feed line 640 from the capacitor 620 is divided into two feeds 642F and
644F coupled to the inputs 611 and 614 of the two arc sections 612 and 615
respectively. The return current of each feed 642F and 644F, whether coaxial or strip
line, flows on the return paths 642R and 644R for the feed of other arc section, and in
the case of a coaxial feed, the current of each coaxial feed flows on the shield for the
coaxial feed of another arc section. For example, the return 644R of the feed 644F
for the second arc section 615 is coupled to the output 613 of the first arc section 612
and, thus, the return current of the feed 642F for the first arc section 612 flows on the
return 644R of the feed 644F for the second arc section 615.       Likewise, the return

642R of the feed 642F for the first arc section 612 is coupled to the output 616 of the
second arc section 615 and, thus, the return current of the feed 644F for the second
arc section 615 flows on the return 642R of the feed 642F for the first arc section
612.
[047] As noted from Table 1, the closed loop voltage CLV is defined as
        CLV = (V - N) / M
For the circuit 610 depicted in Figure 7, where N = 2 arc sections, and M = 1.5 turns,
CLV = 2V /1.5 or 1.33 V.
[048] As shown in Figure 8, the magnetic field for a coil have multiple turns where M
is a non-integer will not be uniform but rather having a gradient as depicted.
[049] Turning to Figure 9, a circuit 700 is depicted as having a load comprising a
partial turn coil 710 having less than one full turn, i.e., the number of turns M < 1.
Like the embodiments noted above, the coil 710 includes fractional turn windings 712
and 715.     Although depicted as having two electrically distinct fractional turn
windings segments or arc sections 712 and 715 for exemplary purposes only, the coil
710 can be divided into as many arc sections that are practical. As depicted, the arc
sections are azimuthally symmetric but could be azimuthally asymmetric, i.e., have
different arc lengths.
[050] The partial turn coil 710 is coupled through a switch 730 to a capacitor, a bank
of capacitors or other power source 720 (capacitor). The switch 730 preferably
comprises a single two-position or two-state switch mechanism 731. As depicted, the
transmission feed line 740 from the capacitor 720 is divided into two feeds 742F and
744F coupled to the inputs 711 and 714 of the two arc sections 712 and 715

respectively. The return current of each feed 742F and 744F, whether coaxial or strip
line, flows on the return paths 742R and 744R for the feed of other arc section, and in
the case of a coaxial feed, the current of each coaxial feed flows on the shield for the
coaxial feed of another arc section. For example, the return 744R of the feed 744F
for the second arc section 715 is coupled to the output 713 of the first arc section 712
and, thus, the return current of the feed 742F for the first arc section 712 flows on the
return 744R of the feed 744F for the second arc section 715.       Likewise, the return
742R of the feed 742F for the first arc section 712 is coupled to the output 716 of the
second arc section 715 and, thus, the return current of the feed 744F for the second
arc section 715 flows on the return 742R of the feed 742F for the first arc section
712.
[051] Similar the coil 610 of the circuit 600 depicted in Figure 7, the magnetic field of
the partial turn coil 710 is not uniform but rather having a gradient.
[052] The systems and methods discussed above advantageously allow the use of
lower voltage switches or lower voltage capacitors to produce a greater volt per turn
to a coil than the capacitor itself could otherwise produce, without the requirement to
use opposite polarity voltages, which is only capable of doubling the voltage.
However, the opposite polarity technique can also be used with the split coil
embodiments described herein, thereby further increasing the loop voltage of the coil.
[053] The magnetic field energy available from the capacitor (or capacitor bank) is
not increased. It is delivered on a shorter time scale (assuming stray inductances to
be substantially less than the load inductance).
