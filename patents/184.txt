and the treatment of cancer.
                                             BACKGROUND
[0004]       According to the World Health Organization, mortality due to cancer is expected to
increase from 7.6 million in 2008 to 12 million deaths in 2030 (1). To address this growing problem,
two emerging paradigms that are driving the evolution of newer treatment strategies are: (i) better
understanding of oncogenic drivers, leading to the development of molecularly 'targeted' therapeutics
(2-3); and, (ii) the use of nanotechnology to deliver drugs specifically to the tumor, thereby improving
therapeutic index (4-5). However the interface between these two paradigms, which can offer unique
opportunities for improving cancer chemotherapy, currently remains largely underexplored.
                                                SUMMARY
[00051       The level of a chemotherapeutic agent which is necessary in order to effectively treat a
cancer is often well above the level at which dangerous side effects are likely to occur. The inventors
have designed conjugates, and compositions comprising those conjugates, which increase the level of
chemotherapeutic agent which is delivered to the tumor while reducing the accumulation of the
chemotherapeutic in other tissues, e.g. the liver. These conjugates overcome the difficulties typically
encountered with nanoformulation of chemotherapeutic agents, which limit the entrapment efficiency
or introduce sub-optimal release kinetics.
[0006]       In one aspect, described herein is a conjugate comprising a chemotherapeutic agent
conjugated to cholesterol. In some embodiments, the conjugate is an amphiphile. In some
embodiments, the agent is conjugated to cholesterol via a linker. In some embodiments, the linker is
selected from the group consisting of: -0-, -S-, -S-S-, -NR-, -C(O)-, -C(O)O-, -C(O)NRV, -SO-,

[0041]        In one aspect, the disclosure provides a conjugate comprising a chemotherapeutic agent
covalently linked with a lipid. The term "lipid" as used herein means a substance that is soluble in
organic solvents and includes, but is not limited to, oils, fats, sterols, triglycerides, fatty acids,
phospholipids, and the like. The chemotherapeutic agent and the lipid can be covalently conjugated
with each other using a reactive functional group present in their respective structures. The term
"reactive functional group" refers to a functional group that is capable of reacting with another
functional group. Exemplary reactive functional groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxyls,
amines, thiols, thials, sulfinos, carboxylic acids, amides, and the like. The reactive functional group
on the lipid and the chemotherapeutic agent can be the same or different. In some embodiments, the
reactive group on the lipid is a hydroxyl, an amine, a thiol, or a carboxylic acid. In some
embodiments, the reactive group on the chemotherapeutic agent is a hydroxyl, an amine, a thiol, or a
carboxylic acid.
[0042]        Without limitations the lipid can be selected from the group consisting of sterol lipids,
fatty acids, fatty alcohols, glycerolipids (e.g., monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides),

phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, prenol lipids, saccharolipids, polyketides, and
any combination thereof The lipid can be a polyunsaturated fatty acid or alcohol. The term
"polyunsaturated fatty acid" or "polyunsaturated fatty alcohol" as used herein means a fatty acid or
alcohol with two or more carbon-carbon double bonds in its hydrocarbon chain. The lipid can also be
a highly unsaturated fatty acid or alcohol. The term "highly polyunsaturated fatty acid" or "highly
polyunsaturated fatty alcohol" as used herein means a fatty acid or alcohol having at least 18 carbon
atoms and at least 3 double bonds. The lipid can be an omega-3 fatty acid. The term "omega-3 fatty

[0044]       In some embodiments, the lipid is cholesterol. In some embodiments, the cholesterol can
further comprise succinate and/or succinic acid for conjugating with the chemotherapeutic agent.
[00451       As used herein the term "chemotherapeutic agent" refers to any chemical or biological
agent with therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth.
Such diseases include tumors, neoplasms and cancer as well as diseases characterized by hyperplastic
growth. These agents can function to inhibit a cellular activity upon which the cancer cell depends for
continued proliferation. In some aspect of all the embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is a cell
cycle inhibitor or a cell division inhibitor. Categories of chemotherapeutic agents that are useful in the
methods of the invention include alkylating/alkaloid agents, antimetabolites, hormones or hormone
analogs, and miscellaneous antineoplastic drugs. Most of these agents are directly or indirectly toxic
to cancer cells. In one embodiment, a chemotherapeutic agent is a radioactive molecule. One of skill
in the art can readily identify a chemotherapeutic agent of use ( e.g. see Slapak and Kufe, Principles of
Cancer Therapy, Chapter 86 in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 14th edition; Perry et al. ,
Chemotherapy, Ch. 17 in Abeloff, Clinical Oncology 2nd ed. 2000 Churchill Livingstone, Inc; Baltzer
L, Berkery R (eds): Oncology Pocket Guide to Chemotherapy, 2nd ed. St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book,
1995; Fischer D S, Knobf M F, Durivage H J (eds): The Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook, 4th ed. St.
Louis, Mosby-Year Book, 1993). In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent can be a
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic. The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that
inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to
include radioactive isotopes ( e.g. At211, 1131, 1125, Y90, Re186, Re188, Sm153, Bi212, P32 and
radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins, such as small molecule toxins or
enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or
variants thereof.
[00461       The term chemotherapeutic agent is a broad one covering many chemotherapeutic agents
having different mechanisms of action. Generally, chemotherapeutic agents are classified according to
the mechanism of action. Many of the available agents are anti-metabolites of development pathways
of various tumors, or react with the DNA of the tumor cells. There are also agents which inhibit
enzymes, such as topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II, or which are antimiotic agents.
[00471       Chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, an aromatase inhibitor; an
antiestrogen, an anti-androgen (especially in the case of prostate cancer) or a gonadorelin agonist; a
topoisomerase I inhibitor or a topoisomerase II inhibitor; a microtubule active agent, an alkylating
agent, an anti-neoplastic anti- metabolite or a platin compound; a compound targeting/decreasing a
protein or lipid kinase activity or a protein or lipid phosphatase activity, a further anti-angiogenic
compound or a compound which induces cell differentiation processes; a bradykinin 1 receptor or an

[0048]        Other chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, plant alkaloids, hormonal
agents and antagonists, biological response modifiers, preferably lymphokines or interferons,
antisense oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide derivatives; or miscellaneous agents or agents with other
or unknown mechanism of action.
[0049]        In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent can be a Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI
3-kinase or PI3K) inhibitor. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases are a family of related enzymes that are
capable of phosphorylating the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol.
They are also known as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases. PI3Ks interact with the IRS (Insulin receptor
substrate) in order to regulate glucose uptake through a series of phosphorylation events. The
phosphoinositol- 3-kinase family is composed of Class I, II and Class III , with Class I the only ones
able to convert PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.
[00501        Class I P13K are heterodimeric molecules composed of a regulatory and a catalytic
subunit; they are further divided between IA and IB subsets on sequence similarity. Class IA P13K are
composed of one of five regulatory p85a, p55a, p50a, p85p or p557 subunit attached to a p1 Oa,        P or
6 catalytic subunit. The first three regulatory subunits are all splice variants of the same gene ( Pik3rl
), the other two being expressed by other genes (Pik3r2 and Pik3r3, p85p and p557, respectively). The
most highly expressed regulatory subunit is p85a, all three catalytic subunits are expressed by
separate genes (Pik3ca, Pik3cb and Pik3cd for p1 10a, p11pO and p1106 , respectively). The first two
p110 isoforms (a and P) are expressed in all cells, but p1106 is primarily expressed in leukocytes and
it has been suggested it evolved in parallel with the adaptive immune system. The regulatory p101 and
catalytic p1107 subunits comprise the type IB P13K and are encoded by a single gene each.
[00511        Class II comprises three catalytic isoforms (C2a, C2P, and C2 7 ), but unlike Classes I and
III, no regulatory proteins. These enzymes catalyse the production of PI(3)P from PI (may also
produce PI(3,4)P2 from PI(4)P). C2a and C2P are expressed throughout the body, however expression

of C2 7 is limited to hepatocytes. The distinct feature of Class II PI3Ks is the C-terminal C2 domain.
This domain lacks critical Asp residues to coordinate binding of Ca2+, which suggests class II PI3Ks
bind lipids in a Ca2+ independent manner. Class III are similar to II in that they bias the production
of PI(3)P from PI, but are more similar to Class I in structure, as they exist as a heterodimers of a
catalytic ( Vps34 ) and a regulatory (p150) subunits. Class III seems to be primarily involved in the
trafficking of proteins and vesicles.
[0052]        As used herein, a "PI3K inhibitor" refers to an agent that inhibits the activity of PI3K, as
measured by the level of phosphorylation of the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of
phosphatidylinositol, or as measured by the activity and/or phosphorylation (where increased
phosphorylation indicates P13K activity) of molecules downstream of P13K. Examples of such
downstream molecules are known in the art and can include, but are not limited to AKT, SGK,
mTOR, GSK3P, PSD-95, S6, and 4EBP1. Methods of measuring the activity of P13K, directly or
indirectly are well known in the art, and include, by way of non-limiting example determining the
level of phosphorylation of a molecule downstream of P13K using phospho-isoform specific
antibodies, which are commercially available (e.g. anti-phospho-AKT antibody, Cat No. ab66138
Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
[00531         In some embodiments, a P13K inhibitor can be LY294002, P1103, and/or P1828. Further
non-limiting examples of P13K inhibitors can include wortmannin, demethoxyviridin, IC486068,

[00561      In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a taxane. The term "Taxane" is
generally referred to diterpene-containing compounds produced by the plants of the genus Taxus (e.g.,
yews, such as, but not limited to, Taxus baccata, Taxus brevifolia, Taxus canadensis, Taxus chinensis,
Taxus cuspidata, Taxus floridana, Taxus globosa, Taxus sumatrana, Taxus walUchiana), and synthetic
and semisynthetic forms thereof. The term denotes a compound containing the core
structure                           . The basic taxane core structure may further be substituted or may
contain unsaturations in the ring to yield a number of compounds, generically known as taxanes.

Generally, such compounds may block cell growth by stopping mitosis by interfering with
microtubules. The term "diterpene," as used herein, means chemical compounds having a carbon
skeleton derived from four isoprene units. The taxane group of compounds includes paclitaxel and
docetaxel.
[00571         Taxanes can be isolated from natural sources, and can also be prepared synthetically from
naturally occumng precursors. Paclitaxel (TAXOL@, Bnstol-Myers Squibb), for example, can be
prepared from baccatin by attachment of protecting groups to the hydroxyl groups of baccatin that are
to become the hydroxyl groups of paclitaxel, converting the precursor baccatin to paclitaxel, and then
removing the protecting groups from the hydroxyl groups to obtain paclitaxel (see, e.g., W093/10076.

thereof, and mixtures thereof.
[0058]         Taxanes can be used effectively to treat a variety of cancers. Paclitaxel, for example, has
been found to have activity against ovanan and breast cancers, as well as against malignant
melanoma, colon cancer, leukemias and lung cancer (see, e.g., Borman, Chemical & Engineenng
News, September 2, 1991 , pp. 11-18; The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Goodman Gilman
et al., eds.), Pergamon Press, New York (1990), p. 1239; Suffness, Antrtumor Alkaloids, in: "The
Alkaloids, Vol. XXV," Academic Press, Inc. (1985), Chapter 1 , pp. 6-18; Rizzo et al., J. Pharm. &
Biomed. Anal. §(2):159-164 (1990); and Biotechnology 9:933-938 (October. 1991). Paclitaxel acts
against cancer cells by binding to tubulin in the cells nuclei, thereby blocking the disassembly of
microtubules and consequently, inhibiting cell division (Schiff et al., Nature 277:665 (1979). In one
embodiment, the taxane is paclitaxel.

cholesterol. In some embodiments, the conjugate is of formula III:

[00601        In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a platinate. Any platinum
compound can be used in the methods and compositions described herein. In some embodiments, the
platinum compound is a platinum (II) or platinum (IV) compound. The platinum can be dissociably
linked to the lipid via at least one coordination bond. In some embodiments, the coordination bond is
Pt->O. In some other embodiments, the coordination bond is Pt->N.
[00611        In some embodiments, the platinum (II) compound is selected from the group consisting
of cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, paraplatin, sartraplatin, and combinations thereof. In a preferred
embodiment, the platinate is cisplatin or oxalipaltin. Cisplatin [cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II)]
(CDDP) has emerged as an important class of antitumor agents, and is widely used for the treatment
of many malignancies including testicular, ovarian, cervical, head and neck, and non-small cell lung
cancer (Jamieson, et al, Chem. Rev. (1999), 99(9): 2467-2498). It was also shown to be active in triple
negative breast cancer (Leong, et al., J. Clin. Invest. (2007), 117(5): 1370-80). Its use is however
dose-limited mainly because of nephrotoxicity or toxicity to the kidney (Madias, NE and Harrington,
JT, Am. J. (1978), 65(2): 307-14).

[0064]       The chemotherapeutic agent and the lipid (e.g., cholesterol) can be linked together by a
bond or via a linker. This linker can be cleavable or non-cleavable, depending on the application. In
certain embodiments, a cleavable linker can be used to release the chemotherapeutic agent after
transport to the desired target. The intended nature of the conjugation or coupling interaction, or the
desired biological effect, will determine the choice of linker group.
[00651       The term "linker" means an organic moiety that connects two parts of a compound.
Linkers typically comprise a direct bond or an atom such as oxygen or sulfur, a unit such as NR',

[00661        In certain embodiments, the linker is a branched linker. The branch-point of the branched
linker can be at least trivalent, but can be a tetravalent, pentavalent or hexavalent atom, or a group
presenting such multiple valencies. In certain embodiments, the branch-point can be , -N, -N(Q)-C,
O-C, -S-C, -SS-C, -C(O)N(Q)-C, -OC(O)N(Q)-C, -N(Q)C(O)-C, or -N(Q)C(O)O-C; wherein Q is
independently for each occurrence H or optionally substituted alkyl. In other embodiment, the
branch-point can be glycerol or a glycerol derivative.
[00671        In some embodiments, the linker comprises at least one cleavable linking group. A
cleavable linking group is one which is sufficiently stable outside the cell, but which upon entry into a
target cell is cleaved to release the two parts the linker is holding together. In a preferred
embodiment, the cleavable linking group is cleaved at least 10 times or more, preferably at least 100
times faster in the target cell or under a first reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic
or represent intracellular conditions) than in the blood or serum of a subject, or under a second
reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent conditions found in the blood
or serum).
[00681        Cleavable linking groups are susceptible to cleavage agents, e.g., pH, redox potential or
the presence of degradative molecules. Generally, cleavage agents are more prevalent or found at
higher levels or activities inside cells than in serum or blood. Examples of such degradative agents
include: redox agents which are selected for particular substrates or which have no substrate
specificity, including, e.g., oxidative or reductive enzymes or reductive agents such as mercaptans,
present in cells, that can degrade a redox cleavable linking group by reduction; esterases; amidases;
endosomes or agents that can create an acidic environment, e.g., those that result in a pH of five or
lower; enzymes that can hydrolyze or degrade an acid cleavable linking group by acting as a general
acid, peptidases (which can be substrate specific) and proteases, and phosphatases.
[0069]        A linker can include a cleavable linking group that is cleavable by a particular enzyme.
The type of cleavable linking group incorporated into a linker can depend on the cell to be targeted.
In some embodiments, cleavable linking group is cleaved at least 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50,
or 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions)
as compared to blood or serum (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular
conditions). In some embodiments, the cleavable linking group is cleaved by less than 90%, 80%,
70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, or 1% in the blood (or in vitro conditions selected to
mimic extracellular conditions) as compared to in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to
mimic intracellular conditions).
[00701        Exemplary cleavable linking groups include, but are not limited to, redox cleavable
linking groups (e.g., -S-S- and -C(R) 2 -S-S-, wherein R is H or CI-C 6 alkyl and at least one R is CI-C 6
alkyl such as CH 3 or CH 2 CH 3 ); phosphate-based cleavable linking groups (e.g., -O-P(O)(OR)-O-, -0

acids, -C=NN- and -OC(O)-); ester-based cleavable linking groups (e.g., -C(0)O-); peptide-based
cleavable linking groups, (e.g., linking groups that are cleaved by enzymes such as peptidases and
proteases in cells, e.g., - NHCHRAC(O)NHCHRBC(O)-, where             RA  and RB are the R groups of the two
adjacent amino acids). A peptide based cleavable linking group comprises two or more amino acids.
In some embodiments, the peptide-based cleavage linkage comprises the amino acid sequence that is
the substrate for a peptidase or a protease found in cells.
[0071]       In some embodiments, the linker comprises an acid labile group. Generally, an acid
cleavable linking group is cleaveable in an acidic environment with a pH of about 6.5 or lower (e.g.,
about 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, or lower), or by agents such as enzymes that can act as a
general acid.
[0072]       In some embodiments, the linker is C(O), C(O)CH 2CH 2C(O), or
C(O)NH(CH 2) 2NHC(O)(CH 2) 2C(O).
[0073]       Generally, the composition can comprise any amount of the conjugate. For example, the
composition can comprise from about 1% to about 99% (w/w) of the conjugate. In some
embodiments, the composition can comprise two or more different conjugates disclosed herein.
Further, the different conjugates can be present in any desired ratio. For example, the different
conjugates can be in a ratio ranging from about 100:1 to 1:100.
[0074]       In addition to the conjugate, the composition (e.g., a particle comprising the conjugate)
can further include one or more additional lipids and/or other components such as cholesterol.
Without wishing to be bound by a theory, other lipids can be included in the compositions for a
variety of purposes, such as to prevent lipid oxidation, to stabilize bilayer, to reduce aggregation
during formation or to attach ligands onto the particle surface. Any of a number of lipids can be
present, including but not limited to, amphipathic, neutral, cationic, anionic lipids, sterols, and
phospholipids. Further, such lipids can be used alone or in any combination with each other. In some
embodiments, the composition further comprises a lipoprotein particle, e.g., HDL or LDL.          The
composition can comprise from about 1% to about 99% (w/w) of the additional lipid or component.
Further the additional lipid or component can be present in 10:1 to 1:10 ratio with the conjugate. If
two or more different additional lipids are present in the composition, each lipid can be independently
in 10:1 to 1:10 ratio with the conjugate. Further, if two or more different additional lipids are present
in the composition, the two lipids can be in 10:1 to 1:10 ratio. Without limitations, two different
components (conjugate and lipid or two different lipids) of the composition can be in ratio 10:1 to
1:10, 5:1 to 1:5, or 2.5:1 to 1:2.5. In some embodiments, two different components in the
composition can be in ratio of about 1:1, about 1:1.2, about 1:1.5, about 1:1.7, about 1:2, about 1:2.5,

about 1:7.5, about 1:8, about 1:8.5, about 1:9, about 1:9.5, or about 1:10. If the composition
comprises more than two components ratio between any two components can be independent of ratio
between any other two components.
[00751        Additional components that can be present in the particle composition can include bilayer
stabilizing components such as polyamide oligomers (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,320,017), peptides,
proteins, detergents, lipid-derivatives, such as PEG conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine, PEG
conjugated to phosphatidic acid, PEG conjugated to ceramides (see, U.S. Patent No. 5,885,613), PEG
conjugated dialkylamines, PEG conjugated 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3-amines, and PEG conjugated to
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycem-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE). In some embodiments, the bilayer
stabilizing component is DSPE-PEG2000.
[0076]        The composition can also include components selected to reduce aggregation of particles
during formation, which can result from steric stabilization of particles which prevents charge
induced aggregation during formation. Suitable components that reduce aggregation include, but are
not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids (i.e., PEG conjugated lipids),
monosialoganglioside Gm1, and polyamide oligomers ("PAO") such as (described in US Pat. No.
6,320,017). Exemplary suitable PEG-modified lipids include, but are not limited to, PEG-modified
diacylglycerols and dialkylglycerols, PEG-modified phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid,
PEG-ceramide conjugates (e.g., PEG-CerC14 or PEG-CerC20), PEG-modified dialkylamines, PEG
modified 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3-amines, and PEG conjugated DSPE (e.g., DSPE-PEG2000).               Other
compounds with uncharged, hydrophilic, steric-barrier moieties, which prevent aggregation during
formation, like PEG, Gm1, or ATTA, can also be coupled to lipids to reduce aggregation during
formation. ATTA-lipids are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 6,320,017, and PEG-lipid conjugates
are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,820,873, 5,534,499 and 5,885,613. Typically, the
concentration of the lipid component selected to reduce aggregation is about 0.1 to 15% (by mole
percent of lipids). It should be noted that aggregation preventing compounds do not necessarily
require lipid conjugation to function properly. Free PEG or free ATTA in solution can be sufficient to
prevent aggregation. If the liposomes are stable after formulation, the PEG or ATTA can be dialyzed
away before administration to a subject.
[00771        Neutral lipids, when present in the composition, can be any of a number of lipid species
which exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at physiological pH. Such lipids
include, but are not limited to, diacylphosphatidylcholine, diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide,
sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin, cephalin, and cerebrosides. The selection of neutral lipids for
use in liposomes described herein is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size and
stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. Preferably, the neutral lipid component is a lipid having
two acyl groups, (i.e., diacylphosphatidylcholine and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine). Lipids
having a variety of acyl chain groups of varying chain length and degree of saturation are available or
                                                    22

can be isolated or synthesized by well-known techniques. In one group of embodiments, lipids
containing saturated or unsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C6 to C2 2
(e.g., C6 , CS, CIO, C 12 , C14 , C16 , CIS, C2 2 , or C2 2 ) are preferred. Additionally, lipids having mixtures of
saturated and unsaturated fatty acid chains can be used. In some embodiments, the neutral lipids can
be phosphatidylcholine, DOPE, DSPC, POPC, DMPC, DPPC or any related phosphatidylcholine.
The neutral lipids useful in the present invention can also be composed of sphingomyelin,
dihydrosphingomyeline, or phospholipids with other head groups, such as serine and inositol.
[0078]         When present in the composition, the sterol component can be any of those sterols
conventionally used in the field of liposome, lipid vesicle or lipid particle preparation. A preferred
sterol is cholesterol.
[00791         When present in the composition, the cationic lipids can be any of a number of lipid
species which carry a net positive charge at about physiological pH. Such lipids include, but are not
limited to, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride ("DODAC"); N-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl
N,N-N-triethylammonium chloride ("DOTMA"); N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide
("DDAB"); N-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride ("DOTAP"); 1,2
Dioleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt ("DOTAP.Cl"); 3p-(N-(N',N'
dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl)cholesterol ("DC-Chol"), N-(1 -(2,3 -dioleyloxy)propyl)-N-2
(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium trifluoracetate ("DOSPA"),
dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine ("DOGS"), 1,2-dileoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanolamine
("DOPE"), 1,2-dioleoyl-3 -dimethylammonium propane ("DODAP"), N, N-dimethyl-2,3
dioleyloxy)propylamine ("DODMA"), N-(1,2-dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-N
hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide ("DMRIE"), 5-carboxyspermylglycine diocaoleyamide ("DOGS"),
and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine 5-carboxyspermyl-amide ("DPPES"). Additionally, a
number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids can be used, such as, e.g., LIPOFECTIN
(including DOTMA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL), and LIPOFECTAMINE (comprising
DOSPA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL). Other cationic lipids suitable for lipid particle
formation are described in W098/39359, W096/37194. Other suitable cationic lipids are described,
for example in US Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0997720 and PCT Patent Application
Publication No. WO 2009/132131 and No. WO 2009/132131, content of all of which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety.
[0080]         When present in the composition, the anionic lipid can be any of a number of lipid
species which carry a net negative charge at about physiological pH. Such lipids include, but are not
limited to, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diacylphosphatidylserine, diacylphosphatidic acid, N
dodecanoyl phosphatidylethanoloamine, N-succinyl phosphatidylethanolamine, N-glutaryl
phosphatidylethanolamine, lysylphosphatidylglycerol, and other anionic modifying groups joined to
neutral lipids.
                                                                23

[00811        As used herein, the term "amphipathic lipids" refer to any suitable material, wherein the
hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients into a hydrophobic phase, while the hydrophilic
portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Such compounds include, but are not limited to,
phospholipids, aminolipids, and sphingolipids.
[0082]        In some embodiments, the composition further comprises a phospholipid. Without
limitations, the phospholipids can be of natural origin, such as egg yolk or soybean phospholipids, or
synthetic or semisynthetic origin. The phospholipids can be partially purified or fractionated to
comprise pure fractions or mixtures of phosphatidyl cholines, phosphatidyl cholines with defined acyl
groups having 6 to 22 carbon atoms, phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidyl inositols, phosphatidic
acids, phosphatidyl serines, sphingomyelin or phosphatidyl glycerols. Suitable phospholipids include,
but are not limited to, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, lecithin, P,7-dipalmitoyl-a-lecithin,
sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, N-(2,3-di(9-(Z)-octadecenyloxy))-prop-1-yl
N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysolecithin,
lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, cephalin, cardiolipin, cerebrosides,
dicetylphosphate, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, palmitoyl-oleoyl
phosphatidylcholine, di-stearoyl-phosphatidylcholine, stearoyl-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, di
palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, di-stearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, di-myrstoyl
phosphatidylserine, di-oleyl-phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline (DMPC),
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), egg
phosphatidylcholine (EPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
(DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG),
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), -phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), dioleoyl
phosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane- 1-carboxylate (DOPE-mal), and the
like. Non-phosphorus containing lipids can also be used. These include, e.g., stearylamine,
docecylamine, acetyl palmitate, fatty acid amides, and the like. Other phosphorus-lacking
compounds, such as sphingolipids, glycosphingolipid families, diacylglycerols, and        p-acyloxyacids,
can also be used
[00831        Also suitable for inclusion in the compositions described herein are programmable fusion
lipids. Particles containing programmable fusion lipids have little tendency to fuse with cell
membranes and deliver their payload until a given signal event occurs. This allows the composition
to distribute more evenly after administration into an organism or disease site before it starts fusing
with cells. The signal event can be, for example, a change in pH, temperature, ionic environment, or
time. In the latter case, a fusion delaying or "cloaking" component, such as an ATTA-lipid conjugate
or a PEG-lipid conjugate, can simply exchange out of the particle membrane over time. By the time
the particle is suitably distributed in the body, it has lost sufficient cloaking agent so as to be

fusogenic. With other signal events, it is desirable to choose a signal that is associated with the
disease site or target cell, such as lower pH at a site of tumor.
[0084]       One or more complementary surface active agent can be added to the compositions, for
example as complements to the characteristics of an amphiphilic agent or to improve particle
stabilizing capacity or enable an improved solubilization. Such complementary agents can be
pharmaceutically acceptable non-ionic surfactants which preferably are alkylene oxide derivatives of
an organic compound which contains one or more hydroxylic groups. For example ethoxylated and/or
propoxylated alcohol or ester compounds or mixtures thereof are commonly available and are well
known as such complements to those skilled in the art. Examples of such compounds are esters of
sorbitol and fatty acids, such as sorbitan monopalmitate or sorbitan monopalmitate, oily sucrose
esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitane fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters,
polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene sterol ethers,
polyoxyethylene-polypropoxy alkyl ethers, block polymers and cethyl ether, as well as
polyoxyethylene castor oil or hydrogenated castor oil derivatives and polyglycerine fatty acid esters.
Suitable non-ionic surfactants, include, but are not limited to various grades of PLURONIC@,
POLOXAMER@, SPAN@, TWEEN@, POLYSORBATE@, TYLOXAPOL®, EMULPHOR@ or
CREMOPHOR@ and the like. The complementary surface active agents can also be of an ionic
nature, such as bile duct agents, cholic acid or deoxycholic their salts and derivatives or free fatty
acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid and others. Other ionic surface active agents are found among
cationic lipids like C6 -C24 alkylamines or alkanolamine and cationic cholesterol esters.
[00851       In some embodiments, the composition comprises a PEG conjugated lipid and a
phospholipid.
[0086]       The composition can also include a targeting moiety, e.g., a targeting moiety that is
specific to a cell type or tissue. The targeting moiety is also referred to as a targeting ligand or
targeting agent herein. Targeting of particles with a surface coating of hydrophilic polymer chains,
such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, for targeting has been proposed (Allen, et al., Biochimica
et Biophysica Acta 1237: 99-108 (1995); DeFrees, et al., Journalof the American Chemistry Society

Other targeting moieties, such as ligands, cell surface receptors, glycoproteins, vitamins (e.g.,
riboflavin), aptamers and monoclonal antibodies, can also be used. The targeting moieties can include
the entire protein or fragments thereof Targeting mechanisms generally require that the targeting
agents be positioned on the surface of the liposome in such a manner that the targeting moiety is
available for interaction with the target, for example, a cell surface receptor.

[00871        In one approach, a targeting moiety, such as receptor binding ligand, can be linked to a
component (e.g., a lipid) of the composition. In some embodiments, the ligand can be conjugated
with PEG. A variety of different targeting agents and methods are known and available in the art,
including those described, e.g., in Sapra, P. and Allen, TM, Prog. Lipid Res. 42(5):439-62 (2003); and

[0090]        A targeting agent can bind to and/or penetrate a specific cell type(s) at a greater rate than
to other cell types, e.g. cancer cells as compared to healthy cells. A targeting agent can be selected

 e.g. a peptide having the sequence CRGDKGPDC (SEQ ID NO: 1).
 [0091]       A targeting agent can be present, e.g. on the surface of a nanoparticle described herein
 and/or partially embedded in the membrane or lipid layer of a nanoparticle described herein. Methods
 of incorporating a targeting agent are known in the art and non-limiting examples are described
 elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, a composition described herein can comprise a two or more
 targeting agents, e.g. a composition can comprise a combination of nanoparticles, each comprising a
 different targeting agent and/or a composition can comprise nanoparticles which each comprise
 multiple targeting agents. In some embodiments, a composition described herein can comprise one
 targeting agent, two targeting agents, three targeting agents, or more targeting agents.

 particle can be of any shape or form, e.g., spherical, rod, elliptical, cylindrical, capsule, or disc; and
 these particles can be part of a network or an aggregate. In some embodiments, the particle is a

 150 nm, from about 75 nm to about 125 nm, from about 50 nm to about 500 nm, from about 75 nm to

[00941         In some embodiments a nanoparticle can be less than about 1 um in diameter, e.g., about
1 um or less in diameter, about 500 nm or less in diameter, about 400 nm or less in diameter, about
300 nm or less in diameter, about 200 nm or less in diameter, about 100 nm or less in diameter, about
50 nm or less in diameter, or about 10 nm or less in diameter. In some embodiments a nanoparticle
can be less than 1 um in diameter, e.g., 1 um or less in diameter, 500 nm or less in diameter, 400 nm
or less in diameter, 300 nm or less in diameter, 200 nm or less in diameter, 100 nm or less in diameter,
50 nm or less in diameter, or 10 nm or less in diameter. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles in a
composition can be from about 1 nm to about 1 um in diameter, e.g. from about 1 nm to about 500 nm
in diameter, from about 1 nm to about 200 nm in diameter, from about 10 nm to about 200 nm in
diameter, from about 100 nm to about 200 nm in diameter, or from about 10 nm to about 100 nm in
diameter. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles in a composition can be from 1 nm to 1 um in
diameter, e.g. from 1 nm to 500 nm in diameter, from 1 nm to 200 nm in diameter, from 10 nm to 200
nm in diameter, from 100 nm to 200 nm in diameter, or from 10 nm to 100 nm in diameter.
[00951         In some embodiments, nanoparticles can be selected to be of specific sizes, e.g. less than
about 200 nm in diameter. Methods of selecting nanoparticles of a particular size and/or range of
sizes are known in the art and can include, by way of non-limiting example, filtration, sedimentation,
centrifugation, and/or chromatographic methods, e.g. SEC.
[0096]         It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that particles usually exhibit a
distribution of particle sizes around the indicated "size." Unless otherwise stated, the term "particle
size" as used herein refers to the mode of a size distribution of particles, i.e., the value that occurs
most frequently in the size distribution. Methods for measuring the particle size are known to a skilled
artisan, e.g., by dynamic light scattering (such as photocorrelation spectroscopy, laser diffraction,
low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS), and medium-angle laser light scattering (MALLS)), light
obscuration methods (such as Coulter analysis method), or other techniques (such as rheology, and
light or electron microscopy).
[00971         In some embodiments, the particles can be substantially spherical. What is meant by
"substantially spherical" is that the ratio of the lengths of the longest to the shortest perpendicular
axes of the particle cross section is less than or equal to about 1.5. Substantially spherical does not
require a line of symmetry. Further, the particles can have surface texturing, such as lines or
indentations or protuberances that are small in scale when compared to the overall size of the particle
and still be substantially spherical. In some embodiments, the ratio of lengths between the longest and
shortest axes of the particle is less than or equal to about 1.5, less than or equal to about 1.45, less than
or equal to about 1.4, less than or equal to about 1.35, less than or equal to about 1.30, less than or
equal to about 1.25, less than or equal to about 1.20, less than or equal to about 1.15 less than or equal
to about 1.1. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, surface contact is minimized in particles that
are substantially spherical, which minimizes the undesirable agglomeration of the particles upon
storage. Many crystals or flakes have flat surfaces that can allow large surface contact areas where
                                                      28

    WO 2013/188763                                                                    PCT/US2013/045893
agglomeration can occur by ionic or non-ionic interactions. A sphere permits contact over a much
smaller area.
[0098]       The particles can be, e.g., monodisperse or polydisperse and the variation in diameter of
the particles of a given dispersion can vary. In some embodiments, the particles have substantially
the same particle size. Particles having a broad size distribution where there are both relatively big
and small particles allow for the smaller particles to fill in the gaps between the larger particles,
thereby creating new contact surfaces. A broad size distribution can result in larger spheres by
creating many contact opportunities for binding agglomeration. The particles described herein are
within a narrow size distribution, thereby minimizing opportunities for contact agglomeration. What
is meant by a "narrow size distribution" is a particle size distribution that has a ratio of the volume
diameter of the 90th percentile of the small spherical particles to the volume diameter of the 10th
percentile less than or equal to 5. In some embodiments, the volume diameter of the 90th percentile of
the small spherical particles to the volume diameter of the 10th percentile is less than or equal to 4.5,
less than or equal to 4, less than or equal to 3.5, less than or equal to 3, less than or equal to 2.5, less
than or equal to 2, less than or equal to 1.5, less than or equal to 1.45, less than or equal to 1.40, less
than or equal to 1.35, less than or equal to 1.3, less than or equal to 1.25, less than or equal to 1.20,
less than or equal to 1.15, or less than or equal to 1.1.
[0099]       Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD) can also be used to indicate the narrow size
distribution. GSD calculations involved determining the effective cutoff diameter (ECD) at the
cumulative less than percentages of 15.9% and 84.1%. GSD is equal to the square root of the ratio of
the ECD less than 84.17% to ECD less than 15.9%. The GSD has a narrow size distribution when
GSD<2.5. In some embodiments, GSD is less than 2, less than 1.75, or less than 1.5. In one
embodiment, GSD is less than 1.8.
[00100]      In some embodiments, the composition is in the form of a liposome. As used herein, the
term "liposome" encompasses any compartment enclosed by a lipid layer. Liposomes can have one
or more lipid membranes. Liposomes can be characterized by membrane type and by size. Small
unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) have a single membrane and typically range between 0.02 and 0.05 jim
in diameter; large unilamellar vesicles (LUVS) are typically larger than 0.05 jim. Oligolamellar large
vesicles and multilamellar vesicles have multiple, usually concentric, membrane layers and are
typically larger than 0.1 jim. Liposomes with several nonconcentric membranes, i.e., several smaller
vesicles contained within a larger vesicle, are termed multivesicular vesicles.
[00101]      In order to form a liposome the lipid molecules comprise elongated non-polar
(hydrophobic) portions and polar (hydrophilic) portions. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions of
the molecule are preferably positioned at two ends of an elongated molecular structure. When such
lipids are dispersed in water they spontaneously form bilayer membranes referred to as lamellae. The
lamellae are composed of two mono layer sheets of lipid molecules with their non-polar
(hydrophobic) surfaces facing each other and their polar (hydrophilic) surfaces facing the aqueous
                                                      29

    WO 2013/188763                                                                PCT/US2013/045893
medium. The membranes formed by the lipids enclose a portion of the aqueous phase in a manner
similar to that of a cell membrane enclosing the contents of a cell. Thus, the bilayer of a liposome has
similarities to a cell membrane without the protein components present in a cell membrane.
[00102]       A liposome composition can be prepared by a variety of methods that are known in the
art. See e.g., US Patent No. 4,235,871, No. 4,897,355 and No. 5,171,678; published PCT applications

[00103]       The liposomes can be prepared to have substantially homogeneous sizes in a selected size
range. One effective sizing method involves extruding an aqueous suspension of the liposomes
through a series of polycarbonate membranes having a selected uniform pore size; the pore size of the
membrane will correspond roughly with the largest sizes of liposomes produced by extrusion through
that membrane. See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,737,323, content of which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
[00104]       The compositions described herein can also be in the form of an emulsion. Emulsions are
typically heterogenous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets (Idson, in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Volume 1, p. 245; Block in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
New York, N.Y., volume 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack
Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising two
immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions may
be of either the water-in-oil (w/o) or the oil-in-water (o/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely
divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase, the resulting composition is
called water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and
dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the resulting composition is called an oil-in
water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions can contain additional components in addition to the dispersed
phases, and the conjugate disclosed herein can be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase or
the oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers,
dyes, and anti-oxidants can also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions can
also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the
case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex
formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple
emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute
                                                     30

    WO 2013/188763                                                                  PCT/US2013/045893
a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily
continuous phase provides an o/w/o emulsion.
[00105]      Emulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed
or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and
maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of
the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment
bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be
incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers can broadly be classified into four
categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely
dispersed solids (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.),
1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).
[00106]      Synthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability
in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical
Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,
volume 1, p. 285; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.),
Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, volume 1, p. 199). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic
and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the
hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a
valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants
may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic,
anionic, cationic and amphoteric (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285).
[00107]      Naturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax,
phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can
soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous
lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers
especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic
solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite,
kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate,
pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.
[00108]      A large variety of non-emulsifying materials can also be included in emulsion
formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include, but are not limited to, fats,
oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and
antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988,
Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms,
Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).

    WO 2013/188763                                                               PCT/US2013/045893
[00109]      Hydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic
polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum,
karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and
carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and
carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize
emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing
the viscosity of the external phase.
[00110]      Since emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins,
sterols and phosphatides that may readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often
incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include
methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p
hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations
to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used can be free radical scavengers such as
tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents
such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric
acid, and lecithin.
[00111]      The applications of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes
and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (Idson, in Pharmaceutical
Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,
volume 1, p. 199). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of
ease of formulation, as well as efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint (Rosoff, in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).
[00112]      In some embodiments, a composition described herein can comprise two or more
conjugates disclosed herein. For example the composition can comprise two or more conjugates
selected from conjugate of formula I, II, III, and IV. In some embodiments, the composition can
comprise conjugate of formula I and conjugate of formula II, conjugate of formula I and conjugate of
formula III, conjugate of formula I and conjugate of formula IV, conjugate of formula II and
conjugate of formula III, conjugate of formula II and conjugate of formula IV, or conjugate of

present on the same nanoparticle, e.g. a single nanoparticle can comprise two or more types of
conjugates. In some embodiments, a composition can comprise multiple types of nanoparticles, each
of which comprises a different conjugate (or different suites of two or more conjugates). In some
embodiments, a composition can comprise two or more conjugates as described herein, e.g. two
conjugates, three conjugates, four conjugates, or more conjugates.    In some embodiments, the two or
more conjugates comprise two or more types of chemotherapeutic agents, e.g. a P13K inhibitor and a

[00113]       In some embodiments, the methods described herein relate to treating a subject having or
diagnosed as having cancer. Subjects having cancer can be identified by a physician using current
methods of diagnosing cancer. Symptoms and/or complications of cancer which characterize these
conditions and aid in diagnosis are well known in the art and include but are not limited to, growth of
a tumor, impaired function of the organ or tissue harboring cancer cells, etc. Tests that may aid in a
diagnosis of, e.g. cancer include, but are not limited to, tissue biopsies and histological examination.
A family history of cancer, or exposure to risk factors for cancer (e.g. tobacco products, radiation,
etc.) can also aid in determining if a subject is likely to have cancer or in making a diagnosis of
cancer.
[00114]       Cancer can include, but is not limited to, carcinoma, including adenocarcinoma,
lymphoma, blastoma, melanoma, sarcoma, leukemia, squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer,
non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's lymphoma,
pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, brain
cancer including glioblastomas and medulloblastomas; breast cancer, cervical cancer,
choriocarcinoma; colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, endometrial cancer;
esophageal cancer, gastric cancer; various types of head and neck cancers, intraepithelial neoplasms
including Bowen's disease and Paget's disease; hematological neoplasms including acute lymphocytic
and myelogenous leukemia; Kaposi's sarcoma, hairy cell leukemia; chromic myelogenous leukemia,
AIDS-associated leukemias and adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma; kidney cancer such as renal cell
carcinoma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, lymphomas including Hodgkin's disease
and lymphocytic lymphomas; liver cancer such as hepatic carcinoma and hepatoma, Merkel cell
carcinoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma; neuroblastomas; oral cancer including squamous cell
carcinoma; ovarian cancer including those arising from epithelial cells, sarcomas including
leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibROS 1arcoma, and osteosarcoma; pancreatic
cancer; skin cancer including melanoma, stromal cells, germ cells and mesenchymal cells; pROSitate
cancer, rectal cancer; vulval cancer, renal cancer including adenocarcinoma; testicular cancer
including germinal tumors such as seminoma, non-seminoma (teratomas, choriocarcinomas), stromal
tumors, and germ cell tumors; thyroid cancer including thyroid adenocarcinoma and medullar
carcinoma; esophageal cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, and Wilms' tumors.
[00115]       In some embodiments, the methods described herein can relate to treating a subject
determined to have a cancer with aberrant P13K signaling. Aberrant P13K signaling can be increased
or decreased signaling relative to a reference level, e.g. the level in the non-cancerous cells of the
subject, or the level in a population of healthy subjects. P13K signaling levels can be determined by
examining the level of activity of P13K directly, or indirectly (e.g. by measuring the level and/or
activity of a downstream molecule) as described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, a cancer

with aberrant P13K signaling can be a cancer with a decreased level of PTEN, increased level and/or
activity of PIK3CA, mutations and/or increased levels or activity of tyrosine receptor kinases, AKT,
or RAS, and/or increased phosphorylation of P13K pathway members (e.g. AKT, S6, 4EBP1 and
mTOR). In some embodiments, a subject having a cancer with aberrant P13K signaling can be a
subject with decreased glucose tolerance.
[00116]       The compositions and methods described herein can be administered to a subject having
or diagnosed as having cancer. In some embodiments, the methods described herein comprise
administering an effective amount of compositions described herein to a subject in order to alleviate a
symptom of a cancer. As used herein, "alleviating a symptom of a cancer" is ameliorating any
condition or symptom associated with the cancer. As compared with an equivalent untreated control,
such reduction is by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more as
measured by any standard technique. A variety of means for administering the compositions described
herein to subjects are known to those of skill in the art. Such methods can include, but are not limited
to oral, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol),
pulmonary, cutaneous, topical, injection, or intratumoral administration. Administration can be local
or systemic.
[00117]       In some embodiments, a composition described herein (e.g. a composition comprising a
P13K inhibitor) can be administered to a subject in need of a decrease in blood glucose levels. As
demonstrated in the Examples herein, the compositions comprising P13K inhibitors can induce a
decrease in blood glucose. Accordingly, described herein are methods of lowering the blood glucose
in a subject in need thereof, e.g. improving glucose tolerance. Subject in need of a decrease of blood
glucose levels can be subjects with a cancer having aberrant P13K signaling or subjects otherwise
diagnosed as having high blood glucose, e.g. subjects with diabetes or metabolic syndrome.
[00118]       The term "effective amount" as used herein refers to the amount of a composition
described herein needed to alleviate at least one or more symptom of the disease or disorder, and
relates to a sufficient amount of pharmacological composition to provide the desired effect. The term
"therapeutically effective amount" therefore refers to an amount of a composition described herein
that is sufficient to provide a particular anti-tumor effect when administered to a typical subject. An
effective amount as used herein, in various contexts, would also include an amount sufficient to delay
the development of a symptom of the disease, alter the course of a symptom disease (for example but
not limited to, slowing the progression of a symptom of the disease), or reverse a symptom of the
disease. Thus, it is not generally practicable to specify an exact "effective amount". However, for any
given case, an appropriate "effective amount" can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art
using only routine experimentation.
[00119]       Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50
(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of
                                                      34

the population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of
administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index
and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions and methods that exhibit large
therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell
culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma
concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of a composition described herein,
which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture, or in an
appropriate animal model. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance
liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay,
e.g., assay for tumor size and/or growth, among others. The dosage can be determined by a physician
and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.
[00120]       In some embodiments, the technology described herein relates to a pharmaceutical
composition as described herein, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents include saline, aqueous buffer solutions, solvents
and/or dispersion media. The use of such carriers and diluents is well known in the art. Some non
limiting examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1)
sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3)
cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethyl
cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6)
gelatin; (7) lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc; (8)
excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil,
safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol;
(11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG); (12) esters, such as
ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and
aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's
solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) pH buffered solutions; (21) polyesters, polycarbonates and/or
polyanhydrides; (22) bulking agents, such as polypeptides and amino acids (23) serum component,
such as serum albumin, HDL and LDL; (22) C2 -C 12 alcohols, such as ethanol; and (23) other non
toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. Wetting agents, coloring
agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents,
preservative and antioxidants can also be present in the formulation. The terms such as "excipient",
"carrier", "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or the like are used interchangeably herein. In some
embodiments, the carrier inhibits the degradation of the active agent, e.g. a composition as described
herein.
[00121]       In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a composition
described herein, e.g. a nanoparticle as described herein can be a parenteral dose form. Since
administration of parenteral dosage forms typically bypasses the patient's natural defenses against
                                                     35

contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to
administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to,
solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions. In addition,
controlled-release parenteral dosage forms can be prepared for administration of a patient, including,
but not limited to, DUROS*-type dosage forms and dose-dumping.
[00122]       Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of a composition as
described herein are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, without limitation:
sterile water; water for injection USP; saline solution; glucose solution; aqueous vehicles such as but
not limited to, sodium chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose Injection, dextrose and sodium
chloride injection, and lactated Ringer's injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to,
ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not
limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl
benzoate. Compounds that alter or modify the solubility of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can
also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms of the disclosure, including conventional and
controlled-release parenteral dosage forms.
[00123]      Pharmaceutical compositions a composition as described herein can also be formulated to
be suitable for oral administration, for example as discrete dosage forms, such as, but not limited to,
tablets (including without limitation scored or coated tablets), pills, caplets, capsules, chewable
tablets, powder packets, cachets, troches, wafers, aerosol sprays, or liquids, such as but not limited to,
syrups, elixirs, solutions or suspensions in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water
emulsion, or a water-in-oil emulsion. Such compositions contain a predetermined amount of the
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the disclosed compounds, and may be prepared by methods of
pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, Remington: The Science and Practice
of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Philadelphia PA. (2005).
[00124]      Conventional dosage forms generally provide rapid or immediate drug release from the
formulation. Depending on the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the drug, use of conventional
dosage forms can lead to wide fluctuations in the concentrations of the drug in a patient's blood and
other tissues. These fluctuations can impact a number of parameters, such as dose frequency, onset of
action, duration of efficacy, maintenance of therapeutic blood levels, toxicity, side effects, and the
like. Advantageously, controlled-release formulations can be used to control a drug's onset of action,
duration of action, plasma levels within the therapeutic window, and peak blood levels. In particular,
controlled- or extended-release dosage forms or formulations can be used to ensure that the maximum
effectiveness of a drug is achieved while minimizing potential adverse effects and safety concerns,
which can occur both from under-dosing a drug (i.e., going below the minimum therapeutic levels) as
well as exceeding the toxicity level for the drug. In some embodiments, a composition as described
herein can be administered in a sustained release formulation.

[00125]      Controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug
therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled release counterparts. Ideally, the use of an
optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum
of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time.
Advantages of controlled-release formulations include: 1) extended activity of the drug; 2) reduced
dosage frequency; 3) increased patient compliance; 4) usage of less total drug; 5) reduction in local or
systemic side effects; 6) minimization of drug accumulation; 7) reduction in blood level fluctuations;
8) improvement in efficacy of treatment; 9) reduction of potentiation or loss of drug activity; and 10)
improvement in speed of control of diseases or conditions. Kim, Cherng-ju, Controlled Release
Dosage Form Design, 2 (Technomic Publishing, Lancaster, Pa.: 2000).
[00126]      Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug
(active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and
continually release other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect
over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug
must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being
metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated
by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, ionic strength, osmotic pressure, temperature,
enzymes, water, and other physiological conditions or compounds.
[00127]      A variety of known controlled- or extended-release dosage forms, formulations, and
devices can be adapted for use with the salts and compositions of the disclosure. Examples include,
but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123;

and 6,365,185 Bi ; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. These dosage forms can be
used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example,
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems
(such as OROS* (Alza Corporation, Mountain View, Calif. USA)), or a combination thereof to
provide the desired release profile in varying proportions.
[00128]      In some embodiments, the method of treatment disclosed herein comprises co
administering one or more additional anti-cancer therapies to the patient in addition to administering
the conjugate or composition comprising the conjugate. Exemplary anti-cancer therapies include, but
are not limited to, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, thermotherapy, immunotherapy,
hormone therapy, laser therapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, and any combinations thereof.

administering a combination of any two of the combinations described herein, e.g. a composition
comprising nanoparticles comprising molecules having the structure of Formula I and a composition
comprising nanoparticles comprising molecules having the structure of Formula IV. In some
embodiments, a method of treating cancer as described herein can comprise administering a
combination of a composition described herein and a second agent and/or treatment. In some
embodiments, the composition described herein can be a composition comprising a taxane, e.g. a
composition of nanoparticles comprising a molecule having the structure of Formula IV and a P13K

[00133]      In certain embodiments, an effective dose of a composition as described herein can be
administered to a patient once. In certain embodiments, an effective dose of a composition as
described herein can be administered to a patient repeatedly. For systemic administration, subjects can
be administered a therapeutic amount of a composition as described herein, such as, e.g. 0.1 mg/kg,
0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 30
mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, or more.
[00134]      In some embodiments, after an initial treatment regimen, the treatments can be
administered on a less frequent basis. For example, after treatment biweekly for three months,
treatment can be repeated once per month, for six months or a year or longer. Treatment according to
the methods described herein can reduce levels of a marker or symptom of a condition, e.g. tumor size
and/or growth by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at
least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80 % or at least 90% or more.
[00135]      The dosage of a composition as described herein can be determined by a physician and
adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment. With respect to duration and
frequency of treatment, it is typical for skilled clinicians to monitor subjects in order to determine
when the treatment is providing therapeutic benefit, and to determine whether to increase or decrease
dosage, increase or decrease administration frequency, discontinue treatment, resume treatment, or
make other alterations to the treatment regimen. The dosing schedule can vary from once a week to
daily depending on a number of clinical factors, such as the subject's sensitivity a composition as
described herein. The desired dose or amount of activation can be administered at one time or divided
into subdoses, e.g., 2-4 subdoses and administered over a period of time, e.g., at appropriate intervals
through the day or other appropriate schedule. In some embodiments, administration can be chronic,
e.g., one or more doses and/or treatments daily over a period of weeks or months. Examples of
dosing and/or treatment schedules are administration daily, twice daily, three times daily or four or
more times daily over a period of 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4
months, 5 months, or 6 months, or more. A composition as described herein can be administered over
a period of time, such as over a 5 minute, 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute, or 25 minute period.
[00136]      The dosage ranges for the administration of a composition as described herein, according
to the methods described herein depend upon, for example, the form of a composition as described
herein, its potency, and the extent to which symptoms, markers, or indicators of a condition described
herein are desired to be reduced, for example the percentage reduction desired for tumor growth. The
dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects. Generally, the dosage will vary with
the age, condition, and sex of the patient and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage
can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.
[00137]      The efficacy of a composition as described herein in, e.g. the treatment of a condition
described herein, or to induce a response as described herein can be determined by the skilled
clinician. However, a treatment is considered "effective treatment," as the term is used herein, if one

or more of the signs or symptoms of a condition described herein are altered in a beneficial manner,
other clinically accepted symptoms are improved, or even ameliorated, or a desired response is
induced e.g., by at least 10% following treatment according to the methods described herein. Efficacy
can be assessed, for example, by measuring a marker, indicator, symptom, and/or the incidence of a
condition treated according to the methods described herein or any other measurable parameter
appropriate, e.g. tumor size and/or growth. Efficacy can also be measured by a failure of an
individual to worsen as assessed by hospitalization, or need for medical interventions (i.e.,
progression of the disease is halted). Methods of measuring these indicators are known to those of
skill in the art and/or are described herein. Treatment includes any treatment of a disease in an
individual or an animal (some non-limiting examples include a human or an animal) and includes: (1)
inhibiting the disease, e.g., preventing a worsening of symptoms (e.g. pain or inflammation); or (2)
relieving the severity of the disease, e.g., causing regression of symptoms. An effective amount for
the treatment of a disease means that amount which, when administered to a subject in need thereof, is
sufficient to result in effective treatment as that term is defined herein, for that disease. Efficacy of an
agent can be determined by assessing physical indicators of a condition or desired response, (e.g.
tumor size and/or growth). It is well within the ability of one skilled in the art to monitor efficacy of
administration and/or treatment by measuring any one of such parameters, or any combination of
parameters. Efficacy can be assessed in animal models of a condition described herein, for example
treatment of cancer. When using an experimental animal model, efficacy of treatment is evidenced
when a statistically significant change in a marker is observed, e.g. a decreased in tumor size and/or
growth.
[00138]       In vitro and animal model assays are provided herein which allow the assessment of a
given dose of a composition as described herein. By way of non-limiting example, the effects of a
dose of a composition can be assessed by an in vitro cell viability assay. A non-limiting example of a
protocol for such an assay is as follows: cells, e.g. cancer cell lines, are contacted with compositions
described herein and viability determined at one or more timepoints using a cell viability reagent, e.g.
CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution reagents (PROMEGA, WI).
[00139]       The efficacy of a given dosage can also be assessed in an animal model, e.g. the murine
model of ovarian cancer described in the Examples herein. Briefly, ovarian adenocarcinomas can be
induced in K-Ras     LSL/+PtenM/f mice via intrabursal delivery of adenovirus-carrying Cre recombinase.
Once mice develop medium to large tumors, they can be administered a composition as described
herein, e.g. via tail vein injection. Tumor imaging can be performed and/or mice can be sacrificed.

[00141]       For convenience, certain terms employed herein, in the specification, examples and
appended claims are collected here.
[00142]       The terms "decrease", "reduced", "reduction", or "inhibit" are all used herein to mean a
decrease by a statistically significant amount. In some embodiments, "reduce," "reduction" or
"decrease" or "inhibit" typically means a decrease by at least 10% as compared to a reference level
(e.g. the absence of a given treatment) and can include, for example, a decrease by at least about 10%,

least about 95%, at least about 98%, at least about 99% , or more. As used herein, "reduction" or
"inhibition" does not encompass a complete inhibition or reduction as compared to a reference level.
"Complete inhibition" is a 100% inhibition as compared to a reference level. A decrease can be
preferably down to a level accepted as within the range of normal for an individual without a given
disorder.
[00143]       The terms "increased", "increase", "enhance", or "activate" are all used herein to mean an
increase by a statically significant amount. In some embodiments, the terms "increased", "increase",
"enhance", or "activate" can mean an increase of at least 10% as compared to a reference level, for
example an increase of at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least
about 50%, or at least about 6 0%, or at least about 7 0%, or at least about 8 0%, or at least about 9 0%
or up to and including a 100% increase or any increase between 10-l100% as compared to a reference
level, or at least about a 2-fold, or at least about a 3-fold, or at least about a 4-fold, or at least about a
5-fold or at least about a 10-fold increase, or any increase between 2-fold and 10-fold or greater as
compared to a reference level. In the context of a marker or symptom, an "increase" is a statistically
significant increase in such level.
[00144]       As used herein, a "subject" means a human or animal. Usually the animal is a vertebrate
such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal. Primates include chimpanzees,
cynomologous monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus. Rodents include mice, rats,
woodchucks, ferrets, rabbits and hamsters. Domestic and game animals include cows, horses, pigs,
deer, bison, buffalo, feline species, e.g., domestic cat, canine species, e.g., dog, fox, wolf, avian
species, e.g., chicken, emu, ostrich, and fish, e.g., trout, catfish and salmon. In some embodiments,
the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. The terms, "individual," "patient" and
"subject" are used interchangeably herein.

[00145]      Preferably, the subject is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, non-human primate,
mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but is not limited to these examples.   Mammals other than
humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of cancer. A subject can
be male or female.
[00146]      A subject can be one who has been previously diagnosed with or identified as suffering
from or having a condition in need of treatment (e.g. cancer) or one or more complications related to
such a condition, and optionally, have already undergone treatment for cancer or the one or more
complications related to cancer. Alternatively, a subject can also be one who has not been previously
diagnosed as having cancer or one or more complications related to cancer. For example, a subject
can be one who exhibits one or more risk factors for cancer or one or more complications related to
cancer or a subject who does not exhibit risk factors.
[00147]      A "subject in need" of treatment for a particular condition can be a subject having that
condition, diagnosed as having that condition, or at risk of developing that condition.
[00148]      As used herein, the terms "protein" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably herein to
designate a series of amino acid residues, connected to each other by peptide bonds between the
alpha-amino and carboxy groups of adjacent residues. The terms "protein", and "polypeptide" refer to
a polymer of amino acids, including modified amino acids (e.g., phosphorylated, glycated,
glycosylated, etc.) and amino acid analogs, regardless of its size or function. "Protein" and
"polypeptide" are often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides, whereas the term "peptide"
is often used in reference to small polypeptides, but usage of these terms in the art overlaps. The terms
"protein" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product and
fragments thereof. Thus, exemplary polypeptides or proteins include gene products, naturally
occurring proteins, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants,
fragments, and analogs of the foregoing.
[00149]      As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid sequence" refers to any molecule,
preferably a polymeric molecule, incorporating units of ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid or an
analog thereof. The nucleic acid can be either single-stranded or double-stranded. A single-stranded
nucleic acid can be one nucleic acid strand of a denatured double- stranded DNA. Alternatively, it can
be a single-stranded nucleic acid not derived from any double-stranded DNA. In one aspect, the
nucleic acid can be DNA. In another aspect, the nucleic acid can be RNA. Suitable nucleic acid
molecules are DNA, including genomic DNA or cDNA. Other suitable nucleic acid molecules are
RNA, including mRNA.
[00150]      The term "agent" refers generally to any entity which is normally not present or not
present at the levels being administered to a cell, tissue or subject. An agent can be selected from a
group including but not limited to: polynucleotides; polypeptides; small molecules; and antibodies or
antigen-binding fragments thereof. A polynucleotide can be RNA or DNA, and can be single or
double stranded, and can be selected from a group including, for example, nucleic acids and nucleic

acid analogues that encode a polypeptide. A polypeptide can be, but is not limited to, a naturally
occurring polypeptide, a mutated polypeptide or a fragment thereof that retains the function of
interest. Further examples of agents include, but are not limited to a nucleic acid aptamer, peptide
nucleic acid (PNA), locked nucleic acid (LNA), small organic or inorganic molecules; saccharide;
oligosaccharides; polysaccharides; biological macromolecules, peptidomimetics; nucleic acid analogs
and derivatives; extracts made from biological materials such as bacteria, plants, fungi, or mammalian
cells or tissues and naturally occurring or synthetic compositions. An agent can be applied to the
media, where it contacts the cell and induces its effects. Alternatively, an agent can be intracellular as
a result of introduction of a nucleic acid sequence encoding the agent into the cell and its transcription
resulting in the production of the nucleic acid and/or protein environmental stimuli within the cell. In
some embodiments, the agent is any chemical, entity or moiety, including without limitation synthetic
and naturally-occurring non-proteinaceous entities. In certain embodiments the agent is a small
molecule having a chemical moiety selected, for example, from unsubstituted or substituted alkyl,
aromatic, or heterocyclyl moieties including macrolides, leptomycins and related natural products or
analogues thereof. Agents can be known to have a desired activity and/or property, or can be selected
from a library of diverse compounds. As used herein, the term "small molecule" can refer to
compounds that are "natural product-like," however, the term "small molecule" is not limited to
"natural product-like" compounds. Rather, a small molecule is typically characterized in that it
contains several carbon-carbon bonds, and has a molecular weight more than about 50, but less than
about 5000 Daltons (5 kD). Preferably the small molecule has a molecular weight of less than 3 kD,
still more preferably less than 2 kD, and most preferably less than 1 kD. In some cases it is preferred
that a small molecule have a molecular mass equal to or less than 700 Daltons.
[00151]       As used herein, the term "inhibitor" refers to an agent which can decrease the expression
and/or activity of the targeted expression product (e.g. mRNA encoding the target or a target
polypeptide), e.g. by at least 10% or more, e.g. by 10% or more, 50% or more, 70% or more, 80% or
more, 90% or more, 95% or more, or 98 % or more. The efficacy of an inhibitor of, for example,
P13K, e.g. its ability to decrease the level and/or activity of P13K can be determined, e.g. by
measuring the level of a P13K polypeptide (and/or mRNA encoding such a polypeptide) and/or the
activity of P13K. Methods for measuring the level of a given mRNA and/or polypeptide are known to
one of skill in the art, e.g. RTPCR with primers can be used to determine the level of RNA and
Western blotting with an antibody can be used to determine the level of a polypeptide. The activity of,
e.g. P13K can be determined using methods known in the art and described above herein. .
[00152]       As used herein, the terms "treat," "treatment," "treating," or "amelioration" refer to
therapeutic treatments, wherein the object is to reverse, alleviate, ameliorate, inhibit, slow down or
stop the progression or severity of a condition associated with a disease or disorder, e.g. cancer. The
term "treating" includes reducing or alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of a condition,
disease or disorder associated with a cancer. Treatment is generally "effective" if one or more

symptoms or clinical markers are reduced. Alternatively, treatment is "effective" if the progression of
a disease is reduced or halted. That is, "treatment" includes not just the improvement of symptoms or
markers, but also a cessation of, or at least slowing of, progress or worsening of symptoms compared
to what would be expected in the absence of treatment. Beneficial or desired clinical results include,
but are not limited to, alleviation of one or more symptom(s), diminishment of extent of disease,
stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration
or palliation of the disease state, remission (whether partial or total), and/or decreased mortality,
whether detectable or undetectable. The term "treatment" of a disease also includes providing relief
from the symptoms or side-effects of the disease (including palliative treatment).
[00153]       As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to the active agent in
combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. a carrier commonly used in the
pharmaceutical industry. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to
those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound
medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without
excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with
a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
[00154]       As used herein, the term "administering," refers to the placement of a compound as
disclosed herein into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial delivery of the
agent at a desired site. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds disclosed herein can
be administered by any appropriate route which results in an effective treatment in the subject.
[00155]       As used herein, the term "amphiphilic" refers to a molecule that has both a hydrophobic
portion and a lipophobic portion, i.e. at least one a polar, water-soluble group and at least one a
nonpolar, water- insoluble group. Typically, in a two phase system having a polar, aqueous phase and
a non-polar, non-aqueous phase, an amphiphilic molecule will partition to the interface of the two
phases. In simpler non limiting terms, an amphiphile is a molecule that is soluble in both an aqueous
environment and a non-aqueous environment. The term "amphiphile" refers to an amphiphilic
molecule.
[00156]       The term "statistically significant" or "significantly" refers to statistical significance and
generally means a two standard deviation (2SD) or greater difference.
[00157]       Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers
expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein should be understood as
modified in all instances by the term "about." The term "about" when used in connection with
percentages can mean       1.
[00158]       As used herein the term "comprising" or "comprises" is used in reference to
compositions, methods, and respective component(s) thereof, that are essential to the method or
composition, yet open to the inclusion of unspecified elements, whether essential or not.

carboxyl, and imidazole groups. Under physiological conditions, these drugs ionize and produce
positively charged ion that attach to susceptible nucleic acids and proteins, leading to cell cycle arrest
and/or cell death.
[00169]      The terms "anti-neoplastic" and "anti-metabolite" agents refers to the group of
compounds that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer
cells. Actively proliferating cancer cells require continuous synthesis of large quantities of nucleic
acids, proteins, lipids, and other vital cellular constituents. Many of the antimetabolites inhibit the
synthesis of purine or pyrimidine nucleosides or inhibit the enzymes of DNA replication. Some
antimetabolites also interfere with the synthesis of ribonucleosides and RNA and/or amino acid
metabolism and protein synthesis as well. By interfering with the synthesis of vital cellular
constituents, antimetabolites can delay or arrest the growth of cancer cells. Examples of antimetabolic
agents include, but are not limited to, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); asparaginase; capecitabine; cladribine (2
CDA); cytarabine; DNA de-methylating agents, such as 5-azacytidine and decitabine; edatrexate;

Example 1: EnhancingAnti-Tumor Efficacy via Temporal Inhibitionof Phosphatidylinositol3 Kinase
using a SupramolecularNanoparticle
[00199]      In this study, we demonstrate the potential advantages of the rational design of
supramolecular nanoparticles that target the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (P13K) pathway. Since its
discovery 20 years ago, studies have established the centrality of the P13K family of lipid kinases in
the etiology of cancer (6). Of the three classes of P13K, Class IA P13K is the one most implicated in
driving human cancers (7).
[00200]      PIK3CA, which encodes the p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K, and P1K3R1, which codes
for the regulatory p85a subunit, are somatically mutated or amplified in multiple primary tumors,
including in breast, gliomas, gastrointestinal, prostate and gynecological cancers (7). Additional
modulators of the P13K signaling pathway are also commonly deregulated in multiple malignancies.
For example, the lipid phosphatase PTEN, an inhibitor of P13K signaling, is a commonly inactivated
tumor suppressor (8). Activation of this pathway can also occur at the level of mutated or amplified
tyrosine receptor kinases or through mutations of AKT and RAS (7). Consequently, small molecule
inhibitors that target P13K pathway have emerged as an exciting area of research, and several
molecules that either inhibit specific catalytic subunits (a,13.8,y) of p 10 or act as pan-PI3K inhibitors
are currently in development (9).
[00201]      However, recent studies have implicated p1 1a as also playing a predominant role in
glucose homeostasis (10). Indeed, recent data from a Phase I clinical study with a pan-class I selective
P13K inhibitor (NVP-BKM120) indicates dose-dependent hyperglycemia, possibly an example of a
class effect consistent with P13K inhibition (11). Furthermore, studies have reported that
approximately 10-fold higher concentration of P13K inhibitors might be required to block
phosphorylation of downstream pathway proteins such as ribosomal protein S6 than that needed for
inhibiting more proximal AKT phosphorylation (12). We rationalized that a natural approach to
                                                     58

    WO 2013/188763                                                                 PCT/US2013/045893
overcome these challenges associated with targeting the P13K pathway is through the use of
nanotechnology.
[00202]       Nanostructures can capitalize on the unique leaky angiogenic tumor vasculature coupled
with impaired intratumoral lymphatic drainage, resulting in increased intratumoral drug
concentrations arising from the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect (13). However,
traditional processes for nanoformulation are often incompatible with physicochemical properties of
many chemotherapeutic agents, which can limit the entrapment efficiency or introduce sub-optimal
release kinetics. Indeed, our early attempts in entrapping LY294002, one of the earliest and still
widely used P13K inhibitors, resulted in sub-optimal loading efficiencies that prevented translation to
in vivo tumor efficacy studies (14). Similarly, in a recent study, wortmannin-encapsulated polymeric
nanoparticles were shown to act as a radiosensitizer (15), but such formulations are limited by total
release within a short time period, which would complicate clinical translation.
[00203]       In a recent study, we demonstrated a new paradigm moving beyond traditional
encapsulation strategies to the rational re-design of molecules to facilitate supramolecular assembly in
the nanoscale dimension (16). This concept of supramolecular nanochemistry was first envisioned by
Jean Marie Lehn, who postulated that complex nanostructures could evolve from molecular building
blocks that interact via non-covalent intermolecular forces (17, 18). Here we report that rational
modification of P13K inhibitors following conjugation with cholesterol enables supramolecular
assembly into a nanoparticle. Such P13K-targeting supramolecular nanoparticles (SNPs) exhibit the
desired pharnnacodynamic profile with enhanced antitumor efficacy, and can emerge as a new
paradigm in targeted molecular therapeutics development.
[00204]       Synthesis and characterization of PI3K-Inhibiting SNPs. In the current study, we used
two different P13K inhibitors, the pyridofuropyrimidine PI103, and P1828 (8-bromo-2-morpholin-4
yl-chromen-4-one) to engineer the supramolecular nanoparticles. P1828 is a derivative of the earlier
generation and widely used P13K inhibitor LY294002, where an amine linker has been inserted in 4
position hydrogen of the exocyclic phenyl substituent, enabling conjugation to cholesterol via a
carbamate bond (FIG. 1A). Previous studies have demonstrated that conjugation via this linker
maintains affinity for the catalytic site of P13K class I isoforms (19). However, P1828, like
LY294002, is a weak inhibitor (19). We therefore included, PI103, which has been reported to exhibit
excellent potency in the low nanomolar range and selectivity for class IA PI3Ks as well as mTOR
(12). However, PI103 was not found suitable for clinical development as the planar tricyclic structure
resulted in limited aqueous solubility and the phenolic hydroxyl group is rapidly glucoronidated (12).
These traits, however, made PI103 a perfect molecule to engineer the supramolecular nanoparticies.
As shown in Fig.1B, the phenolic hydroxyl group was conjugated via an ester linkage to cholesterol
succinate complex. The intermediate and products were characterized by 1H, 13 C NMR spectroscopy
and mass spectrometry (FIGs. 5-7).
[00205]       We engineered the SNPs from the cholesterol-P1828 or cholesterol-P103 conjugates,

    WO 2013/188763                                                                 PCT/US2013/045893
phosphatidylcholine        (PC)     and     1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycem-3-phosphoethanolamine-N
[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000) at optimized weight ratios using a lipid-film
hydration self assembly method (20)(Fig. IC). The incorporation efficiency for the cholesterol-P1828
SNPs was 43%, and 60±5% for PI103-cholesterol conjugate SNPs. As shown in FIG. ID, cholesterol
P1828 conjugates resulted in the formation of SNPs with hydrodynamic diameter of 108 ± 8.9 nm as
determined by dynamic light scattering (FIG. ID). P1103-SNPs showed a mean particle diameter of
172+1.8 nm (FIG. 1E). Ultrastructure analysis using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo
TEM) (FIG. IF) revealed the formation of predominantly unilamellar structures 100 nm or less in
diameter. The size difference between TEM and DLS measurements can be attributed to the hydration
sphere arising from the PEG coating, which can facilitate the masking from the reticuloendothelial
system (21). Additionally, aliquots of the PI103-SNPs were stored for a period of over a month, and
the size and zeta potential was measured periodically as a measure of stability of the nanostructure. As
show in FIG. 1G, no significant temporal variation was observed in either size or zeta potential during
this period, indicating that the formulations were stable.
[00206]      To study the temporal kinetics of P13K inhibitor release, the SNPs were incubated either
in phosphate buffer saline or in cell lysate. While the amount of drug released in PBS was saturated at
 ~20%, a sustained release of drug was observed in cell lysate (FIGs. 1H, 11), consistent with the
cleavage of the linkers in acidic and enzymatic (esterase) conditions. Interestingly, while a sustained
and increasing drug release was observed with P1103-SNP, the rate of release of P1828 was
significantly lower. This is consistent with the carbamate linker between the drug and cholesterol,
which is more stable than the ester linkage in the PI103-SNPs.
[00207]      As a control experiment, we also engineered nanoparticles, in which we encapsulated
PI103 in the lipid bilayer (FIG.8A). Using the lipid ratio employed with the SNPs, however, resulted
in minimal incorporation efficiency of 2% PI103, which could be optimized to 30% by changing the
compositional ratio (FIG. 8B). As shown in FIG. 8C, a sustained release of PI103 was observed from
the formulation. While the PH103 -encapsulated nanoparticles exhibited similar effects on cell viability
(FIG. 8D) and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in vitro (FIG. 8E), temporal light scattering studies
revealed an increase in the size of the nanoparticles with time (FIG. 8F), which indicated that these
nanoparticles are unstable and precipitate out (data not shown). As a result, further studies with this
nanoparticle design were not pursued.
[00208]      In vitro efficacy of supramolecular nanoparticles: We evaluated the efficacy of the SNP
in vitro using a 4T 1 murine breast cancer, MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells and a P13K
overexpressing 4306-ovarian cancer cell line. As shown in FIGs. 2A and 2B, IC50 values for free
P1103 and P1103-SNP against 4T1 murine breast cancer cell line were 121.5 ± 3.15 nM and 297.7
3.57 nM at 48 hours and 67.26     +  3.4 nM and 243.6   + 3.4 nM at 72 hours respectively. The IC50
values in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cell line treated with free P1103 and P1103-SNP were
0.445  + 0.067 pM and 6.686     + 0.0108 pM at 48 hours and 0.3121    + 0.049 pM and 2.049   + 0.044 pM

    WO 2013/188763                                                               PCT/US2013/045893
at 72 hours respectively (FIG. 2C and 2D). For 4306 ovarian cancer cell line, the 1050 values for free
P1103 and P1103-SNPs were 0.2863 ± 0.045 pM and 3.698 ± 0.050 pM at 48 hours and 0.3916 ±
0.0493 pM and 2.846 ± 0.045 pM at 72 hours respectively (FIGs. 2E and 2F). Western blot analysis
showed that at equimolar concentrations of PI103 (5 pM), both the free drug as well the SNP inhibited
basal phosphorylation of Akt even at 48 hours of continuous incubation (FIG. 2G). Interestingly, on
the other hand, a transient exposure of 4 hours resulted in a rebound increase in phosphorylation of
AKT in the case of free PI103, while SNP-P103 inhibited Akt phosphorylation in a more sustained
manner (FIGs. 2H-2K). The intracellular concentration of PI103 at 4 hours was higher in the cells
treated with the free drug than in SNP-P1103, but at 18 hours the PH103 concentration remained high
in the P1103-SNP-treated cells, whereas only traces of the drug were detected in the cells treated with
the free drug (FIG. 2L). Consistent with the above observations, P1828-SNPs and free P1828
exhibited similar cytotoxic effect on the 4T1 cells (FIG. 2M) and 4306 cells (FIG. 2N). The cells
treated with P1103-SNPsand P1828-SN exhibited similar inhibition of Akt phosphorylation after 36
hours of treatment (FIG. 20).
[00209]       Efficacy of SNP in an in vivo 4T1 breast cancer model: We next investigated the anti
tumor efficacy of P1103-SNPs in the 4T1 cell line, which is negative for ER and PR, and expresses a
low level of the mouse Her2/neu equivalent (22). Transplanted into syngeneic mice, the 4T1 form
aggressive, highly metastatic breast cancers. Mutations in genes that constitute the P13K pathway
occur in >70% of breast cancers (23). We have previously demonstrated that the 4T1 cells mount a
survival response to standard chemotherapy via an upregulation of P13K signaling (24).
[00210]       We treated mice with 411 tumors with a dose equivalent to 5 mg/kg of PI103 as free drug
or as PI103-SNP. The treatment was started when the mean tumor volume had reached 100 mm 3 , As
shown in FIGs. 3A-3C, treatment with P1103 resulted in tumor growth inhibition relative to PBS
treated controls, but tumor rebound was observed after the treatment was stopped. In contrast,
treatment with P1103-SNP resulted in sustained tumor growth inhibition over the study period. This
was consistent with the sustained level of the drug in the SNP group. After a single injection,
intratumoral Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by both the free drug and P1103-SNP compared to the
vehicle-treated group (FIG. 3E). P1103 seemed more efficient, but the difference was not statistically
significant. Interestingly, the phosphorylated forms of downstream signaling molecules, mTOR and
4EBP, were more strongly inhibited in the P1103-SNP-treated group than in the P1103-treated tumors
(P<0.05, t test).
[00211]       To test whether targeting the nanoparticles to the tumor using 'homing' peptides increases
antitumor efficacy, a separate group of tumor mice were treated with P1103-SNPs that were surface
decorated with iRGD peptide. As shown in FIGs. 3A-3C, such a treatment resulted in greater tumor
inhibition than what was obtained with SNPs that accumulate via passive uptake. Indeed, previous
observations have shown that iRGD-coated nanostructures exhibit increased extravasation and tissue
penetration in a tumor-specific and neuropilin-1-dependent manner (25). Epifluorescence imaging of
                                                    61

    WO 2013/188763                                                                  PCT/US2013/045893
tumor cross-sections revealed significant intra-tumoral localization of FAM-labeled iRGD coated
P1 03-SNPs (data not shown). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the increased in vivo efficacy,
the tumors were excised post-treatment, and processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) as a marker for apoptosis. Treatment with PI103-SNPs resulted in
greater apoptosis than treatment with free P1103. iRGD-coated P1103-SNPs induced highest level of
apoptosis, followed by P1103 nanoparticles and free P1103, consistent with the tumor inhibition result
(data not shown).
[00212]      Treatment with P1828-SNPs (5mg/kg P1828 equivalent, 3 doses) also exerted a superior
inhibitory effect on Akt phosphorylation in vivo as compared to free P1828, translating into greater
tumor growth inhibition (Figures 9A-9B). However, at this dose, the antitumor efficacy was
significantly lower than that achieved with the P1103-SNPs. One explanation is that P1828, which is
an analogue of LY294002, inhibits P13K in the micromolar range, whereas PI103 is more potent.
However, given that the both P1103-SNPs and P1828-SNPs inhibited P13K signaling, it is likely that
the release kinetics of the active agent plays a critical role in efficacy and needs to be considered in
the design of supramolecular nanoparticles.
[00213]      Effect of PI-103-SNP on insulin tolerance: P13K plays a central role in mediating
insulin signaling that is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. While both the p110 E and p11Oa
isoforms have been implicated in insulin signaling, it is the former that is predominant in maintaining
glucose homeostasis (10). We therefore investigated the effect of PI103-SNPs on insulin tolerance in
a 4T1 breast cancer model. Consistent with previous studies (12,20), mice injected with free PI-103
exhibited only a minor decrease in blood glucose level after insulin injections. In contrast a significant
drop in blood glucose level was observed when insulin was injected in mice pre-treated with PI103
SNP, or with empty nanoparticles as a control.
[00214]      Efficacy of PI103-SNPs in an in vivo K-RasLSU+/Ptenlf ovarian cancer model: We
also evaluated the effect of PI-103-SNP in a K-RasLSL/+Ptenfl/fl ovarian cancer model (26). We
selected this model because tumors that lack Pten have been reported to be addicted to P13K signaling
(7). On the other hand, tumors that present a mutated or activated Ras have been reported to be less
responsive to P13K inhibitors (7). As shown in FIG. 4A, bioluminescence quantification of tumor
luciferase signal indicates that the 3 doses of free P1-103, PI103-SNP and iRGD-PI103-SNP resulted
in significant tumor regression as compared to vehicle control. The bioluminescence response of
iRGD-PI-103-SNP was statistically significantly higher than free P1-103 after 3 cycles of treatments
as compared with 5 cycles of treatment, consistent with previous observations that iRGD facilitates
intratumoral penetrance and accumulation. No change in body weight was observed in any treatment
group (FIG. 4C). The expression levels of PI3K/mTOR pathway markers, as assessed by western blot
analysis of tumor samples from different groups, showed significant inhibition of activation of
phospho -mTOR, phospho-AKT, phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP1 in P1-103 nanoparticle and iRGD
coated P1103 nanoparticle groups as compared to the free PI-103 (FIG. 4D).

[00215]       Supramolecular nanochemistry, the development of complex chemical nanostructures
from molecular building blocks that interact via non-covalent intermolecular forces, is an emerging
concept in cancer theranostics. Indeed, in a recent study, gandolinium (111)-encapsulated
supramolecular nanoparticles were used in diagnosis of cancer metastasis (27). Similarly, we
demonstrated that the use of structure activity relationships can facilitate the assembly of platinum
cytotoxics into supramolecular nanostructures with resultant increase in antitumor efficacy and
reduction in nephrotoxicity (16). Here we demonstrate that supramolecular nanochemistry can be
extended to molecularly targeted therapeutics facilitating efficient inhibition of the P13K signaling
pathway.
[00216]       While the use of nanotechnology to preferentially target anticancer agents to solid tumors
is increasingly being explored, the traditional processes for synthesis of nanopharmaceuticals are
often incompatible with the physicochemical properties of many chemotherapeutic agents, which
limits the entrapment efficiency or introduces suboptimal release kinetics. Indeed, in our current
study, we observed that the attempts at encapsulating PI103 resulted in suboptimal loading or
formation of unstable nanoparticles. Such challenges have limited the number of nanomedicines that
have translated to the clinic despite the advantages of nanotechnology. In contrast, the higher
incorporation efficiencies into the SNPs along with the observed stability indicate that the SNPs can
facilitate clinical translation.
[00217]       The clinical translation of P13K inhibitors has been a challenge (28). A key difficulty is
biomarker selection, with most studies relying on the phosphorylation status of Akt (29). Consistent
with these studies, we observed that the SNP treatment in the ovarian cancer model resulted in
significantly greater inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, and of the downstream signaling molecules
mTOR, S6 and 4E-BP1, as compared with free PI103. Interestingly, in the breast tumors, which were
excised at a later time point post-treatment than the ovarian cancers, we observed that the phospho
Akt levels were similar in the SNP and free drug groups. However, the phosphorylation status of
mTOR and S6 kinase, was significantly inhibited following treatment with the SNPs, and correlated
well with the increased anti-tumor efficacy compared with the free drug. These results suggest that the
downstream signals might be superior biomarkers of P13K inhibitor efficacy than the upstream Akt. It
is likely that this distinction between the predictive ability of the biomarkers is being dissected due to
the temporality of inhibition arising from sustained release of the active agent from the
supramolecular nanoparticles as compared with an binary ion' state of inhibition achieved by a
therapeutic concentration of P1103 that can switch 'off as soon as the drug is rapidly removed (12).
[00218]       The sustained inhibition of the P13K signaling achieved using the supramolecular
nanoparticles can potentially overcome another challenge facing clinical translation of P13K
inhibitors. As seen in the current study, an acute exposure to the free drug (PI103) resulted in an
increase in the phospho-Akt levels at later time-points. Such a rebound activation of the pathway is
consistent with previous reports (28, 30), and has been reported to arise from a homeostatic feedback
                                                      63

loop via an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Similarly, inhibition of mTORCl can relieve a
negative loop from S6K to IRS1, leading to the activation of IGFR1 and PI3K-Akt (31). Interestingly,
treatment with the P1103-SNPs could potentially overcome this feedback loop as evident from a
sustained inhibition of the phospho-Akt signal. The reason may be that the intracellular concentration
of PI103 achieved with SNPs is higher than when the cells are exposed to the free drug. Indeed, in a
recent commentary, Engleman et al. have posed the question whether lack of efficacy of P13K
inhibitors is due to inadequate inhibition of the target or because complete inhibition of the target is
not sufficient to produce antitumor activity (31) The current results indicate that in addition to the
level of inhibition of the pathway, the temporality in terms of sustained release and target inhibition
may be a critical element in determining antitumor outcome. Interestingly, a similar observation was
made during the evolution of current clinical candidate GDC-0941 from PI103, where-90% inhibition
of Akt phosphorylation for several hours was seen as a requirement for antitumor activity,
establishing a link between pharmacokinetic exposure and pharmacodynamic biomarker changes (9).
[00219]       The ability of nanoparticles to passively accumulate in tumors coupled with the increased
intracellular concentrations of the free drug achieved in this study permits increased intra-tumoral
apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the efficacy is further improved by placing active targeting
moieties such as iRGD peptides on the nanoparticle surface. Second, the sustained release, resulting in
prolonged inhibition of the P13K pathway and absence of the 'feedback loop' raises an interesting
possibility that the duration of inhibition could be a critical determinant in clinical success in addition
to drug concentration. Interestingly, the current results also highlight that while conventional tools can
facilitate dissection of biological interactions on a spatial or concentration axes, the use of
nanochemistry can potentially enable dissection on a temporal axis. Third, the absence of insulin
resistance with the PH103-SNP, a class effect associated with p1 10a inhibitors including PI103,
indicates that the supramolecular nanochemistry can significantly impact the therapeutic index.
Additionally, rational optimization of the chemical structures to facilitate supramolecular assembly
can overcome existing limitations associated with parent molecules such as PI103, thereby opening up
the possibility of resuscitating promising drug candidates that had failed to translate into the clinic,
thereby rejuvenating the diminishing drug pipelines.

N4Amino(Polythylene Glycol)2000](DSPE-PEG) were dissolved in 1.0 mL DCM. Solvent was
evaporated into a thin and uniform lipid-drug film using a rotary evaporator. The lipid-drug film was
then hydrated with 1.0 mL H 2 0 for 1 h at 55'C. The hydrated nanoparticles looked light yellow to
white with little viscous texture. It was passed though Sephadex G-25 column and extruded at 55 0 C to

measurements each were performed at 90 degree scattering angle to get the average particle size. The
zeta potential was measured using a Zetasizer ZS90 with the nanoparticles diluted in water for

free drug or equivalent amount of drug loaded nanoparticles were added in appropriate concentration
in serum deprived media (1% FBS). After 24 hours of incubation in 5% C02 atmosphere at 370 C,
cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and protein was collected by scraping using RIPA buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche diagnostic). Amount of protein was measured by RCA
assay and equal amount of protein lysates were electrophoresed on a 4 -2 0 % polyacrylamide gel,
transferred to polyvinylidene difiuoride membrane, and blocked in TBST-T with 5% dry milk. Then
membranes were incubated in TBST with Phospho AKT (S473) (1:500 dilution), total AKT (1:1000
dilution), and actin (1:2000 dilution) antibodies (all antibodies from Cell Signalling Technology)

densitometric quantification was done by image     JTM  software.
[00244]       Efficacy study of PI828-SNPs and PI103-SNPs in marine 4T1 breast cancer model:
4T1 breast cancer cells (1 X 105) were implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of 4-week-old BALB/c
mice (weighing 20g, Charles River Laboratories). The drug therapy was started on day 9. For P1828
SNPs, the drug therapy consisted of administration of PBS (for Control group), free PI-828 (5mg/kg)
and P1828-SNPs (5mg/kg). For PI103-SNPs, the drug therapy consisted of administration of PBS (for
control group), free PI-103 (5mg/kg) and P1103-SNPs (5mg/kg) and 1RGD-PI103-SNPs (5mg/kg)
(administered by tail-vain injection). The tumor volumes and body weights were monitored on every
alternate day for 11 days. The tumor volume was calculated by using the formula, L X B2/2, where
the longest diameter was considered as L and the shortest diameter as measured using a vernier
caliper as B. Tumor volume increments were calculated as Vt1VO (VO was tumor volume at the time
of first injection). The animals were sacrificed when the average tumor volume of the control

model) were injected with a single dose of Empty nanoparticles (Control), Free PI-103 (5 mg/kg) and
PI103-SNPs via tail vain injections. Freshly prepared Insulin solution (0.75 U/Kg) in 0.1 ml 0.9%
NaCI was injected intraperitoneally to mice 1 hour after the drug administration. The blood glucose
levels were measured before and 45 min after the insulin injections using glucometer.
[00247       Efficacy study of PI103-SNPs in Murine Ovarian Cancer Tumor Model: Ovarian
adenocarcinomas were induced in genetically engineered K-ras isu+/Pten mice via intrabursal
delivery of adenovirus-carrying Cre recombinase. Tumor cells were also engineered to express
luciferase once activated by Adeno-Cre to make tumor imaging possible before and after drug
treatment. Once mice developed medium to large tumors, they were placed into one of four treatment
groups (vehicle, Free-PI-103 5 mg/kg, PI-103-SNP 5 mg/kg, and iRGD-PI103-SNP 5 mg/kg) and all
drugs were administered via tail vein injection. Treatment was administered five times over a 10 d
period with a 1 d period between treatments for Free-PI-103 and P1103-SNP, while iRGD-PI103-SNP
was administered three times over a 7 d period with 1 d break between treatments. Tumor imaging in
vivo was performed using an 1VIS Lumina ITM Imaging System. Quantification of bioluminescence
was achieved by using Living Image Software 3.1TM (Caliper Life Sciences). Prior to imaging, mice
received 150 mg/kg of D-luciferin firefly potassium salt via intraperitoneal injection. Five minutes
post-luciferin injection, mice were anesthetized in a 2.5% isoflurane induction chamber where they
were kept under anesthesia by a manifold supplying isoflurane and their body temperature was
maintained steady by a 37 'C temperature stage. Bioluminescent signal was collected 15 min after
luciferin administration for an exposure time of 30 s. Images were taken a day prior to initial
treatment (day 0, baseline image), after 3 treatments, and 1 d after 5 treatments.

Example 2: Cholesterol-tetheredplatinum II-based supramolecularnanoparticleincreases antitumor
efficacy and reduces nephrotoxicity
[00250]      Nanoscale drug delivery vehicles have been harnessed extensively as carriers for cancer
chemotherapeutics. However, traditional pharmaceutical approaches for nanoformulation have been a
challenge with molecules that exhibit incompatible physicochemical properties, such as platinum
based chemotherapeutics. Here we describe the rational design of active molecules that facilitate
supramolecular assembly in the nanoscale dimension. Using cisplatin as a template, we describe the
synthesis of a unique platinum (II) tethered to a cholesterol backbone via a unique monocarboxylato
and O->Pt coordination environment that facilitates nanoparticle assembly with a fixed ratio of
phosphatidylcholine and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3 -phosphoethanolamine-N- [amino (polyethylene

glycol)-2000]. The nanoparticles formed exhibit lower IC50 values compared with carboplatin or
cisplatin in vitro, and are active in cisplatin-resistant conditions. Additionally, the nanoparticles
exhibit significantly enhanced in vivo antitumor efficacy in murine 4T 1 breast cancer and in K
RasLSL/+/Ptenfl/fl ovarian cancer models with decreased systemic- and nephro-toxicity. The results
described herien indicate that the integration of rational drug design
and supramolecular nanochemistry is a powerful strategy for drug development.
[00251]       Cancer remains one of the main causes of death in the United States and many western
countries. In addition, the incidence is also increasing in less developed and economically
transitioning countries (1). The World Health Organization projects over 12 million deaths worldwide
in 2030 because of cancer, up from 7.6 million in 2008 (2). To address this growing problem, there is
an urgent need to develop treatment strategies that are more efficacious with lesser adverse effects.
An increasingly pursued approach to achieve these goals is the use of nanotechnology to
preferentially target anticancer agents to solid tumors (3). This approach capitalizes on the unique
leaky angiogenic tumor vasculature coupled with impaired intratumoral lymphatic drainage,
contributing to an enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect (4). Indeed, nanoparticles carrying
a doxorubicin payload or an albumin-paclitaxel nanocomplex increase intratumoral drug
concentration (5, 6) and are currently in the clinics (7). However, traditional processes for
nanoformulation are often incompatible with physicochemical properties of many chemotherapeutic
agents, which limit the entrapment efficiency or introduce suboptimal release kinetics.
[00252]       Described herein is a unique paradigm moving beyond traditional encapsulation strategies
to the rational design of molecules that facilitate supramolecular assembly in the nanoscale
dimension. In this study, cisplatin [cis-dichlorodiamineplatinum (II)] was as an example to
demonstrate this approachs. Cisplatin is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents (8) but
poses significant challenges for nanoformulations (9, 10). For example, SPI-077, a sterically
stabilized liposome encapsulating cisplatin, exhibited poor clinical efficacy resulting from impaired
drug release (11, 12).
[00253]       To achieve supramolecular nanoassembly, we synthesized a cholesterol-tethered
cisplatinum (II) amphiphile. The design of the tether was inspired by the process of "aquation,"
wherein the chloride leaving groups of cisplatin are rapidly displaced to form cis
Pt[(NH3)2(OH2)Cl]+ and cis-Pt[(NH3)2(OH2)2]2+ (8). Self-assembling cholesterol-succinic acid
cisplatinum II-based nanoparticles (SACNs) exhibited increased potency and efficacy in vitro and in
vivo, respectively. Additionally, the SACNs exceed the size cutoff for clearance by the kidney (13),
and therefore exhibited limited cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity (14). We demonstrate herein that
rational drug design can enable the increase in the supramolecular dimension from the Angstrom- to
the nano-scale, thereby conferring unique biological properties. Furthermore, only three platinates
cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin-have been successfully used in the clinics (8). The increased
efficacy with improved therapeutic index of the current molecule compared with the existing

platinates indicates the potential for clinical translation as the next-generation platinum-based
chemotherapeutic.
[00254        Synthesis of Cholesterol-Succinic Acid-Pt(H) Molecule. Aquation of cisplatin results in
the rapid formation of active species cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl(OH2)]+ and cis-[Pt(NH3)2(OH2)2]2+ with a
rate constant of 8 x 10-5s-1 (15). In contrast, the rate constant for aquation of carboplatin, where the
platinum is coordinated with a stable bidentate 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato ligand, was found to be
7.2 x 10-7 s-i. This difference in their rate of aquation was matched by their rates of binding to
DNA, indicating that the rate of aquation correlates with potency (16, 17). Indeed, we had
demonstrated that Pt chelated to a polyisobutylene maleic acid glucosamine copolymer via a
monocarboxylato and an O->Pt coordinate bond release of Pt in a pH-dependent manner, and more
efficiently than when the Pt was chelated using dicarboxylato bonds or via a monocarboxylato and an
N->Pt coordinate bond (18, 19). As a result, we rationalized that the introduction of a coordination
environment where the Pt was chelated via a monocarboxylato and an O->Pt coordinate bond is
critical to the design of an efficacious platinate. As outlined in the given scheme (Figure 10A), we
first synthesized cholesterol-ethylenediamine conjugate in near quantitative yield (99.10%) by reacting
cholesteryl chloroformate with excess ethylene diamine. Next, we introduced monocarboxylato and
amide chelating moiety by reacting cholesterol-ethylenediamine conjugate with succinic anhydride (at
95% yield). Finally, the conjugate was reacted with aquated cis-Pt[(NH3)2(OH2)2]2+ in 1:1 molar
ratio in acidic pH (pH = 6.4) to obtain cholesterol-cisplatin conjugate, characterized by
monocarboxylato and an O->Pt coordinate bond of an amide, as indicated by an unique single 195Pt
NMR peak at -1,621.497 ppm (Figure 14). All of the other intermediates were characterized by 1H
and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures 15-18).
[00255        Synthesis and CharacterizationofSACNs. We engineered the S.ACNs from the
cholesterol-succinic acid-platinum (11) molecuic phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn
glcero-3polyhylene                                            glyco)-2000] (DSPE-PfG) in 1:2:0,2 weight
ratio using a lipid-filin hydration self assernbly method (20) (Figure 10A). The ultrastructure analysis
using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) (Figure 1OB) revealed the formation of
predominantly uni- and rare multilamellar structures less than 200 nm in diameter, with a membrane
thickness -5 nm. Dynamic light scattering further confirmed the size distribution of SACNs with a
mean hydrodynamic diameter of 141.4 ± 1.2 nm (n = 9) (Figure 10C). To validate the kinetics of
cisplatin release, SACNs were incubated at acidic pH 5.5 over 120 h, with pH 7 as a reference. As
shown in Figure 1OD, SACNs exhibited a pH-dependent sustained release of cisplatin. Interestingly,
the rate of release was slower than observed earlier using a polymeric system, indicating that the
cholesterol can incorporate into the lipid layer in a manner where the Pt moiety is present both on the
outer as well as inner part of the membrane.
[00256]       In Vitro Efficacy of SACNs. To evaluate the efficacy of the SACNs in vitro, we
performed a cell viability assay using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines.

Cell viability was quantified by using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2
(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay at 48 h postincubation. As shown in Figures 11 A
1 IB, free cisplatin induced LLC and 4T1 cell kill with IC 50 values of 2.91 ± 0.015 jaM and 4.72 ±
0.0 16 jaM, respectively. In neither of these cell lines did carboplatin exert any inhibitory activity at
this concentration range. Interestingly, the SACNs were found to be more efficacious than cisplatin
against both 4T1 and LLC cells, with IC 50 values of 0.44 ± 0.016 jaM and 1.16 ± 0.016 jaM,
respectively. We next tested the efficacy of the SACNs in a cisplatin-resistant hepatocellular
carcinoma (7404-CP20) cell line. Although the IC 50 value for free cisplatin in this assay was
calculated to be 42.84 ± 0.04 jaM, consistent with previously reported values (21), the SACNs were
found to be overcome the resistance with an IC 50 value of 3.02 ± 0.013 jaM (Figure 1 IC). To elucidate
the mechanism of cell death, we incubated 4T1 cells with a sub-IC50 concentration of the SACNs,
cisplatin or carboplatin, for 24 h. The cells were labeled with FITC-Annexin V that binds to
phosphatidylserine, an early marker for apoptosis. As seen in Figure 1 ID, treatment with platinates
induced both apoptosis and necrosis of the tumor cells, with both cisplatin and SACNs being more
efficacious than carboplatin. Studies using FITC-labeled SACNs revealed that the nanoparticles were
internalized and localized in the endolysosomal compartment in a temporal manner (e.g.
internalization of FITC-SACNs in the endolysosomal compartments within 4 h) (data not shown).
This finding is further validated by incubating the tumor cells (4T1 and 7404-CP20) with FITC
labeled SACNs at 37 'C and 4 'C, wherein the internalization of SACNs into the cells was decreased
in the latter condition (data not shown). To dissect the mechanism underlying the efficacy of SACNs
in the cisplatin-resistant 7404-CP20 cell line, we quantified the intracellular concentration of Pt in the
cells following incubation with cisplatin or SACNs containing equivalent levels of Pt. As shown
in Figure 11 E, the SACNs resulted in significantly elevated intracellular levels of Pt compared with
cisplatin. Incubating cells with SACNs at 4 'C, which inhibits energy-dependent endocytosis, reduced
the intracellular Pt concentration to cisplatin-treated levels, validating that the SACNs can enter these
cells via endocytosis.
[00257        Efficacy of SACNs in an in Vivo 4T1 Breast Cancer Model. Motivated by the sustained
release of Pt and enhanced in vitro efficacy of SACNs, we evaluated its antitumor efficacy in vivo. As
the first step, we established the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the SACNs in BALB/c mice to
be 16 mg/kg compared with 9 mg/kg of cisplatin (Figure 12A). We next dosed syngeneic BALB/c
mice bearing 4T1 breast tumors (mean tumor volume ~100 mm3 ) with a single dose of cisplatin (8
mg/kg). Other groups of animals received vehicle, carboplatin, or SACNs, (the latter two received a Pt
dose equivalent to 8 mg/kg dose of cisplatin). As shown in Figure 12B, although all of the platinates
resulted in significant tumor inhibition compared with the vehicle-treatment, the SACNs exerted the
maximal tumor inhibition (P < 0.01 vs. control) followed by cisplatin and carboplatin. Furthermore,
although treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin exerted only minor increase in survival over vehicle
treated controls, the SACNs significantly increased overall survival trend (Figure 12C).

[00258]       We next tested the effects of multiple low-dose treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, or
the SACNs, with the highest platinum dose in each case adding up to the levels of Pt delivered at the
MTD of cisplatin. Two additional groups were included that were treated with a lower dose of
cisplatin or SACNs (equivalent of 1 mg/kg dose of platinum). As shown in Figure 12D, treatment
with cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. Interestingly, although at the
highest doses the tumor inhibition with the SACNs or cisplatin were identical, at the lower doses the
SACNs exerted a superior antitumor effect compared with free cisplatin (P < 0.05, ANOVA).
Furthermore, cisplatin resulted in a significant reduction in mean body weight (P< 0.05, ANOVA)
compared with the SACN-treated groups (Figure 12E), indicating that the latter can reduce the
systemic toxicity associated with cisplatin chemotherapy. Interestingly, even at the lower dose both
the SACNs and cisplatin exerted greater tumor inhibition as opposed to the higher dose of carboplatin
(Figures 12D-12E). At the higher dose, both cisplatin and SACNs were found to increase survival,
although the latter was superior (Figure 12 F).
[00259]       To elucidate the mechanism underlying of increased in vivo efficacy, the tumors were
excised posttreatment and processed for TUNEL as a marker for apoptosis. SACNs induced
significantly greater apoptosis than cisplatin, but at the higher doses both the SACNs and cisplatin
induced similar apoptosis, consistent with the tumor inhibition results (data not shown). However, at
the latter dose level, cisplatin but not SACNs resulted in significant nephrotoxicity as evident by
reduced kidney weight and up-regulation of kidney injury molecule-i (KIM1) expression (Figure
13A). Additionally, TUNEL of the excised kidney sections indicated significant apoptosis in
cisplatin-treated mice, whereas the SACNs demonstrated negligible apoptosis even at the higher dose
(data not shown).
[00260]       SA CNs Home Preferentiallyto the Tumors and Bypass Kidney. To elucidate the
mechanism underlying the enhanced apoptosis in the tumor and reduced nephrotoxicity evident with
the SACNs, we probed the tumor and reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs for the platinum
biodistribution. Tumor-bearing animals were dosed with cisplatin or SACNs at doses equivalent to 1
and 3 mg/kg of platinum. As shown in Figure 13B, there was a dose-dependent accumulation of
platinum (as quantified per gram of tissue using inductive-coupled plasma atomic absorption spectra)
in the RES tissues. Interestingly, the SACNs (3 mg/kg Pt dose) resulted in significantly higher
concentration in the tumor than achieved following dosing of an equivalent amount of cisplatin.
Furthermore, at this dose, cisplatin resulted in significantly higher platinum build-up in the kidney,
which could account for cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity, compared with the SACN-treated groups.
[00261]       Efficacy of SACNs in an in Vivo K-RasLSL1+/Ptenlf Ovarian Cancer Model. In recent
years, it has been well established that frequent somatic PTEN and K-Ras mutations are implicated in
wide spectrum of human cancers, including endometrioid ovarian cancer (224-24). As shown
in Figure 19A, the animals bearing medium and large K-rasLS+/Ptenfl/fl ovarian cancer treated with
SACNs (Pt dose equivalent to 3 mg/kg of cisplatin) resulted in greater regression compared with
                                                     77

cisplatin treatment. TUNEL revealed apoptosis in both SACN- and cisplatin-treated tumor. However,
although cisplatin induced apoptosis of nephrons, negligible cell death was evident in the kidney with
SACNs (data not shown), which correlated with elevated levels of Pt in the tumor with reduced
concentrations in the kidney following SACN treatment compared with cisplatin-treatment (Figure
19B).
Discussion
[00262]       Supramolecular chemistry, the development of complex chemical systems from
molecular building blocks that interact via noncovalent intermolecular forces (25), has emerged as a
field that explains and impacts many biological and physical concepts. In an elegant perspective,
Jean-Marie Lehn had envisioned a unique paradigm called supramolecular nanochemistry (26).
Indeed, gadolinium (111)-encapsulated supramolecular nanoparticles were recently shown to enhance
relaxivity with increased sensitivity, and serve as a tool for diagnosis of cancer metastasis (27). In
another study, camptothecin was encapsulated in a supramolecular nanoparticle (28). However,
although these emerging studies have focused on using supramolecular interactions to encapsulate
molecules for targeting cancer, we report here the rational redesign of a cancer chemotherapeutic drug
to enable supramolecular assembly into a nanostructure.
[00263]       Although cisplatin [cis-dichlorodiamineplatinum (II)] is the drug of choice as a first or
second line chemotherapy for most cancers, its clinical efficacy is dose-limited because of
nephrotoxicity, resulting from a peritubular uptake in both proximal and distal tubules mediated by a
organic cation transporter 2 (29). As nanoparticles > 5.5 nm can bypass glomerular filtration (13),
cisplatin made an excellent candidate for rational engineering into a supramolecular nanostructure to
potentially overcome nephrotoxicity. As the first step, we converted cis-platinum (II) into an
amphiphile via conjugation to a cholesterol succinic acid conjugate, which facilitated
the supramolecular assembly of this platinate into SACNs with PC and DSPE-PEG arising from
hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions (30, 31). Cholesterol and PC were selected as both are
components of biological cellular membranes, and the 3 P-OH group of cholesterol is easily amenable
to conjugation, and alter pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile as well as cellular uptake of the
active agent (32). DSPE-PEG was incorporated to impart "stealth" property to SACNs as surface
modification of nanoparticles with PEG has been reported to decrease interaction with opsonin (33),
and thereby reduce clearance by the RES. Indeed, consistent with the above hypothesis, our
biodistribution studies revealed that the SACNs could bypass glomerular filtration in the kidney,
evident by the significantly lower Pt concentration in the kidney compared with cisplatin. This finding
was further validated by low expression of KIMI, an early marker for kidney injury (34), with
concomitant decrease in kidney apoptosis observed following SACNs treatment. Furthermore, the
SACNs preferentially accumulated in the tumor are consistent with previous reports where such
stealth nanosystems were reported to home into the tumors via the EPR effect (5).

[00264]       Although the SACNs enable enhanced intratumoral concentrations, a critical driver of
efficacy is the efficient release of active cis-[Pt(NH3)2]2 moiety. For example, the stable
cyclobutanedicarboxylate chelating ligand lowers the rate of aquation of carboplatin by two-to-four
orders of magnitude than cisplatin, and to obtain cytotoxicity comparable to cisplatin a 4- to 20-fold
higher dose of carboplatin is required (16). Similarly, AP5280, a N-(2-hydroxypropyl)
methacrylamide copolymer-bound platinum was found to exert minimal nephrotoxicity in clinical
studies (35), but was less potent than carboplatin because the platinum is held to an aminomalonic
acid chelating agent coupled to the COOH terminal glycine of a tetra-peptide spacer (36). The
criticality in the amphiphile design in this study was therefore the introduction of the
monocarboxylato and O->Pt coordination environment between the platinum and the leaving group,
in this case the cholesterol succinic acid conjugate. We have previously demonstrated that this
coordination environment was more efficient in releasing activated Pt in a pH-dependent manner than
when coordination is via more stable dicarboxylato linkages or monocarboxylato and N->Pt linkage
(18, 19). This finding is consistent with the increased potency of SACNs compared with carboplatin
as observed in vitro and validated by increased tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. Interestingly, the
SACNs also exhibited slightly improved efficacy compared with cisplatin in the breast cancer (4T 1)
and LLC cells, and was significantly superior to cisplatin in the hepatocellular carcinoma (7404
CP20), which could be explained by the SACNs harnessing additional mechanisms of uptake into the
7404-CP20 cells besides traditional platinum transporters that are mutated in these cells. Indeed our
studies using fluorescently tagged SACNs revealed internalization via endocytosis in a temporal
manner.
[00265]       Inhibition of endocytosis decreased the intracellular levels of Pt following SACN
treatment to that achieved by treatment with cisplatin. Although previous studies have reported that
cholesterol has been shown to facilitate cellular uptake through caveolin-mediated endocytosis (37),
we observed that pretreatment of the cells with chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated
endocytosis, nystatin, a caveolae-mediated endocytosis inhibitor, or cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of
macropinocytosis/phagocytosis, could not fully abolish internalization of the SACNs (data not
shown), which could suggest a redundancy in the mechanisms of SACN internalization. However, it
should be noted that recent reports have questioned the specificity of endocytosis inhibitors (38), and
in our study we did observe changes in cellular morphology, even at lower doses and short incubation
times. SACNs were also internalized in a similar manner by endothelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro
(data not shown). Without wishing to be bound by theory, in vivo, the preferential EPR-mediated
intratumoral accumulation, and the tendency of SACNs to internalize within the low pH
endolysosomal compartment together with the predisposition of the SACNs to release activated cis
[Pt(NH3)2]2 in an acidic environment, may contribute to preferential tumor targeting.
[00266]       Although the SACNs exhibit increased potency, we also observed an increase in the MTD
in vivo compared with cisplatin, suggesting that it may be possible to overcome the dosing limits
                                                      79

    WO 2013/188763                                                                 PCT/US2013/045893
associated with cisplatin in the clinics. We selected the 4T1 breast cancer and the genetically
engineered K-rasLSL+/pten/f ovarian adenocarcinoma mouse models for our in vivo studies because
these closely mimic human tumor progression. Interestingly, even at a single sub-MTD platinum dose
comparable to the MTD of cisplatin, the SACNs exerted superior antitumor efficacy, both in terms of
tumor inhibition and survival, which could be attributed to the preferential accumulation and
increased potency. Furthermore, there may be a metronomic dosing effect involved in the therapeutic
outcome potentially arising from the sustained release because, even at the lower doses, SACNs were
more efficacious than cisplatin. Interestingly, recent clinical reports have indicated that metronomic
dosing of cisplatin exerts an antiangiogenic effect (39). Interestingly, we observed that administration
of lower multiple doses of cisplatin was more effective in increasing survival compared with a single
MTD. This finding indicates that therapeutic efficacy of SACNs can be optimized by tailoring the
dosing regimen.
[00267]      The results described herein demonstrate that integrating rational drug design and
supramolecular nanochemistry can permit a powerful strategy for drug development. Furthermore,
because platinum-based chemotherapeutics form the frontline therapy for a broad range of cancers,
including testicular, ovarian, cervical, endometrial, bladder, head and neck, lung, and gastro
esophageal cancers, the increased efficacy and improved toxicity profile, resulting from an increase in
the molecular dimension through supramolecular assembly, indicates that the constructed
nanostructure can be efficacious for treatment.
Materials and Methods
[00268]      Synthesis and Characterization of SACNs. Briefly, a thin and uniform lipid-drug film of
PC, cholesterol-cisplatin conjugate, and DSPE-PEG was coated using a rotary evaporator, then
hydrated for 1 h at 60 'C, passed although Sephadex G-25 column, and extruded at 65 'C to obtain
sub-200 nm particles. Nanoparticles were analyzed using a nanozetasizer and using cryo-TEM. For
release kinetics, drug loaded nanoparticles were suspended in buffer (pH = 5.5 or 7) and sealed in a
dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff= 500 Da). The dialysis bags were incubated in 30 mL
PBS buffer at room temperature with gentle shaking. An aliquot was collected from the incubation
medium at predetermined time intervals, and the released drug was quantified.

hepatocellular carcinoma cells (CP20) were seeded into 96-well flat bottomed plates (4 x 103 cells per
well). Drugs or SACNs were added at equivalent Pt concentrations and incubated for 48 h. Viability
was quantified using the Cell-Titer 96 Aqueous One SolutionTM reagent. Cellular apoptosis was
quantified using Annexin-V-Alexa FluorTM 488 conjugate and propidium iodide staining followed by
FACS.

intravenous administration of SACNs (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg equivalent Pt dose), cisplatin (1 mg/kg
and 3 mg/kg equivalent Pt dose), and carboplatin (3 mg/kg equivalent Pt dose). PBS (100 gL) by tail
vain injection was used as a control for drug treatment. Treatment was started on day 9

genetically engineered K-rasLSU+/Pten/f mice via intrabursal delivery of adenovirus carrying Cre
recombinase. Tumor cells were engineered to express luciferase once activated by Adeno-Cre, to
make tumor imaging feasible before and after drug treatment. The drug therapy consisted of tail vein
administration of SACNs (3 mg/kg equivalent Pt dose), cisplatin (3 mg/kg equivalent Pt dose), or PBS
(100 gL). Each animal was dosed three times over the course of treatment given every alternate day.
Treatment efficacy was quantified by examining the fold increase in bioluminescence of the
posttreatment signal compared with baseline.

heated for another 12 h to evaporate the liquids. All solid residues were redissolved in 1 mL water and
then amount of platinum was measured by inductive-coupled plasma-atomic absorption
spectrometry/MS.

sectioned at the Harvard Medical School Core Facility. Tumor and kidney paraffin sections were
deparaffinized and stained with a standard TMR red fluorescent TUNEL kit following the
manufacturer's protocol (In Situ Cell Death Detection   KitTM,  TMR-Red; Roche). The kidney sections
were also immunolabeled for KIMI expression. Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse

5.0 mg cholesterol-cisplatin conjugate (7), and 1.0 mg of DSPE-PEG were dissolved in 10.0 mL
DCM. Solvent was evaporated into a thin and uniform lipid-drug film using a rotary evaporator. The

looked light yellow to white with little viscous texture. This mixture was passed although Sephadex
G-25 column and extruded at 65 'C to obtain sub-200 nm particles.

camera. Vitreous ice grids were transferred into the electron microscope using a cryostage that
maintains the grids at a temperature below -170 'C. Images of the grid were acquired at multiple
scales to assess the overall distribution of the specimen. After identifying potentially suitable target

areas for imaging at lower magnification, high magnification images were acquired at nominal
magnification of 52,000x (0.21 nm/ pixel) and 21,000x (0.50 nm/pixel). Images were acquired at a
nominal underfocus of -5 gm (21,000x) and -4 gm (52,000x) at electron doses of -10-15          e/A 0 2.
[00284]        Cell Viability Assay. The Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, breast cancer cell line (4T 1),
and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (CP20) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection.
LLC cells and CP20 cells were cultured in DMEM and 4T1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium
1640-supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 unit/mL penicillin, and 50 unit/mL streptomycin. Trypsinized
cultured LLC, 4T1, and CP20 cells were washed twice with PBS and seeded into 96-well flat
bottomed plates (4    x 103 cells per well). Free drugs and SACNs were added at appropriate
concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 20, 50 gM Pt concentration). The plates were then incubated for 48 h
in a 5% C02 atmosphere at 37 'C. The cells were washed and incubated with 100 gL phenol-red free
medium (without FBS) containing 20 gL of the Cell-Titer 96 Aqueous One SolutionTM reagent
(Promega). After 2 h incubation in 5% C02 atmosphere at 37 'C, the absorbance in each well was
recorded at 490 nm using an Epoch (BioTekTM) plate reader. Results were quantified by subtracting
the blank value from each value then normalizing against the control values and results were analyzed
by using PrismTM software (GraphPad). Data shown are mean ± SE of n =3.
[00285]       Synthesis ofFITC-Labeled SA CNs. For synthesis of FITC-labeled SACNs, 10.0 mg of
PC, 5.0 mg of cholesterol-cisplatin conjugate 7, 1.0 mg of DSPE-PEG, and 1 mg of FITC were
dissolved in 10.0 mL DCM. Solvent was evaporated into a thin and uniform lipid-drug film with the
help of a rotary evaporator. The lipid-drug film was hydrated with 1.0 mL H20 for 2 h at 60 'C. The
hydrated nanoparticles appeared light yellow to white with little viscous texture. The mixture was
passed although Sephadex G-25 column and extruded at 65 'C in dark to obtain sub 200-nm particles.
[00286]       FITC-SA CNInternalization Study. The 4T1 or 7404-CP20 cells were seeded on glass
cover-slips in 24-well plates until subconfluent, and then treated with FITC-encapsulated SACNs for a
time-course ranging from 30 min to 18 h. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice in PBS and
incubated in LysoTracker RedTM (Ex: 577 nm; Em: 590 nm) for 30 min at 37 'C. Cells were then
washed again, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, then treated with DAPI (Ex: 350 nm; Em: 470 nm) for
30 s, and mounted using Prolong GoldTM antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images taken in three random
fields were captured at 40x using an inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with UV, blue, and green
filters to visualize DAPI, FITC, and LysoTracker red fluorescence, respectively. Cells incubated either
only FITC encapsulated CNP or Lyso-Tracker red served as negative controls. Pharmacological
inhibitors are often used to study endocytic pathways. We used Chlorpromazine (25 gM) as Clathrin
mediated endocytosis inhibitor, Nystatin (25 gg/mL) as caveolae-mediated endocytosis inhibitor, and
Cytochalasin D (5 gg/mL) as macropinocytosis/ phagocytosis inhibitor. Cells were pretreated with the
inhibitors for 2 h before incubation with the FITC-SACNs for 4 h, following which they were imaged
after being processed as de-scribed earlier. In other studies the cells were incubated at 4 'C to block
energy-dependent endocytosis, as described by Drin et al. (1)

[00287]       Quantification of Intracellular Pt in Vitro in 7404-CP20 Cells. For quantification of
intracellular Pt in vitro in 7404-CP20 cells, 5 x 105 CP20 cells were plated in 100-mm cell culture
dish. When cells became around 70% confluent, they were serum-deprived for 6 h before the addition
of the drugs. Cells were incubated with either 20 gM of free cisplatin or SACN at 37 'C or same dose
of SACN at 4 'C to inhibit energy-dependent internalization. After that, drug-containing media was
removed and cells were washed three times using cold PBS. Cell numbers from each dish were
counted following trypsinization, and then lysed overnight in 70% nitric acid. Nitric acid was then
evaporated and amount of Pt was measured by ICP-MS after appropriate dilutions in 5%nitric acid.
[00288]       FACS Analysis ofApoptosis. The 4T1 cells were grown in six-well plates incubated in
the presence of SACNs or free cisplatin or free carboplatin at 1 gM concentration at 37 'C for 24 h.
After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and collected at 0 'C. The cells were then treated with
Annexin-V-Alexa Fluor 488TM conjugate (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and incubated in the dark, at
room temperature, for 15 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with propidium
iodide (PI) solution (50 g/mL; Sigma) containing RNase (1 mg/mL; Sigma). The cell suspension were
then transferred to FACS tubes and analyzed for Annexin-V/PI staining on a BD FACS CaliburTM
instrument. Data were analyzed using a CellQuestPrTM software (BD Biosciences).
[00289]       In Vivo Murine 4T1 Breast Cancer Model. The 4T1 breast cancer cells (3 x 105) were
implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of 4-wk-old BALB/c mice (weighing 20 g; Charles River
Laboratories). The drug therapy was started on day 9. The drug therapy consisted of administration of
SACNs (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg), free cisplatin (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg), and free carboplatin (3 mg/kg)
(administered by tail-vain injection). PBS (100 gL) administered by tail-vain injection was used as a
control for drug treatment. The tumor volumes and body weights were monitored on a daily basis.
The tumor volume was calculated by using the formula, L x B2, where the longest diameter was
considered as L and the shortest diameter as measured using a vernier caliper as B. The animals were
killed when the average tumor volume of the control exceeded 2,000 mm3 in the control group. The
tumors were harvested immediately following sacrifice and stored in 10% formalin for further
analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the Harvard Institutional Use and Care of Animals
Committee.
[00290]       In Vivo Murine Ovarian Cancer Tumor Model. Ovarian adenocarcinomas were induced
in genetically engineered K-rasLSL/+/Ptenfl/fl mice via intrabursal delivery of adenovirus-carrying
Cre recombinase. Tumor cells were engineered to express luciferase once activated by Adeno-Cre, to
make tumor imaging feasible before and after drug treatment. Once mice developed medium-to-large
tumors they were placed into one of three treatment groups (control, cisplatin 3 mg/kg, and SACNs),
with all drugs administered intravenously via tail vein. The dose of SACNs was selected to be
equivalent in Pt content as 3 mg/kg of cisplatin. The animals were injected with the drugs three times
over a 6-d period with a 1-d interval between the dosings. Tumor imaging in vivo was performed with
the IVIS Lumina II Imaging SystemTM. Quantification of bioluminescence was achieved by using the
                                                    85

Living Image Software 3.1TM (Caliper Life Sciences). Mice received 150 mg/kg of D-luciferin firefly
potassium salt via intraperitoneal injection before imaging. Five minutes postluciferin injection,
animals were anesthetized in a 2.5% isoflurane induction chamber where they were kept under
anesthesia by a manifold supplying isoflurane and their body temperature was maintained by a 37 'C
temperature stage. Bioluminescent signal was collected 15 min after luciferin administration for an
exposure time of 30 s. Images were taken a day before treatment (day 0, baseline), in the middle of
the treatment cycle, and 1 d following the final treatment. Treatment efficacy was quantified by
examining the fold-increase in bioluminescence of the posttreatment signal compared with baseline.
Statistical analysis of the toxicity data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test with the Prism
5TM   software.
[00291]       Biodistribution of Cisplatin and SA CNs. After the in vivo experiments, the animals were
killed and the organs were harvested. The organs were then weighed and dissolved in concentrated
HNO 3 (approximately 10 mL) by shaking for 24 h at room temperature and then heating at 100 'C for
12 h. To these mixtures 30% H202 was added, the resulting solutions were stirred for 24 h at room
temperature, and then heated for another 12 h to evaporate the liquids. All solid residues were
redissolved in 1 mL water and then amount of platinum was measured by inductively coupled plasma
spectrometry.
[00292]       Platinum II can react with nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen residues in other biomolecules,
such as plasma proteins. As a result of these reactions, a variety of platinum species may be present in
the body after treatment with cisplatin. This protocol does not distinguish platinum that may have
become deactivated by reactions with plasma proteins from active drug, and only quantifies the total
Pt concentrations at defined time point. We anticipate that such interactions will be normalized when
we make comparisons between the SACN-treated groups and cisplatin-treated animals. However,
there is a possibility that the preferential release of Pt (II) from SACNs in acidic vs. physiological pH
might translate into lower deactivation by coordination with Drin G, Cottin S, Blanc E, Rees AR,

kidney paraffin sections were deparaffinized and stained with standard TMR red fluorescent TUNEL
kit following the manufacturer'sprotocol (In Situ Cell Death Detection     KitTM, TMR-Red; Roche).
Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 fluorescence microscope equipped with red
