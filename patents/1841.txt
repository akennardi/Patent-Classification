TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]               The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for separating waste
from a granular solid and in particular to a pet litter scoop.
BACKGROUND
[0002]               Apparatus such as screens or sieves are known to separate mixtures of solids of
varying size. Such apparatus provide openings such that material under a certain size may
pass through the opening while material above that certain size cannot pass through and
instead collect on the surface of the screen.
[0003]               Apparatus such as this may be used to separate pet litter from pet waste. When
used in such an application, the apparatus may take the form of a scoop, which is often
referred to as a litter scoop, or a kitty litter scoop. Litter scoops may be used to remove
waste such as faeces and clumped litter, from unspent litter, which may pass through the
openings in the screen of the litter scoop. The waste thus collected by the scoop can then
be disposed of.
[0004]               Litter scoops may become soiled by nature of their utility. Accordingly, there
is a need for a scoop that can be stored in a manner that improves hygiene.
[0005]               The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0022]               The following modes, given by way of example only, are described in order to
provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a preferred embodiment or
embodiments.
[0023]               In the Figures, incorporated to illustrate features of an example embodiment,
like reference numerals are used to identify like parts throughout the figures.
[0024]               Referring to the Figures, shown is an apparatus 1 for separating waste from
granular solids. In an embodiment, the apparatus 1 may be suitable for removing pet waste
from pet litter; such an embodiment being commonly referred to as a litter scoop 2.
[0025]               The apparatus 1 may include a main body portion 2 in the form of a scoop 2
having apertures 3 to allow the through passage of granular solids whilst disallowing
through passage of larger solids. The apparatus I may have a handle member 8 connecting
with the main body portion 2, and may further have a shield member 7 which may locate
between the handle member 8 and the main body portion 2. The shield member may be
configured to provide a physical obstruction between the handle member and the main
body portion, for example, the shield member 7 may be broader than the handle. By this
arrangement, a person having grip of the apparatus 1 by way of the handle, may obstructed
from their grip slipping towards the scoop 2, such that the shield member 7 provides a
barrier between the hand of a user and the potentially spoiled scoop 2.
[0026]                 The main body portion 2 may comprise a screen 4 having the plurality of
apertures 3, wherein the screen 4 may be bordered by a plurality of walls to aid in retaining
material on the screen 4, such that an agitating action may be applied to the apparatus 1 in
order to promote granular material passing through the plurality of apertures 3 rather than
to fall off the screen 4.                            The main body portion 2 may further include an attachment
member 9 adapted to attach the apparatus I to an object for storage, such as the rim 11 of a
pet litter tray.
[0027]               Referring to Figure 1, shown is a front view of an apparatus 1 according to the
present invention. The main body portion 2 in the form of a scoop may have a screen 4

R]AdvbInterw\RPor th\DCC\DVWi]6060695_i.doc-25/0018
                                                    -5
with two side walls 5 and a rear wall 6 projecting from a periphery of the screen 4 in a first
direction.          A front periphery 12 of the screen 4 may not have such a wall.       By this
arrangement, the scoop 2 may provide a shallow pan adapted so as to be pushed into a
granular material by the front periphery 12 to gather up a granular material, with the side
walls 5 and rear wall 6 acting to maintain the granular material incident on the screen 4.
The apparatus 1 may have a shield member 7 attaching with the main body portion 2 by
the rear wall 6, the shield member 7 thus locating between the main body portion 2 and a
handle.        The handle member 8 may be adapted with a hole 12, which may allow the
apparatus 1 to be hung from a hook for storage.
[0028]              Referring to Figure 2, shown is a rear view of the apparatus 1 showing an
attachment member 9 in the form of a hook projecting from main body portion 2. The
attachment member in the form of a hook 9 may project from the main body portion 2 in
an opposite direction than the side walls 5 and the rear wall 6. The attachment member 9
in the form of a hook 9 may comprise simple elbowed projection or clip configured to fit
over the rim 11 of a container thus removeably attaching the apparatus I thereto. Figures 3
and 4 show the gap 10 formed between the attachment member 9 and the main body
portion 2 which may receive the rim 11 of a container, thus removeably attaching the
apparatus 1 to the container. The attachment member 9 may be adapted so that the gap 10
receives the rim 11 with the apparatus 1 stably located in a vertical orientation with the
scoop 2 locating downwardly relative to the handle member 8.
[0029]              Figure 8 shows an embodiment of the apparatus I in use, with the apparatus I
attached to a container by way of the attachment member 9.              Advantageously and as
apparent from Figure 8, when the attachment member 9 engages with the rim 11 of a
container, the potentially soiled scoop 2 may locate within the bounds of the container,
thus storing the apparatus I in a way that improves hygiene. Further advantageously and
as apparent from Figure 8, the attachment member 9 may be located such that when
engaged to the rim 11 of a container, the shield member 7 locates at, or partially at, a level
above the rim 11. By this arrangement, the shield member 7 may form a barrier above the
level of the rim 11 to resist spillage of potentially soiled material from the container, such
as may be the case when a pet is digging or scratching at the material,
