                                 BREATHING EQUIPMENT TRAINING
                                       TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present disclosure relates generally to training equipment. More particularly, the
present disclosure relates to training devices and methods for breathing equipment.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]      People working in hostile and potentially hazardous environments, such as, for
example, firemen, often use a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to breathe.              For
example, oxygen supply may be depleted in the potentially hazardous environment and/or the air
in the potentially hazardous environment may not be fit for breathing.          Given the risk and
potentially hazardous nature, individuals should be properly trained to operate their equipment,
such as the SCBA, and have the stamina necessary to perform difficult tasks before being
subjected to entering and/or working in such environments.        Current solutions fail to provide
individuals with the realistic training simulations necessary for the preparation of entering and/or
working in such environments.
[0003]      Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have systems and methods that take into
account one or more of the issues discussed above, as well as possibly other issues.
                                            SUMMARY
[0004]      The different illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure provide an apparatus
for a breathing equipment training device and a method for breathing training.
[0005]      In an aspect, the present invention provides a breathing equipment training device.
The breathing equipment training device includes a shell and a diaphragm. The shell includes a
first opening, a second opening, and a pin. The first opening is configured to be inserted into a

[0006]      In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for breathing equipment
training. The method comprises attaching, to a mask, a breathing equipment training device that
includes a shell and a diaphragm, and breathing through the breathing equipment training device.
The shell includes a first opening and a second opening. The first opening is configured to be
inserted into a breathing opening in a mask to form a connection with the breathing opening of
the mask, and the second opening is configured to be exposed to ambient air. The shell further
includes a pin located within the inner cavity of the shell along an axis between the first and
second openings and positioned proximate to the second opening. The pin is configured to hold
the diaphragm in position laterally between the first and second openings and to guide the
diaphragm along the axis between the first and second openings. The diaphragm is positioned in
an inner cavity of the shell about the second opening. The diaphragm is configured to impede
airflow into the shell through the second opening and to traverse along the axis between the first
and second openings.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0033]      The various figures and embodiments used to describe the principles of the present
disclosure in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in
any way to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that
the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any type of suitably-arranged
device or system.
[0034]      Various embodiments of the present disclosure recognize and take into account that,
for safety reasons, people needing to use breathing equipment, such as, for example, firemen,
                                                 -5-

construction workers, hazardous material response personnel, military personnel, underwater
divers, etc., should first train with the equipment. For example, to preserve air supply, an SCBA
utilizes on demand breathing. This means that the air flow does not continuously flow into the
mask of the wearer of the SCBA. The wearer must manually suck into their mask in order to
retrieve air from their air supply. Oftentimes, the amount of force that needs to be used to suck
air into the air supply is substantial and/or not common for someone absent specific training.
[0035]       Various embodiments of the present disclosure further recognize and take into
account that use of air or oxygen tanks in the training of personnel to operate breathing
equipment is costly.      For example, training a person to breathe and suck properly with the
breathing equipment can waste air in the tank when the ambient air is perfectly breathable.
Accordingly, various embodiments of the present disclosure provide a breathing equipment
training device and method that allow people to train to use breathing equipment without needing
to have an air tank.
[0036]       FIG. 1 illustrates a breathing equipment training device 100 in accordance with
various embodiments of the present disclosure.          In this illustrative embodiment, breathing
equipment training device 100 includes a cylindrically-shaped shell with a first set of openings
105 or holes designed to allow air to flow into a mask (e.g., mask 900 in FIG. 9) of an operator
of breathing equipment, such as an SCBA.            For example, the breathing equipment training
device 100 may take the place of a regulator which is attached to the mask to regulate or
otherwise control the flow of air into the mask. Breathing equipment training device 100 also
includes a raised surface with a pair of flanges 110 that protrude from the breathing equipment
training device 100. The flanges 110 are configured to be rotatably inserted into a slot or groove
in the opening in the mask to couple or mate the breathing equipment training device 100 to the
                                                   -6-

mask. Breathing equipment training device 100 also includes a latch 115 which locks or fixes
the breathing equipment training device 100 to the mask to deter or prevent the breathing
equipment training device 100 from rotating inside the opening of the mask and becoming
dislodged or disconnected. In this example embodiment, the shell of the breathing equipment
training device 100 is a single component, one piece that is not segmentable except through
cutting or otherwise destroying the shell. For example, the shell may be a molded plastic or
other composite material.
[0037]      FIG. 2 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a shell for the breathing equipment training
device illustrated in FIG. 1. In this illustrative embodiment, the shell 200 is shown opened along
the cross section denoted by line AA in FIG 1. As illustrated, the shell 200 has a second set of
openings 205 or holes seen in the bottom of the shell 200. A raised ring 210 surrounds the
second set of openings 205 in the shell 200.           Though illustrated with four slot-shaped or
circularly-shaped openings or holes, the first and second set of openings 105 and 205 may
include any number of different openings or holes of any number of different shapes.
[0038]      Shell 200 further includes pins 215 which are adapted to receive and hold a
diaphragm or valve in place over the second set of openings 205. In this illustrative example,
shell 200 does not include a diaphragm or valve as is included in the breathing equipment
training device 100. An example diaphragm or valve is depicted in FIG. 8 and illustrated in a
bottom portion of the breathing equipment training device 100 in FIG. 7.           The diaphragm or
valve covers the second set of openings 205 and is made of a flexible material so as to impede or
resist (but not completely block) the flow of air and other fluids through the second set of
openings 205.      For example, the diaphragm or valve may be made from rubber, plastic,
polyurethane, a composite material, etc.
                                                   -7-

[0039]      In this manner, when attached to a mask, the breathing equipment training device 100
impedes or resists the flow of air into the mask, simulating usage of breathing equipment using
on-demand breathing.        Different types of diaphragms or valves having different levels of
flexibility or resistance to air may be used to simulate, manage, and/or tune different levels of
sucking or inhaling that may be required to operate the on-demand breathing equipment. For
example, progressively stiffer diaphragms or valves may be inserted into the shell 200 of the
breathing equipment training device 100 over time to increase the breathing strength and
conditioning of the operator. Additionally, the tightness or snugness with which the diaphragm
or valve fits within the shell 200 may be adjusted to simulate, manage, and/or tune different
levels of resistance by, for example, increasing or decreasing a width of the diaphragm or valve
and/or the shell 200.
[0040]      FIG. 3 illustrates a top view of shell 200 for breathing equipment training device 100
in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this view, the flanges 110,
latch 115, and first set of openings 105 are seen.
[0041]      FIG. 4 illustrates a bottom view of shell 200 for a breathing equipment training
device 100 in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure.          In this view,
second set of openings 205 are seen, and through the second set of openings 205, the first set of
openings 105 can be seen. In FIGs. 3 and 4, just the shell 200 is present. The diaphragm or
valve is not present inside the shell 200. As can be seen, without the diaphragm or valve, air can
freely pass through the second set of openings 205 into the shell 200 and out the first set of
openings 105. While the terms "top" and "bottom" are used for the convenience of the reader,
any side of the breathing equipment training device 100 may be the "top", "bottom", or "side" of
the device 100 based on the orientation of the device 100 and the perspective of the viewer.
                                                 -8-

[0042]       FIG. 5 illustrates a side view of a breathing equipment training device 100 in
accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. As illustrated, the flanges 110
protrude out from the raised surface of the breathing equipment training device 100 to connect,
seal, or otherwise attach the breathing equipment training device 100 to a mask for breathing
equipment.
[0043]       FIG. 6 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a shell 200 for the breathing equipment
training device 100 illustrated in FIG. 5. In this illustrative embodiment, the shell 200 is seen
opened along the cross section denoted by line BB in FIG 5. FIG. 6 also illustrates an important
concept of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure that the diameter of the ellipse or
circle 220 defining the first set of openings 105 (shown in FIG. 1) is smaller than the ellipse or
circle 225 defining the second set of openings 205 (shown in FIG. 2).           For example, this
configuration simulates a respirator that would be attached to the mask of an SCBA.
Additionally, the larger diameter of the second set of openings 205 allows for more surface area
for air to enter the mask, which improves the customization of simulating on-demand breathing.
For example, the larger surface area of the second set of openings 205 allows for openings in the
second set of openings 205 to be larger and allow for more air to enter the shell 200, which
allows for the customization of the shell 200 to more closely simulate the on-demand breathing
associated with a respirator of an SCBA.
[0044]       FIG. 7 is an image of the breathing equipment training device 100 with a top portion
removed. In this illustrative embodiment, diaphragm or valve 700 is seen present inside the shell
200 of the device 100, because the top portion of the device 100 has been removed for
illustration purposes. Diaphragm or valve 700 covers the second set of openings 205 (not seen in
this view) in the bottom of the device 100. As illustrated, the diaphragm or valve 700 tapers
                                                  -9-

outwardly towards the second set of openings 205.      In this configuration, a strong sucking or
inhaling action away from the second set of openings 205 by the operator of the device 100 can
cause the tapered portions of the diaphragm or valve 700 to deform or bend slightly to allow the
flow of air into the device 100 around the diaphragm or valve 700.             In this illustrative
embodiment, blowing or exhaling into the device 100 towards the second set of openings 205
(e.g., exhaling) may be much harder than sucking (e.g., inhaling) given the orientation and
tapering of the diaphragm or valve 700 in the shell 200.
[0045]       FIG. 8 illustrates a diaphragm 800 insertable in the shell 200 for the breathing
equipment training device 100 in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. As illustrated, the
diaphragm 800 is circularly shaped to cover the second set of openings 205 in the shell (not
present in this view). The diaphragm 800 tapers in width from the center to the edges of the
diaphragm 800. The diaphragm 800 also includes a ring 805 near and/or along the outer bottom
edge of the diaphragm 800. This ring 805 acts as a seal and is matched to seat on or around the
ring 210 in the shell 200. In this manner, the ring 805 on the diaphragm 800 and the ring in the
shell 200 operate to provide substantially uniform resistance to breathing when operated to
consistently and accurately simulate resistance provided by on-demand breathing equipment.
While diaphragm 800, ring 805, and ring 210 are depicted as circular, any shape may be used
(e.g., ellipse, oval, square, rectangular, etc.).
[0046]       FIG. 9 illustrates a mask 900 for an SCBA, which may be utilized in implementing
various embodiments of the present disclosure. The mask 900 is designed to be worn over the
head and face of the operator to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth of the operator in hazardous
environments and/or in environments where breathable ambient air is not present.        Mask 900
                                                  -10-

includes a breathing opening 905 matched to be connected to a regulator or the breathing
equipment training device 100 of the present disclosure.
[0047]      FIG. 10A illustrates another example of a breathing equipment training device 1000
in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, breathing equipment
training device 1000 may be an example implementation of the breathing equipment training
device 100 adapted to be inserted into a different type of mask than breathing equipment training
device 100. While FIGs. 1, 10A, and 11 A illustrate different examples of a breathing equipment
training device adapted for use with a particular type of mask, any number of adaptations may be
made to the area proximate to the first set of openings 105 to adapt the breathing equipment
training device 100 to be inserted into or attached to any number of commercially-available
masks.
[0048]       In this illustrative embodiment, breathing equipment training device 1000 includes a
cylindrically-shaped shell 1002 with a first set of openings 1005 or holes in a first opening
designed to allow air to flow into a mask (e.g., mask 900 in FIG. 9) of an operator of breathing
equipment, such as an SCBA. Breathing equipment training device 1000 also includes flanges
1010 attached to latches 1015, respectively. The flanges 1010 are configured to be inserted into
or over slots, grooves, or protrusions, respectively, in the opening in the mask to couple or mate
the breathing equipment training device 1000 to the mask. The latches 1015 are depressible to
allow the flanges 1010 to be inserted into or removed from the mask for locking or fixing the
breathing equipment training device 1000 to the mask. Once attached to the mask, the latches
1015 are also depressible to remove the breathing equipment training device 1000 from the
mask.
                                                -11-

[0049]       FIG. 1OB illustrates a cross-sectional view of the breathing equipment training device
1000 illustrated in FIG. 1OA. In this illustrative embodiment, the breathing equipment training
device 1000 is seen opened along the cross section denoted by line CC in FIG. 10A.                  As
illustrated, the shell 1002 has a second set of openings 1020 seen in the bottom of the shell 1002.
A ring 1025 surrounds the second set of openings 1020 in the shell 1002 and tapers upwardly
toward the first set of openings 1005. Shell 1002 further includes pins 1030, which are adapted
to receive and hold the diaphragm or valve 1035 in place over the second set of openings 1020.
The diaphragm or valve 1035 may be one example of the diaphragm or valve 700 in FIG. 7.
[0050]       In this illustrative embodiment, in addition to and/or in lieu of the ways of simulating,
managing, and/or tuning different levels of resistance discussed above, different levels of
inhalation and/or exhalation resistance may be achieved in breathing equipment training device
1000 by changing the distance between the surface of the shell 1002 proximate the second set of
openings 1020 and the diaphragm or valve 1035. For example, the closer the diaphragm or valve
1035 is to the surface of the shell 1002 proximate the second set of openings 1020 the greater the
inhalation and/or exhalation resistance becomes. In another example, the ring 1025 may taper
inwardly or outwardly as the ring 1025 extends from the surface of the shell 1002 proximate the
second set of openings 1020. In this manner, changing the distance between the surface of the
shell 1002 proximate the second set of openings 1020 and the diaphragm or valve 1035 allows
for adjustment and/or tuning of the tightness or looseness between the ring 1025 and the outer
edge of the diaphragm or valve 1035, which also allows for additional or alternative ways of
simulating, managing, and/or tuning different levels of inhalation and/or exhalation resistance by
the breathing equipment training device 1000. In these examples, the diaphragm or valve 1035
is positioned about the second set of openings 1020, in that the diaphragm or valve 1035
                                                  -12-

controls, manages, resists, and/or impedes the flow of air into and out of the second set of
openings 1020.
[0051]      FIG. 10B also illustrates that the diameter of the ellipse or circle 1040 defining the
first set of openings 1005 is smaller than the ellipse or circle 1045 defining the second set of
openings 1020.
[0052]      FIG. 11 A illustrates another example of a breathing equipment training device 1100
in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, breathing equipment
training device 1100 may be an example implementation of the breathing equipment training
device 100 or 1000 adapted to be inserted into a different type of mask than breathing equipment
training device 100 or 1000.       In this illustrative embodiment, breathing equipment training
device 1100 includes a cylindrically-shaped shell 1102 with a first set of openings 1105 in a first
opening designed to allow air to flow into a mask (e.g., mask 900 in FIG. 9) of an operator using
breathing equipment, such as an SCBA. Breathing equipment training device 1100 also includes
flanges 1110 attached to latches 1115, respectively.       The flanges 1110 are configured to be
inserted into or over slots, grooves, or protrusions, respectively, in the opening in the mask to
couple or mate the breathing equipment training device 1100 to the mask. The latches 1115 are
depressible to allow the flanges 1110 to be inserted into or removed from the mask for locking or
fixing the breathing equipment training device 1100 to the mask. Once attached to the mask, the
latches 1115 are also depressible to remove the breathing equipment training device 1100 from
the mask.
[0053]      FIG. 11 B illustrates a cross-sectional view of the breathing equipment training device
1100 illustrated in FIG. 11 A. In this illustrative embodiment, the breathing equipment training
device 1100 is seen opened along the cross section denoted by line DD in FIG. 11A.               As
                                                  -13-

illustrated, the shell 1102 has a second set of openings 1120 seen in the bottom of the shell 1102.
A ring 1125 surrounds the second set of openings 1120 in the shell 1102 and tapers upwardly
toward the first set of openings 1105. Shell 1102 further includes pins 1130, which are adapted
to receive and hold the diaphragm or valve 1135 in place over the second set of openings 1120.
The diaphragm or valve 1135 may be one example of the diaphragm or valve 700 in FIG. 7.
[0054]       In this illustrative embodiment, in addition to and/or in lieu of the ways of simulating,
managing, and/or tuning different levels of resistance discussed above, different levels of
inhalation and/or exhalation resistance may be achieved in breathing equipment training device
1100 by changing the distance between the surface of the shell 1102 proximate the second set of
openings 1120 and the diaphragm or valve 1135. For example, the closer the diaphragm or valve
1135 is to the surface of the shell 1102 proximate the second set of openings 1120 the greater the
inhalation and/or exhalation resistance becomes. In another example, the ring 1125 may taper
inwardly or outwardly as the ring 1125 extends from the surface of the shell 1102 proximate the
second set of openings 1120. In this manner, changing the distance between the surface of the
shell 1102 proximate the second set of openings 1120 and the diaphragm or valve 1135 allows
for adjustment and/or tuning of the tightness or looseness between the ring 1125 and the outer
edge of the diaphragm or valve 1135, which also allows for additional or alternative ways of
simulating, managing, and/or tuning different levels of inhalation and/or exhalation resistance by
the breathing equipment training device 1100. In these examples, the diaphragm or valve 1135
is positioned about the second set of openings 1120, in that the diaphragm or valve 1135
controls, manages, resists, and/or impedes the flow of air into and out of the second set of
openings 1120.
                                                  -14-

[0055]      FIG. 11 B also illustrates that the diameter of the ellipse or circle 1140 defining the
first set of openings 1105 is smaller than the ellipse or circle 1145 defining the second set of
openings 1120.
[0056]      Embodiments of the present disclosure also include a method of training to use
breathing equipment.    In addition to the description above, the method includes attaching the
breathing equipment training device 100 to a mask (e.g., mask 900 in FIG. 9) of an operator
using breathing equipment, for example, an SCBA.          The method further includes breathing
through the mask 900 and the breathing equipment training device 100 to train for the on
demand breathing experienced using certain types of breathing equipment.          For example, the
training may include performing exercises to increase the stamina of the wearer of the breathing
equipment training device.
[0057]      In one or more embodiments, the breathing equipment training device 100 may be a
molded plastic device that looks, feels, and weighs about the same as an SCBA regulator. For
example, the breathing equipment training device 100 may connect to and secure to the face
piece the same as a regulator, and the interior components have a pressure demand - type of
inspiration and exhalation valve or components that require the same deliberate breathing efforts
as a regular SCBA, without needing to use the air supply of an SCBA.
[0058]      Most training for use of an SCBA does not require the trainee to need a supply of air,
though it is beneficial in realistic training. For example, while wearing an SCBA, a user may
need to perform tasks that have a high level of exertion, while the on-demand breathing from the
SCBA can make breathing and oxygen supply more difficult than breathing without the SCBA.
Embodiments of the present disclosure give the trainee all the physical sensations and demands
of being attached to an on-demand air supply without actually using an air supply. This
                                                 -15-

eliminates the need for time consuming, labor-intensive, and costly air refilling support
operations, while allowing individuals to be exposed to the demands of SCBA breathing to
increase preparedness and stamina.
[0059]      While various embodiments are described as use of the device 100 in connection with
training to use equipment such as an SCBA, in other embodiments, the device 100 may be used
in connection with a mask for the purposes of increasing stamina or endurance unrelated to use
of equipment such as an SCBA, such as, for example, fitness, cardiovascular, or high-altitude
training.  In other examples, the device may be used to simulate underwater breathing.        For
example, the SCBA may be a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) and the
device 100 may be used to simulate and train for on-demand breathing experienced underwater
with SCUBA equipment.
[0060]      FIG. 12A illustrates a breathing equipment training device 1200 in accordance with
various embodiments of the present disclosure. The device 1200 can be a further embodiment of
the device 100. In this illustrative embodiment, breathing equipment training device 1200
includes a cylindrically shaped shell 1201 with a pair of flanges 1210 on either side of the shell
1201, a depressible latch 1215, and a release valve 1240. A first set of openings 1205 and a
second set of openings 1207 are not visible in FIG. 12A but are shown in FIGS. 12B and 12C,
respectively. The first set of openings 1205 are designed to allow air to flow into a mask (e.g.,
mask 900 in FIG. 9) of an operator of breathing equipment, such as an SCBA. For example, the
breathing equipment training device 1200 may take the place of a regulator which is attached to
the mask 900 to regulate or otherwise control the flow of air into the mask 900. The second set
of openings 1207 is configured to allow air and/or other fluids to pass into the shell 1201.
                                               -16-

[0061]        The exterior of breathing equipment training device 1200 includes a raised surface
with a pair of flanges 1210 that protrude from the breathing equipment training device 1200.
The flanges 1210 are configured to be rotatably inserted into a slot or groove in the opening in
the mask 900 to couple or mate the breathing equipment training device 1200 to the mask 900.
Although shown in this embodiment with a pair of flanges 1210, the raised surface of breathing
equipment training device 1200 may include any number of flanges 1210.             The exterior of
breathing equipment training device 1200 also includes a depressible latch 1215. The depressible
latch 1215 is configured to lock or fix the breathing equipment training device 1200 to the mask
900 to prevent the breathing equipment training device 1200 from rotating inside the opening of
the mask 900 and becoming dislodged or disconnected. Although shown in this embodiment
with one depressible latch 1215, various embodiments may include one or more than one
depressible latch 1215. The exterior of breathing equipment training device 1200 also includes a
release valve 1240. The release valve 1240 is configured to allow a user to breathe normally
after it is rotated about a central axis.
[0062]        FIG. 12B illustrates a top view of a shell 1201 for a breathing equipment training
device in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this view, the first
set of openings 1205, flanges 1210, the depressible latch 1215, a set of diaphragm holes 1230,
the release valve 1240, and a first opening 1250 are seen. The first opening 1250 is a first ellipse
or circle configured to be inserted into a breathing opening of a mask, e.g., a mask 900 shown in
FIG. 9. The first opening 1250 contains the first set of openings 1205, which is configured to
allow air or other fluids to pass through from the shell 1201 to the inside of the mask, e.g., a
mask 900 shown in FIG. 9. Though illustrated here with four slot-shaped openings or holes, the
first set of openings 1205 may include any number of different openings or holes of any number
                                                -17-

of different shapes. The set of diaphragm holes 1230 are small holes in a diaphragm 1350. The
set of diaphragm holes 1230 and the diaphragm 1350 are discussed in greater detail in the
description of FIG. 13A. While the term "top" is used for the convenience of the reader, any
side of the breathing equipment training device 1200 may be the "top," "bottom," or "side" of
the device 1200 based on the orientation of the device 1200 and the perspective of the viewer.
[0063]      FIG. 12C illustrates a bottom view of shell 1201 for a breathing equipment training
device 1200 in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this view, a
second set of openings 1207, the depressible latch 1215, the release valve 1240, and a second
opening 1260 is seen. The second opening 1260 is a second ellipse or circle configured to allow
air and/or other fluids to flow into the shell 1201 through the second set of openings 1207. The
second set of openings 1207 is configured to allow air and/or other fluids to freely pass through
into the shell 1201. Though illustrated here with four slot-shaped openings or holes, the second
set of openings 1207 may include any number of different openings or holes of any number of
different shapes. While the term "bottom" is used for the convenience of the reader, any side of
the breathing equipment training device 1200 may be the "top", "bottom", or "side" of the device
1200 based on the orientation of the device 1200 and the perspective of the viewer.
[0064]      FIG. 13A illustrates a cross-sectional view of a shell for the breathing equipment
training device 1200 illustrated in FIG. 12A in the exhalation position.        In this illustrative
embodiment, the interior of shell 1201 is shown opened along the cross section denoted by line
AA in FIG. 12A. In this illustrative embodiment, the device 1200 includes a diaphragm 1350, a
pin 1360, a base 1370, and a gap 1380.
[0065]      The pin 1360 is configured to guide the diaphragm 1350 between the first set of
openings 1205 and the second set of openings 1207 within the shell 1201. In this embodiment,
                                                -18-

the pin 1360 is cylindrically shaped with a hollow interior to reduce weight. The pin 1360 also
narrowly tapers as it extends away from the base 1370 so as to guide the diaphragm 1350 toward
the base during exhalation.     The diaphragm 1350 is configured to impede or resist (but not
completely block) the flow of air and/or other fluids through the second set of openings 1207 and
made of a flexible material sufficient to accomplish this function. For example, the diaphragm
1350 may be made from rubber, plastic, polyurethane, a composite material, etc. The diaphragm
1350 is configured to traverse along an axis throughout the shell 1201, guided by the pin 1360.
In this embodiment, the pin 1360 does not extend to top of inner cavity 1325 of the shell 1201.
The axial length of the pin 1360 serves to prevent or inhibit the diaphragm 1350 from moving
laterally within the shell 1201. For example, as shown in FIG. 13B discussed in greater detail
below, the pin 1360 guides the diaphragm 1350 along the axis of the pin 1360 with sufficient axil
length to maintain the lateral position diaphragm 1350 between the first and second sets of
openings 1205 and 1207.
[0066]      In this embodiment, the diaphragm 1350 is shown in the exhalation position,
proximate to the base 1370.      When the diaphragm 1350 occupies the exhalation position, as
shown here, an inner ring 1390 of the diaphragm 1350 sits flush against the base 1370 about the
second opening 1260.       Inner ring 1390 serves to raise the majority of the surface of the
diaphragm 1350 proximate the base 1370, thereby allowing for additional air to flow through the
second set of openings 1207. When the diaphragm 1350 sits flush against the base 1370, the
second set of openings 1207 is obscured or partially blocked by the position of the diaphragm
1350. Thereby, the diaphragm 1350 significantly impedes or resists the flow of ambient air or
other fluids through the second set of openings 1207.
                                               -19-

[0067]      In this embodiment, when attached to a mask, the breathing equipment training
device 1200 impedes or resists the flow of air into the mask, simulating usage of breathing
equipment using on-demand breathing. Even in this embodiment, the diaphragm 1350 does not
completely impede the flow of air into the mask. In one embodiment, throughout the entire
circumference of the interior of the shell 1201, a small gap 1380 of between approximately 0.008
in (0.203 mm) and approximately 0.014 in (0.356 mm) is present between the exterior of the
diaphragm 1350 and the interior of the shell 1201. In one embodiment, the cumulative area of
the gap 1380 between the exterior of the diaphragm 1350 and the interior of the shell 1201 (that
is, the area encompassing the entire circumference of the diaphragm 1350) may be between
                                                                     2             2
approximately 0.001 in2 (0.645 mm2 ) and approximately 0.25 in (161.29 mm ). In another
embodiment, the entire gap 1380 between the exterior of the diaphragm 1350 and the interior of
                                                        2            2                           *2
the shell 1201 may be between approximately 0.04 in (25.806 mm ) and approximately 0.09 in
(58.064 mm2). These values can be adjusted to further refine the level of breathing resistance
desired for a particular application.
[0068]      In addition to the gap 1380 between the exterior of the diaphragm 1350 and the shell
1201, the diaphragm 1350 contains small holes 1230 configured to allow air and/or other fluids
to pass through the diaphragm 1350. In one illustrative example, the diaphragm 1350 has three
holes 1230 evenly spaced 1200 apart and equidistant between the interior and exterior edges of
the diaphragm. In this embodiment, each hole is approximately 0.20 in (5.08 mm) in diameter.
In this embodiment, the diaphragm 1350 contains a total area of approximately 0.094 in 2 (60.645
mm2) of space for air or other fluids to pass through. In another embodiment, the diaphragm
1350 contains more than three holes 1230, each comprised of a diameter less than approximately
0.20 in (5.08 mm), which results in a total area of approximately 0.094 in 2(60.645 mm 2 ) of space
                                                -20-

for air and/or other fluids to pass through. In another embodiment, the diaphragm 1350 contains
fewer than three holes 1230, each comprised of a diameter greater than approximately 0.20 in
(5.08 mm), which results in a total area of approximately 0.094 in2 (60.645 mm 2 ) of space for air
and/or other fluids to pass through. In other embodiments, any number of holes, hole diameter,
and total area for passage can be selected to define the amount of breathing resistance desired for
a particular application.
[0069]       FIG. 13B illustrates a cross-sectional view of a shell for the breathing equipment
training device 1200 illustrated in FIG. 12A in the inhalation position.        In this illustrative
embodiment, the shell 1201 is shown opened along the cross section denoted by line AA in FIG.
12A.     In this illustrative embodiment, the device 1200 from FIG. 13A is shown with the
diaphragm 1350 in a raised position due to inhalation by a user of the device 1200.
[0070]       For example. when the breathing equipment training device 1200 is connected, or
otherwise attached to, a mask (e.g., mask 900 as shown in FIG. 9), a user may breathe through
the mask 900 to simulate a scenario in which a mask 900, for example, an SCBA, may need to be
worn for protection. In one embodiment, the diaphragm 1350 begins in the exhalation position
as shown in FIG. 13A. As a user inhales through the breathing equipment training device 1200,
the sucking motion of the user's inhalation causes the diaphragm to traverse along the pin 1360
through the shell 1201 toward the first set of openings 1205. Once the user has finished the
inhalation process, he or she will then exhale. The air propelled by the user's exhalation causes
the diaphragm 1350 to traverse away from the first set of openings 1205 and along the pin 1360
toward the base 1370 and second set of openings 1207. Once the exhalation process is complete,
the diaphragm returns to the exhalation position shown in FIG. 13A.            The return of the
                                                -21-

diaphragm to the exhalation position shown in FIG. 13A concludes one complete breathing cycle
by a user.
[0071]       In various embodiments, as illustrated in FIGs. 13A and 13B, the inner cavity 1325 of
the shell 1201 in which the diaphragm 1350 resides tapers from the second set of openings 1207
toward the first opening 1250. Similarly, the outer circumference of the diaphragm 1350 may
also taper at a same or different rate. For example, in some embodiments the taper of the inner
cavity 1325 of the shell 1201 may be greater than that of the outer circumference of the
diaphragm 1350, such that the gap 1380 is reduced (or eliminated) during a breathing cycle (e.g.,
as illustrated in FIG. 13B). In this manner, greater resistance is provided by the diaphragm 1350
in the inhalation position than in the exhalation position. For example, the increase in breathing
resistance during a breathing cycle may force or encourage a user to breathe more slowly or
control their breathing despite the resistance so as to obtain more air during a cycle and use
fewer breathing cycles.
[0072]       Other advantages of these embodiments include that the sliding mechanism of the
diaphragm 1350 operates to simulate the sound and feel of a traditional breathing equipment
device used by, for example, firemen in a potentially hazardous situation.        Specifically, one
familiar with breathing equipment, e.g., an SCBA, will recognize the clicking sounds produced
when the diaphragm 1350 contacts the first set of openings 1205 during the inhalation process
and/or contacts the base 1370 at the conclusion of the exhalation process, which is similar to the
clicking sound produced by a traditional breathing equipment device that would be used in a
potentially hazardous situation.
[0073]       Another advantage of this embodiment is the simplicity of the design. The design of
this embodiment results in a durable product because the diaphragm 1350 is one of only a few
                                                -22-

moving parts of the breathing equipment training device 1200.         Fewer moving parts yields a
lesser likelihood of mechanical failures that would result in inoperability of the breathing
equipment training device 1200.        In addition, the simplicity of this design results in a cost
effective manufacturing process.        Because the diaphragm 1350 may be made of common
industrial products, such as rubber, plastic, polyurethane, a composite material, etc., manufacture
of the breathing equipment training device 1200 is not overly burdensome.
[0074]       FIG. 14A illustrates a side view of another example of a breathing equipment training
device in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure.              For example,
breathing equipment training device 1400 may be an example implementation of the breathing
equipment training device 1200 adapted to be inserted into a different type of mask 900 than
breathing equipment training device 1200.         While FIGs. 14A-15B illustrate examples of a
breathing equipment training device adapted for use with a particular type of mask, any number
of adaptations may be made to the area proximate to the first set of openings 1405 to adapt the
breathing equipment training device 1400 to be inserted into or attached to any number of
commercially-available masks.
[0075]       In this illustrative embodiment, breathing equipment training device 1400 includes a
cylindrically shaped shell 1401 with flanges 1410, depressible latches 1415, and a release valve
1440. A first set of openings 1405 and a second set of openings 1407 are not visible in this
illustration. The first set of openings 1405, as seen in FIG. 14B, are designed to allow air to flow
into a mask (e.g., mask 900 in FIG. 9) of an operator of breathing equipment, such as an SCBA.
For example, the breathing equipment training device 1400 may take the place of a regulator
which is attached to the mask to regulate or otherwise control the flow of air into the mask 900.
                                                 -23-

The second set of openings 1407 is configured to allow air or other fluids to pass into the shell
1401.
[0076]       As illustrated, the flanges 1410 protrude out from the raised surface of the breathing
equipment training device 1400 and are configured to connect, seal, or otherwise attach the
breathing equipment training device 1400 to a mask for breathing equipment (e.g., mask 900 in
FIG. 9). The flanges 1410 are coupled to depressible latches 1415, respectively. The flanges
1410 are configured to be inserted into or over slots, grooves, or protrusions, respectively, in the
opening in the mask 900 to couple or mate the breathing equipment training device 1400 to the
mask 900. The depressible latches 1415 are depressible to allow the flanges 1410 to be inserted
into or removed from the mask 900 for locking or fixing the breathing equipment training device
1400 to the mask 900. Once attached to the mask 900, the depressible latches 1415 are also
depressible to remove the breathing equipment training device 1400 from the mask 900.
[0077]       FIG. 14B illustrates a top view of a shell 1401 for a breathing equipment training
device 1400 in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this view, a
first set of openings 1405, flanges 1410, depressible latches 1415, a set of diaphragm holes 1430,
the release valve 1440, and a first opening 1450 are seen. Though illustrated here with four slot
shaped openings or holes, the first set of openings 1405 may include any number of different
openings or holes of any number of different shapes.       The first opening 1450 is a first circle
configured to be inserted into a breathing opening in a mask, e.g., a mask 900 shown in FIG. 9.
The set of diaphragm holes 1430 are small holes in a diaphragm 1550. The set of diaphragm
holes 1430 and the diaphragm 1550 are discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 13A.
While the term "top" is used for the convenience of the reader, any side of the breathing
equipment training device 1400 may be the "top," "bottom," or "side" of the breathing
                                                 -24-

equipment training device 1400 based on the orientation of the breathing equipment training
device 1400 and the perspective of the viewer.
[0078]     FIG. 14C illustrates a bottom view of shell 1401 for a breathing equipment training
device 1400 in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this view, a
second set of openings 1407, depressible latches 1415, and the release valve 1440 are shown.
The second set of openings 1407 is configured to allow air or other fluids to pass through into the
shell 1401. Though illustrated here with four slot-shaped openings or holes, the second set of
openings 1407 may include any number of different openings or holes of any number of different
shapes.   While the term "bottom" is used for the convenience of the reader, any side of the
breathing equipment training device 1400 may be the "top", "bottom", or "side" of the breathing
equipment training device 1400 based on the orientation of the breathing equipment training
device 1400 and the perspective of the viewer.
[0079]     FIG. 15A illustrates a cross-sectional view of a shell for the breathing equipment
training device illustrated in FIG. 14A in the exhalation position.            In this illustrative
embodiment, the interior of shell 1401 is seen opened along the cross section denoted by line BB
in FIG. 14A.    In this illustrative embodiment, the breathing equipment training device 1400
includes the flanges 1410, the pair of depressible latches 1415, a diaphragm 1550, a pin 1560, a
base 1570, and a gap 1580. Hidden from view in this FIG. 15A is the first set of openings 1405
and second set of openings 1407. The diaphragm 1550 and pin 1560 in FIG. 15A operates in the
same or similar manner to the diaphragm 1350 in FIG. 13A.
[0080]     However, in these embodiments, the diaphragm 1550 does not include an inner ring
1390. In this manner, the diaphragm 1550, when in the exhalation position, as illustrated in FIG.
15A, sits flush against the inner surface of the base 1570.     Thereby the configuration of the
                                               -25-

breathing equipment training device 1400 is able to provide greater breathing resistance as
desired for a particular application.
[0081]       FIG. 15B illustrates a cross sectional view of a shell for the breathing equipment
training device illustrated in FIG. 14A in the inhalation position. In this illustrative embodiment,
the interior of shell 1401 is seen opened along the cross section denoted by line BB in FIG. 14A.
In this illustrative embodiment, the shell 1401 includes the flanges 1410, the depressible latches
1415, the diaphragm 1550, the pin 1560, and the base 1570. Hidden from view in FIG. 15B is
the first set of openings 1405 and second set of openings 1407. The diaphragm 1550 in FIG.
15B operates in the same or similar manner to the diaphragm 1350 in FIG. 13B, including the
properties of the diaphragm holes 1430 and the gap 1580.
[0082]       Embodiments of the present disclosure also include a method of training to use
breathing equipment.     In addition to the description above, the method includes attaching the
breathing equipment training device 1200 to a mask, e.g. mask 900 of breathing equipment, for
example, an SCBA, via the first opening 1250.        The method further includes a user breathing
through the mask 900 via the attached breathing equipment training device 1200 to train for the
on-demand breathing experienced using certain types of breathing equipment.
[0083]       Most training for use of an SCBA does not require the trainee to need a supply of air,
though it is beneficial in realistic training. For example, while wearing an SCBA, a user may
need to perform tasks that have a high level of exertion, while the on-demand breathing from the
SCBA can make breathing and oxygen supply more difficult than breathing without the SCBA.
Embodiments of the present disclosure give the trainee all the physical sensations and demands
of being attached to an on-demand air supply without actually using an air supply. This
eliminates the need for time consuming, labor-intensive, and costly air refilling support
                                                -26-

operations, while allowing individuals to be exposed to the demands of SCBA breathing to
increase preparedness and stamina.
[0084]      While various embodiments are described as use of the device 1200 in connection
with training to use equipment such as an SCBA, in other embodiments, the device 1200 may be
used in connection with a mask, e.g., mask 900 in FIG. 9, for the purposes of increasing stamina
or endurance unrelated to use of equipment such as an SCBA, such as, for example, fitness,
cardiovascular, or high-altitude training. In other examples, the device may be used to simulate
underwater breathing. For example, the SCBA may be a self-contained underwater breathing
apparatus (SCUBA) and the device 1200 may be used to simulate and train for on-demand
breathing experienced underwater with SCUBA equipment.
