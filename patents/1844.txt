                                                    ABSTRACT
This invention is directed to an electronic device with an embedded
authentication             system      for     restricting             access         to    device         resources.
The authentication system may include one or more sensors operative
to      detect       biometric        information             of     a    user.        The       sensors         may     be
positioned             in   the      device         such        that         the      sensors            may      detect
appropriate            biometric       information as               the user          operates           the device,
without         requiring         the    user      to     perform          a     step      for      providing           the
biometric          information          (e.g.,       embedding           a    fingerprint             sensor        in   an
input       mechanism          instead        of    providing           a     fingerprint              sensor        in    a
separate          part     of    the     device        housing).            In      some       embodiments,             the
authentication              system       may      be      operative            to     detect          a    visual        or
temporal         pattern       of   inputs       to     authenticate              a   user.       In     response        to
authenticating,              a   user     may      access        restricted             files,         applications
 (e.g.,       applications           purchased           by     the      user),         or      settings          (e.g.,
application settings such as contacts or saved game profile).

   Cross-Reference to Related Application
 5 [0001]      This application relates to U.S.           Provisional Patent
   Application No.    60/995,200,   filed September 24,         2007, which
   is  incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
   [0001A]     Also incorporated herein by reference, in its
   entirety, is PCT/US2008/075738        (published as WO 2009/042392),

   Background of the Invention
   [0002]      This invention is directed to electronic devices
   with embedded authentication systems.
   [0003]      Electronic devices, and in particular portable
 5 electronic devices, are used to store personal information. For
   example, users may use cellular telephones,              PDAs, smart phones,
   or other electronic devices to store contacts, e-mail, calendar
   information, documents,     and other information used by the user.
   While this information may not necessarily be confidential, users
 o may desire that at least some of that          information be unavailable
   to other people. One approach for preventing unauthorized people
   from accessing and viewing the user's personal information may be
   to require users of the electronic device to provide a password
   or pass code prior to enabling device functions or accessing
25 device resources. For example, the electronic device may require
   a user to enter a four number or four letter pin prior to
   displaying the device home screen        (e.g., a spring board) or
   menus.    As another example, an accessory device for detecting a
   user's fingerprint or for scanning a user's retina may be coupled
30 to the device such that the user must first show an authorized
   fingerprint or retina before receiving access to the device.
   [0004a]       Reference  to   any  prior   art      in   the  specification       is
   not  an   acknowledgment   or  suggestion      that     this   prior       art forms
   part of   the common general    knowledge in        any jurisdiction or         that

   this     prior       art       could      reasonably            be    expected         to    be     understood,
   regarded as           relevant, and/or combined with other pieces                                        of prior
   art by a skilled person in the art.

25 or     more     programs          configured           to    be    executed          by   the      one     or    more
   processors,           the      one     or   more      programs          including         instructions             for
   performing the method of paragraph                                [0004b].
    [0004d]             According to a third aspect of the invention there is
   provided           a     non-transitory                 computer-readable                   storage          medium
30 storing one or more programs                           configured to be executed by one or
   more     processors            of    an    electronic           device        with     a   display         and     one

   or   more   image       sensors,      the     one    or     more     programs      including
   instructions for performing the method of paragraph                          [0004c].
   [0005]          Methods,       electronic        devices        and   computer       readable
   media   for    authenticating          a    user   of     an     electronic     device     are
 5 provided.       In     some     embodiments,          an     electronic        device      may
   seamlessly       authenticate         a    user.      The      electronic      device      may
   receive    an   input     from    a   user,     the    input      provided    by    an   input
   mechanism     of    the   electronic        device.      The     electronic     device     may
   detect identification information as the user provides the input
 0 from one    or more       sensors     embedded       in    or    adjacent    to   the    input
   mechanism.     The     electronic       device     may     authenticate       the    user   by
   comparing        the      detected          identification            information         with
   identification        information        stored     in    a    library    of   the    device.
   For   example,       the    sensor     may    include        a    sensor   for    detecting
 5 features of a user's skin, or features underneath a user's skin.
   The sensor may be embedded              in   at least one of a touch              screen,    a
   button    (e.g.,     of   a   keyboard      or mouse),         device    housing      near  an
   input   mechanism        (e.g.,     laptop     housing       near     keyboard),       or  any
   other suitable location.
 0 [0006]          In     some     embodiments,          the      electronic      device      may
   determine that a user is aligned with a sensing component of the
   device   without       directing       the    user      to   align     with    the     sensing
   component.     For example,         the    sensing     component       may be    positioned
   such   that    the    sensing      region     of   the      sensor     includes     expected
25 positions     of    the   user    while      the   user      operates     the    electronic
   device.    The    sensor     may   detect     one    or more       biometric     attributes
   of  the   user     (e.g.,     facial     or    eye    features)       using    the    sensing
   component.       For     example       the      sensor       may     include      a     camera

                                                            -5
   device       may      be     operative        to     identify           a   pattern          of   the     detected
   inputs,         and      to     compare        the      identified             pattern          with     patterns
   stored        in     memory        to     authenticate              the     user.        The      patterns       may
   include        temporal         patterns         (e.g.,         related         to    the      delays      between
 5 consecutive               inputs),          visual            patterns              (e.g.,         related          to
   attributes           of      several       options          selected          by     the      user    or     inputs
   provided           by       the      user),         or        combinations               of       these.       Upon
   authenticating               the    user,      the      electronic            device        may     provide       the
   user with access to restricted electronic device resources.
 0 [0008a]               As     used     herein,         except         where        the      context        requires
   otherwise,           the     term     "comprise"           and     variations           of     the   term,      such
   as     "comprising",             "comprises"           and       "comprised",             are     not     intended
   to exclude further additives, components, integers or steps.

       Detailed Description
 10    [0024]     An electronic device having an authentication
       system for restricting access to electronic device
      resources is provided.     Access to any suitable electronic
      device resource may be restricted, including for example
      access to files or data stored on or available to the
15    device.    As another example, access to particular
      applications may be restricted     (e.g., applications
      purchased by particular users, or applications associated
      with administrative tasks or privileges).      As still
      another example, access to personal settings      (e.g.,
20    displayed options, background images, or the icons used
      for applications) may be restricted until the user
      authenticates.
       [0025]     Any suitable authentication system may be
      implemented.     In some embodiments, the authentication
25    system may include a system for detecting biometric
      features or attributes of a user.      For example, the
      electronic device may include a system operative to
      detect and authenticate a user based on features of or
      under a user's skin, such as a finger print, hand print,
30   palm print, knuckle print, blood vessel pattern, or any

                                     -8
       other suitable portion of or under the user's skin.           As
       another example, the electronic device may include a
       system operative to detect and authenticate a user based
       on features of a user's eyes or face, or movements of the
  5    user's eyes.     As still another example, the electronic
       device may include a system operative to detect features
       of a user's ear canal, an odor associated with the user,
       a user's DNA, or any other suitable biometric attribute
      or information associated with a user.
10     [0026]       In some embodiments, the authentication system
      may include a system operative to identify a user based
      on a visual or temporal pattern of inputs provided by the
      user.      For example, the electronic device may display
      several selectable options or shapes forming a visual
15    pattern.      The user may select any suitable predetermined
      subset of displayed options to authenticate.        For
      example, the user may select one or more options that
      have a predetermined attribute      (e.g., size, color, shape
      or contour) in common.      As another example, the user may
20    select one or more options positioned in predetermined
      areas of the display (e.g., independent of the attributes
      of the selected options).      The user may select options
      simultaneously, sequentially, or as a combination of
      these.
25     [0027]       As another example, the user may provide a
      series of inputs at a particular pace or in a particular
      pattern.      For example, the user may select options with a
      particular delay (e.g., pause between two selections).
      Alternatively, the user may provide inputs detected by a
30    sensor (e.g., an accelerometer or a gyroscope) of the

  WO 2009/042392                                   PCT/US2008/075738
                                    -9
       device following a predetermined temporal pattern.        The
       device may detect the inputs from vibrations caused by
       tapping the device or an area adjacent to the device,
       moving the device in a particular manner, or any other
  5    suitable approach for detecting inputs.
        [0028]   The electronic device may provide any suitable
       combination of authentication systems, including for
       example biometric authentication systems and pattern
       based authentication systems, several biometric
 10    authentication systems, or several pattern-based systems.
       In some embodiments, different authentication systems may
      be associated with different resources, such that a user
      may provide authentication information for several
      systems before finally accessing particular restricted
15    resources   (e.g., private or personal information).      The
      electronic device may use any suitable approach for
      selecting which authentication systems to combine.        For
      example, a user may associate several authentication
      systems with particular resources, or the electronic
20    device may instead automatically (e.g., as a default)
      assign particular authentication systems to particular
      resources.
       [0029]    FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an illustrative
      electronic device for use with an authentication system
25    in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.

       omitted   (e.g.,  combine storage 104 and memory 106).          In
       some embodiments, electronic device 100 may include other
       components not combined or included in those shown in
       FIG. 1 (e.g., a display, bus, or input mechanism), or
   5   several instances of the components shown in FIG. 1.              For
       the sake of simplicity, only one of each of the
       components is shown in FIG. 1.
        [0030]     Processor 102 may include any processing
       circuitry operative to control the operations and
 10    performance of electronic device 100. For example,
       processor 100 may be used to run operating system
       applications, firmware applications, media playback
       applications, media editing applications, or any other
      application.      In some embodiments, a processor may drive
 15   a display and process inputs received from a user
       interface.

      more storage mediums including a hard-drive, solid state
      drive, flash memory, permanent memory such as ROM, any
20    other suitable type of storage component, or any
      combination thereof.      Storage 104 may store, for example,
      media data (e.g., music and video files), application
      data (e.g., for implementing functions on device 100),
      firmware, user preference information data (e.g., media
25    playback preferences),     authentication information (e.g.
      libraries of data associated with authorized users),
      lifestyle information data       (e.g., food preferences),
      exercise information data     (e.g.,   information obtained by
      exercise monitoring equipment),       transaction information
30    data (e.g., information such as credit card information),

       wireless connection information data (e.g., information
       that may enable electronic device 100 to establish a
       wireless connection),     subscription information data
       (e.g., information that keeps track of podcasts or
  5    television shows or other media a user subscribes to),
       contact information data (e.g., telephone numbers and
       email addresses),    calendar information data, and any
      other suitable data or any combination thereof.
       [0032]       Memory 106 can include cache memory, semi
10    permanent memory such as RAM, and/or one or more
      different types of memory used for temporarily storing
      data.      In some embodiments, memory 106 can also be used
      for storing data used to operate electronic device
      applications, or any other type of data that may be
15    stored in storage 104.       In some embodiments, memory 106
      and storage 104 may be combined as a single storage
      medium.
       [0033]       Communications circuitry 108 can permit
      device 100 to communicate with one or more servers or
20    other devices using any suitable communications protocol.
      Electronic device 100 may include one more instances of
      communications circuitry 108 for simultaneously
      performing several communications operations using
      different communications networks, although only one is
25    shown in FIG. 1 to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.
      For example, communications circuitry 108 may support Wi
      Fi    (e.g., a 802.11 protocol),   Ethernet, Bluetooth       (which
      is a trademark owned by Bluetooth Sig, Inc.),       radio
      frequency systems, cellular networks      (e.g., GSM, AMPS,

       LTE or any other suitable cellular network or protocol),
       infrared, TCP/IP    (e.g., any of the protocols used in each
       of the TCP/IP layers),    HTTP, BitTorrent, FTP, RTP, RTSP,
       SSH, Voice over IP    (VOIP), any other communications
  5    protocol, or any combination thereof.
        [0034]     Input/output circuitry 110 may be operative to
       convert   (and encode/decode, if necessary) analog signals
       and other signals into digital data.      In some
       embodiments, input/output circuitry can also convert
 10   digital data into any other type of signal, and vice
      versa.     For example, input/output circuitry 110 may
      receive and convert physical contact inputs        (e.g., from a
      multi-touch screen),     physical movements   (e.g., from a
      mouse or sensor), analog audio signals       (e.g., from a
15    microphone),    or any other input.   The digital data can be
      provided to and received from processor 102, storage 104,
      memory 106, or any other component of electronic
      device 100.     Although input/output circuitry 110 is
      illustrated in FIG. 1 as a single component of electronic
20    device 100, several instances of input/output circuitry
      can be included in electronic device 100.
       [0035]      Electronic device 100 may include any suitable
      mechanism or component for allowing a user to provide
      inputs to input/output circuitry 110.       For example,
25    electronic device 100 may include any suitable input
      mechanism, such as for example, a button, keypad, dial, a
      click wheel, or a touch screen.      In some embodiments,
      electronic device 100 may include a capacitive sensing
      mechanism, or a multi-touch capacitive sensing mechanism.

  5   User Interfaces for Touch Sensitive Input Device,"         both
      of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.
       (0036]     In some embodiments, electronic device 100 can
      include specialized output circuitry associated with
      output devices such as, for example, one or more audio
10    outputs.    The audio output may include one or more
      speakers   (e.g., mono or stereo speakers) built into
      electronic device 100, or an audio component that is
      remotely coupled to electronic device 100 (e.g., a
      headset, headphones or earbuds that may be coupled to
15    communications device with a wire or wirelessly).
       [0037]     In some embodiments,   I/O circuitry 110 may
      include display circuitry (e.g., a screen or projection
      system) for providing a display visible to the user.           For
      example, the display circuitry may include a screen
20     (e.g., an LCD screen) that is incorporated in electronics
      device 100.    As another example, the display circuitry
      may include a movable display or a projecting system for
      providing a display of content on a surface remote from
      electronic device 100    (e.g., a video projector).      In some
25    embodiments, the display circuitry can include a
      coder/decoder    (Codec) to convert digital media data into
      analog signals.     For example, the display circuitry (or
      other appropriate circuitry within electronic device 100)
      may include video Codecs, audio Codecs, or any other
30    suitable type of Codec.

        [0038]       The display circuitry also can include display
       driver circuitry, circuitry for driving display drivers,
       or both. The display circuitry may be operative to
       display content (e.g., media playback information,
  5    application screens for applications implemented on the
       electronic device, information regarding ongoing
       communications operations, information regarding incoming
       communications requests, or device operation screens)
      under the direction of processor 102.
10     [0039]        Authentication system 112 may include any
       suitable system or sensor operative to receive or detect
      an input identifying the user of device 100.          For
      example, authentication system 112 may include a skin
      pattern sensing mechanism, an optical system for
15    identifying users based on their facial patterns, eye
      features      (e.g., retinas),  or vein patterns, or any other
      sensor for detecting any other unique biometric feature
      or attribute of a user.        As another example,
      authentication system 112 may be operative to receive
20    secret or confidential entries identifying the user
       (e.g., gestures on the device, or touching a particular
      pattern of objects or colors on a display).        As still
      another example, authentication system 112 may be
      operative to detect particular movements or vibrations of
25    the device caused by the user.        Authentication system 112
      may be combined or embedded in any other element of
      electronic device 112       (e.g., a display or a camera),     or
      use events detected by various sensors of the electronic
      device     (e.g., an accelerometer or proximity sensor).         In

       some embodiments, several types of authentication systems
      may be combined or implemented in the electronic device.
       [0040]     In some embodiments, electronic device 100 may
       include a bus operative to provide a data transfer path
  5    for transferring data to, from, or between control
      processor 102, storage 104, memory 106, communications
      circuitry 108, input/output circuitry 110 authentication
      system 112, and any other component included in the
      electronic device.
10     [0041]    To prevent unauthorized access to data or
      information stored in memory or storage, the electronic
      device may direct an authentication system to identify
      the user and authorize access to requested resources.
      The electronic device may require authorization prior to
15    providing access to any electronic device resource.         In
      some embodiments, the electronic device may require
      different levels of authorization before providing access
      to different applications or different data or files
      associated with different applications.    For example, the
20    electronic device may require a user to satisfy several
      authentication systems prior to providing access to an
      application or data (e.g., a secondary authentication,
      for example using biometrics, in addition to a first or
      initial authentication, for example a pass code used to
25    unlock the device).
      [0042]     FIG. 2 is a schematic view of an illustrative
      display screen of an electronic device in accordance with
      one embodiment of the invention.   Display screen 200 may
      be displayed in response to a user unlocking the
30    electronic device.   Display screen 200 may include

  WO 2009/042392                                    PCT/US2008/075738

       selectable options 210 for accessing various device
       functions.    For example, each option 210 may be
       associated with different applications available on the
       electronic device.    As another example, each option may
  5   be associated with particular data or files available to
       the user.   The electronic device may or may not require
      authentication to access display 200.     For example,
      display 200 may include basic or default applications
      available to the user.     As another example, display 200
10    may include default features available to all users.
       [0043]     In some embodiments, one or more applications
      may provide access to or use data or resources that are
      personal to one or more users.     For example, options 212
      and 214, associated with telephone and mail applications,
15    respectively, may involve personal accounts or contacts
      that are not associated with every user of the electronic
      device.    Prior to providing access to such applications,
      or to personal or confidential features or resources
      available via such applications, the electronic device
20    may require the user to authenticate.     In some
      embodiments, default features of applications may be
      available without authentication (e.g., allow all users
      to place telephone calls, but not to access a contact
      list).
25    [0044]      FIG. 3 is a schematic view of an illustrative
      display screen directing a user to authenticate in
      accordance with one embodiment of the invention.       Display
      screen 300 may be displayed in response to receiving an
      instruction from a user to access resources     (e.g.,
30    information or an application) restricted by an

  WO 2009/042392                                    PCT/US2008/075738

       authentication protocol.   Display screen 300 may include
       information 310 associated with the selected resources.
       To prevent an unauthorized user from viewing the
       resources prior to authorization, information 310 may be
  5    blurred or hidden from view (e.g., entries in particular
       field may be unobtainable).    In some embodiments, display
       screen 300 may instead include no information until the
      user is authenticated.
       [0045]    Display screen 300 may include notice 320
10     instructing the user to authenticate before accessing the
      requested resources.    Notice 320 may include a pop-up,
      overlay, new display screen, or any other suitable type
      of display for providing an instruction to the user.
      Notice 320 may include any suitable instruction,
15    including for example a manner in which the user is to
      authenticate   (e.g., specifying a particular
      authentication system to use).     For example, notice 320
      may direct the user to provide a fingerprint or provide
      an input that matches a predefined visual or temporal
20    pattern.   Once the user authenticates properly, the
      electronic device may display information 310 in a manner
      discernable by the user, and enable selectable options or
      other functions associated with the selected resource.
      [0046]     In some embodiments, a user may be required to
25    authenticate prior to unlocking the electronic device
      (e.g., prior to accessing any resource of the device).
      FIG. 4 is a schematic view of an illustrative display
      screen for directing a user to authenticate prior to
      accessing device resources in accordance with one
30    embodiment of the invention.    Display screen 400 may

                                      -  18
       include option 410 for unlocking the display.           For
       example, option 410 may include a slider operative to be
       dragged across a portion of the screen.          As another
       example, option 410 may include an option or series of
   5   options for the user to select        (e.g.,  simultaneously or
       sequentially press several keys or touch several areas of
       display screen 400).
       [0047]       Display screen 400 may include notice 420
       directing the user to authenticate prior to accessing the
 10    device resources      (e.g., the home screen from which
       information and applications are launched).          Notice 420
      may include any suitable type of notice, including for
       example a pop-up, overlay, new display screen, or any
      other suitable type of display for providing an
15     instruction to the user.       The electronic device may
      display notice 420 at any suitable time, including for
      example when the user turns on the device          (e.g., and
      views display screen 400),        in response to the user
      attempting to access device resources without first
20    authenticating      (e.g., as an error message),     in response
      to a user request for help, or at any other suitable
      time.      Notice 420 may include any suitable instruction,
      including for example a manner in which the user is to
      authenticate, a list of authorized users, or any other
25    suitable information.
       [0048]       Once the user has been properly authenticated,
      the electronic device may display options associated with
      the authenticated user (e.g., options for applications

      lists or previous messages in a telephone or mail
      application).      FIGS. 5A-C are schematic views of
      illustrative display screens associated with different
  5   users provided in response to authenticating the user in
      accordance with one embodiment of the invention.         Display
      screen 500A may include several options 510A.        The
      displayed options may include some options common to a
      default or basic display of the electronic device (e.g.,
10    display screen 500A shares options with display
      screen 200, FIG. 2).      Display screen 500A may include
      several options 512A for additional applications or
      resources only available to the particular authenticated
      user.      For example, display screen 510A may include
15    additional options 512A for game, system and media
      applications.
       [0049]       Display screen 500B may include options 510B
      for resources or applications available to the users.            In
      some embodiments, options 510B may be entirely different
20    from the options of a default screen (e.g., display
      screen 50DB shares no options display screen 200,
      FIG. 2).      Display screen 500B may be further customized
      to not include labels identifying the applications or
      resources associated with options 510B.
25     [0050]       Display screen 500C may include options 510C
      for resources or applications available to the users.            In
      some embodiments, options 510C for the same resources as
      other display screens may have different appearances
      (e.g., different icons).      For example, in FIG. 5C, the

       and Calculator applications may be different than those
       displayed in display screen 500A of FIG. 5A.           Display
       screen 500C may in addition include a custom or personal
       background 512C       (e.g., different background image).        In
  5    some embodiments, display screen 500C may not include a
       dock or other feature for maintaining some options 510C
       in a fixed position       (e.g., unlike options 510B located in
      dock 512B).
       [0051]       In some embodiments, the electronic device may
10    provide access to different amounts of electronic device
      resources based on the identity of the authenticated
      user.      For example, if an electronic device is used by
      several users       (e.g., parents and children in the same
      family),     the users may share some but not all of the
15    resources      (e.g., all users may have access to the family
      contact list, but not to other family members' e-mail).
      As another example, users of the electronic device may be
      organized in groups or tiers of users.          Some resources
      may be associated with groups or tiers or users, instead
20    of or in addition to particular users.          When a particular
      user is authenticated and identified as being part of a
      group, the electronic device may provide the user with
      access to the resources associated with the group (e.g.,
      common or shared contacts,         shared communications, or
25    shared documents) and to the resources associated with
      the particular user (e.g., personal contacts, e-mail
      accounts, and telephone call lists).
      [0052]        The electronic device may associate particular
      resources with one or more authentication systems.              For
30    example, a user may identify a resource and provide a

  WO 2009/042392                                       PCT/US2008/075738

      protect or secure instruction       (e.g., by selecting an
      appropriate option).      A user may in addition select one
      or more authentication systems to satisfy before
      providing access to the resource.        If the resource is not
  5   public     (e.g., not a default application or file to remain
      available to all users), or if the resource was created
      or purchased by the user, the electronic device may
      associate the selected resource with the one or more
      selected authentication systems.        Alternatively, if the
10    user has sufficient privileges       (e.g., an administrator),
      any resource may be secured using one or more selected
      authentication systems.
       [0053]       The electronic device may not require a user to
      authenticate each time the user unlocks or operates the
15    electronic device.      In some embodiments, the electronic
      device may allow a user to authenticate for a particular
      amount of time.      For example, once authenticated, the
      electronic device may allow a user to access restricted
      resources for 10 hours from the time the user
20    authenticated.      As another example, the electronic device
      may retain the user's authentication for a particular
      amount of time after having received the user's last
      instruction or having entered a stand-by mode (e.g.,
      retain authentication for thirty minutes after an input).
25    The amount of time the electronic device retains
      authentication information may be set by the device or by
      the user, and may be based on the particular types or
      resources protected by the authentication information
      (e.g., allow for a longer authentication period for
30    access to a game purchased by a particular user than to a

  WO 2009/042392                                      PCT/US2008/075738
                                    - 22
       user's personal contacts).     Not requiring the electronic
       device to authenticate each time the user operates the
       device may save power consumption.
       [0054]     The electronic device may use any suitable type
  5    of authentication system to prevent unauthorized access
       of device resources.    In some embodiments, the electronic
      device may include an authentication system based on a
      user's unique skin patterns.       For example, the electronic
      device may include an authentication system operative to
10    detect a user's finger, hand, palm, knuckle print, or any
      other suitable print or skin feature unique to the user.
      The authentication system may include a sensor operative
      to detect the user's unique skin pattern or feature.
       [0055]    The sensor may include any suitable type of
15    sensor for detecting unique features or patterns of a
      user's skin.     For example, the sensor may include an
      optical scanner operative to detect features of the
      user's skin.    The optical sensor may include a charge
      coupled device, or any other suitable array of light
20    sensitive components    (e.g., diodes) operative to record
      the light received by the sensor (e.g., a charge coupled
      device).   For example, if a charge coupled device
      includes an array of light-sensitive components, the
      optical sensor may be operative to record, for each light
25    sensitive component of the array, a pixel representing
      the light received by the particular light sensitive
      component.    The value of each pixel may then reflect the
      distance from the sensor of the particular portion of the
      user's skin associated with the pixel (e.g., a ridge or
30    valley).   The recorded pixels may form an image, for

  WO 2009/042392                                    PCT/US2008/075738
                                   - 23
       example of a particular portion of the user's skin, that
       the electronic device can compare to a library of images
      associated with authorized users.
       [0056]    As another example, the sensor may include a
  5   capacitive sensor operative to detect features of a
      user's skin.    The capacitive sensor may include one or
      more chips containing an array of cells, each of which
      may include at least two conductor plates separated by an
      insulating layer.    The sensor may be coupled to an
10    inverting amplifier operative to change the voltage
      between the at least two conductor plates of each cell in
      the chip.   When a user's finger is placed over the array
      of cells, the sensor may be operative to distinguish the
      cells over which a valley    (e.g., a fingerprint valley)
15    and a ridge   (e.g., a fingerprint ridge) are placed from
      the different capacitance values of each cell      (i.e.,
      cells under a valley will have a lower capacitance than
      cells under a ridge).    Using the detected capacitance
      values of each cell in the chip, the sensor may generate
20    an image or a representation of the skin placed over the
      sensor that can be compared to a library of images or
      representations available to the electronic device.
       [0057]    The authentication system may include any
      suitable countermeasure for preventing an unauthorized
25    user from spoofing an authorized user's skin patterns,
      for example by placing an image    (e.g., a printed image)
      or a three-dimensional structure    (e.g., a polymer cast)
      adjacent to the authentication system sensor.      For
      example, the authentication system may include a
30    combination of optical and capacitance sensors, a sonar

       or radio-frequency sensor, a sensor for detecting a
       user's pulse, a heat sensor for determining the
       temperature of the object placed against the sensor
       (e.g., to determine if the temperature is within a range
  5    of expected human skin temperatures),   or any other
       suitable countermeasure.
       [0058]    The sensor may be operative to detect features
      of the user's skin using any suitable approach.        In some
      embodiments, the sensor may be operative to detect
10    features of the user's skin when the user's skin is moved
      over the sensor.   For example, the sensor may include a
      one-dimensional sensor or stagnant sensor (e.g., a line
      of sensing components) operative to detect features of a
      user's finger as it slides or rolls over the sensor.          The
15    sensor may include an orientation in which the user's
      skin is to move to provide an accurate representation of
      the user's skin features.     For example, the sensor may
      require a user to move a fingertip along the axis of the
      finger or perpendicular to the axis of the finger.
20     [0059]    In some embodiments, the sensor may be
      operative to detect features of the user's skin when the
      skin is held immobile over the sensor.     For example, the
      sensor may include a two-dimensional sensor or moving
      sensor operative to detect features of the user's finger
25    when the finger is stationary over the sensor.       The
      sensor may be operative to move at a regular pace or
      speed under the user's immobile finger, or detect an
      instantaneous or near-instantaneous two-dimensional
      representation of the user's finger at a point in time
30    (e.g., as the user's finger moves over the sensor).

       Using a two-dimensional sensor may provide a more
       accurate representation of     the user's skin features, as a
       two-dimensional sensor does not depend on the user moving
      his skin over the sensor at a regular or even pace,
  5   unlike a one-dimensional sensor.
       [0060]      The sensor may be placed at any suitable
      location within the electronic device.         In some
      embodiments, the sensor may be placed such that it is
      operative to detect an appropriate portion of the user's
10    skin as the user operates or begins to operate the
      electronic device.     The sensor position may vary based on
      the portion of the user's skin to be detected (e.g.,
      finger, hand or palm).     FIG. 6 is a schematic view of an
      illustrative electronic device display for detecting a
15    user's fingerprint in accordance with one embodiment of
      the invention.     Display 600 may include screen 602
      instructing the user to unlock the electronic device.
      For example, screen 602 may include block 610 having an
      arrow instructing the user to slide block 610 along
20    track 612 to unlock the electronic device, for example by
      placing a finger on block 610 and dragging the finger
      along track 612.
       [0061]      To authenticate the user during the unlocking
      process, display 600 may include sensor 620 in the
25    display along track 612.     For example, sensor 620 may be
      embedded in the display stack       (e.g., among the display
      stack that may include a capacitance sensing component, a
      light source, and a display surface).        As another
      example, sensor 620 may be placed underneath the display
30    stack.     As still another example, sensor 620 may include

                                   - 26
       an existing component of the display stack (e.g., the
       display stack for a touch screen display may include a
       capacitance sensor).   In such an approach, the
       authentication system may use the detected output of a
  5    capacitance sensing component of the display stack (e.g.,
       in a touch screen display) that has a sufficient
       resolution for distinguishing ridges and valleys of a
      user's skin.    In some embodiments, the capacitance
       sensing component of the display stack may include
10     several types or densities of capacitance sensing
      components to allow for authentication using particular
      portions of the display (e.g., use very fine sensing
      components in the display stack along at least a portion
      of track 612 for authentication and less fine sensing
15    components in the remaining areas of display 600).
       [0062]    In some embodiments, sensor 620 may be embedded
      in the electronic device such that it is not visible in
      display 600.   For example, sensor 620 may be assembled,
      printed or etched directly on display 600   (e.g., etched
20    on glass) such that the user cannot see the fingerprint
      scanner.   If a user has difficulty providing a suitable
      fingerprint to sensor 620, display 600 may highlight the
      outlines of sensor 620   (e.g., display an icon directing
      the user to place a finger on the icon over sensor 620)
25    to assist the user in authenticating.
       [0063]    FIG. 7 is a schematic view of another
      illustrative electronic device for detecting a user's
      fingerprint in accordance with one embodiment of the
      invention.   Electronic device 700 may include input
30    mechanisms 710 and 712 that the user may actuate to

      provide inputs to electronic device 700. For example,
       input mechanism 710 may include a keyboard, and input
      mechanism 712 may include a touchpad or track pad.         It
      will be understood, however that any other input
 5    mechanism, including input mechanism remotely coupled to
      electronic device 700   (e.g., a wired or wireless mouse)
      may be used with electronic device 700.
       [0064]    To provide for secure access to resources,
      electronic device 700 may include at least one sensor 720
10    operative to detect features of a user's fingerprint to
      identify the user.   To provide a seamless user
      experience, the sensors 720 may be embedded in or under
      at least one of input mechanism 710 and 712.     In some
      embodiments, input mechanism 710, which may include
15    several distinct keys that a user may press to provide
      inputs to electronic device 700, may include a sensor 720
      embedded in one or more keys.    For example, an optical or
      capacitive sensor may be placed at the top surface of a
      key such that when a user places a finger on the key
20     (e.g., rests his index fingers on the "F" or "J" keys),
      the sensor may detect features of the user's fingertips
      for authenticating the user.    A two-dimensional or moving
      sensor may be used for this implementation to
      authenticate the user while the user's fingers are placed
25    over the keys.
       [0065]    A sensor 720 may be placed in, adjacent to or
      behind any button or other physical input that a user may
      press in an electronic device.    For example, a sensor 720
      may be placed behind a home button of a portable media
30    player or cellular telephone   (e.g., button 812, FIG. 8B).

      Sensor 720 may be placed between an outer cover or
      surface (e.g., a glass or plastic surface) and a
      mechanical component operative to interact with a switch
      or electronic circuit.   For example, an fingerprint
 5    sensing mechanism may be embedded underneath a
      transparent surface operative through which the sensing
      mechanism may detect a user's fingerprint ridges and
      valleys.   In some embodiments, no additional transparent
      surface may be necessary (e.g., if the sensing mechanism
10    includes a surface on which a user may place a finger).
       [0066]    In some embodiments, input mechanism 712 may
      include a sensor 720 embedded underneath some or all of
      the pad such that when a user places a finger on input
      mechanism 712  (e.g., to move an indicator on
15    display 715),  sensor 720 may detect the features of the
      user's finger for authenticating the user.      Sensor 720
      used may be a one-dimensional sensor, authenticating the
      user as the user moves his fingers across the pad, or a
      two-dimensional sensor operative to authenticate the user
20    when the user's finger is immobile on the pad (e.g., when
      the user first places his finger on the pad).       Sensor 720
      may cover the entire surface of input mechanism 712 such
      that the user need not place his fingers over a
      particular portion of input mechanism 712 to be
25    authenticated.   Electronic device 700 may be operative to
      identify the position of each sensor 720 to assist the
      user in providing an adequately detectable input, for
      example using a highlight, indication on the display, or
      any other suitable approach.     In some embodiments, any
30    other suitable input mechanism may include a sensor 720

       [0067]      FIGS. 8A and 8B are schematic views of an
      illustrative electronic device for detecting a user's
  5   handprint in accordance with one embodiment of the
      invention.     Electronic device 800 may include housing 802
      operative to retain display 810.     Housing 802 may
      substantially constitute the back surface of electronic
      device 800    (e.g., the surface that does not include
10    display 810) to protect the components of the electronic
      device.    When a user holds electronic device 800, the
      user's hand 830 may be cupped around housing 802 leaving
      display 810 visible such that at least the user's
      palm 832 is placed against back surface 804, as shown in
15    FIG. 8B.    Electronic device 800 may include sensor 820
      embedded in back surface 804 and operative to detect
      features of a user's palm or hand.     By placing sensor 820
      on back surface 802    (or any surface of the electronic
      device that is opposite the surface of display 810),
20    sensor 820 may authenticate the user when the user holds
      electronic device 800.     Sensor 820 may include a two
      dimensional sensor, thus allowing electronic device 800
      to seamlessly authenticate the user without requiring the
      user to move or slide a hand against back surface 804.
25    [0068]      FIG. 9 is a schematic view of an illustrative
      electronic device for detecting a user's hand print in
      accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
      Electronic device 900 may include input mechanism 910
      with which a user may provide inputs to the device.
30    Input mechanism 910 may be positioned such that a user's

  WO 2009/042392                                  PCT/US2008/075738
                                  - 30
       fingers are placed over input mechanism 910 while the
      user's palms and wrists are placed on or extend over
      housing 912.   Electronic device 900 may include one or
      more sensors 920 embedded in or placed on housing 912 to
  5   authenticate a user of the device.   Sensors 920 may be
      located such that the user's hands, palms or wrists are
      aligned with sensors 920 when the user places his hands
      over housing 912 to operate input mechanism 910.
      Sensors 920 may be operative to detect features of the
10    user's skin when the user's hands are placed over
      housing 912,  for example using a two-dimensional sensor.
       [0069]    In some embodiments, the authentication system
      may instead or in addition include a sensing mechanism
      for detecting features underneath a user's skin.      For
15    example, the authentication system may include a sensor
      operative to detect the pattern of a user's veins,
      arteries, follicle distribution, or any other suitable
      feature underneath the user's skin that may be detected.
      The sensor may include any suitable type of sensor,
20    including for example an optical sensor (e.g., a camera)
      located on the surface of the electronic device.      The
      sensor may be positioned so as to detect a feature
      underneath any suitable portion of the user's skin when
      the electronic device is in use.   For example, the sensor
25    may be positioned to detect features underneath a user's
      skin in an area of the user's fingers, hand, wrist, arm,
      face, or any other suitable area.
       [0070]    FIG. 10 is a schematic view of an illustrative
      device having a sensor operative to detect features
30    underneath a user's skin in accordance with one

  WO 2009/042392                                      PCT/US2008/075738
                                   -  31
      embodiment of the invention.       Electronic device 1000 may
       include input mechanism 1010 located on or extending
      through a portion of housing 1012.      Input mechanism 1010
      may be configured such that when in use, a user's hands
  5   and wrists are placed over housing 1012      (e.g., instead of
      over input mechanism 1010).      Electronic device 1000 may
      include sensor 1020 operative to detect features
      underneath a user's skin.      For example, sensor 1020 may
      include an optical sensor operative to detect a user's
10    vein patterns near the user's wrists.       Sensor 1020 may be
      located on any suitable surface of electronic
      device 1000, including for example on or embedded in
      housing 1012 such that the user's wrists may be adjacent
      to sensor 1020 when the user's hands are positioned to
15    provide an input using input mechanism 1010.        Such a
      positioning may allow for a seamless authentication of
      the user by detecting features underneath the user's skin
       (e.g., a vein pattern by the user's wrist) while the user
      operates device 1000.
20     [0071]     In some embodiments, the authentication system
      may instead or in addition include a sensor operative to
      detect features of the user's face.      For example, the
      authentication system may include a sensor operative to
      detect radiation emitted or reflected by one or more
25    distinctive features of the user's face when the user's
      face is placed opposite the sensor.      The sensor may be
      operative to detect any suitable type of radiation.            For
      example, the sensor may include a light sensor (e.g., a
      camera),   an infra-red sensor, an ultra-violet sensor, a
30    scanning laser, an ultrasound sensor (e.g., sonar),          or

  WO 2009/042392                                       PCT/US2008/075738
                                      - 32
       any other sensor operative to detect a desired radiation
       (e.g., a particular range of radiation frequencies or
      periods).
       [0072]      The authentication system may be operative to
  5   detect any suitable element of the user's face.           For
      example, the authentication system may identify faces by
      analyzing the relative to position and size of a user's
      head, nose, mouth, ears, cheekbones, jaw, or any other
      attribute of the user's face.        As another example, the
10    authentication system may identify features of the user's
      face using a three-dimensional authentication system to
      capture and analyze curved surfaces or depths of a user's
      facial features      (e.g., contour of eye sockets, chin or
      nose).     As still another example, the authentication
15    system may detect unique lines, patterns or spots of the
      user's skin     (e.g., using skin texture analysis).       To
      enhance or facilitate authentication, combinations of
      these approaches may be used.
       [0073]      The sensor for detecting features of the user's
20    face may be located at any suitable position on the
      electronic device.       In some embodiments, the sensor may
      include a camera or other sensor provided with the
      electronic device for a different purpose        (e.g., an
      embedded webcam for chatting).        FIG. 11 is a schematic
25    view of an illustrative electronic device having a sensor
      for detecting features of a user's face in accordance
      with one embodiment of the invention.        Electronic
      device 1100 may include sensor 1120 located adjacent to
      display 1110 such that the user's face, and the features
30    of interest of the user's face may be aligned with

  WO 2009/042392                                       PCT/US2008/075738
                                     - 33
       sensor 1120     (e.g., in the field of view of sensor 1120)
      when the user faces display 1110 to view or access
       electronic device resources.       In response to detecting a
      user's face opposite sensor 1120, electronic device 1100
  5   may direct sensor 1120 to capture and analyze features of
      the user's face, and compare the analyzed features with a
      library of features associated with authorized users.              If
      an authorized user is detected, electronic device 1100
      may display or provide access to restricted content 1112
10    on display 1110.
       [0074]       In some embodiments, the authentication system
      may instead or in addition include a sensor operative to
      authenticate a user based on attributes of the user's
      eyes.      For example, the sensor may be operative to scan a
15    user's retina, iris or retinal blood vessels to detect
      unique patterns of the user.        The sensor may include a
      light source operative to emit light, for example
      infrared light, to be reflected by the user's eye and
      detected by a lens or optical sensor.        The sensor may
20    analyze the received light to create a representation of
      the user's eyes that can be compared with a library of
      authorized user's eyes.
       [0075]       As another example, the sensor may instead or
      in addition be operative to detect movements of the
25    user's eyes, for example by tracking the position and
      movement of a user's retina, iris, blood vessels, or any
      other feature of the user's eyes.        Before providing a
      user with access to electronic device resources, the
      electronic device may direct the sensor to detect a
30    predetermined eye movement set up by an authorized user.

  WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                    -  34
       For example, each authorized user may create an eye
       movement track by moving his eyes in a particular manner
        (e.g., up, down, left, right, blink, blink) while looking
       at the sensor.    When a user of the device moves his eyes
  5    in a manner that matches a predetermined eye movement,
       the electronic device may unlock the device or provide
       access to restricted resources.
       [0076]     The sensor may be located at any suitable
      position of the device, including for example adjacent to
10     a display or other portion of the device that will face
       the user's eyes   (e.g., a position similar to that of
       sensor 1120, FIG. 11, which may be used to authenticate a
      user from features of the user's eyes).      FIG. 12 is a
      schematic view of an illustrative electronic device
15    having a sensor for detecting features of a user's eyes
      in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
      Electronic device 1200 may include sensor 1220 located
      adjacent to display 1210 such that the user's eyes may be
      aligned with sensor 1220    (e.g., in the field of view of
20    sensor 1220) when the user faces display 1210 to view or
      access electronic device resources.      Using sensor 1220,
      electronic device 1200 may detect features or movements
      of a user's eyes to authenticate the user and provide
      access to restricted device resources.      In some
25    embodiments, sensor 1220 may be implemented to
      authenticate a user based on features of the user's face
       (e.g., like sensor 1120, FIG. 11).
       [0077]     In some embodiments, the authentication may be
      operative to authenticate users based on attributes or
30    qualities of their voices.      For example, the

  WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                   -  35
      authentication system may be operative to detect a
      particular voice pitch or voice signature.       The
      authentication system may be text dependent      (e.g., the
      user must say a particular phrase to authenticate, such
  5   as "my voice is my passport") or text independent         (e.g.,
      any suitable words may be said to authenticate the user).
      In some embodiments, the authentication system may
      require the user to say a secret password to
      authenticate, thus requiring both knowledge of the user's
10    password and the user's voice pitch to properly
      authenticate.    The authentication system may include any
      suitable component for authenticating a user, including
      for example a microphone.      In some embodiments, the
      microphone may be primarily used for other purposes
15     (e.g., telephone communications or video conferencing).
       [0078]     In some embodiments, other types of
      authentication systems may be used.      In some embodiments,
      the authentication system may be operative to identify
      and authenticate users from the shape of their ear
20    canals.    For example, the authentication system may
      include a sensor (e.g., optical, radar or sonar)
      operative to detect unique features of a user's ear canal
      (e.g., shape and length).      The sensor may be located, for
      example, near a speaker of the device     (e.g., if the
25    device is a telephone).    In some embodiments, the
      authentication system may be operative to identify a user
      based on an odor particular to the user.      For example,
      the authentication system may include a sensor operative
      to detect unique attributes of the odor of a user's skin
30    or sweat glands.    The sensor may be located at any

  WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                  -  36
       suitable position on the device, including for example at
      or near an input mechanism    (e.g., where the user touches
      the device).
       [0079]    In some embodiments, the authentication system
  5   may be operative to identify a user based on a DNA
      sequence.   For example, the authentication may include a
      sensor coupled to a processor that is operative to
      receive a cell having the user's DNA      (e.g., from the
      user's skin or mouth) and determine whether a particular
10    DNA sequence is present.   The length or variation in DNA
      sequence may be selected to both ensure that proper
      authentication is provided and that the authentication
      process is sufficiently quick (e.g., the entire DNA
      strand need not be analyzed).     The sensor may be
15    positioned at any suitable location on the device,
      including for example on or adjacent to input mechanisms
      or other components that a user may touch.
       [0080]    The electronic device may receive biometric
      information reflecting authorized users using any
20    suitable approach.   For example, when a user selects an
      authentication system to use with particular device
      resources, the electronic device may direct the user to
      provide biometric information (e.g., a fingerprint, eye
      scan, or DNA sequence) to be stored in a library.         The
25    electronic device may direct the user to provide the
      biometric input using any suitable approach, including
      for example using visual cues, audio cues, and
      highlighting or identifying the location of the
      authentication system sensor.     Received biometric
30    information stored in the library may be retrieved when a

 WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                 -  37
     user attempts to authenticate, and compared to the
     biometric information provided by the user.       If the
     provided biometric authentication information matches
     information stored in the library (e.g., information
 5   associated with a requested resource),     the electronic
     device may provide access to a restricted resource.           In
     some embodiments, a similar approach may be used to
     receive non-biometric authentication information.
      [0081]     In some embodiments, the authentication system
10   may instead or in addition not require biometric
     parameters to provide access to electronic device
     resources to users.    Although non-biometric
     authentication systems may be, in some cases, easier to
     circumvent than biometric authentication systems, the
15   non-biometric authentication systems may nevertheless be
     highly effective and secure.      In some embodiments, the
     authentication system may provide access to electronic
     device resources in response to detecting that a key or
     token is within a particular distance of the electronic
20   device.    For example, a user may have a cellular
     telephone and a computer.     One or both devices may
     include circuitry for detecting that the devices are
     within a particular range of each other (e.g., 5 feet so
     that a user may sit at a desk to use the computer with
25   the cellular telephone in his pocket and authenticate).
     When the devices determine that they are in proximity,
     resources of one or both devices may become available.
     This approach may be particularly useful to secure access
     to static devices while taking advantage of the fact that
30   a user may keep a portable device on his person.         This

 5     [0082]       In some embodiments,    the electronic device may
      authenticate a user based on a particular sequence of
      inputs provided by the user.         For example, the electronic
      device may require the user to provide an input
      corresponding to a visual pattern provided by the
10    electronic device.      FIGS. 13   and 14 are schematic views
      of an illustrative display for providing a visual pattern
      in one embodiment of the invention.         Display 1300 may
      include distribution 1310 of options or shapes 1312.
      Display 1400 may include distribution 1410 of options or
15    shapes 1412.      Each shape 1312 and 1412 may have a
      different fill pattern (e.g., different line
      orientations),     color or colors, shape or contour, size
       (e.g., periphery or area),      proximity to or position
      relative to other displayed shapes, alignment with other
20    shapes     (e.g., select four yellow shapes that form a
      straight line),     source  (e.g., shapes representing
      pictures in a particular album or library),         or any other
      suitable characteristic.       Distributions 1310 and 1410 may
      include any suitable number and distribution of shapes,
25    including for example a number of evenly distributed
      shapes     (e.g., 20 evenly distributed shapes 1310) or a
      seemingly arbitrary distribution of shapes         (e.g.,
      arbitrarily distributed shapes 1410).
       [0083]       To authenticate, the user may select      (e.g., as
30    detected by an input mechanism or other sensor) any

  WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                     - 39
      suitable subset of the displayed shapes or options.           The
      subset may include some or all of the shapes that share
      one or more attributes.      For example, the user may select
      some or all of the shapes that are of a particular color
 5     (e.g., all shapes that include a shade of yellow).         As
      another example, the user may select some or all shapes
      that have the same contour (e.g. all squares).        As still
      another example, the user may select some or all shapes
      that have a particular attribute in common (e.g., all 5
10    sided shapes, or all shapes representing pictures
      associated with a particular album stored by the device).
      As yet still another example, the user may select some or
      all shapes that include a particular distribution of
      colors     (e.g., shapes that include a red portion adjacent
15    to a blue portion).      Any suitable criteria or attribute
       (including combinations of the examples listed above,
      such as selecting the top two blue shapes and the bottom
      two square shapes) may be used to select the particular
      subset of displayed shapes.
20     [0084]       Any suitable number of shapes or options may be
      associated with the subset to select for authentication.
      For example, the number of shapes may be related to the
      total number of displayed shapes (e.g.,     select 20% of the
      displayed shapes).      As another example, the number of
25    shapes may be a fixed number, for example less than five
       (e.g., so that the user can simultaneously select all
      shapes using one hand) or ten (e.g., so that the user can
      simultaneously select all shapes using both hands).          The
      number of shapes may be selected to optimize security

                                - 40
      (e.g., require enough shapes that it is too difficult to
     simply guess which shapes to select).
      [0085]    The user may select the subset of the shapes
     using any suitable approach.    If a multi-touch display is
 5   provided, the authentication system may require the user
     to simultaneously select all of the shapes used for
     authentication.   As another example, the authentication
     system may allow the user to sequentially select the
     shapes used for authentication.    The shapes may be
10   selected in an arbitrary or particular order     (e.g., from
     top to bottom or left to right).    As still another
     example, the authentication system may require the user
     to provide a single, moving input   (e.g., dragging a
     finger across the display) selecting only the shapes of
15   the authorized subset.   Any other suitable approach for
     selecting the subset of shapes may be used.
      [0086]    To avoid having the user always select shapes
     displayed in the same relative position on the display
      (e.g., like entering a numeric pass code using a
20   displayed keypad),  the electronic device may change the
     distribution of the shapes to select for authentication.
     To authenticate, the user may then identify the shapes
     that share the attribute associated with the
     authentication protocol.   Because the position of the
25   shapes used to authenticate may change each time the user
     accesses device resources, someone looking over the
     user's shoulder to see the general distribution of the
     selected shapes may not be able to select shapes with the
     same distribution to authenticate   (e.g., the striped

  WO 2009/042392                                      PCT/US2008/075738
                                    -  41
      shapes may not be distributed in the same areas of the
      device).
       [0087]       After each failed attempt at selecting shapes
      for authentication, the electronic device may change the
 5    distribution of the displayed shapes, or even change the
      shapes     (e.g., use different colors or contours) to
      prevent an unauthorized user from guessing the proper
      subset of shapes.      The electronic device may lock the
      device resources after a particular number of failed
10    attempts to select the proper subset of shapes.         Once
      locked, a user may need to couple the device with a host
      to re-enable the device (e.g., couple a mobile device to
      a fixed device) or use another authentication system
       (e.g., a biometric system) to re-enable the device.
15     [0088]       In some embodiments, rather than selecting
      particular shapes, the user may simply select the shapes
      located in pre-determined portions of the screen.           For
      example, the user may place one or more fingers over
      several shape positions independent of the actual
20    displayed shape.      As another example, the user may place
      one or more fingers over particular shapes displayed by
      the electronic device, and move the one or more fingers
      in a predetermined manner      (e.g. slide one or more
      fingers),     independent of the displayed shapes.     As still
25    another example, the user may successively select several
      shapes located at predetermined positions on the display
      (e.g., select shapes at particular locations to form a
      predetermined pattern).      The electronic device may, in
      some embodiments, provide a blank or uniform display on
30    which the user may draw one or more patterns using one or

 WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                   - 42
     more fingers.    Such an approach may confuse or distract
     unauthorized users by creating a visual distraction via
     the displayed shapes.
      [0089]    In some embodiments,    the electronic device may
 5   authenticate a user based instead or in addition on a
     received temporal pattern of inputs by the user.         For
     example, the user may provide a particular number of
     inputs at a particular rate to authenticate.       The
     electronic device may detect the inputs using any
10   suitable approach.     For example, the electronic device
     may detect inputs provided using an input mechanism of
     the device   (e.g.,  inputs received by a touch screen).         As
     another example, the electronic device may detect inputs
     from motion, contacts, vibrations or other impacts
15   detected by an appropriate sensor of the device        (e.g., an
     accelerometer).     In such an approach, a user may tap any
     portion of the device     (or a body in contact with the
     device, such as a table on which the device is placed)
     such that the sensor in the device detects the taps and
20   determines whether they correspond to an authorized
     temporal pattern.     As still another example, the
     electronic device may detect that it has been moved in a
     particular manner (e.g., shaken twice then spun) using a
     sensor in the device (e.g., an accelerometer or
25   gyroscope).    In response to detecting a correct temporal
     pattern, the electronic device may provide access to
     restricted resources.
      [0090]    In some embodiments, the authentication system
     may combine temporal and visual patterns for
30   authentication.     For example, a user may be required to

  WO 2009/042392                                    PCT/US2008/075738
                                  -  43
       select particular displayed shapes at a certain rate
       (e.g., the first two shapes quickly, then a pause before
       simultaneously selecting the last two).    As another
      example, the user may be required to first select the
  5   proper shapes then provide an input for a temporal
      pattern.   As still another example the user may be
      required to select one or more shapes and move the device
       (e.g., shake the device).    Any other suitable combination
      of inputs may be required for authentication.
10     [0091]    The electronic device may set up visual or
      temporal patterns for authorized users using any suitable
      approach.   In some embodiments, when a user selects to
      use a temporal or visual pattern to restrict access to
      particular device resources, the electronic device may
15    direct the user to provide or select the temporal or
      visual pattern.   For example, the electronic device may
      provide a list of shape attributes that the user may
      select to form a pattern (e.g., a color or a contour).
      As another example, the electronic device may direct the
20    user to select displayed shapes or provide a temporal
      pattern, and extract or identify the pattern from the
      received inputs.   The electronic device may direct the
      user to provide a pattern several times before it is
      accepted to ensure that the user intended and remembers
25    the selected pattern.
       [0092]    The electronic device may include any suitable
      number and types of authentication systems.     For example,
      the electronic device may include one, more or all of the
      authentication systems or authentication approaches
30    described above.   Access to different resources may be

  WO 2009/042392                                     PCT/US2008/075738
                                  -  44
      restricted using one or more authentication systems,
      which a user may select or set up.      In some embodiments,
      several authentication systems may be used sequentially
      before access to particular restricted resources is
 5    provided.
       [0093]    FIG. 15 is a flow chart of an illustrative
      process for authenticating a user in accordance with one
      embodiment of the invention.      Process 1500 may begin at
      step 1502.   At step 1504,  the electronic device may
10    identify the user of the device.      For example, the
      electronic device may receive a username or password
      associated with the user.     As another example, the
      electronic device may receive authentication information
      using an authentication system and identify the user from
15    the received authentication system.      The electronic
      device may automatically receive authentication
      information without requiring an express input from the
      user, for example by placing a sensor of the
      authentication system in a manner that seamlessly
20    captures authentication information as the user operates
      the device.   As another example, the sensor may be
      operative to detect features of attributes of the user as
      soon as the user is within the field of view or sensing
      region of the sensor.   In some embodiments, process 1500
25    may move directly from step 1502 to step 1506.
       [00941    At step 1506 the electronic device may
      determine whether a request to access restricted
      resources was received.    For example, the electronic
      device may determine whether the user provided an
30    instruction to access data associated with a particular

  WO 2009/042392                                      PCT/US2008/075738
                                      - 45
      user     (e.g., a contact list or other personal
      information).       As another example, the electronic device
      may determine whether the user provided an instruction to
      access a restricted application (e.g., an application
  5   restricted to a particular tier of users, such as
      administrators, or an application purchased by a
      particular user).       If the electronic device determines
      that no instruction to access restricted resources was
      received, process 1500 may return to step 1506 and
10    continue to monitor inputs received from the user.
       [0095]       If,  at step 1506, the electronic device instead
      determines that an instruction to access restricted
      resources was received, process 1500 may move to
      step 1508.      At step 1508, the electronic device may
15    determine whether the identified user is authorized to
      access the resources.       For example, the electronic device
      may determine whether the user has provided suitable
      authentication information for accessing the restricted
      resources.      The electronic device may receive suitable
20    authentication information without the user's knowledge,
      for example by embedding an authentication sensor in the
      device such that authentication information is received
      during normal use.       If the electronic device determines
      that the identified user is not authorized, process 1500
25    may move to step 1510.       At step 1510, the electronic
      device may instruct the user to authenticate.        For
      example, the electronic device may direct the user to
      provide authentication information to an authentication
      system (e.g., any of the authentication systems described
30    above).      In some embodiments, the electronic device may

 WO 2009/042392                                  PCT/US2008/075738
                                 - 46
      detect several inputs by the user, and determine whether
      the inputs have a pattern or share attributes associated
     with an authorized user (e.g., determine whether the user
     has provided the proper inputs that correspond to an
 5   attribute or pattern of an authorized user, or determine
     whether the attribute or pattern of the inputs matches an
     attribute or pattern associated with authorized users).
     Process 1500 may then return to step 1508 to determine
     whether the user has provided suitable authentication
10    information.
      [0096]    If, at step 1508, the electronic device instead
     determines that the user is authorized, process 1500        may
     move to step 1512.   At step 1512, the electronic device
     may provider the user with access to the requested
15   restricted resources.   For example, the electronic device
     may provide the user with access to personal data or to
     applications specific to the user.   Process 1500 may then
     end at step 1514.
      [0097]    The above described embodiments of the
20   invention are presented for the purposes of illustration
     and not of limitation, and the present invention is
     limited only by the claims which follow.
