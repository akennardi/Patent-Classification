 )002]        Functional          endoscopic             sinus      surgery        (FESS)       is    a   common type
     of    surgery         used    to      treat        chronic       sinusitis.             In    a    typical         FESS
     procedure,             anatomical              structures             are      typically             removed           or
     modified         in      order        to     access        the     openings          into       the      paranasal
     sinus.         For example,               during       a   FESS procedure,              one     or more          rigid
     surgical         instruments              (e.g.,        a  rigid       endoscope)           can      be    inserted
     into      a   nostril       in      order        to    perform        operations          such       as    removing
     bone      and mucosal            tissue          from the        nasal       cavity       and      the     openings
     into       the     paranasal              sinuses,         and      enlarging           such        openings           to
     improve         sinus       drainage              and      to    mitigate           sinusitis            symptoms.
     Other       types       of   tissue          that       can    be    treated        during         FESS      surgery
     include polyps and bony growths.

     outer       surface        of the        distal        end of the            insertion          tube.        In some
     embodiments,             the     conductive             element        is      disposed          over     an     outer
     surface         of    the      outer       tube,        and     the     medical           probe     comprises           a
     conductor          that      runs       along        the     outer      tube        from      the   proximal          to

     comprise a set of grasping teeth configured to grasp body cavity
     tissue        during       the     medical         procedure.              In    embodiments             where      the
     conductive            element       is      disposed           over     the      outer        surface        of     the
     outer tube, the conductive element may also be disposed over the
     additional           cutting        blade       and      coupled        to     the     conductor,           thereby
     enabling the additional cutting blade to perform coagulation.

     comprise          a   radial       suction         window        opening        that       is    configured          to
     traverse          the     radial        cutting         window         opening         as     the      inner      tube
     rotates.             When      the    inner        tube      is     coupled         to    a     suction       device
      (also       referred         to   herein        as     a    suction        module)          at    its    proximal

     radial        suction        window       opening,         debris         (e.g.,       body      cavity       tissue
     and coagulated blood) during the medical procedure.
0021]          In further embodiments, the medical probe                                       can be configured
     to restrict            conveyance           of    the energy to the                  distal        end to       times
     when the          inner tube is positioned at specific angles of rotation
     relative          to    the     outer     tube.           For     example,         in    embodiments            where
     the      conductive            element         is     disposed         over       the       outer       tube,       the
     medical         probe       can    be     configured            to    restrict          conveyance           of    the
     energy          to    the       conductive            element         to      times       when         the    radial

     extract        coagulated             debris.              In       additional              embodiments,             the
     rotation         of     the      inner        tube        and       the      energy         conveyed          to     the
     conductive         element        can each be              controlled            independently,               thereby
