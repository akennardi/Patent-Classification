Abstract
A hygiene station is provided for use at entry and exit points to communal areas, wherein a beam
extends horizontally across the entry or exit point, and wherein the hygiene station provides an
audible beep when the beam is broken.

           <removed-apn>
There is one page of description only

                 Hygiene station original idea
Original concept was a mechanical gate with a lock release that releases with the
hygiene being dispensed
Improved this to passing through a beam with an audible beep on breaking the
beam.
    *    Designed to be mounted to rig and smoko shack stairs- i.e. one way entry
         and exit points to food and toilet communal areas
    * This means the total number of passes will be twice the number of people
         passed
    " The compliance ratio will be the number of dispensing divided by the
         number of passes X 100 as a percentage.
    * This number should be not easily seen, i.e. contained within the unit to
         prevent people finding ways to change the count ratio
    * It will serve as an audible reminder to wash hands on entry to smoko
         shack and toilets
    " It will aid to improve hygiene culture by adding oversight.
Technology will be a beam that extends horizontally across the stairs with a no
touch alcohol dispenser.
It will be encased in a metal box that attaches directy to the stair rails with quick
fasteners
It will be robust enough to survive rig moves every 6 days
It will function as an audit count for hygiene compliance-this may be useful to
commercial catering companies as will show if rig workers hand hygiene is poor
or good. This may aid post-event analysis to determine gastro outbreaks or food
poisoning.

            Hygiene station specification claim
Original concept was a mechanical gate with a lock release that releases only
with the hygiene solution being dispensed by a no touch disenser
Improved this to passing through a beam with an audible beep on breaking the
beam. The beam extends horizontally from the unit and records a pass and
sounds a beep each time it is passed. The no touch dispensing beam extend
downwards from the unit and each dispensing is seperately recorded.

It will have an idoor model for use in hospitals and cain restaurants-anywhere
ewhere the compliance of handwashing is required.
It may be upgraded in future to wifi download of recorded data.
