                                    APPLICATIONS
                                      ABSTRACT
        A computer-implemented method for determining a target situation in an
athletic event. Positional information including the relative positions of a group of
selected participants is initially received from a tracking system, and the
aggregate motion of the selected participants is detected in real-time using the
positional information (402). The target situation may be determined to have
occurred (406) when a change in the aggregate motion occurs (404) in
accordance with a predetermined characteristic during an initial time interval.

Application Nos. <removed-apn> and 2011203707 are also incorporated herein by reference.
                                             BACKGROUND
         [0002]     Systems that track objects in an event, such as participants in an athletic event,
are known. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0129825 to DeAngelis
et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses systems and methods to facilitate
autonomous image capture and picture production. A location unit is attached to each tracked
object (e.g., participants in an athletic event). An object tracking device receives location
information from each location unit. A camera control device controls, based upon the location
information, at least one motorized camera to capture image data of at least one tracked object.
         [0003]     It is also known to manually create video and still images of an event. For
example, a video feed of an event (e.g., an American football game) is typically generated by
highly trained camera persons and highly trained production staff who select camera shots and
combine graphics into the video feed. Video images and/or still picture production can be
partially or fully automated using systems and methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Application
Publication No. 2008/0129825.
         [0004]     In many American football games, two 'standard' views are manually filmed
using two digital video cameras; one on the sideline, and one in an end zone. These views are
then manually 'broken down' by humans watching the videos, clipping them into plays, and
identifying interesting attributes of each play. One of the most obvious attributes is simply who
was on the field for each team at a given time. This is also one of the most difficult things to
determine from the video since the resolution is not sufficient to clearly determine each of the
players' numbers, thus making it difficult to identify all of the players.
                                               SUMMARY
         [0004a]     It is an object of the present disclosure to substantially overcome, or at least
ameliorate, at least one disadvantage of present arrangements.

                                                    2
          [0004b]     One aspect of the present disclosure provides a computer-implemented
method for identifying a play in a sporting event, comprising: periodically receiving, from a
tracking system, positional information defining location of each of a plurality of participants in
the sporting event; processing the positional information to determine a static formation of
players of interest immediately prior to a start of the play; comparing the static formation against
a plurality of standard formations stored in a database to identify a nearest standard formation
corresponding to the static formation; wherein the play is identified based upon the nearest
standard formation.
          [0004c]    Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a computer-implemented
method for annotating a video feed of an event comprising: receiving, from a tracking system,
positional information of a plurality of participants in the event; determining a target situation
within the video feed based upon a sequence of individual aggregate motion values of the
plurality of participants of the event; determining a path of travel, during at least a portion of the
event, of a selected participant from the positional information; and overlaying, onto the video
feed, graphical information comprising the path of travel and identifying information of the
selected participant after the target situation is determined; wherein each aggregate motion value
is, at a particular time, one of (a) a sum of velocities of the plurality of selected participants and
(b) an average of the velocities of the plurality of selected participants.
          [0004d]    Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a system for displaying event
information comprising: a video camera for capturing a video feed of the event;
a tracking system for providing position information of a plurality of participants of the event; a
computing device, coupled to the video camera, including: instructions for determining a target
situation within the event based upon a sequence of individual aggregate motion values of the
plurality of participants in the event, and instructions determining a path of travel, during at least
a portion of the event, of a selected participant from the positional information; and a display
device for displaying graphical information, overlaying the video feed, comprising the path of
travel and identifying information of the selected participant; wherein each aggregate motion
value is, at a particular time, one of (a) a sum of velocities of the plurality of selected participants
and (b) an average of the velocities of the plurality of selected participants.
          [0005]     A computer-implemented method is disclosed for determining a target
situation in an athletic event. In one embodiment, positional information including the relative
positions of a group of selected participants is initially received from a participant tracking
system. Aggregate motion of the selected participants is detected in real-time using the
positional information. The target situation is determined to have occurred when a change in the

                                                  2a
aggregate motion occurs in accordance with a predetermined characteristic during an initial time
interval.
         [0006]     In another embodiment, a video feed of an event is annotated by receiving
positional information indicating the position of a selected participant in the event from a
tracking system. The path of travel of the participant is determined from the positional
information, and graphical information indicating the path of travel, and information identifying
the participant, is overlaid onto the video feed.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0027]      The present disclosure may be understood by reference to
the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings
described below. It is noted that, for purposes of illustrative clarity, certain
elements in the drawings may not be drawn to scale.
        [0028]      Systems and methods disclosed herein analyze event data,
such as respective real-time locations of participants in an event, to
advantageously automatically generate information characterizing one or
more aspects of the event (event characterization information). In the case of
a sporting event, examples of possible event characterization information
include (1) identification of formations and/or plays, (2) beginning and/or end
of a play, (3) players' paths of travel, (4) lines of scrimmage, (5) identification
of players, and (6) position and orientation of coaches and/or officials.
        [0029]      Such event characterization information, for example, is
provided to interested recipients (e.g., event spectators, coaches, and/or
event officials) automatically or upon demand. In some embodiments, event
characterization information is advantageously used to enhance a video feed
109 of an event, such as by overlaying graphical information onto the video
feed. Some embodiments of the systems and methods disclosed herein may
partially or fully automate imaging of an event (e.g., generating a video feed of
the event) and/or control delivery of event images to recipients.
        [0030]      The present system and methods provide the basic
functionality for implementing, among other things, a real-time feed showing
who is on a playing field at all times. The feed can be automatically added as
a data track to the original digital video.
        [0031]      Figure 1 shows an exemplary system 100 for automatically
generating event characterization information from event data. System 100
receives a video feed (live video stream) 109 and other event data 102, which
includes information such as participant location information and system
instructions 107, and automatically generates event characterization
information 104. Exemplary embodiments of system 100 are operable to
automatically generate event characterization information 104 in real-time,
where the term "real-time" in the context of this disclosure and appended
                                             4

claims means information 104 is generated as the event occurs. For
example, identification of a play in a sporting event in real-time means that the
play is identified as it occurs, as opposed to the play being identified at a later
time (e.g., upon post-analysis of the event).
         [0032]    Figure 2 shows exemplary system 100 in more detail.
System 100 includes an input/output (I/O) subsystem 106 operable to receive
event data 102 and user input 118, and to output event characterization
information 104. I/O subsystem 106 includes, for example, a USB (Universal
Serial Bus) and/or Ethernet interface for connecting to one or more external
systems. It is to be noted that input 118 is received from a system user to
initiate and/or provide certain information specific to each of the system
functions described below.
         [0033]    In one embodiment, I/O subsystem 106 is communicatively
coupled to a video feed 109 from one or more video cameras 117, and a
tracking system 108, information from which is transmitted via link 107, which
also provides data including information pertaining to event participants and
instructions for system 100 including requests to be processed. Video
cameras 117 may be manually or robotically controlled. Tracking system 108
determines positions and/or velocities of event participants from location units
such as active RFID tags affixed to event participants by triangulating the
position of the location units to determine respective positions and/or
velocities of the participants. System 100 may alternatively receive event
data 102 from Internet 110 via I/O subsystem 106.
         [0034]    In the present embodiment, system 100 further includes a
processor 112, a data store 114, and a database 115. Processor 112 is a
computing device, which includes, for example, a general purpose
microprocessor, processes event data 102 to generate event characterization
information 104 in response to instructions 116, in the form of software and/or
firmware 116, stored in data store 114. Examples of methods executed by
processor 112 to generate event characterization information 104 are
discussed below.
         [0035]    Data store 114 typically includes volatile memory (e.g.,
dynamic random access memory) and one or more hard drives. Although the
components of system 100 are shown grouped together, such components
                                           5

could be spread over a number of systems, such as in a distributed computing
environment and/or in a distributed storage environment.
        [0036]     In one embodiment, event characterization information 104 is
transmitted to an annotation system 124, which annotates a video feed 120
(e.g., a live video feed) of the event to produce an annotated video feed 122.
In certain embodiments, annotation system 124 overlays graphical information
onto video feed 120, as is known in the art, and the graphical information
includes event characterization information 104.
        [0037]     The present system advantageously uses information
derived from the aggregate motion of event participants. The aggregate
motion of multiple participants in an event can indicate the occurrence of a
particular incident, target situation, or circumstance of interest (hereinafter
collectively, "target situation") in the event (e.g., the beginning of a play in a
sporting event). An aggregate motion value represents collective motion of
two or more participants. An aggregate motion value for selected event
participants at a given point in time can be determined, for example, by
summing the velocities of the participants at that time or determining an
average velocity of the participants at that time. A particular target situation
can be detected by recognizing changes in aggregate motion values and/or
sequences of aggregate motion values that are known to coincide with the
target situation, thereby indicating that the target situation occurred.
        [0038]     Figure 3 shows an example in which aggregate motion of
event participants and knowledge of the type of event can be used to
determine the occurrence of a particular target situation in the event. More
specifically, Figure 3 is a graph 300 of normalized aggregate motion versus
time for a 24 second interval of an American football game. Certain target
situations in a football game can be recognized by comparing actual
aggregate motion values of graph 300 to aggregate motion values known to
occur with a given target situation. For example, segments A, B, D, and E are
respectively characterized by a moderate value of aggregate motion, a small
value of aggregate motion, a large increase in aggregate motion over a
defined time duration, and a sustained large value of aggregate motion. Such
sequences of aggregate motion values are known to occur with the
                                             6

preparation for and executing of an offensive play, and the beginning of an
offensive play can thus be inferred from the sequence.
        [0039]    Specifically, segment A represents the offensive squad
breaking a huddle and heading toward a line of scrimmage, segment B
represents an offensive squad assembling at a line of scrimmage and
entering a pre-play condition, segment D represents a beginning of a play,
and segment E represents the play in progress. Accordingly, an offensive
play can be detected by recognizing the sequence of aggregate motion values
associated with segments A, B, D, and E. Point C, which is characterized by
a brief spike in aggregate motion, represents a player going into motion
before the ball was snapped.
        [0040]    A sequence of aggregate motion values in graph 300 can
also be recognized to determine an end of the play. In particular, segments
E, F, G, and H are respectively characterized by a sustained large value of
aggregate motion, a substantial decrease in aggregate motion over a defined
time duration, a moderate value of aggregate motion, and moderate but
smaller value of aggregate motions. Such sequence of aggregate motion
values are known to occur with the ending of a play. In particular, segment E
represents the play in progress (as previously noted), segment F represents
the end of the play, segment G represents the players moving from the post
play positions back to the next huddle, and segment H represents players
beginning to assemble for the next huddle.
        [0041]    Accordingly, certain embodiments of system 100 at least
partially determine event characterization information 104 from aggregate
motion of participants of the event, such as by processor 112 executing
instructions 116 to perform an analysis similar to that discussed above with
respect to Figure 3.
        [0042]     Figure 4A shows an exemplary method 400 that can be
used with certain embodiments of system 100 to detect a target situation in an
event by analyzing the aggregate motion of participants in the event in real
time. Method 400 is performed, for example, by processor 112 of system 100
executing instructions 116. As shown in Figure 4A, in step 402, aggregate
motion of a number of participants of the event is detected, such as by
processor 112 calculating an average velocity of selected participants in the
                                         7

event from velocity data calculated from event data 102. Processor 112 may
calculate respective participant velocities from changes in participant positions
and then determine an average velocity from the respective participant
velocities. Calculated aggregate motion values may be stored in database
115 for subsequent use.
        [0043]      In step 404, a change in aggregate motion is determined.
For example, processor 112 may determine a difference between two
sequentially determined aggregate motion values stored in database 115. In
step 406 a target situation is detected if the change in aggregate motion
detected in step 404 has a predetermined characteristic (block 407), and/or if
a specific sequence of aggregate motion values detected (block 408), and/or
if specific positions or orientation of event participants is detected (block 409).
        [0044]      For example, with respect to block 407, processor 112 may
detect the beginning of a sporting event play if the change in aggregate
motion meets a predetermined increases by at least a threshold value within
a given time period as specified by instructions 116, such as similar to the
increase shown in segment D of graph 300 (Figure 3). As another example of
step 406, processor 112 may detect an end of the sporting event play if
aggregate motion decreases by at least a threshold value within a given time
period as specified by instructions 116, such as a value similar to the
decrease that occurred in segment F of graph 300.
        [0045]      In block 408, a specific sequence of aggregate motion values
must occur before a target situation is determined to be detected. For
example, detection of a play beginning may require a minimum aggregate
motion value to precede a rapid increase in aggregate motion values and/or a
maximum sustained aggregate motion value to follow the rapid increase,
similar to sequences B, D and D, E of Figure 3, respectively. As another
example, detection of a play ending may require a maximum sustained
aggregate motion value to precede a rapid decrease in aggregate motion
values and/or a moderate aggregate motion value to following the rapid
decrease, similar to sequences E, F, and F, G of Figure 3, respectively.
        [0046]      In block 409, event data 102 must have certain
characteristics in addition to known aggregate motion characteristics to detect
a target situation. Examples of such additional characteristics include
                                            8

positions and/or orientation of participants relative to each other or relative to
a playing field. In the case of a football game, the beginning of a play may be
detected if a certain number of players are in certain predetermined positions
indicating formation of a starting line prior to a sufficiently rapid increase (e.g.,
6 feet/second minimum aggregate speed in a 0.3 second period) in aggregate
motion values.
         [0047]    The choice of the specific participants to be considered when
determining the aggregate motion value in step 402 depends on the specific
intended application of method 400. For example, in the case of American
football, only the players on one team might be considered when determining
an aggregate motion value. As another example, only players considered
likely to be involved in a high level of motion during a particular target
situation, such as running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks, may be
considered when determining an aggregate motion value. The specific
participants considered when determining an aggregate motion value may
vary depending on the target situation to be detected or determined. For
example, different players may be considered in aggregate motion
determinations when detected in the beginning of an offensive play and the
kicking of a field goal.
         [0048]     Figure 4B is a flowchart showing exemplary steps performed
in detecting a play in a sporting event. As shown in Figure 4B, initially, at step
410, specific players in a sporting event are selected for inclusion in an
aggregate motion tabulation. Combining the motion of multiple players
minimizes the impact of the random movement of individual players and
accentuates the differential movement associated with specific target
situations. Certain players or players at certain positions inherently exhibit
higher levels of differential motion than others. Selecting players with typically
high levels of differential movement for the aggregate tabulation, and ignoring
the remaining players, minimizes the effect of random motion while
maximizing differential motion levels at various stages of a target situation.
         [0049]     In an American football game, certain 'skill' positions have a
relatively high level of differential motion associated with the beginning or end
of a play, thus their inclusion in an aggregate motion tabulation increases the
differential levels of aggregate motion. Skill positions include wide receivers,
                                            9

running backs, and defensive backs. Linemen typically have low differential
motion during play start/stop and so their inclusion in the tabulation reduces
the differential levels of aggregate motion.
         [0050]    At step 412, a pre-play target set of conditions is identified.
Situations of interest are generally preceded by a definable (sport-specific) set
of conditions, players, positions, relative movements, and the like. The
occurrence of this target set of conditions is an indication that a target
situation will occur in the near future and is used as a pre-condition to a
refined set of player position and alignment criteria.
         [0051]    The pre-play target conditions in American football are met
when there are exactly 11 players from each team on the playing field and
both teams are on their own side of the line of scrimmage. This situation
occurs toward the end of segment A in the graph shown in Figure 3.
         [0052]    At step 414, a system 'arm' condition is identified. In addition
to pre-play conditions, a target situation is often immediately preceded by a
definable (sport-specific) set of conditions, players, positions, relative
movements, and the like. A system arm condition is an indication that the
target situation is imminent and is used as a pre-condition to more specific,
motion based criteria, described below.
         [0053]     In American football one arm condition is known as a 'line
set'. This condition is defined by a certain number of linemen being stationary
for a defined period (typically <800 ms) and the offensive and defensive
linemen being positioned within a defined distance of each other (typically <2
meters). This situation occurs toward the end of segment B in the graph
shown in Figure 3.
         [0054]    At step 416, a start-of-play condition is identified. The
beginning of a target situation (e.g., start of play) is characterized by a specific
aggregate motion profile. In most cases this will be a rapid increase in
aggregate motion but depending on the sport other aggregate motion profiles
may exist. If the real time aggregate motion profile matches the aggregate
motion start profile then the start of a situation has been detected.
         [0055]     In American football, immediately prior to the snap of the
ball, all offensive players (with minor exceptions) are required to be
motionless. This condition results in a very low aggregate motion baseline,
                                            10

which was established during the arm condition. As soon as the ball is
snapped, all players begin moving nearly simultaneously, with the position
players often moving rapidly. This results in the aggregate motion radically
increasing over a very short period of time. This situation matches the profile
for start-of-play and occurs toward the end of segment D in the graph shown
in Figure 3.
        [0056]     At step 418, an aggregate motion baseline of play is
established. Following a start event the target situation will typically reach
and maintain some level of sustained aggregate motion. This establishes an
aggregate motion baseline value for the play.
        [0057]     Following the start of a play in American football, the players
are typically moving at a reasonably stable level of aggregate motion. The
magnitude of this level will vary depending on the type of play. In the case of
a long pass play, the level of aggregate motion will be relatively high, and on a
running play it will be relatively low. Regardless of the type of play, a
sustained aggregate motion of some level will generally be established. This
condition exists as segment E in the graph shown in Figure 3.
        [0058]     At step 420, an end-of-play condition is identified. The end
of this target situation (i.e., end-of-play) is characterized by a specific
aggregate motion profile. In most cases this profile exhibits a gradual, yet
constant, decrease in aggregate motion, with an initially faster decrease (e.g.,
a decrease in aggregate speed of 40% in 0.5 seconds) in the motion. If a
particular real time aggregate motion profile matches the aggregate motion
stop profile then the end of a play has been detected.
        [0059]     In American football, when the referee blows his whistle,
indicating that a play has ended, the players will begin to slow down. While
the aggregate motion will immediately begin to decline, since the players do
not all stop instantaneously, or at the same instant, the decline will be more
gradual than the play start. However, the end-of-play profile is identified by
aggregate motion consistently decreasing over a predefined relatively short
period of time, for example, 800 milliseconds. In practice, this duration is
dictated by the specific sport and the specific situation of interest in that sport.
This condition exists as segment F in the graph shown in Figure 3.
                                             11

        [0060]     Once a target situation has ended, system 100 begins
looking for the next target situation to enter its pre-play condition. In an
American football game, once a play is over the system monitors the players,
positions, etc., as described above, seeking to identify the next pre-play
condition. This condition exists in segment G and carries through into
segment H in the graph shown in Figure 3. If a game is still in progress at this
point, the procedure described above resumes at step 412.
        [0061]     As noted above, the present system can determine the
occurrence of a target situation at least partially from positional information.
Examples of target situations determined from analysis of positional
information include players breaking (from) a huddle, reaching a set position
in a line formation, and the beginning of a play. For example, in an American
football game, players' positions relative to each other, or relative to a
particular yard marker may indicate that the players are lined up at the line of
scrimmage immediately prior to beginning a play.
        [0062]     Figure 5A is a flowchart showing exemplary steps performed
in using positional information to determine certain target situations in real
time. As shown in Figure 5, at step 505, tracking information, which includes
the relative positions of event participants of interest, is received from tracking
system 108. At step 510, the relative positions of selected participants (e.g.,
players on a particular team) are determined from analysis of the tracking
information. At step 515, if the positions of the selected participants meet
certain predefined criteria, then a corresponding target situation is detected, at
step 520.
        [0063]     In one embodiment, the predefined criteria includes relative
positions of participants determined by analyzing the tracking information to
detect the participants' positions relative to certain position indicators, such as
yard line markers in a football game. The criteria may also include the
orientation of participants. e.g., the direction in which the participants are
facing.
        [0064]     Examples of target situations that can be determined from
positional information include team in huddle, players in a particular formation,
and players' position relative to the line of scrimmage. Relative positions of
coaches and officials can enable detection of a target situation such as a
                                           12

coach signaling a 'time out' or an official signaling a penalty. Positional
information may also be used to analyze actions of officials and assist with
their training.
         [0065]    In American football, there are a finite number of basic
offensive and defensive formations in common use. On top of these there are
many standard variations of these formations. Some of these variations are
common to nearly all teams, while others are specific to individual teams.
Beyond these standard and variant formations there are an infinite number of
subtle formation variations, both intentional and unintentional.
         [0066]    Currently, defensive coaching staffs routinely study an
upcoming opposition's offensive formations and subsequent play
selection/execution. In conjunction with various game situations (e.g., 3rd
down and long) they calculate the percentage of time an opponent runs
certain plays in specific situations. For example, in a 'third and long' situation,
when in a particular formation, the offense passes the ball 75 percent of the
time and when passing from this formation the ball is passed it to a wide
receiver 43 percent of the time.
         [0067]    The objective of compiling these statistics is to improve the
accuracy with which the defense can predict which play the opposing offense
will run in a given situation and, in turn, select the defensive formation with the
highest likelihood of success. The identification of subtle variations in player
formations allows the systematic prediction of which play the offense is most
likely to run. An offense may intentionally employ a subtle formation variation
as they believe there is advantage to be gained from this variation based on
the play that is about to be run. For instance their pass blocking may be more
effective when employing a very subtle increase in lineman spacing.
         [0068]    In analyzing video data from a team's past performances this
variation can be systematically identified. This analysis may lead to learning
that, in a third and long situation, when in a particular formation, and where
the offensive line assumes a slightly wider space than normal, a particular
offense passes the ball a certain percentage (e.g., 95.8 percent) of the time.
         [0069]    The present system compares formations, on a play by play
basis, against a catalog of historical plays of the same class and
systematically identifies subtle formation variations within each specific play.
                                            13

In the methods shown in Figures 5B - 5H (described below), a computer
program 116 is used to systematically determine statistically significant
correlations between subtle formation variations and plays run when these
specific subtle variations were present. Each of the examples in Figures 5B
5H is set forth in the context of American football; nevertheless, the methods
described in accordance with these figures are applicable to other sports as
well. This process systematically distills an infinite possible number of subtle
variations down to a finite number of meaningful predictors, which increases
play prediction accuracy, improves the ability to choose the most appropriate
formation and thus may systematically improve a team's success percentage.
        [0070]     Figure 5B is a flowchart showing exemplary steps performed
in generating solutions and recommendations to increase a team's future
success percentage based on detecting deviations in static formations,
correlating these deviations to specific outcomes (play results) and comparing
these correlations to the outcomes of previous situations. Figure 5C is an
exemplary diagram showing a standard line formation 553 and a deviant 555
of the standard formation, wherein "X's indicate the players on one team.
Operation of the present system is best understood by viewing Figures 5B
and 5C in conjunction with one another.
        [0071]     Using player location data for a group of players (such as an
offensive football squad in the present example), at a particular point in a
game (i.e. just before a situation of interest, such as the snap of the ball), the
relative positions of the players is established, at step 530, in Figure 5B.
Player location data can be acquired from tracking system 108 via feed 107.
The relative positions of these players define a static formation 553 for that
group of players, which formation is associated with the subsequent play.
        [0072]     The static formation 555 established in step 530 is compared
against a library (in database 115) of well known classes of standard
formations and accepted variants of those standard formations to identify a
best case match with a standard formation, at step 532. In the example
shown in Figure 5C, the standard formation thus identified is shown in box
553. In this particular standard formation 553, the line spacing (distance
between the players at the left and right tackle positions, as indicated by
                                           14

marker 550) is 7 yards, and wide receiver X1 (circled) is lined up 5 yards
away from the right tackle, as indicated by marker 552.
        [0073]     Once a best case match has been made, deviations between
the determined static formation 555 and the standard library version of that
formation 553 are identified, at step 534. These deviations can be as subtle
as, for example, where the average line spacing is slightly wider (8 yards, as
indicated by marker 551) than in the standard library formation (7 yards in the
present example). These deviations may be significantly larger, as where a
wide receiver lines up 10 yards away from the respective tackle (as indicated
by marker 553), as opposed to 5 yards (as indicated by marker 552), per the
standard library formation shown in Figure 5C.
        [0074]     Having identified a deviation between the previously
captured static formation 555 and the standard library formation 553, at step
536 this deviation is logged to database 115 along with a number of
associated attributes such as deviation type (e.g., wide offensive line
spacing), matched library formation (class & variant), play results (success or
failure), and opposing formation (which type of defense was set up against the
deviant offense in the static formation). Although yardage gained or lost is
one measure of success, there may be other, more appropriate, measures of
success depending on the circumstances. For example, if an offense is
facing third down and 10 (yards to a first down) and they gain 9.8 yards, then
with respect to gain vs. loss, the play might be judged, in the abstract, to be a
success, but in this particular situation it was actually a failure. The above
example is specific to football and the parameters of success/failure will vary
with specific situations.
        [0075]     The above examples represent only two deviations which
might be identified. In practice there may be 'intentional' deviations and many
subtle, 'unintentional' deviations from the standard formation. Although the
majority of these deviations may be tentatively deemed irrelevant to the play
outcome,     all deviations are nevertheless logged into database 115, as they
may become relevant in the future as additional data is collected.
        [0076]     Once a best case match has been made, deviations between
the static formation 555 and the standard library version 553 of that play are
systematically evaluated. At step 538, system 100 accesses play deviation
                                            15

information in database 115 to identify deviations for which there are multiple
instances and correlates these to play outcomes (both positive and negative).
        [0077]     Having identified these correlations, at step 540 these play
outcomes are then compared to play outcomes when a particular deviation
was not present, i.e., the deviant formation outcomes are compared against
play outcomes resulting from corresponding 'standard' formations. Previous
formations, with associated deviations, are repetitively compared against
standard formations to get a best-case match for each, which information is
then logged in database 115 along with attributes indicating, such things as
the success/failure of the formation (e.g., the number of yards gained/lost
using a particular deviant offensive formation against a specific defensive
formation).
        [0078]    At step 542, the system uses the correlations thus
established to generate a report for the coaching staff proposing solutions
and/or recommendations such as those indicated in the example below:
Positive Outcome Variation Detected
        Squad: Offense
        Formation Class: passing
        Formation Variant: split wide receiver
        Deviation Type: increased line spacing
        Standard Success: 52.6%
        Deviation Success: 63.1%
        Recommendation(s):
               Increase line spacing in split receiver formations.
               Investigate line spacing increases in passing class formations.
        [0079]     Figure 5D is a flowchart showing exemplary steps performed
in predicting an opponent's behavior based on detecting deviations in static
formations and correlating these deviations to historical behavior in given
situations. Operation of the present system is best understood by viewing
Figures 5D and 5C (described above) in conjunction with one another.
        [0080]     Using player location data for an offensive football squad, in
the present example, at a particular point in a game (i.e. just before a situation
of interest, such as the snap of the ball), the relative positions of those players
                                           16

is established, at step 580, in Figure 5D. The relative positions of these
players define a static formation 555 (shown in Figure 5C) for that group of
players, which formation is associated with the subsequent play.
        [0081]     The static formation 555 established in step 580 is compared
against a library (in database 115) of classes of standard formations for the
specified team of interest and accepted variants of those standard formations,
for a specific team of interest, to identify a best case match with a standard
formation used by that team, at step 582. In the example shown in Figure 5E,
the standard formation thus identified is shown in box 553. In this particular
standard formation 553 (which is the same formation as indicated in the
example of Figure 5B), the line spacing is 7 yards, and wide receiver X1 is
lined up 5 yards away from the right tackle.
        [0082]     Once a best case match has been made, potentially
significant deviations between the defined static formation 555 and the
standard library version 553 of that formation are identified, at step 584.
Having identified a deviation between the static formation 555 and the
standard library formation 553 for the team of interest, at step 585 this
particular deviation is logged to database 115 along with a number of
associated attributes such as deviation type (e.g., wide offensive line
spacing), matched library formation (class & variant), situation (e.g., which
down and the number of yards to go), and subsequent type of play run. This
type of information may be used by a defensive squad to analyze an offensive
squad for specific 'down and distance' situations to determine, on a statistical
basis, what type of play this offensive squad runs when faced with a particular
situation, for example., third down and between 7 and 10 yards to a first
down.
        [0083]     At step 586, system 100 accesses historical play data in
database 115 to selectively retrieve previous plays for specific situational
categories, for example, first down and ten yards to go, from between the
opponent's 10 and 20 yard lines, for a team of interest. At step 587, the
results are then sorted into groups based on standard formations for the team
of interest and a tabulation is made of the percentage of times specific plays
were run from this standard formation given a specific type of game situation.
The results are then further sorted based on common, identifiable, and
                                            17

sometimes subtle, deviations from the standard formation 553. After
identifying correlations between formation deviations and their outcomes, at
step 588 these outcomes are then compared to play outcomes when a
particular deviation was not present, i.e., the deviant formation outcomes are
compared against play outcomes resulting from corresponding 'standard'
formations.
        [0084]      At step 589, a report is generated in which these tabulations
are cataloged based on situations of interest for the coaching staff. The
report is used in preparing a team to more accurately predict what the team of
interest will do in a given situation, from a specific formation and how specific
deviations in that formation refine the likelihood of a particular behavior. A
typical report may include information such as that indicated in the example
below:
Behavior Prediction based on situation, formation and variant
        Squad: offense
        Down: third
        Yardage: 7< x <10
        Formation Class: passing
        Pass 80%
        Run 20%
        Formation variant: split wide receiver
        Deviation type: increased line spacing
        Pass: 85%
        Run: 15%
        Formation Variant: split wide receiver
        Deviation Type: increased wide receiver spacing
        Pass: 93%
        Run: 7%
        [0085]      Play recognition is a type of target situation that may be
detected by the use of information such as the path of travel of an event
participant, as determined from positional, velocity, and path information. This
information can be compared to a database of known plays to recognize a
particular type of play. In the embodiments described below with respect to
                                            18

Figures 5E - 5H, database 115 is populated with information indicating
previous formations and plays run by a particular team in given game
situations.
        [0086]      Figure 5E is a flowchart showing exemplary steps performed
in generating solutions and recommendations to improve the performance of
a team based on detecting deviations in dynamic play execution, correlating
these deviations to specific outcomes and comparing the correlations to the
outcomes of previous situations. Figure 5F is an exemplary diagram showing
a standard route 573 and a deviant route 574 in similar patterns (paths) run by
a wide receiver. Operation of the present system is best understood by
viewing Figures 5Eand 5Fin conjunction with one another.
        [0087]      Using a player location data set for a selected group of
participants (such as an offensive football squad) captured for the full duration
of a situation of interest (e.g., an entire play), the path of each individual
participant is determined, at step 590. The collection of these individual paths
defines a dynamic play execution. In step 592, the dynamic play execution
established in step 590 is compared against a library of well known classes of
standard play executions (and accepted variants of those standard
executions) stored in database 115, to establish a best case match with a
standard type of play.
        [0088]     This comparison is considered from the perspective of
individual paths, which are compared to predefined paths and the paths
treated as a collection of individual data points. Although there may be
multiple paths, each player has a predefined path, so the paths can be
processed individually. While the paths are actually two dimensional, they are
treated simply as collections of discrete data points, which can be evaluated
for deviation from a standard path. What might be considered a significant
deviation will vary by sport, situation of interest, and by player position. When
considering, for example, a wide receiver in an offensive football play, a
deviation of more than 1.5 yards from predefined path may be considered
significant.
        [0089]      In finding matches between deviations so that they can be
grouped together, each standard play execution is considered as a collection
of individual, predefined paths. Each individual path comprises a collection of
                                            19

specific segments consisting of legs and inflection points. As an example, a
wide receiver route might be described as follows:
Wide Receiver Path Segments
          Start of play
          Segment 1 - straight for 5 yards
          Segment 2 - 90 degree turn toward center of field
          Segment 3 - 10 yards straight
          Segment 4 - 45 degree turn in opposite direction of segment 2 turn
          Segment 5 - straight until end of play
        [0090]     Once a path within a dynamic play execution has been
identified, then the segment in which the deviation occurred is identified.
Deviations in individual paths are selected for further evaluation and, once
selected, these paths are further classified such that they can be grouped
with, and compared to, previously recorded deviations.
        [0091]     Once a best case match has been made between the
dynamic play execution established in step 590 and a standard type of play,
deviations between each path of interest within the dynamic play execution
set and the paths defined in the standard library version of that play execution
are evaluated, at step 594. In Figure 5F, two paths for offensive player X1
(e.g., a wide receiver) in formation 591 are shown - path 574 is the path
selected from the dynamic play execution established in step 590, and path
573 is the path with the best case match selected from the standard library of
plays. The deviations determined by the evaluation made in step 594 may be
as subtle as a wide receiver making a jog (at arrow 575) in his pattern where
the receiver changes his 'cut point', as shown in Figure 5F.
        [0092]     The present example represents one possible path deviation
which might be identified. In practice there may be a large number of
deviations present in a single play and possibly even multiple deviations in a
single player's path. Having identified a deviation between a path within a
dynamic play execution and the standard library path for that play execution,
at step 595 this deviation is logged to database 115 along with a number of
associated attributes such as deviation type (e.g., wide receiver path),
deviation specifics (e.g., additional course changes), matched library
                                          20

formation (class & variant), play outcome (success or failure), and opposing
formation (which type of defense). Although the majority of the deviations
may be tentatively deemed irrelevant to the play outcome, all deviations are
nevertheless logged in database 115 as they may become relevant in the
future as additional data is collected.
        [0093]    At step 596, deviation information in database 115 is
accessed to identify significant correlations between various path deviations
and play outcomes (both positive and negative). Having identified these
correlations, at step 597 the outcomes are then compared to corresponding
standard play outcomes, that is, the results of a standard play that had been
executed as intended (e.g., as the play was initially drawn on a chalkboard)
when a particular deviation was not present. At step 598, these correlations
are then used to generate a report for the coaching staff including relative
success of deviant and standard paths, and optionally proposing solutions
and recommendations. A typical report may include information such as the
following:
Positive Outcome Variation Detected - Dynamic Play Execution
        Squad: Offense
        Execution Class: Passing
        Execution Variant: Split wide receiver
        Deviation Type: Receiver Path
        Deviation Specific: Additional course changes
        Standard Success: 52.6%
        Deviation Success: 61.6%
        Recommendation(s):
               Incorporate additional course changes in wide receiver path.
               Investigate additional course changes in all receiver routes.
        [0094]     Figure 5G is a flowchart showing exemplary steps
performed in predicting an opponent's behavior based on detecting deviations
in dynamic play execution and correlating these deviations to previous
behavior in specific situations. Figure 5H is an exemplary diagram showing a
standard route and a deviant route in similar patterns (paths) run by a slot
                                          21

receiver. Operation of the present system is best understood by viewing
Figures 5G and 5H in conjunction with one another.
        [0095]      Using a player location data set for a selected group of
participants (such as an offensive football squad) of a team of interest,
captured for the full duration of a particular situation (e.g., an entire play), the
path of each individual participant is determined, at step 5105. The collection
of these individual paths defines a dynamic play execution.
        [0096]      In step 5110, the dynamic play execution established in step
5105 is compared against a library (stored in database 115) of well known
classes of standard play executions and accepted variants of those standard
executions, for a specific team of interest, to establish a best case match for a
selected standard type of play. Once a best case match has been made,
deviations between each path of interest within the dynamic play execution
set and the paths defined in the standard library version of that play execution
are evaluated, at step 5115.
        [0097]      In Figure 5H, two paths for offensive player X1 (e.g., a slot
receiver) in formation 5101 are shown - path 5103 is the path selected from
the dynamic play execution established in step 5105, and path 5102 is the
path with the best case match selected from the standard library of plays.
Note that 'standard' path 5102 and deviant path 5103 have respective 'cut
point' distances 5111 and 5112. The deviations determined by the evaluation
made in step 5115 may be as subtle as a slot receiver cutting his 'in motion'
path short (at arrow 5107) relative to where he would normally change
direction at the standard cut point (at arrow 5108), as shown in Figure 5H.
        [0098]      Having identified a deviation between a path within a
dynamic play execution and the standard library path for that play execution
and team of interest, at step 5120 this deviation is logged to database 115
along with a number of associated attributes such as deviation type (e.g., slot
receiver path), deviation specifics (e.g., motion duration), matched library
formation (class & variant), situation (e.g., down number and yards to first
down), and subsequent type of play run.
        [0099]     At step 5125, information in database 115 indicating previous
performances for the team of interest is accessed to retrieve selected plays
for specific situational categories. At step 5130, the plays are then sorted into
                                           22

groups based on standard play executions for the team of interest, and the
corresponding frequency with which specific behaviors (e.g., which player ran
the ball) occurred are tabulated. The sorted results are refined based on
common, identifiable, and often subtle, deviations from the standard play
execution. The percentages of times specific behaviors occurred (e.g., who
the ball was thrown to in a specific situation) are tabulated for instances when
a play execution deviation was present.
        [0100]      At step 5135, the system accesses information in database
115 to identify deviations for which there are multiple instances and compares
the behavior (the specific type of play executed) in specific play executions
when a particular deviation is present, to behavior when the deviation is not
present.
        [0101]      A defensive squad may want to analyze an offensive squad
for specific 'down and distance' situations on a statistical basis to determine
what an offensive squad typically does when faced with a third down and
between 7 and 10 yards to first down. Dynamic play deviation information can
be used to refine a team's prediction ability and improve their success
percentage.
        [0102]      A report is thus generated, at step 5140, to catalog the
predicted behavior of a team of interest as a function of deviant play execution
and situations of interest, as determined above. A coaching staff may use this
report in preparing their team to more accurately predict what the team of
interest will do in a given situation during a specific play execution, and how
specific deviations in that execution indicate the likelihood of a particular
behavior (e.g., who the ball is thrown to). A typical report may include the
following information:
Behavior Prediction based on situation, dynamic play execution and deviation

        [0103]     In one embodiment, player movements can be traced in real
time onto live feed 109, statically positioned on the field surface as the
camera moves, from detected start of play until detected end of play. In
another embodiment, player paths are automatically shown in real time on a
graphic screen. Data collected (e.g., via feed 107, or from database 115) by
system 100 is associated with the corresponding video footage; therefore, if a
video is selected for replay, the associated data may be used to generate
graphic and statistics for combining with, or overlaying onto, video feed 109.
        [0104]     A generated graphic of the field and players can be a
perspective view which allows fading between live action footage and graphic
views. If the graphics are generated to have the same aspect ratio and
viewing angle as the camera view, player traces and marked paths remain
constant when fading from generated graphic to camera view. This avoids
the switching from a side perspective view of a camera to a generated plan
view to show a play. Once transitioned to the generated perspective graphic
view, the graphic can be rotated to provide the most appropriate viewing
angle for showing the play.
        [0105]     Figure 6A is a flowchart showing exemplary steps performed
in using positional information to provide real-time automatic annotation of a
video feed 120 of an event. Figure 6B is an exemplary diagram showing
player identification graphics and the traced path of a player on a video
display 130. A graphic showing the path of travel of one or more selected
players 660, 661 can be displayed either in real time, or after the end of a
play. As shown in Figure 6A, at step 605, tracking information from tracking
system 108 is received for event participants of interest. At step 610, the path
of travel of one or more of the participants is calculated, using positional
information calculated from tracking system 108 data. At step 615, a graphic
                                           24

652, indicating the path of travel of the selected participant(s), for example,
the path for player 661, is overlaid onto the video feed 120, as indicated in
Figure 6B.
        [0106]     System 100 can also show, via output 104, the identity and
locations of multiple players on the field, and their associated teams (e.g.,
players of team A in red, players of team B in blue). This information can be
displayed on a graphic representing the actual playing field, or overlaid on the
live video feed 109, as indicated in step 620.
        [0107]     In one embodiment, the present system keeps continuous
track of selected off-screen objects so that the off-screen location of the
objects is indicated, and the objects are highlighted immediately upon
entering the field of view. A 'camera view' coordinate system is used, wherein
the center of the screen is assigned the coordinate (0,0), the upper left has
the coordinate (-1, -1), and the lower right is (1,1). Note that the X and Y
scales are not the same, since video displays (including television screens)
have an aspect ratio by which the screen width is greater than the screen
height. Thus the point represented by the coordinate (0.5,0) is located further
to the right of center-screen than the point represented by coordinate (0,0.5)
is located down from the center. It should be noted that the coordinate
system employed by the present system may be different than that described
herein and still provide the same function.
        [0108]     Using the coordinate system described above, it is relatively
simple to determine if an object is on screen, as both the X and Y coordinates
will be >= -1 and <= 1. When reporting the location of an object, its
coordinates can be < -1 or > 1, meaning it is off screen. At high zoom levels,
object coordinates can be much larger than 1 or much smaller than -1.
        [0109]     Figure 6C is an exemplary diagram showing player
identification graphics indicating the off-screen location of selected objects.
By calculating the direction of an off-screen object relative to a border of a
display screen 130, the present system can determine which location along
the appropriate screen border is closest to the object. A highlighting indicator
or marker 675 is placed at this location proximate the border of the screen
130 to indicate that the off-screen object (e.g., player 676 or 677) is in a
particular direction relative to the images displayed on the screen. Dotted box
                                           25

670 represents the potential field of view of a camera (e.g., video camera 117)
which is providing the video feed 109 displayed on screen 130. When a
previously off-screen object again becomes visible 'on-screen', the marker
may change its appearance and continue tracking the object, as shown in
Figure 6B.
        [0110]     One example of off-screen tracking is a close-up of the
quarterback and the linemen around him (indicated by arrow 671), where two
wide receivers 676, 677 are not in view on screen 130, as shown in Figure
6C. Each wide receiver's general location is indicated with a marker 675(1),
675(2) positioned next to the appropriate edge of the screen 130, thus
allowing a viewer to tell which wide receiver the quarterback is looking toward
at a given point in time. Marker 675 may include identifying text, or may
simply be color-coded to represent one or more players of a specific type.
        [0111]      Player identities can be indicated via output 104 in real time,
for example, via a player identification graphic 657 overlaid onto the video
feed such that it is close to the player's head or body. Graphic 657 shows, for
example, the player's number and name, but may, alternatively or additionally,
provide other information such as the number of yards gained or lost on a
particular play, as indicated by graphic 658. In other embodiments, all of, or
certain parts of, selected players 655 may be highlighted, as indicated by an
optionally blinking 'dot' 656, or other part of the player, such as the player's
head or helmet 655. One or more players to be highlighted can be user
selected (via user input 118, such as a handheld device described below) or
selected by the system. For example, the system may automatically identify a
quarterback, or all eligible receivers may be automatically identified after a
quarterback throws the ball.
        [0112]      In another embodiment, certain players can be highlighted as
a result of detection of a target situation, such as when two players are within
a predetermined distance of each other, e.g., when a receiver is within a
predetermined distance of a defensive back.
        [0113]     System 100 can also draw the line of scrimmage and yard
markers and overlay them onto video feed 109. In the case of American
football, the approximate line of scrimmage can be determined from the
players' (e.g., linemens') positions and the distance to a first down can be
                                           26

automatically calculated and added as an annotation. Participant parameters,
such as distance traveled, velocity, and/or acceleration, can also be
displayed on a graphic 658 via output 104.
        [0114]     The graphics generated by the present system may be
partially transparent or opaque, depending on the particular graphic being
displayed and whether the graphic is an overlay or not. Graphics may fade
between an image of an event (e.g., live action footage) in the video feed and
a particular graphic. Graphics may include images that represent actual
players, as commonly done in video games.
        [0115]     Graphics may have same aspect ratio and viewing angle as
image of an event, such that player path traces and marked paths remain
constant when fading between the graphic and the image, thereby providing a
smooth transition during the fading process. Alternately, a graphic may have
a different aspect ratio and/or viewing angle than the corresponding image to
present a view of the event that is different than the video image of the event.
        [0116]     Figure 6D is an exemplary diagram showing a window 685
containing a highlighting shape 680 overlaid onto a video feed 690. In one
embodiment, rather than modifying the incoming video feed 109 frame-by
frame, the present system instead uses a standard video player to overlay, on
top of a video stream 690 (e.g., video feed 109), a window 685 which includes
a ratiometrically correct highlighted image of each player being highlighted.
This overlay window 685 is transparent, except for semi-transparent areas
filled with any color except black. To create a highlight, a white, semi
transparent oval (or a highlighting indicator of other desired color/shape) 680
approximately the size of the player to be highlighted (player 681 in Figure
6D) is drawn on the overlay window 685 at the approximate position of the
player. The position of the player is determined from location information
extracted from tracking system 108. The highlighting indicator 680 is overlaid
on the streamed video image 690 to create an image with highlight 682, while
the rest of the video image remains unchanged. With this method, rather than
having to deal with the higher bandwidth video data stream, the present
system has a simpler and less time-constrained task of creating overlay
updates independent of more frequent video frame updates, since the
highlighting indicator 680 is re-drawn only when the position of the highlighted
                                          27

player changes, in the composite displayed image, by a predetermined
displacement.
        [0117]      When a single player is being tracked by the camera, the
system constantly modifies the zoom level in an effort to maintain the
displayed player at a relatively constant size in the video frame regardless of
how near or far away the player is from the camera. In the case where only
one player is tracked, the sizing of the highlight is relatively constant except at
the minimum and maximum zoom levels.
        [0118]      When other players that are not being tracked appear in the
video feed, the highlight size becomes accordingly dynamic. The size of the
player in the video frame, and therefore the required size of the highlight, is
generally based on how much closer or further away from the camera these
other players are in comparison to the tracked player. In either case (both
camera-tracked, and non-camera-tracked players), the system continuously
calculates a size-in-the-video-frame metric each time new location information
arrives for a player. This metric is used to determine the size of the
highlighting shape, and is based on information including the video camera
location, the location of the player(s), the pan & tilt settings of the camera, and
the current camera zoom level.
        [0119]      The translation of this information into a size-in-the-video
frame metric involves a series of calculations/transforms including determining
a camera's field of view based on pan, tilt and zoom of a plane parallel to the
lens, and correcting that field-of-view measurement based on the degree to
which the field is not parallel to the lens (i.e., correcting for camera angle,
relative to field). Once the field-of-view of the camera (e.g., camera 117) is
calculated, then the position and size within that field of view is calculated for
each of the location units (on players of interest) within the view. This
calculation also corrects for the camera angle. Rather than use the raw noisy
location data, both the field-of-view and the size-in-the-video-frame
calculations are based on filtered location data. The filtering may be identical
to that used in controlling the camera motion.
        [0120]      In one embodiment of the present system 100, the path of
travel of a participant is automatically analyzed and displayed to evaluate the
performance of a participant. Figure 7 is a flowchart showing exemplary
                                            28

steps performed in evaluating a participant's performance. As shown in
Figure 7, at step 705, the path of travel of one or more selected participants is
determined. The distance traveled by the participant, and/or the participant's
velocity may also be determined.       At step 710, paths of travel for multiple
players are compared to determine how well a particular player was able to
perform during a given play (e.g., in avoiding players from an opposing team,
or in 'covering' another player). In the case of officials, their paths show
where the officials traveled during a particular play. This information may be
helpful in evaluating an official's effectiveness.
        [0121]     At step 715, one or more players whose path meets
predetermined criteria is automatically highlighted on a graphic. For example,
'open' players (i.e., offensive players who are separated from all defensive
players by a certain distance) or blocked players (i.e., those whose velocity
during a certain time period is less than a minimum threshold and who are
positioned in sufficiently close proximity to a player on the opposite team), by
changing the color of these players as displayed on a graphic, which may also
show the players' path of travel.
        [0122]     A graphic showing a path of travel may also show orientation
of the participant(s), for example, the direction in which a quarterback or
referee was facing. A graphic may automatically change configuration in
response to a target situation, for example, a dashed line may be displayed
during play and a solid line displayed at the end of play.
        [0123]     In one embodiment, system 100 may control the imaging of
an event at least partially in response to event characterization information
104. The system may automatically direct a robotic camera 117 to capture or
'cover' a target situation such as the beginning of a play, or when certain
players are positioned within a predetermined distance of each other. For
example, a camera may be automatically directed to cover an area of interest
such as the line of scrimmage, a huddle, or a particular participant or
participants in response to, or in anticipation of, a target situation, e.g.,
camera 117 may be directed to cover a quarterback upon detection of the
beginning of a play. This procedure may help ensure that play is not missed
due to other action on the field.
                                            29

         [0124]     In any game there are a number of situations which have the
potential to evolve into a target situation. Some examples include:
        - Two hockey players who have had confrontations in the past are
likely to get into a fight at some point during a game. Every time they are near
each other, they can be targeted in high zoom with a robotic camera 117 in
anticipation of a target situation.
        - Two football players have a historically notorious match-up. Every
time they are near each other, they can be targeted in high zoom with a
robotic camera 117 in anticipation of a target situation.
        - A particular basketball player is a good three point shooter. Every
time he is near the three point line, he can be targeted in high zoom with a
robotic camera 117 in anticipation of a target situation.
         [0125]     In one embodiment, system 100 has access to the positions
of all players on the field of play and a predefined, prioritized list of conditions
to watch for. When system 100 identifies the conditions which precede a
target situation, the system directs a robotic camera 117 to zoom in on and
track the appropriate subject(s).
         [0126]     A simple example is a hockey game in which there are two
players who fought in the last game. The odds that they will fight again are
high and thus any time they are in close proximity, a situation of interest is
determined to exist. Should a target situation subsequently occur, high zoom
video footage becomes available before occurrence of the event defined by
the target situation. In the case of a hockey fight there is often an extended
period of close proximity during which glances, gestures and stares are
exchanged in a period preceding the actual confrontation.
         [0127]     System 100 can cause video to be generated only during
time intervals where the system has detected a play in process. Video buffers
may capture leaders or trailers to ensure that an entire play is recorded.
Alternatively, the entirety of an event, or a significant portion of it may be
recorded, in which case the system may automatically post-edit the video
recording to remove footage that does not include plays in progress.
                                           30

         [0128]     In one embodiment, an entire game video is completely
automated. This automation emulates what is typically done with a manually
operated camera. Figure 8 is a flowchart showing exemplary steps
performed in automating the video filming of predetermined types of segments
of a game. The exemplary process shown in Figure 8 may be performed for a
game of American football with two cameras, for example, with one camera
117 at an end zone and another camera 117 in a press box.
         [0129]     In one embodiment, a camera 117 in the press box (or other
vantage point) automatically captures all (22) players on the field during the
entire game, at step 805. The press box camera may either record the entire
field of play or, alternatively, zoom in to more closely capture a smaller area
on the field in which all of the players are located. As indicated in Figure 8, at
step 810, a camera 117 in the end zone is zoomed in on a scoreboard and
records for a predetermined duration (e.g., 10 seconds). At step 815, upon
detection of a predetermined type of situation (e.g., players moving to a line of
scrimmage), the end zone camera moves and/or zooms to capture all players
on the field. At step 820, upon detection of a line set condition, both press
box and end zone cameras begin recording. At step 825, upon end-of-play
detection, both cameras continue recording for a predetermined time, e.g., 5
seconds, and then stop recording. If it is not yet the end of the game (step
830), then steps 810 - 825 are repeated until the game ends.
         [0130]     In certain embodiments, system 100 automatically transmits
event characterization information to a recipient's wireless device, such as a
mobile phone, net-book computer, or other portable wireless device, using
UDP protocol, for example. Figure 9 is a diagram showing the use of a
wireless, typically handheld, device 128 with the present system. Users may
select which event characterization information and/or video/still images of an
event are displayed on their mobile device 128. For example, a coach or a
spectator may elect to view selected athlete performance parameters, or a
spectator may select one of a number of video feeds, such as one that is
covering the spectator's favorite athlete.
         [0131]     In one embodiment, user-configurable video feeds from one
or more cameras 117 at an event facility may be broadcast throughout the
facility. Users with handheld devices 128 may access the specific video feed
                                            31

of their choice via a wireless broadcast from system 100 or via a wireless
communication system connected thereto. Coaches, referees, spectators,
and commentators may also use handheld devices 128 to choose their own
particular video feed from system 100.
         [0132]     Coaches and/or officials may also direct event
characterization information and/or images to be displayed for training and/or
reviewing purposes on a large display device 130, such as a stadium
scoreboard. A coach may control video playback from the field using a
handheld device 128 (such as a net-book or other portable computing device)
and may select video or graphic displays for viewing during training sessions.
Replays can be displayed on the handheld device, or on a larger display unit
such as the stadium scoreboard 130.
         [0133]     In American football, a minimum of one referee is assigned
to count the players on each team just prior to the snap of the ball. This is not
only a difficult task to perform correctly, given the time constraints, it also
deters this referee from watching other things immediately prior to the snap.
         [0134]     In one embodiment, system 100 continuously monitors the
number of players on each team and notifies referees via handheld devices
128 (via a tone, vibrating mechanism, etc.) when either team has too many
players on the field at the snap of the ball. The present method also provides
coaches with real-time access to players on the field as well as with specific
statistical data regarding their performance. Event spectators using their own
handheld devices, capable cell phones, etc., are provided access to a menu
of data options that display information such as such as who is on the field,
statistics, replays, and so forth.
         [0135]     Changes may be made in the above methods and systems
without departing from the scope thereof. It should thus be noted that the
matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying
drawings should be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. The
following claims are intended to cover generic and specific features described
herein, as well as all statements of the scope of the present method and
system, which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.

       dynamic play execution based upon a travel path of each of the plurality of
       participants during the play, wherein the step of comparing further comprises
       comparing the dynamic play execution against the plurality of standard formations
       in the database to identify the nearest standard formation.
   12. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, the step of comparing further
       comprising comparing individual paths of each of the plurality of participants
       against predefined paths of the standard formation.

   13. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, further comprising:
       for each segment of each individual path, identifying a deviation from the
               corresponding segment of the corresponding predefined path of the
               standard formation;
       logging the deviations in the database;
       generating correlated deviation play outcomes by correlating the identified
               deviations to play outcomes within the database;
       comparing the correlated deviation play outcomes against outcomes of standard
               formations; and
       generating a report indicating relative success of each of the identified deviations
               correlated with the correlated deviation play outcomes and the standard
               paths.
