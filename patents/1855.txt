                                     DETERGENT COMPOSITION
                                      FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention is in the field of detergents.       In particular, it relates to an automatic
   dishwashing detergent composition, more in particular to an automatic dishwashing detergent
 5 composition comprising a cleaning amine. The composition provides good cooked-, baked- and
   burnt-on soil removal.
                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Cooked-, baked- and burnt-on soils are amongst the most severe types of soils to remove from
   surfaces. Traditionally, the removal of cooked-, baked- and burnt-on soils from cookware and
 0 tableware requires soaking the soiled object prior to mechanical action. Apparently, the
   automatic dishwashing process alone does not provide a satisfactory removal of cooked-, baked
   and bumt-on soils.
   The removal of good cooked-, baked- and burnt-on soil is even more challenging when using a
   phosphate free detergent.
 5 The objective of the present invention is to provide an automatic dishwashing detergent
   composition capable to provide tough food removal, including cooked-, baked- and bumt-on
   soils.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an automatic dishwashing detergent
20 composition.     The composition comprises a cleaning surfactant and a cleaning amine.            The
   surfactant is selected from the group consisting of an anionic surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant,
   an amphoteric surfactant, and mixtures thereof.
   Traditionally, the only surfactants used in automatic dishwashing compositions are low foaming
   non-ionic surfactants.    These surfactants help with sheeting of the water and contribute to the
25 lack of filming and/or spotting that it is then reflected in better shine of the washed items. The
   present invention requires the presence of different types of surfactants for a different benefit. In
   the course of this work, it has been found out that the cleaning surfactants act synergistically in
   combination with the cleaning amines to provide though food soil removal.

                                                      2

   The amine of the invention is a cyclic amine with at least two primary amine functionalities.
   The primary amines can be in any position in the cycle but it has been found that in terms of
   grease cleaning better performance is obtained when the primary amines are in positions 1,3. It
   has also been found advantageous in terms of grease cleaning amines in which one of the
 5 substituents is -CH3 and the rest are H.
   The term "cleaning amine" herein encompasses a single cleaning amine and a mixture thereof.
   A "cleaning amine" herein means a molecule comprising amine functionalities that helps
   cleaning as part of a cleaning composition.
   The amine can be subjected to protonation depending on the pH of the cleaning medium in
 0 which it is used.
   Preferred cleaning amines include polyetheramines. One of the polyetheramine preferred for use
   in the composition of the invention is represented by the structure of Formula (I):

15 copper-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing catalysts, where the catalytically active material of the
   catalyst, before the reduction thereof with hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of
   aluminum, copper, nickel, and cobalt, and, in the range of from about 0.2 to about 5.0% by
   weight of oxygen compounds, of tin, calculated as SnO. Other suitable catalysts are supported
   copper-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing catalysts, where the catalytically active material of the
20 catalyst, before the reduction thereof with hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of
   aluminum, copper, nickel, cobalt and tin, and, in the range of from about 0.2 to about 5.0% by
   weight of oxygen compounds, of yttrium, lanthanum, cerium and/or hafnium, each calculated as

   about 0.1 to about 5 %by weight of oxygen-containing compounds of aluminium and/ or
   manganese, calculated as A12 0 3 and MnO 2 respectively.
   For the reductive amination step, a supported as well as non-supported catalyst may be used.
 5 The supported catalyst is obtained, for example, by deposition of the metallic components of the
   catalyst compositions onto support materials known to those skilled in the art, using techniques
   which are well-known in the art, including without limitation, known forms of alumina, silica,
   charcoal, carbon, graphite, clays, mordenites; and molecular sieves, to provide supported
   catalysts as well. When the catalyst is supported, the support particles of the catalyst may have
 o any geometric shape, for example spheres, tablets, or cylinders, in a regular or irregular version.
   The process may be carried out in a continuous or discontinuous mode, e.g. in an autoclave, tube
   reactor, or fixed-bed reactor. The feed thereto may be upflowing or downflowing, and design
   features in the reactor which optimize plug flow in the reactor may be employed. The degree of
   amination is from about 50% to about 100%, typically from about 60% to about 100%, and more

   The alkoxylated triol, such as alkoxylated glycerine or alkoxylated 1,1,1 -trimethylolpropane,
 5 may be prepared in a known manner by reaction of the low-molecular-weight triol with an
   alkylene oxide. Suitable alkylene oxides are linear or branched C2 -Ci 8 alkylene oxides, typically
   C2 -Cio alkylene oxides, more typically C2 -C6 alkylene oxides or C 2 -C 4 alkylene oxides. Suitable
   alkylene oxides include ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, pentene oxide, hexene
   oxide, decene oxide, and dodecene oxide. In some aspects, the C2 -Ci 8 alkylene oxide is selected
 0 from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, or a mixture thereof. In some aspects, the
   C2 -C18 alkylene oxide is butylene oxide, optionally in combination with other C2 -Ci 8 alkylene
   oxides.
   The low molecular weight triols, such as glycerine or 1,1,1 -trimethylolpropane, may be reacted
   with one single type of alkylene oxide or combinations of two or more different types of
15 alkylene oxides, e.g., ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. If two or more different types of
   alkylene oxides are used, the resulting alkoxylate may have a block-wise structure or a random
   structure.

   alkoxylation reaction is carried out is in the range of about 1:3 to about 1:10, more typically
20 about 1:3 to about 1:6, even more typically about 1:4 to about 1:6. In some aspects, the molar
   ratio of low-molecular-weight triol to C2 -C18 alkylene oxide at which the alkoxylation reaction is

   When the low-molecular-weight triol is 1,1,1 -trimethylolpropane, or when R of the triol of
   Formula (2) is a C2 alkyl and each of ki, k 2, and k3 are 1, the polyetheramine has a weight

                                                   23
   average molecular weight of from about 500 to about 1000, or to about 900, or to about 800
   grams/mole.
   The reaction is generally performed in the presence of a catalyst in an aqueous solution at a
   reaction temperature of from about 70'C to about 200'C, and typically from about 80'C to about
 5 160'C. This reaction may be performed at a pressure of up to about 10 bar, or up to about 8 bar.
   Examples of suitable catalysts are basic catalysts such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal
   hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal
   alkoxides, in particular sodium and potassium C 1-C 4-alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide,
   sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides,
 0 such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride, and alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium
   carbonate and potassium carbonate. Alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide and
   sodium hydroxide, are particularly suitable. Typical use amounts for the basic catalyst are from
   about 0.05 to about 10% by weight, in particular from about 0.1 to about 2% by weight, based on
   the total amount of the low-molecular-weight triol and the alkylene oxide.
 5 Amination
   Polyetheramines according to Formula (III) may be obtained by reductive amination of an
   alkoxylated triol, such as those described above, for example alkoxylated glycerine or
   alkoxylated 1,1,1 -trimethylolpropane, with ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst,
   such as a catalyst containing nickel. Suitable catalysts are described in WO 2011/067199 Al, in
zo W02011/067200 Al, and in EP0696572 Bl.
   The amination may be carried out in the presence of copper-, nickel- or cobalt-containing
   catalyst. Preferred catalysts are supported copper-, nickel- and cobalt-containing catalysts,
   wherein the catalytically active material of the catalysts, before the reduction thereof with
   hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of aluminium, copper, nickel and cobalt, and, in the
25 range of from about 0.2% to about 5.0% by weight, of oxygen compounds of tin, calculated as
   SnO. Other preferred catalysts are supported copper-, nickel- and cobalt-containing catalysts,
   wherein the catalytically active material of the catalysts, before the reduction thereof with
   hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of aluminium, copper, nickel, cobalt, tin, and, in the
   range of from about 0.2 to about 5.0% by weight, of oxygen compounds of yttrium, lanthanum,
30 cerium and/or hafnium, each calculated as Y2 0 3 , La 2 0 3 , Ce 2 0 3 and Hf 2 0 3 , respectively. Another
   suitable catalyst is a zirconium, copper, nickel catalyst, wherein the catalytically active

                                                  24
   composition comprises from about 20 to about 85 % by weight of oxygen-containing zirconium
   compounds, calculated as ZrO 2 , from about 1 to about 30% by weight of oxygen-containing
   compounds of copper, calculated as CuO, from about 30 to about 70 % by weight of oxygen
   containing compounds of nickel, calculated as NiO, from about 0.1 to about 5 % by weight of
 5 oxygen-containing compounds of aluminium and/ or manganese, calculated as Al20         3 and MnO 2 ,
   respectively.
   For the reductive amination step, a supported as well as a non-supported catalyst can be used.
   The supported catalyst may be obtained by deposition of the metallic components of the catalyst
   compositions onto support materials known to those skilled in the art, using techniques that are
 o well-known in the art, including, without limitation, known forms of alumina, silica, charcoal,
   carbon, graphite, clays, mordenites; molecular sieves may be used to provide supported catalysts
   as well. When the catalyst is supported, the support particles of the catalyst may have any
   geometric shape, for example, the shape of spheres, tablets, or cylinders in a regular or irregular
   version.
 5 The process can be carried out in a continuous or discontinuous mode, e.g., in an autoclave, tube
   reactor, or fixed-bed reactor. A number of reactor designs may be used. For example, the feed
   thereto may be upflowing or downflowing, and design features in the reactor that optimize plug
   flow in the reactor may be employed.
   The degree of amination may be from about 67% to about 100%, or from about 85% to about
 o 100%. The degree of amination is calculated from the total amine value (AZ) divided by sum of
   the total acetylables value (AC) and tertiary amine value (tert. AZ) multiplied by 100 (Total AZ /
   ((AC+tert. AZ)x100)).
           The total amine value (AZ) is determined according to DIN 16945.
           The total acetylables value (AC) is determined according to DIN 53240.
25         The secondary and tertiary amines are determined according to ASTM D2074-07.
           The hydroxyl value is calculated from (total acetylables value + tertiary amine value)
   total amine value.

   Non-ionic surfactant
   The composition of the invention can comprise a non-ionic surfactant or a non-ionic surfactant
 5 system, more preferably the non-ionic surfactant or a non-ionic surfactant system has a phase
   inversion temperature, as measured at a concentration of 1% in distilled water, between 40 and
   70"C, preferably between 45 and 65"C. By a "non-ionic surfactant system" is meant herein a
   mixture of two or more non-ionic surfactants. Preferred for use herein are non-ionic surfactant
   systems. They seem to have improved cleaning and finishing properties and better stability in
 0 product than single non-ionic surfactants.
   Phase inversion temperature is the temperature below which a surfactant, or a mixture thereof,
   partitions preferentially into the water phase as oil-swollen micelles and above which it partitions
   preferentially into the oil phase as water swollen inverted micelles. Phase inversion temperature
   can be determined visually by identifying at which temperature cloudiness occurs.
 5 The phase inversion temperature of a non-ionic surfactant or system can be determined as
   follows: a solution containing 1% of the corresponding surfactant or mixture by weight of the
   solution in distilled water is prepared.    The solution is stirred gently before phase inversion
   temperature analysis to ensure that the process occurs in chemical equilibrium. The phase
   inversion temperature is taken in a thermostable bath by immersing the solutions in 75 mm
20 sealed glass test tube. To ensure the absence of leakage, the test tube is weighed before and after
   phase inversion temperature measurement. The temperature is gradually increased at a rate of
   less than 1 C per minute, until the temperature reaches a few degrees below the pre-estimated
   phase inversion temperature. Phase inversion temperature is determined visually at the first sign
   of turbidity.
25 Suitable nonionic surfactants include: i) ethoxylated non-ionic surfactants prepared by the
   reaction of a monohydroxy alkanol or alkyphenol with 6 to 20 carbon atoms with preferably at

   Dekker, N.Y., 1973, incorporated herein by reference.
 5 Suds suppressors are preferably included in the automatic dishwashing detergent composition.
   The suds suppressor is included in the composition at a level of from about 0.0001% to about
   10%, in another embodiment from about 0.001% to about 5%, from about 0.01% to about 1.5%,
   from about 0.01 % to about 0. 5 %, by weight of the composition.
   Silicone based suds suppressor are quite suited for the compositions of the invention. Silicone
 0 suds suppressor technology and other defoaming agents useful herein are extensively
   documented in "Defoaming, Theory and Industrial Applications", Ed., P.R. Garrett, Marcel
   Dekker, N.Y., 1973, ISBN 0-8247-8770-6, incorporated herein by reference. See especially the
   chapters entitled "Foam control in Detergent Products" (Ferch et al) and "Surfactant Antifoams"
   (Blease et al). See also U.S. Patents 3,933,672 and 4,136,045. In one embodiment, the silicone
 5 based suds suppressors is polydimethylsiloxanes having trimethylsilyl, or alternate end blocking
   units may be used as the silicone. These may be compounded with silica and/or with surface
   active nonsilicon components, as illustrated by a suds suppressor comprising 12% silicone/silica,
   18% stearyl alcohol and 70% starch in granular form. A suitable commercial source of the
   silicone active compounds is Dow Corning Corp. Silicone based suds suppressors are useful in
 0 that the silica works well to suppress the foam generated by the high foaming non-ionic
   surfactant.

   polysiloxane compound having polyethylenoxy-propylenoxy group in the side chain, and a
   micro-powdery silica.
   A phosphate ester suds suppressor may also be used. Suitable alkyl phosphate esters contain
   from 16-20 carbon atoms. Such phosphate ester suds suppressors may be monostearyl acid
30 phosphate or monooleyl acid phosphate or salts thereof, in one embodiment alkali metal salts.
   Other suitable suds suppressors are calcium precipitating fatty acid soaps. However, it has been

                                                   31
    found to avoid the use of simple calcium-precipitating soaps as antifoams in the present
    composition as they tend to deposit on dishware. Indeed, fatty acid based soaps are not entirely
    free of such problems and the formulator will generally choose to minimize the content of
    potentially depositing antifoams in the instant composition.

   Manganese bleach catalysts are preferred for use in the composition of the invention. These
   catalysts in combination with the alkyl ether sulfate provide the best results in terms of removal
 5 of bleachable stains. Especially preferred catalyst for use here is a dinuclear manganese
   complex having the general formula:
                                                                       z

   wherein Mn is manganese which can individually be in the III or IV oxidation state; each x
   represents a coordinating or bridging species selected from the group consisting of H20, 022-,
20 02-, OH-, H02-, SH-, S2-, >SO, Cl-, N3-, SCN-, RCOO-, NH2- and NR3, with R being H, alkyl
   or aryl, (optionally substituted); L is a ligand which is an organic molecule containing a number
   of nitrogen atoms which coordinates via all or some of its nitrogen atoms to the manganese
   centres; z denotes the charge of the complex and is an integer which can be positive or negative;
   Y is a monovalent or multivalent counter-ion, leading to charge neutrality, which is dependent
25 upon the charge z of the complex; and q = z/[charge Y].
   Preferred manganese-complexes are those wherein x is either CH3COO- or 02 or mixtures
   thereof, most preferably wherein the manganese is in the IV oxidation state and x is 02-.

                                                  38
   Preferred ligands are those which coordinate via three nitrogen atoms to one of the manganese
   centres, preferably being of a macrocyclic nature. Particularly preferred ligands are:
   (1)     1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, (Me-TACN); and
   (2) 1,2,4,7-tetramethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, (Me-Me TACN).
 5 The type of counter-ion Y for charge neutrality is not critical for the activity of the complex and
   can be selected from, for example, any of the following counter-ions: chloride; sulfate; nitrate;
   methylsulfate; surfanctant anions, such as the long-chain alkylsulfates, alkylsulphonates,
   alkylbenzenesulphonates, tosylate, trifluoromethylsulphonate, perchlorate (Cl04-), BPh4-, and
   PF6-' though some counter-ions are more preferred than others for reasons of product property
 0 and safety.
   Consequently, the preferred manganese complexes useable in the present invention are:
   (I)     [(Me-TACN)MnIV(A p-0)3MnIV(Me-TACN)]2+(PF6-)2
   (II)    [(Me-MeTACN)MnIV(A p-0)3MnIV(Me-MeTACN)]2+(PF6-)2

   It is of note that the manganese complexes are also disclosed in EP-A-0458397 and EP-A
   0458398 as unusually effective bleach and oxidation catalysts. In the further description of this
   invention they will also be simply referred to as the "catalyst".

   composition.
   Enzyme related terminology
   Nomenclature for amino acid modifications
   In describing enzyme variants herein, the following nomenclature is used for ease of reference:
 0 Original amino acid(s):position(s):substituted amino acid(s).
   According to this nomenclature, for instance the substitution of glutamic acid for glycine in
   position 195 is shown as G195E. A deletion of glycine in the same position is shown as G195*,
   and insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as lysine is shown as G195GK. Where a
 5 specific enzyme contains a "deletion" in comparison with other enzyme and an insertion is made
   in such a position this is indicated as *36D for insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36.
   Multiple mutations are separated by pluses, i.e.: S99G+V102N, representing mutations in
   positions 99 and 102 substituting serine and valine for glycine and asparagine, respectively.
   Where the amino acid in a position (e.g. 102) may be substituted by another amino acid selected
 0 from a group of amino acids, e.g. the group consisting of N and I, this will be indicated by
   V102N/I.
   In all cases, the accepted IUPAC single letter or triple letter amino acid abbreviation is
   employed.

   Amino acid identity
   The relatedness between two amino acid sequences is described by the parameter "identity". For
   purposes of the present invention, the alignment of two amino acid sequences is determined by
 5 using the Needle program from the EMBOSS package (http://emboss.org) version 2.8.0. The
   Needle program implements the global alignment algorithm described in Needleman, S. B. and
   Wunsch, C. D. (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443-453. The substitution matrix used is BLOSUM62,
   gap opening penalty is 10, and gap extension penalty is 0.5.
   The degree of identity between an amino acid sequence of and enzyme used herein ("invention
10 sequence") and a different amino acid sequence ("foreign sequence") is calculated as the number
   of exact matches in an alignment of the two sequences, divided by the length of the "invention
   sequence" or the length of the "foreign sequence", whichever is the shortest. The result is
   expressed in percent identity. An exact match occurs when the "invention sequence" and the
   "foreign sequence" have identical amino acid residues in the same positions of the overlap. The
15 length of a sequence is the number of amino acid residues in the sequence.

   Unit dose form
   Preferably the composition of the invention is a unit-dose product. Products in unit dose form
   include tablets, capsules, sachets, pouches, injection moulded compartments, etc. Preferred for
 5 use herein are tablets and unit dose form wrapped with a water-soluble film (including wrapped
   tablets, capsules, sachets, pouches) and injection moulded containers. The unit dose form of the
   invention is preferably a water-soluble multi-compartment pack.
   Preferred packs comprise at least two side-by-side compartments superposed (i.e., placed above)
   onto another compartment, especially preferred are pouches. This disposition contributes to the
20 compactness, robustness and strength of the pack, additionally, it minimise the amount of water
   soluble material required. It only requires three pieces of material to form three compartments.
   The robustness of the pack allows also for the use of very thin films without compromising the
   physical integrity of the pack. The pack is also very easy to use because the compartments do not
   need to be folded to be used in machine dispensers of fix geometry. At least two of the
25 compartments of the pack contain two different compositions. By "different compositions"
   herein is meant compositions that differ in at least one ingredient.
   Preferably, at least one of the compartments contains a solid composition, preferably in powder
   form and another compartment a liquid composition, the compositions are preferably in a solid to
   liquid weight ratio of from about 20:1 to about 1:20, more preferably from about 18:1 to about
30 2:1 and even more preferably from about 15:1 to about 5:1. This kind of pack is very versatile
   because it can accommodate compositions having a broad spectrum of values of solid:liquid

                                                    45
   ratio. Particularly preferred have been found to be pouches having a high solid:liquid ratio
   because many of the detergent ingredients are most suitable for use in solid form, preferably in
   powder form. The ratio solid:liquid defined herein refers to the relationship between the weight
   of all the solid compositions and the weight of all the liquid compositions in the pack.
 5 Preferably solid:liquid weight ratio is from about 2:1 to about 18:1, more preferably from about
   5:1 to about 15:1. These weight ratios are suitable in cases in which most of the ingredients of
   the detergent are in liquid form.
   Preferably the two side-by-side compartments contain liquid compositions, which can be the
   same but preferably are different and another compartment contains a solid composition,
 o preferably in powder form, more preferably a densified powder. The solid composition
   contributes to the strength and robustness of the pack.
   For dispenser fit reasons, especially in an automatic dishwasher, the unit dose form products
   herein have a square or rectangular base and a height of from about 1 to about 5 cm, more
   preferably from about 1 to about 4 cm. Preferably the weight of the solid composition is from
 5 about 5 to about 20 grams, more preferably from about 10 to about 15 grams and the weight of
   the liquid compositions is from about 0.5 to about 4 grams, more preferably from about 0.8 to
   about 3 grams.
   In preferred embodiments, at least two of the films which form different compartments have
   different solubility, under the same conditions, releasing the content of the compositions which
zo they partially or totally envelope at different times.
   Controlled release of the ingredients of a multi-compartment pouch can be achieved by
   modifying the thickness of the film and/or the solubility of the film material. The solubility of
   the film material can be delayed by for example cross-linking the film as described in WO
   02/102,955 at pages 17 and 18. Other water-soluble films designed for rinse release are
25 described in US 4,765,916 and US 4,972,017. Waxy coating (see WO 95/29982) of films can
   help with rinse release.   pH controlled release means are described in WO 04/111178, in
   particular amino-acetylated polysaccharide having selective degree of acetylation.
   Other means of obtaining delayed release by multi-compartment pouches with different
   compartments, where the compartments are made of films having different solubility are taught
30 in WO 02/08380.

   In a 2 1 autoclave 322.6 g 2-Butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol and 7.9 g KOH (50% in water) were
   mixed and stirred under vacuum (<10 mbar) at 120'C for 2 h. The autoclave was purged with
   nitrogen and heated to 140'C. 467.8 g propylene oxide was added in portions within 6 h. To
10 complete the reaction, the mixture was allowed to post-react for additional 5 h at 140'C. The
   reaction mixture was stripped with nitrogen and volatile compounds were removed in vacuo at
   80'C. The catalyst potassium hydroxide was removed by adding 2.3 g synthetic magnesium
   silicate (Macrosorb MP5plus, Ineos Silicas Ltd.), stirring at 100'C for 2 h and filtration. A
   yellowish oil was obtained (772.0 g, hydroxy value: 248.5 mgKOH/g).

   In a 9 1 autoclave 600 g of the resulting diol mixture from step a), 1250 g THF and 1500 g
   ammonia were mixed in presence of 200 ml of a solid catalyst as described in EP0696572B1.
   The catalyst containing nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum and zirconium was in the form of
   3x3 mm tables. The autoclave was purged with hydrogen and the reaction was started by heating
 5 the autoclave. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 h at 205'C, 5 the total pressure was
   maintained at 270 bar by purging hydrogen during the entire reductive amination step. After
   cooling down the autoclave the final product was collected, filtered, vented of excess ammonia
   and stripped in a rotary evaporator to remove light amines and water. A total of 560 grams of a

   Methodology:
   Stainless steel slide preparation
15 To prepare the baked-on, burnt-on soil 6g of corn oil, 6g of peanut oil and 6g of sunflower oil
   were added into a glass beaker and continually stirred. While stirring, 2.5g of powdered albumin
   were added gradually. This mixture was allowed to stir for 1 hour.
   Each clean stainless steel slide was identified and its individual weight recorded. Then the soil
   was applied onto the slide, using a mini sponge roller to cover it across its length, leaving about
20 1-2cm from the top of the slide clean. The amount of soil added to each slide was about 0.065g
   (0.0025g).
   Once soil was applied, the soiled slides were laid on a metal baking tray and placed in a
   preheated oven at 160'C and baked for 2 hours. After this time elapsed the slides were removed

                                                50
  from the oven and allowed to cool down and finally the post-baked weight of all slides were
  taken and recorded.
  Six slides were placed in the bottom rack of a Miele 1022 dishwasher, three on each side of the
  dishwasher, clipping them into the rack prongs when necessary. The selected wash temperature
5 was 50'C using city water with water hardness of 8 USgpg. Each composition was run at least
  twice and no additional soil was added into the wash. At the end of the wash the slides were
  allowed to dry overnight and then weighed. Results are expressed gravimetrically as a % of soil
  removed from known weight of soil on slide, taking composition A as reference.
  The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as being strictly limited to
