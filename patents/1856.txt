 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to organic synthesis intermediates octyl aldehyde synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Octyl aldehyde is the intermediate of organic synthesis, which is one component
   of the rose head incense, it's also used for the orange flower, bitter orange, lemon and
10 citrus cologne type. It can also be used in imitation of trace cream, chocolate, apricot,
   plum, grape, lemon, orange, cheese and other food flavor. Octal aldehyde has a strong
   flavor of fruit and it has a pleasant aroma when sweet orange in extremely dilute, it
   mainly used for citrus flavor blending, drinks, ice cream, candy, bread etc in the
   dosage of 1.4-4.4ppm, but also can be used for soap, spices with detergent. However,
15 most of the existing synthesis methods are using the process that made by caprylic
   acid vapor mixed with excess formic acid vapor at the temperature of 300 C the
   manganese oxide. This method of production requires more than 300 C high
   temperature, high energy consumption, high requirements               of heat resistance
   equipment, equipment loss rate is high, the production cost is increased, and the
20 manganese oxide on the environmental pollution greatly, the cost of late pollution
   treatment is also higher. The synthesis method is not in accordance with the
   requirements of green energy saving, economy and environmental protection, and the
   process of synthesis is complicated. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new
   synthetic method.

 5 two chloropropane solution for several times, washed with the anhydrous two
   isopropyl propane solution for several times, recrystallized in the anhydrous xylene
   solution, dehydrated with dehydration, got the finished product octyl aldehyde.
         Preferably, the dehydration is activated alumina, any one of anhydrous potassium
   carbonate.
10       Throughout the reaction process can be the following reaction formula:
         CH3 (CH2 )6CH2          +   C51  100 2   + S2W                 1        CH 3 (CH 2 )6 CH

15 save energy consumption, reduce the equipment requirements of heat resistance,
   equipment loss rate is reduced, the production cost is reduced, meanwhile avoid the
   environmental pollution of manganese oxide on the adverse effects and reduce the
   follow-up pollution treatment cost, this method can meet the requirements of green
   energy economy and environmental protection, reduce a lot of intermediate links
20 reaction, decease the reaction time, and increase the reaction yield, at the same time,
   the present invention provides a new synthetic route which has laid a good foundation
   for further enhancing the yield of the reaction.
