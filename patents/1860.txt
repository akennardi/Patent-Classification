FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]           Methods and compositions of the invention relate to nucleic acid assembly, and
particularly to high fidelity, multiplex nucleic acid assembly reactions.
BACKGROUND
[0003]           Recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids have many applications in research,
industry, agriculture, and medicine. Recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids can be used to
express and obtain large amounts of polypeptides, including enzymes, antibodies, growth factors,
receptors, and other polypeptides that may be used for a variety of medical, industrial, or
agricultural purposes. Recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids also can be used to produce
genetically modified organisms including modified bacteria, yeast, mammals, plants, and other
organisms. Genetically modified organisms may be used in research (e.g., as animal models of
disease, as tools for understanding biological processes, etc.), in industry (e.g., as host organisms
for protein expression, as bioreactors for generating industrial products, as tools for
environmental remediation, for isolating or modifying natural compounds with industrial
applications, etc.), in agriculture (e.g., modified crops with increased yield or increased
resistance to disease or environmental stress, etc.), and for other applications. Recombinant and
synthetic nucleic acids also may be used as therapeutic compositions (e.g., for modifying gene
expression, for gene therapy, etc.) or as diagnostic tools (e.g., as probes for disease conditions,
etc.).
[0004]           Numerous techniques have been developed for modifying existing nucleic acids
(e.g., naturally occurring nucleic acids) to generate recombinant nucleic acids. For example,
                                                    1

     WO 2013/032850                                                          PCT/US2012/052036
combinations of nucleic acid amplification, mutagenesis, nuclease digestion, ligation, cloning
and other techniques may be used to produce many different
recombinant nucleic acids. Chemically synthesized polynucleotides are often used as primers or
adaptors for nucleic acid amplification, mutagenesis, and cloning.
[0005]          Techniques also are being developed for de novo nucleic acid assembly whereby
nucleic acids are made (e.g., chemically synthesized) and assembled to produce longer target
nucleic acids of interest. For example, different multiplex assembly techniques are being
developed for assembling oligonucleotides into larger synthetic nucleic acids that can be used in
research, industry, agriculture, and/or medicine. However, one limitation of currently available
assembly techniques is the relatively high error rate. As such, high fidelity, low cost assembly
methods are needed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 [0021]          Aspects of the invention relate to methods and compositions for covalently
joining a plurality of nucleic acid fragments to produce a longer nucleic acid product in a single
assembly step. Aspects of the invention can be used to assemble large numbers of nucleic acid
fragments efficiently, and/or to reduce the number of steps required to generate large nucleic
acid products, while reducing assembly error rate. Aspects of the invention can be incorporated
into nucleic assembly procedures to increase assembly fidelity, throughput and/or efficiency,
decrease cost, and/or reduce assembly time. In some embodiments, aspects of the invention may
be automated and/or implemented in a high throughput assembly context to facilitate parallel
production of many different target nucleic acid products.
Multiplex oligonucleotide assembly
 [0022]          A predetermined nucleic acid fragment may be assembled from a plurality of
different starting nucleic acids (e.g., oligonucleotides) in a multiplex assembly reaction (e.g., a
multiplex enzyme-mediated reaction, a multiplex chemical assembly reaction, or a combination
thereof). Certain aspects of multiplex nucleic acid assembly reactions are illustrated by the
following description of certain embodiments of multiplex
oligonucleotide assembly reactions. It should be appreciated that the description of the assembly
reactions in the context of oligonucleotides is not intended to be limiting. The assembly reactions
described herein may be performed using starting nucleic acids obtained from one or more
different sources (e.g., synthetic or natural polynucleotides, nucleic acid amplification products,
nucleic acid degradation products, oligonucleotides, etc.). The starting nucleic acids may be
referred to as assembly nucleic acids (e.g., assembly oligonucleotides). As used herein, an
assembly nucleic acid has a sequence that is designed to be incorporated into the nucleic acid
product generated during the assembly process. However, it should be appreciated that the
description of the assembly reactions in the context of double-stranded nucleic acids is not
intended to be limiting. In some embodiments, one or more of the starting nucleic acids
illustrated in the figures and described herein may be provided as single-stranded nucleic acids.
Accordingly, it should be appreciated that where the figures and description illustrate the
assembly of cohesive-end double-stranded nucleic acids, the presence of one or more single
stranded nucleic acids is contemplated.
                                                   5

      WO 2013/032850                                                          PCT/US2012/052036
[0023]           As used herein, an oligonucleotide may be a nucleic acid molecule comprising at
least two covalently bonded nucleotide residues. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may
be between 10 and 1 ,000 nucleotides long. For example, an oligonucleotide may be between 10
and 500 nucleotides long, or between 500 and 1,000 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, an
oligonucleotide may be between about 20 and about 300 nucleotides long (e.g., from about 30 to
250, 40 to 220, 50 to 200, 60 to 180, or about 65 or about 150 nucleotides long), between about
100 and about 200, between about 200 and about 300 nucleotides, between about 300 and about
400, or between about 400 and about 500 nucleotides long. However, shorter or longer
oligonucleotides may be used. An oligonucleotide may be a single-stranded nucleic acid.
However, in some embodiments a double-stranded oligonucleotide may be used as described
herein. In certain embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be chemically synthesized as described
in more detail below. In some embodiments, an input nucleic acid (e.g., synthetic
oligonucleotide) may be amplified before use. The resulting product may be double-stranded.
[0024]           In certain embodiments, each oligonucleotide may be designed to have a sequence
that is identical to a different portion of the sequence of a predetermined target nucleic acid that
is to be assembled. Accordingly, in some embodiments each oligonucleotide may have a
sequence that is identical to a portion of one of the two strands of a double-stranded target
nucleic acid. For clarity, the two complementary strands of a double stranded nucleic acid are
referred to herein as the positive (P) and negative (N) strands. This designation is not intended to
imply that the strands are sense and anti-sense strands of a coding sequence. They refer only to
the two complementary strands of a nucleic acid (e.g., a target nucleic acid, an intermediate
nucleic acid fragment, etc.) regardless of the sequence or function of the nucleic acid.
Accordingly, in some embodiments a P strand may be a sense strand of a coding sequence,
whereas in other embodiments a P strand may be an anti-sense strand of a coding sequence. It
should be appreciated that the reference to complementary nucleic acids or complementary
nucleic acid regions herein refers to nucleic acids or regions thereof that have sequences which
are reverse complements of each other so that they can hybridize in an antiparallel fashion
typical of natural DNA.
[0025]           According to one aspect of the invention, a target nucleic acid may be either the P
strand, the N strand, or a double-stranded nucleic acid comprising both the P and N strands. It
should be appreciated that different oligonucleotides may be designed to have different lengths.
                                                    6

     WO 2013/032850                                                           PCT/US2012/052036
In some embodiments, one or more different oligonucleotides may have overlapping sequence
regions (e.g., overlapping 5' regions and/or overlapping 3' regions). Overlapping sequence
regions may be identical (i.e., corresponding to the same strand of the nucleic acid fragment) or
complementary (i.e., corresponding to complementary strands of the nucleic acid fragment). The
plurality of oligonucleotides may include one or more oligonucleotide pairs with overlapping
identical sequence regions, one or more oligonucleotide pairs with overlapping complementary
sequence regions, or a combination thereof. Overlapping sequences may be of any suitable
length. For example, overlapping sequences may encompass the entire length of one or more
nucleic acids used in an assembly reaction. Overlapping sequences may be between about 2 and
about 50 (e.g., between 3 and 20, between 3 and 10, between 3 and 8, or 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.
nucleotides long). However, shorter, longer or intermediate overlapping lengths may be used. It
should be appreciated that overlaps between different input nucleic acids used in an assembly
reaction may have different lengths and/or sequences. For example, the overlapping sequences
may be different than one another by at least one nucleotide, 2 nucleotides, 3 nucleotides, or
more. Assuming that the overlapping sequences differ from one another by x nucleotides, then
up to ( 4 x+1) pieces of different input nucleic acids can be assembled together in one reaction.
[0026]           In a multiplex oligonucleotide assembly reaction designed to generate a
predetermined nucleic acid fragment, the combined sequences of the different oligonucleotides
in the reaction may span the sequence of the entire nucleic acid fragment on either the positive
strand, the negative strand, both strands, or a combination of portions of the positive strand and
portions of the negative strand. The plurality of different oligonucleotides may provide either
positive sequences, negative sequences, or a combination of both positive and negative
sequences corresponding to the entire sequence of the nucleic acid fragment to be assembled. In
some embodiments, the plurality of oligonucleotides may include one or more oligonucleotides
having sequences identical to one or more portions of the positive sequence, and one or more
oligonucleotides having sequences that are identical to one or more portions of the negative
sequence of the nucleic acid fragment. One or more pairs of different oligonucleotides may
include sequences that are identical to overlapping portions of the predetermined nucleic acid
fragment sequence as described herein (e.g., overlapping sequence portions from the same or
from complementary strands of the nucleic acid fragment). In some embodiments, the plurality
of oligonucleotides includes a set of oligonucleotides having sequences that combine to span the
                                                    7

      WO 2013/032850                                                            PCT/US2012/052036
entire positive sequence and a set oligonucleotides having sequences that combine to span the
entire negative sequence of the predetermined nucleic acid fragment. However, in certain
embodiments, the plurality of oligonucleotides may include one or more oligonucleotides with
sequences that are identical to sequence portions on one strand (either the positive or negative
strand) of the nucleic acid fragment, but no oligonucleotides with sequences that are
complementary to those sequence portions. In one embodiment, a plurality of oligonucleotides
includes only oligonucleotides having sequences identical to portions of the positive sequence of
the predetermined nucleic acid fragment. In one embodiment, a plurality of oligonucleotides
includes only oligonucleotides having sequences identical to portions of the negative sequence of
the predetermined nucleic acid fragment. These oligonucleotides may be assembled by
sequential ligation or in an extension-based reaction (e.g., if an oligonucleotide having a 3'
region that is complementary to one of the plurality of oligonucleotides is added to the reaction).
[0027]           In one aspect, a nucleic acid fragment may be assembled in a ligase-mediated
assembly reaction from a plurality of oligonucleotides that are combined and ligated in one or
more rounds of ligase-mediated ligations. Ligase-based assembly techniques may involve one or
more suitable ligase enzymes that can catalyze the covalent linking of adjacent 3' and 5' nucleic
acid termini (e.g., a 5' phosphate and a 3' hydroxyl of nucleic acid(s) annealed on a
complementary template nucleic acid such that the 3' terminus is immediately adjacent to the 5'
terminus). Accordingly, a ligase may catalyze a ligation reaction between the 5' phosphate of a
first nucleic acid to the 3' hydroxyl of a second nucleic acid if the first and second nucleic acids
are annealed next to each other on a template nucleic acid). A ligase may be obtained from
recombinant or natural sources. In some embodiments, one or more low temperature (e.g., room
temperature or lower) ligases may be used (e.g., T3 DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase, T7 DNA ligase,
and/or E. coli DNA Ligase). A lower temperature ligase may be useful for shorter overhangs
(e.g., about 3, about 4, about 5, or about 6 base overhangs) that may not be stable at higher
temperatures. A ligase may also be a heat-stable ligase. In some embodiments, a thermostable
ligase from a thermophilic organism may be used. Examples of thermostable DNA ligases
include, but are not limited to: Tth DNA ligase (from Thermus thermophilics, available from, for
example, Eurogentec and GeneCraft); Pfu DNA ligase (a hyperthermophilic ligase from
Pyrococcus furiosus); Taq ligase (from Thermus aquaticus), any other suitable heat-stable ligase,
or any combination thereof.

[0028]          Aspects of the invention may be used to enhance different types of nucleic acid
assembly reactions (e.g., multiplex nucleic acid assembly reactions). Aspects of the invention
may be used in combination with one or more assembly reactions described in, for example, Carr

incorporated herein by reference. Certain embodiments of multiplex nucleic acid assembly
reactions for generating a predetermined nucleic acid fragment are illustrated with reference to
FIGS. 1-10. It should be appreciated that synthesis and assembly methods described herein
(including, for example, oligonucleotide synthesis, step-wise assembly, multiplex nucleic acid
assembly, hierarchical assembly of nucleic acid fragments, or any combination thereof) may be
performed in any suitable format, including in a reaction tube, in a multi-well plate, on a surface,
on a column, in a microfluidic device (e.g., a microfluidic tube), a capillary tube, etc. For
example, some embodiments, the target nucleic acid can be assembled by "recursive assembly"
or "hierarchical assembly." In this embodiment, the target nucleic acid is divided first into two
or more overlapping nucleic acid fragments (or subassembly fragments). Each nucleic acid
fragments is then subdivided into two or more overlapping smaller nucleic acid fragments.
Synthetic Oligonucleotides
[0029]          Oligonucleotides may be synthesized using any suitable technique. For example,
oligonucleotides may be synthesized on a column or other support (e.g., a chip).
Examples of chip-based synthesis techniques include techniques used in synthesis devices or
methods available from CombiMatrix, Agilent, Affymetrix, or other sources. A synthetic
oligonucleotide may be of any suitable size, for example between 10 and 1,000 nucleotides long
(e.g., between 10 and 200, 200 and 500, 500 and 1,000
nucleotides long, or any combination thereof). An assembly reaction may include a plurality of
oligonucleotides, each of which independently may be between 10 and 300 nucleotides in length
(e.g., between 20 and 250, between 30 and 200, 50 to 150, 50 to 100, or any intermediate number
                                                  9

      WO 2013/032850                                                             PCT/US2012/052036
of nucleotides). However, one or more shorter or longer oligonucleotides may be used in certain
embodiments.
[0030]          As used herein, the term "support" and "substrate" are used interchangeably and
refers to a porous or non-porous solvent insoluble material on which polymers such as nucleic
acids are synthesized or immobilized. As used herein "porous" means that the material contains
pores having substantially uniform diameters (for example in the nm range). Porous materials
can include but are not limited to, paper, synthetic filters and the like. In such porous materials,
the reaction may take place within the pores. The support can have any one of a number of
shapes, such as pin, strip, plate, disk, rod, bends, cylindrical structure, particle, including bead,
nanoparticle and the like. The support can have variable widths.
[0031]          The support can be hydrophilic or capable of being rendered hydrophilic. The
support can include inorganic powders such as silica, magnesium sulfate, and alumina; natural
polymeric materials, particularly cellulosic materials and materials derived from cellulose, such
as fiber containing papers, e.g., filter paper, chromatographic paper, etc.; synthetic or modified
naturally occurring polymers, such as nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, poly (vinyl chloride),
polyacrylamide, cross linked dextran, agarose, polyacrylate, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly
(4-methylbutene), polystyrene, polymethacrylate, poly(ethylene terephthalate), nylon, poly(vinyl
butyrate), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, glass, controlled pore glass, magnetic
controlled pore glass, ceramics, metals, and the like; either used by themselves or in conjunction
with other materials.
[0032]          In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are synthesized on an array format. For
example, single-stranded oligonucleotides are synthesized in situ on a common support wherein
each oligonucleotide is synthesized on a separate or discrete feature (or spot) on the substrate. In
preferred embodiments, single-stranded oligonucleotides are bound to the surface of the support
or feature. As used herein, the term "array" refers to an arrangement of discrete features for
storing, routing, amplifying and releasing oligonucleotides or complementary oligonucleotides
for further reactions. In a preferred embodiment, the support or array is addressable: the support
includes two or more discrete addressable features at a particular predetermined location (i.e., an
"address") on the support. Therefore, each oligonucleotide molecule of the array is localized to a

determined from its position on the support. Moreover, addressable supports or arrays enable the

direct control of individual isolated volumes such as droplets. The size of the defined feature can
be chosen to allow formation of a microvolume droplet on the feature, each droplet being kept
separate from each other. As described herein, features are typically, but need not be, separated
by interfeature spaces to ensure that droplets between two adjacent features do not merge.
Interfeatures will typically not carry any oligonucleotide on their surface and will correspond to
inert space. In some embodiments, features and interfeatures may differ in their hydrophilicity
or hydrophobicity properties. In some embodiments, features and interfeatures may comprise a
modifier as described herein.
[0033]          Arrays may be constructed, custom ordered or purchased from a commercial
vendor (e.g., CombiMatrix, Agilent, Affymetrix, Nimblegen). Oligonucleotides are attached,
spotted, immobilized, surface-bound, supported or synthesized on the discrete features of the
surface or array. Oligonucleotides may be covalently attached to the surface or deposited on the
surface. Various methods of construction are well known in the art, e.g., maskless array
synthesizers, light directed methods utilizing masks, flow channel methods, spotting methods
etc.
[0034]          In some embodiments, construction and/or selection oligonucleotides may be
synthesized on a solid support using maskless array synthesizer (MAS). Maskless array
synthesizers are described, for example, in PCT application No. WO 99/42813 and in
corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 6,375,903. Other examples are known of maskless instruments
which can fabricate a custom DNA microarray in which each of the features in the array has a
single-stranded DNA molecule of desired sequence.
[0035]          Other methods for synthesizing construction and/or selection oligonucleotides
include, for example, light-directed methods utilizing masks, flow channel methods, spotting
methods, pin-based methods, and methods utilizing multiple supports.
[0036]          Light directed methods utilizing masks (e.g., VLSIPS TM methods) for the
synthesis of oligonucleotides is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,143,854; 5,510,270
and 5,527,681. These methods involve activating predefined regions of a solid support and then
contacting the support with a preselected monomer solution. Selected regions can be activated
by irradiation with a light source through a mask much in the manner of photolithography
techniques used in integrated circuit fabrication. Other regions of the support remain inactive
because illumination is blocked by the mask and they remain chemically protected. Thus, a light
                                                  11

     WO 2013/032850                                                           PCT/US2012/052036
pattern defines which regions of the support react with a given monomer. By repeatedly
activating different sets of predefined regions and contacting different monomer solutions with
the support, a diverse array of polymers is produced on the support. Other steps, such as
washing unreacted monomer solution from the support, can be optionally used. Other applicable
methods include mechanical techniques such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261.
[0037]          Additional methods applicable to synthesis of construction and/or selection
oligonucleotides on a single support are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261. For
example, reagents may be delivered to the support by either (1) flowing within a channel defined
on predefined regions or (2) "spotting" on predefined regions. Other approaches, as well as
combinations of spotting and flowing, may be employed as well. In each instance, certain
activated regions of the support are mechanically separated from other regions when the
monomer solutions are delivered to the various reaction sites. Flow channel methods involve,
for example, microfluidic systems to control synthesis of oligonucleotides on a solid support.
For example, diverse polymer sequences may be synthesized at selected regions of a solid
support by forming flow channels on a surface of the support through which appropriate reagents
flow or in which appropriate reagents are placed. Spotting methods for preparation of
oligonucleotides on a solid support involve delivering reactants in relatively small quantities by
directly depositing them in selected regions. In some steps, the entire support surface can be
sprayed or otherwise coated with a solution, if it is more efficient to do so. Precisely measured
aliquots of monomer solutions may be deposited dropwise by a dispenser that moves from region
to region.
[0038]          Pin-based methods for synthesis of oligonucleotides on a solid support are
described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514. Pin-based methods utilize a support having a
plurality of pins or other extensions. The pins are each inserted simultaneously into individual
reagent containers in a tray. An array of 96 pins is commonly utilized with a 96-container tray,
such as a 96-wells microtiter dish. Each tray is filled with a particular reagent for coupling in a
particular chemical reaction on an individual pin. Accordingly, the trays will often contain
different reagents. Since the chemical reactions have been optimized such that each of the
reactions can be performed under a relatively similar set of reaction conditions, it becomes
possible to conduct multiple chemical coupling steps simultaneously.

[0039]           Other suitable microarrays and methods for synthesizing oligonucleotides include
those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,323,320 and 7,563,600, the entire disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In an example, the oligonucleotides
synthesized therefrom are chemically, enzymatically, or physically cleaved or otherwise released
from the microarrays for further amplification, restriction enzyme digestion and/or assembly.
[0040]           In another embodiment, a plurality of oligonucleotides may be synthesized or
immobilized (e.g. attached) on multiple supports, such as beads. One example is a bead based
synthesis method which is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,358; 5,639,603; and
5,541,061. For the synthesis of molecules such as oligonucleotides on beads, a large plurality of
beads is suspended in a suitable carrier (such as water) in a container. The beads are provided
with optional spacer molecules having an active site to which is complexed, optionally, a
protecting group. At each step of the synthesis, the beads are divided for coupling into a
plurality of containers. After the nascent oligonucleotide chains are deprotected, a different
monomer solution is added to each container, so that on all beads in a given container, the same
nucleotide addition reaction occurs. The beads are then washed of excess reagents, pooled in a
single container, mixed and re-distributed into another plurality of containers in preparation for
the next round of synthesis. It should be noted that by virtue of the large number of beads
utilized at the outset, there will similarly be a large number of beads randomly dispersed in the
container, each having a unique oligonucleotide sequence synthesized on a surface thereof after
numerous rounds of randomized addition of bases. An individual bead may be tagged with a
sequence which is unique to the double-stranded oligonucleotide thereon, to allow for
identification during use.
[0041]           In yet another embodiment, a plurality of oligonucleotides may be attached or
synthesized on nanoparticles. Nanoparticles includes but are not limited to metal (e.g., gold,
silver, copper and platinum), semiconductor (e.g., CdSe, CdS, and CdS coated with ZnS) and
magnetic (e.g., ferromagnetite) colloidal materials. Methods to attach oligonucleotides to the
nanoparticles are known in the art. In another embodiment, nanoparticles are attached to the
substrate. Nanoparticles with or without immobilized oligonucleotides can be attached to
substrates as described in, e.g., Grabar et al., Analyt. Chem., 67, 73-743 (1995); Bethell et al., J.
Electroanal. Chem., 409, 137 (1996); Bar et al., Langmuir, 12, 1172 (1996); Colvin et al., J. Am.

herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. In some embodiments, pre-synthesized
oligonucleotides are attached to a support or are synthesized using a spotting methodology
wherein monomers solutions are deposited dropwise by a dispenser that moves from region to
region (e.g., ink jet). In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are spotted on a support using, for
example, a mechanical wave actuated dispenser.
[0043]          A preparation of an oligonucleotide designed to have a certain sequence may
include oligonucleotide molecules having the designed sequence in addition to oligonucleotide
molecules that contain errors (e.g., that differ from the designed sequence at least at one
position). A sequence error may include one or more nucleotide deletions, additions,
substitutions (e.g., transversion or transition), inversions, duplications, or any combination of
two or more thereof. Oligonucleotide errors may be generated during oligonucleotide synthesis.
Different synthetic techniques may be prone to different error profiles and frequencies. In some
embodiments, error rates may vary from 1/10 to 1/200 errors per base depending on the synthesis
protocol that is used. However, in some embodiments, lower error rates may be achieved. Also,
the types of errors may depend on the synthetic techniques that are used. For example, in some
embodiments chip-based oligonucleotide synthesis may result in relatively more deletions than
column-based synthetic techniques.

      WO 2013/032850                                                         PCT/US2012/052036
[0044]           In some embodiments, one or more oligonucleotide preparations may be
subjected to an error reduction or error filtration process to remove (or reduce the number or the
frequency of) error-containing oligonucleotides. Such process can be used to increase the
number of error-free oligonucleotides in the oligonucleotide preparations. Methods for
conducting error reduction or error filtration can include, for example, hybridization to a
selection oligonucleotide, binding to a mismatch binding agent or to a mismatch binding protein
or combinations thereof.
[0045]           In some embodiments, a hybridization technique may be used wherein an
oligonucleotide preparation (i.e. construction oligonucleotides) is hybridized under stringent
conditions, one or more times, to an immobilized oligonucleotide preparation (i.e. selection
oligonucleotides) designed to have a complementary sequence. The term "selection
oligonucleotide" as used herein refers to a single-stranded oligonucleotide that is complementary
to at least a portion of a construction oligonucleotide (or the complement of the construction
oligonucleotide). Selection oligonucleotides may be used for removing copies of a construction
oligonucleotide that contain sequencing errors (e.g., a deviation from the desired sequence) from
a pool of construction oligonucleotides. In some embodiments, a selection oligonucleotide may
be end immobilized on a substrate. Yet in other embodiments, the selection oligonucleotides can
be in solution. In one embodiment, selection oligonucleotides can be synthetic oligonucleotides
that have been synthesized in parallel on a substrate as disclosed herein.
[0046]           Construction oligonucleotides that do not bind or that form unstable duplexes
may be removed in order to selectively or specifically remove error-containing oligonucleotides
that would destabilize hybridization under the conditions used. It should be appreciated that this
process may not remove all error-containing oligonucleotides since some error-containing
oligonucleotides may still bind to the immobilized selection oligonucleotides with sufficient
affinity through this selection process. For example, the error-containing oligonucleotides may
differ from the selection oligonucleotide by one or two bases and may still bind to the selection
oligonucleotides under the selection process reaction conditions. .
[0047]           In some embodiments, a nucleic acid binding protein or recombinase (e.g., RecA)
may be included in one or more of the oligonucleotide processing steps to improve the selection
of error-free oligonucleotides. For example, by preferentially promoting the hybridization of
oligonucleotides that are completely complementary with the
                                                   15

immobilized oligonucleotides, the amount of error-containing oligonucleotides that are bound
may be reduced. As a result, the oligonucleotide processing procedure described herein may
remove more error-containing oligonucleotides and generate an oligonucleotide preparation that
has a lower error frequency (e.g., with an error rate of less than 1/50, less than 1/100, less than
1/200, less than 1/300, less than 1/400, less than 1/500, less than 1/1,000, or less than 1/2,000
errors per base).
[0048]          In some embodiments, error correction may be included between each process
repetition and at the end of the synthesis process to increase the relative population of
synthesized polynucleotides without deviation from the desired sequences. Such error correction
may include direct sequencing and/or the application of error correction based on correcting
enzymes, such as error correcting nucleases (e.g. CEL I), error correction based on MutS or
MutS homologs binding or other mismatch binding proteins (see, e.g., International Application
No. PCT/US2010/057405), other means of error correction as known in the art or any
combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, CEL I may be added to the oligonucleotide
duplexes in the fluid medium. CEL I is a mismatch specific endonuclease that cleaves all types
of mismatches such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions or deletions. Addition
of the endonuclease results in the cleavage of the double-stranded oligonucleotides at the site or
region of the mismatch.
[0049]          It should be appreciated that one or more nucleic acid binding proteins or
recombinases are preferably not included in a post-synthesis fidelity optimization technique (e.g.,
a screening technique using a MutS or MutS homolog), because the optimization procedure
involves removing error-containing nucleic acids via the production and removal of
heteroduplexes. Accordingly, any nucleic acid binding proteins or recombinases (e.g., RecA) that
were included in the synthesis steps is preferably removed (e.g., by inactivation, column
purification or other suitable technique) after synthesis and prior to fidelity optimization.
[0050]          In certain embodiments, it may be helpful to include one or more modified
oligonucleotides. An oligonucleotide may be modified by incorporating a modified-base (e.g., a
nucleotide analog) during synthesis, by modifying the oligonucleotide after synthesis, or any
combination thereof. Examples of modifications include, but are not limited to, one or more of
the following: universal bases such as nitro indoles, dP and dK, inosine, uracil; halogenated
bases such as BrdU; fluorescent labeled bases; non-radioactive labels such as biotin (as a

post-coupling modification such as dR-NH2 (deoxyribose-NEb); Acridine (6-chloro-2

"arm" into the sequence, such as C3, C8 (octanediol), C9, C12, HEG (hexaethlene glycol) and
C18.
Amplifying Oligonucleotides
[0051]          Oligonucleotides may be provided or synthesized as single-stranded synthetic
products. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides may also be provided or synthesized as
double-stranded preparations including an annealed complementary strand. Oligonucleotides
may be molecules of DNA, RNA, PNA, or any combination thereof. A double-stranded
oligonucleotide may be produced by amplifying a single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide or
other suitable template (e.g., a sequence in a nucleic acid preparation such as a nucleic acid
vector or genomic nucleic acid). Accordingly, a plurality of oligonucleotides designed to have
the sequence features described herein may be provided as a plurality of single-stranded
oligonucleotides having those feature, or also may be provided along with complementary
oligonucleotides. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be phosphorylated (e.g., with a
5' phosphate). In some
embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be non-phosphorylated.
[0052]          In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be amplified using an appropriate
primer pair with one primer corresponding to each end of the oligonucleotide (e.g., one that is
complementary to the 3' end of the oligonucleotide and one that is identical to the 5' end of the
oligonucleotide). In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be designed to contain a central
assembly sequence (designed to be incorporated into the target nucleic acid) flanked by a 5'
amplification sequence (e.g., a 5' universal sequence) and/or a 3' amplification sequence (e.g., a
3' universal sequence). Amplification primers (e.g., between 10 and 50 nucleotides long, between
15 and 45 nucleotides long, about 25 nucleotides long, etc.) corresponding to the flanking
amplification sequences may be used to amplify the oligonucleotide (e.g., one primer may be
complementary to the 3' amplification sequence and one primer may have the same sequence as
the 5' amplification sequence). The amplification sequences then may be removed from the
                                                 17

amplified oligonucleotide using any suitable technique to produce an oligonucleotide that
contains only the assembly sequence.
[0053]           In some embodiments, a plurality of different oligonucleotides (e.g., about 5, 10,
50, 100, or more) with different central assembly sequences may have identical 5' amplification
sequences and/or identical 3' amplification sequences. These oligonucleotides can all be
amplified in the same reaction using the same amplification primers.
[0054]           A plurality of oligonucleotides used in an assembly reaction may contain
preparations of synthetic oligonucleotides, single-stranded oligonucleotides, double-stranded
oligonucleotides, amplification products, oligonucleotides that are processed to remove (or
reduce the frequency of) error-containing variants, etc., or any combination of two or more
thereof. In some aspects, double-stranded amplification products may be used as assembly
oligonucleotides and added to an assembly reaction as described herein. In some embodiments,
the oligonucleotide may be amplified while it is still attached to the support. In some
embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be removed or cleaved from the support prior to
amplification or after amplification.
[0055]           In some embodiments, a synthetic oligonucleotide may include a central assembly
sequence flanked by 5' and 3' amplification sequences. The central assembly sequence is
designed for incorporation into an assembled target nucleic acid or target subassembly. The
flanking sequences are designed for amplification and are not intended to be incorporated into
the assembled nucleic acid. The flanking amplification sequences may be used as universal
primer sequences to amplify a plurality of different assembly oligonucleotides that share the
same amplification sequences but have different central assembly sequences. In some
embodiments, the flanking sequences are removed after amplification to produce an
oligonucleotide that contains only the assembly sequence.
[0056]           In certain embodiments, the double-stranded amplification products may be
subject to restriction enzyme digestion to remove the flanking sequences. To that end, the
flanking sequences can be designed to include one or more restriction sites or restriction enzyme
recognition sites. The restriction site may be present at the 5' or 3' end of the amplification
sequence as long as the cleavage site is between the flanking sequence to be removed and the
central assembly sequence. The restriction site may be included in the amplification sequence
(i.e., primer binding site). The restriction site may also be outside the amplification sequence.

[0057]           After restriction enzyme digestion, the cleaved flanking sequences may be
separated and removed using any suitable technique. In some embodiments, the cleaved
flanking sequences may be fragments less than about 40, about 35, about 30, about 25, about 20,
or about 15 bases long. As such, size dependent separation techniques known in the art may be
used, such as differential affinity to silica, size filtration, differential precipitation with PEG
(polyethylene glycol) or CTAB (cetyltrimethlyammonium bromide), or any combination thereof,
so as to separate the cleaved flanking sequences from the central assembly sequences that can be
designed to be longer in size than the flanking sequences.
[0058]           In some embodiments, the amplification primers may be biotinylated. The
resulting amplification products thus also become biotinylated at both ends. Upon restriction
enzyme digestion, the cleaved flanking sequences having the biotinylated primers retain the
biotin tags, while the central assembly sequences are non-biotinylated. Thus, the cleaved
flanking sequences can be affinity purified and removed using streptavidin (e.g., bound to a
bead, column, or other surface). In some embodiments, the amplification primers also may be
designed to include certain sequence features (e.g., restriction sites) that can be used to remove
the primer regions after amplification in order to produce a double-stranded assembly fragment
that includes the assembly sequence without the flanking amplification sequences.
Single-stranded Overhangs
[0059]           Certain aspects of the invention involve double-stranded nucleic acids with
single-stranded overhangs. Overhangs may be generated using any suitable technique. In some
embodiments, a double-stranded nucleic acid fragment (e.g., a fragment assembled in a multiplex
assembly) may be digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme to generate a terminal single
stranded overhang. In some embodiments, fragments that are designed to be adjacent to each
other in an assembled product may be digested with the same enzyme to expose complementary
overhangs. Different enzymes that generate complementary overhangs may also used.
[0060]           In some embodiments, overhangs may be generated using a type IIS restriction
enzyme. Type IIS restriction enzymes are enzymes that bind to a double-stranded nucleic acid at
one site, referred to as the recognition site, and make a single double stranded cut outside of the
recognition site. The double stranded cut, referred to as the cleavage site, is generally situated 0
20 bases away from the recognition site. The recognition site is generally about 4-8 bp long. All
                                                     19

type IIS restriction enzymes exhibit at least partial asymmetric recognition. Asymmetric
recognition means that 5'--3' recognition sequences are different for each strand of the nucleic
acid. The enzyme activity also shows polarity meaning that the cleavage sites are located on
only one side of the recognition site. Thus, there is generally only one double stranded cut
corresponding to each recognition site. Cleavage generally produces 1-6 nucleotide single
stranded overhangs, with 5' or 3' termini, although some enzymes produce blunt ends. Either cut
is useful in the context of the invention, although in some instances those producing single
stranded overhangs are produced. To date, about 80 type IIS enzymes have been identified.

BsmB I, BspQ I, BtgZ I, BsmF I, Fok I, Bbv I, any variant thereof, or any combination thereof
can be used. Such enzymes and information regarding their recognition and cleavage sites are
available from commercial suppliers such as New England Biolabs.
[0061]           In some embodiments, each of a plurality of nucleic acid fragments designed for
assembly may have a type IIS restriction site at each end. The type IIS restriction sites may be
oriented so that the cleavage sites are internal relative to the recognition sequences. As a result,
enzyme digestion exposes an internal sequence (e.g., an overhang within an internal sequence)
and removes the recognition sequences from the ends. Accordingly, the same type IIS sites may
be used for both ends of all of the nucleic acid fragments being prepared for assembly.
However, different type IIS sites also may be used. Two fragments that are designed to be
adjacent in an assembled product each may include an identical overlapping terminal sequence
and a flanking type IIS site that is appropriately located to expose complementary overhangs
within the overlapping sequence upon restriction enzyme digestion. Accordingly, a plurality of
nucleic acid fragments may be generated with different complementary overhangs. The
restriction site at each end of a nucleic acid fragment may be located such that digestion with the
appropriate type IIS enzyme removes the restriction site and exposes a single-stranded region

      WO 2013/032850                                                           PCT/US2012/052036
that is complementary to a single-stranded region on a nucleic acid fragment that is designed to
be adjacent in the assembled nucleic acid product. In certain embodiments, restriction enzymes
can be selected such that the assembly nucleic acid fragments are free of the corresponding
restriction sites.
[0062]           As discussed above, restriction sites can be placed inside or outside, 5' or 3' to the
amplification sequence. As Figure 9A illustrates, restriction sites (shown in bold) can be
included within the amplification sequence (shown in italic) and distal to the central assembly
fragment (black). By way of example, BtgZI and BsmFI sites are used at either end of the
double-stranded assembly fragment, and their respective cleavage sites are indicated by arrows.
BtgZI and BsmFI both cleave at 10 nucleotides/14 nucleotides away from their recognition sites.
Other restriction enzymes that cleave at a short distance (e.g., 5-25, 10-20, or about 15
nucleotides) from the recognition site can also be used. Alternatively, as Figure 9B illustrates,
restriction sites (shown in bold) can be outside the amplification sequence (shown in italic) and
proximal to the central assembly fragment (normal font). BsaI sites are used at both ends of the
double-stranded assembly fragment as an example, the cleavage sites of which are also indicated
by arrows. As can be seen from Figures 9A and 9B, when restriction sites are placed distal to the
central assembly fragment and included in the amplification sequence, the overall length of the
starting nucleic acid is shorter than when restriction sites are placed proximal to the central
assembly fragment and not included in the amplification sequence. Thus the first strategy
(Figure 9A) can be more cost efficient and less error prone for synthesizing shorter starting
nucleic acids (e.g., on a chip). The first strategy also uses shorter universal primers (for
amplifying the fragments) and thus further reduces costs. After restriction enzyme digestion, the
end pieces to be removed from the central assembly fragments are also shorter and thus are
easier, cheaper and faster to remove in the first strategy than the second.
[0063]           Enzymatic digestions of DNA with type IIS or other site-specific restriction
enzymes typically generate an overhang of four to six nucleotides. It is unexpectedly shown in
this invention, that these short cohesive ends are sufficient for ligating multiple nucleic acid
fragments containing complementary termini to form the target nucleic acid. Conventionally to
ensure efficiency, a ligation reaction typically involves two fragments as ligation efficiency
significantly decreases with three or more fragments. In addition, longer cohesive ends are
required by conventional methods to improve specificity as mismatch often occurs.
                                                  21

      WO 2013/032850                                                                PCT/US2012/052036
Furthermore, to select for the correct ligation product, a labor-intensive and time-consuming
cloning and screening process is required.
[0064]           The present invention provides for, among other things: (1) successful ligation of
multiple fragments (e.g., at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, or more) in a single
reaction (e.g. single pool); (2) quick and inexpensive ligation reaction (e.g., 30 minutes at room
temperature); (3) high specificity which discriminates mismatches; and (4) quick PCR step to
select the correct product, without requiring cloning and screening. Another advantage of the
present invention is the ability to directly use synthetic oligonucleotides of commercially
available chips or microarray to construct any target nucleic acid of interest, which can be of any
sequence and/or any length (e.g., at least 500 bp, at least 1 kb, at least 2 kb, at least 5 kb, at least
10 kb, or longer). Such synthetic oligonucleotides can be of substantially the same size (e.g.,
about 50 bases, about 100 bases, about 200 bases, about 300 bases, or longer), and thus afford
ease to handle.
[0065]           In one example, assuming each oligonucleotide or fragment on the chip has a
payload of 100 nucleotides and the fragments have 4-base overhangs, if the number of fragments
is n, then ligation product length=(n * 100)-(4*(n-1)), with (n-1) ligation junctions. It should be
noted that to ensure ligation specificity, the overhangs can be selected or designed to be unique
for each ligation site; that is, each pair of complementary overhangs for two fragments designed
to be adjacent in an assembled product should be unique and differ from any other pair of
complementary overhangs by at least one nucleotide.
[0066]           Another strategy (offset assembly) for exposing cohesive ends is illustrated in
Figure 10A. Starting from a chip, a plurality of oligos (e.g., A 1 -A10 ) can be synthesized. The
oligos can be designed to have central assembly sequences which when assembled properly,
form the target nucleic acid 5'-A 1-A 3-A 5 -A 7 -A 9 -3' (reverse strand being 3'-A 2 -A 4-A6 -A8 -A1 o-5').
That is, two adjacent oligonucleotides A,, and A,,,i can be designed to overlap. As used herein,
adjacent oligonucleotides refers to oligonucleotides wherein a first oligonucleotide is at the 5'
end or 3' end of a second oligonucleotide along the linear nucleic acid sequence. In some
embodiments, adjacent oligonucleotides can be contiguous. As used herein, contiguous
oligonucleotides refers to two oligonucleotides wherein the first oligonucleotide ends at position
arbitarily set at -1 and the second fragment starts at position arbitarily set at 0 along the linear
nucleic acid sequence. The central assembly sequences can be of any desirable length such as
                                                     22

      WO 2013/032850                                                                  PCT/US2012/052036
about 50-500 nucleotides, about 60-300 nucleotides, about 70-200 nucleotides, or shorter or
longer. The plurality of oligos can have uniform length for ease of handling. By way of
example, the synthesized oligos can also include amplification sequences at either end, which
can have restriction sites built in. The amplification sequences can be about 10-30 nucleotides,
about 15-25 nucleotides, or shorter or longer. Figure 10A shows 70-mer central assembly
sequences and 120-mer overall oligos. Synthesized oligos can be eluted, cleaved, or otherwise
released from the chip, and subjected to PCR amplification using primer pair AL and AR
Amplified products can be cleaved (e.g., with a restriction enzyme) to remove the amplification
sequences (arrow heads), and the central 70-mer double-stranded assembly sequences can be
purified therefrom. These double-stranded assembly sequences can then be melted (e.g., at 95
'C) and re-annealed (e.g., at 65 C) in a single shuffling step. After shuffling of the single
stranded oligonucleotides, 25% of the products will be offset assembly products (e.g., A1/A2 ,
A2 /A 3 , A 3 /A 4 , A 4 /A5 , etc.) having cohesive ends. These cohesive ends can be assembled together
(stepwise or in a single reaction hierarchically) using a ligase, thereby forming the target nucleic
acid 5'-A 1-A3-A5 -A7 -A9-3' (reverse strand being 3'-A2 -A4-A6 -A8 -A1o-5'). It should be
appreciated that the oligos can also be designed such that the target nucleic acid is 5'
A1 .. .A3 ... A5 ... A7 ... A9 -3' (i.e., gaps are allowed between A,, and A11 2 , which can be filled using
A 1+ sequence as template). To that end, a polymerase and dNTPs can be used to extend and fill
the gaps before ligation.
[0067]               A second offset assembly strategy is illustrated in Figure 1OB, where a single
combined assembly-(extension)-ligation step may be used, as opposed to two separate steps (i.e.
assembly step and ligation step). For example, after the shuffling step (e.g., melting at 95 'C and
re-annealing at 65 'C), gapless parse oligonucleotides can be ligated to form a full length
product or a subassembly-product. If gaps are present in the parse, oligonucleotides can be
incubated in presence of a polymerase and dNTPs to fill the gaps by chain extension prior to
ligation. In some embodiments, the gapped parse can be subjected simultaneously to polymerase
chain extension and ligation. As used herein the term "subassembly" refers to a nucleic acid
molecule that has been assembled from a set of construction oligonucleotides. Preferably, a
subassembly is at least about 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, or
more, longer than the construction oligonucleotides.
                                                         23

     WO 2013/032850                                                              PCT/US2012/052036
[0068]           Other methods for generating cohesive ends can also be used. For example, a
polymerase based method (e.g., T4 DNA polymerase) can be used to synthesize desirable
cohesive ends. Regardless of the method of generating specific overhangs (e.g., complementary
overhangs for nucleic acids designed to be adjacent in an assembled nucleic acid product),
overhangs of different lengths may be designed and/or produced. In some embodiments, long
single-stranded overhangs (3' or 5') may be used to promote specificity and/or efficient assembly.
For example, a 3' or 5' single-stranded overhang may be longer than 8 bases long, e.g., 8-14, 14
20, 20-25, 25-50, 50-100, 100-500, or more bases long.
High Fidelity Assembly
[0069]           According to aspects of the invention, a plurality of nucleic acid fragments may
be assembled in a single procedure wherein the plurality of fragments is mixed together under
conditions that promote covalent assembly of the fragments to generate a specific longer nucleic
acid. According to aspects of the invention, a plurality of nucleic acid fragments may be
covalently assembled in vitro using a ligase. In some embodiments, 5 or more (e.g., 10 or more,
15 or more, 15 to 20, 20 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 35, 35 to 40, 40 to 45, 45 to 50, 50 or more, etc.)
different nucleic acid fragments may be assembled. However, it should be appreciated that any
number of nucleic acids (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc.)
may be assembled using suitable assembly techniques. Each nucleic acid fragment being
assembled may be between about 100 nucleotides long and about 1,000 nucleotides long (e.g.,
about 200, about 300, about 400, about 500, about 600, about 700, about 800, about 900).
However, longer (e.g., about 2,500 or more nucleotides long, about 5,000 or more nucleotides
long, about 7,500 or more nucleotides long, about 10,000 or more nucleotides long, etc.) or
shorter nucleic acid fragments may be assembled using an assembly technique (e.g., shotgun
assembly into a plasmid vector). It should be appreciated that the size of each nucleic acid
fragment may be independent of the size of other nucleic acid fragments added to an assembly.
However, in some embodiments, each nucleic acid fragment may be approximately the same size
or length (e.g., between about 100 nucleotides long and about 400 nucleotides long). For
example, the length of the oligonucleotides may have a median length of between about 100
nucleotides long and about 400 nucleotides long and vary from about, +/- 1 nucleotides, +/- 4
nucleotides, +/- 10 nucleotides. It should be appreciated that the length of a double-stranded
                                                    24

      WO 2013/032850                                                          PCT/US2012/052036
nucleic acid fragment may be indicated by the number of base pairs. As used herein, a nucleic
acid fragment referred to as "x" nucleotides long corresponds to "x" base pairs in length when
used in the context of a double-stranded nucleic acid fragment. In some embodiments, one or
more nucleic acids being assembled in one reaction (e.g., 1-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, etc.) may be
codon-optimized and/or non-naturally occurring. In some embodiments, all of the nucleic acids
being assembled in one reaction are codon-optimized and/or non-naturally occurring.
[0070]            In some aspects of the invention, nucleic acid fragments being assembled are
designed to have overlapping complementary sequences. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid
fragments are double-stranded nucleic acid fragments with 3' and/or 5' single-stranded
overhangs. These overhangs may be cohesive ends that can anneal to complementary cohesive
ends on different nucleic acid fragments. According to aspects of the invention, the presence of
complementary sequences (and particularly complementary cohesive ends) on two nucleic acid
fragments promotes their covalent assembly. In some embodiments, a plurality of nucleic acid
fragments with different overlapping complementary single-stranded cohesive ends are
assembled and their order in the assembled nucleic acid product is determined by the identity of
the cohesive ends on each fragment. For example, the nucleic acid fragments may be designed
so that a first nucleic acid has a first cohesive end that is complementary to a first cohesive end
of a second nucleic acid and a second cohesive end that is complementary to a first cohesive end
of a third nucleic acid. A second cohesive end of the second nucleic acid may be complementary
to a first cohesive end of a fourth nucleic acid. A second cohesive end of the third nucleic acid
may be complementary a first cohesive end of a fifth nucleic acid. And so on through to the final
nucleic acid. According to aspects of the invention, this technique may be used to generate a
linear arrangement containing nucleic acid fragments assembled in a predetermined linear order
(e.g., first, second, third, forth, ..., final).
[0071]            In certain embodiments, the overlapping complementary regions between
adjacent nucleic acid fragments are designed (or selected) to be sufficiently different to promote
(e.g., thermodynamically favor) assembly of a unique alignment of nucleic acid fragments (e.g.,
a selected or designed alignment of fragments). Surprisingly, under proper ligation conditions,
difference by as little as one nucleotide affords sufficient discrimination power between perfect
match (100% complementary cohesive ends) and mismatch (less than 100% complementary
                                                   25

      WO 2013/032850                                                          PCT/US2012/052036
cohesive ends). As such, 4-base overhangs can allow up to (4 ^ 4 +1)= 2 5 7 different fragments to
be ligated with high specificity and fidelity.
[0072]          It should be appreciated that overlapping regions of different lengths may be used.
In some embodiments, longer cohesive ends may be used when higher numbers of nucleic acid
fragments are being assembled. Longer cohesive ends may provide more flexibility to design or
select sufficiently distinct sequences to discriminate between correct cohesive end annealing
(e.g., involving cohesive ends designed to anneal to each other) and incorrect cohesive end
annealing (e.g., between non-complementary cohesive ends).
[0073]          To achieve such high fidelity assembly, one or more suitable ligases may be used.
A ligase may be obtained from recombinant or natural sources. In some embodiments, T3 DNA
ligase, T4 DNA ligase, T7 DNA ligase, and/or E. coli DNA Ligase may be used. These ligases
may be used at relatively low temperature (e.g., room temperature) and particularly useful for
relatively short overhangs (e.g., about 3, about 4, about 5, or about 6 base overhangs). In certain
ligation reactions (e.g., 30 min incubation at room temperature), T7 DNA ligase can be more
efficient for multi-way ligation than the other ligases. A heat-stable ligase may also be used,
such as one or more of Tth DNA ligase; Pfu DNA ligase; Taq ligase, any other suitable heat
stable ligase, or any combination thereof.
[0074]          In some embodiments, two or more pairs of complementary cohesive ends
between different nucleic acid fragments may be designed or selected to have identical or similar
sequences in order to promote the assembly of products containing a relatively random
arrangement (and/or number) of the fragments that have similar or identical cohesive ends. This
may be useful to generate libraries of nucleic acid products with different sequence arrangements
and/or different copy numbers of certain internal sequence regions.
[0075]          One should appreciate that the variation in the concentration of individual
fragments to be assembled might result into the assembly of incomplete intermediate constructs.
For example, in the assembly of the target nucleic acid sequence (ABCDEF) using
oligonucleotides A, B, C, D, E, F, each of which having the appropriate cohesive overhang end,
if the concentration of the individual fragments is not equimolar (e.g if the concentration of A, B
and C is greater than the concentration of D, E and F), terminating species (such as AB and BC)
can be formed resulting in a mixture of unligated intermediate products. To avoid the formation
of incomplete intermediate constructs, the target nucleic acid can be assembled from at least two
                                                  26

     WO 2013/032850                                                          PCT/US2012/052036
pools of individual fragments (e.g. pool 1: A, C, E and Pool 2: B, D, F). In some embodiments,
each of the two pools comprises a plurality of nucleic acid fragments, each nucleic acid
fragment of the first pool having a terminal end complementary to a terminal end of a nucleic
acid fragment in the second pool. In some embodiments, the at least two pools can be formed
by splitting the population of oligonucleotides into the at least two pools and amplifying the
oligonucleotides in each pool separately. In other embodiments, the at least two pools can be
formed by releasing (e.g. by eluting, cleaving or amplifying) oligonucleotides from a first
oligonucleotide array into a first pool and releasing the oligonucleotides of a second
oligonucleotide array into a second pool. Yet in an other embodiment, the at least two different
pools can be formed by amplifying oligonucleotide sequences using at least two different sets of
amplification tags as described herein. By the way of example, the second pool comprising
oligonucleotides B, D and F can be diluted such as the molar concentration of the
oligonucleotides B, D, and F present in the second pool is lower than the molar concentration of
oligonucleotides A, C, and E present in the first pool. For example, the molar concentration of
the oligonucleotides in the second pool may be about two times, 10 times, 20 times, 50 times,
100 times or more lower than the molar concentration of the oligonucleotides in the first pool.
After mixing and ligating the two pools, the resulting product comprises the target nucleic acid
having the predetermined sequence and can be separated from the excess oligonucleotides form
the first pool. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to form pools of oligonucleotide
dimers having different molar concentrations. For example, the assembly of the target nucleic
acid sequences ABCDEFGH can be carried out using at least two different pools, the first pool
comprising oligonucleotides A, B, E. F and the second pool comprising oligonucleotides C, D,
G, H. The second pool can be diluted such that the molar concentration of oligonucleotides C,
D, G, H is lower ( e.g 10 times or 100 times) than the molar concentration of oligonucleotides
A, B, E, F . Oligonucleotides having the appropriate cohesive overhang ends can be ligated to
form the intermediate products AB and EF in the first pool and CD and GH in the second pool.
Since the molar concentration of C, D, G, H is lower than the molar concentration of A, B, E. F,
the molar concentration of CD and GH is lower than the molar concentration of AB and EF.
After mixing the intermediates products AB, CD, EF, GH under ligating conditions, the
resulting product comprising the target nucleic acid having the predetermined sequence can be
separated from the excess dimers AB and EF.

      WO 2013/032850                                                            PCT/US2012/052036
[0076]          In some embodiments, the nucleic acid fragments are mixed and incubated with a
ligase. It should be appreciated that incubation under conditions that promote specific annealing
of the cohesive ends may increase the frequency of assembly (e.g., correct assembly). In some
embodiments, the different cohesive ends are designed to have similar melting temperatures
(e.g., within about 5 "C of each other) so that correct annealing of all of the fragments is
promoted under the same conditions. Correct annealing may be promoted at a different
temperature depending on the length of the cohesive ends that are used. In some embodiments,
cohesive ends of between about 4 and about 30 nucleotides in length (e.g., cohesive ends of
about 5, about 10, about 15, about 20, about 25, or about 30 nucleotides in length) may be used.
Incubation temperatures may range from about 200C to about 500 C (including, e.g., room
temperature). However, higher or lower temperatures may be used. The length of the incubation
may be optimized based on the length of the overhangs, the complexity of the overhangs, and the
number of different nucleic acids (and therefore the number of different overhangs) that are
mixed together. The incubation time also may depend on the annealing temperature and the
presence or absence of other agents in the mixture. For example, a nucleic acid binding protein
and/or a recombinase may be added (e.g., RecA, for example a heat stable RecA protein).
[0077]          The resulting complex of nucleic acids may be subjected to a polymerase chain
reaction, in the presence of a pair of target-sequence specific primers, to amplify and select for
the correct ligation product (i.e., the target nucleic acid). Alternatively, the resulting complex of
nucleic acids can be ligated into a suitable vector and transformed into a host cell for further
colony screening.
Sequence Analysis and Fragment Design and Selection
[0078]          Aspects of the invention may include analyzing the sequence of a target nucleic
acid and designing an assembly strategy based on the identification of regions, within the target
nucleic acid sequence, that can be used to generate appropriate cohesive ends (e.g., single
stranded overhangs). These regions may be used to define the ends of nucleic acid fragments
that can be assembled (e.g., in one reaction) to generate the target nucleic acid. The nucleic acid
fragments can then be provided or made (e.g., in a multiplex assembly reaction). The nucleic
acid fragments can be selected such that they have a relative uniform size for ease to handle (e.g.,
purification).

     WO 2013/032850                                                           PCT/US2012/052036
[0079]          According to some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence can be designed
and/or analyzed in a computer-assisted manner to generate a set of parsed double-stranded or
single-stranded oligonucleotides. As used herein, the term "parsed" means that a sequence of
target nucleic acid has been delineated, for example in a computer-assisted manner, such as to
identify a series of adjacent oligonucleotide sequences. Adjacent oligonucleotides or nucleic acid
fragments preferably overlap by an appropriate number of nucleotides to facilitate assembly
according the methods of the invention. The oligonucleotide sequences can be individually
synthesized and assembled using the methods of the invention.
[0080]          In some embodiments, a target nucleic acid sequence may be analyzed to identify
regions that contain at least one different nucleotide on one strand of the target nucleic acid.
These regions may be used to generate cohesive ends. It should be appreciated that the length of
a cohesive end is preferably sufficient to provide specificity. For example, cohesive ends may be
long enough to have sufficiently different sequences (e.g., at least 1-base differences) to prevent
or reduce mispairing between similar cohesive ends. However, their length is preferably not
long enough to stabilize mispairs between similar cohesive sequences. In some embodiments, a
length of about 3 to about 10 bases may be used. However, any suitable length may be selected
for a region that is to be used to generate a cohesive overhang. The importance of specificity may
depend on the number of different fragments that are being assembled
simultaneously. Also, the appropriate length required to avoid stabilizing mispaired regions may
depend on the conditions used for annealing different cohesive ends.
[0081]          In some embodiments, alternating regions may be selected if they are separated
by distances that define fragments with suitable lengths for the assembly design. In some
embodiments, the alternating regions may be separated by about 100 to about 500 bases.
However, any suitable shorter or longer distance may be selected. For example, the cohesive
regions may be separated by about 200 to about 1,000 bases. It should be appreciated that
different patterns of alternating regions may be available depending on several factors (e.g.,
depending on the sequence of the target nucleic acid, the chosen length of the cohesive ends, and
the desired fragment length). In some embodiments, if several options are available, the regions
may be selected to maximize the sequence differences between different cohesive ends.
[0082]          Selection of the cohesive regions defines the fragments that will be assembled to
generate the target nucleic acid. Accordingly, the fragment size may be between about 100 and
                                                  29

      WO 2013/032850                                                            PCT/US2012/052036
about 500 base pairs long, between about 200 and about 1,000 bases long, or shorter or longer
depending on the target nucleic acid. The fragments may be generated or obtained using any
suitable technique. In some embodiments, each fragment may be assembled (e.g., in a multiplex
duplex assembly reaction) so that it is flanked by double-stranded regions that can be used to
generate the cohesive single-stranded regions.
[0083]           In some embodiments, methods for enabling the assembly of a target
polynucleotide based upon information of the sequence of the target nucleic acid. In some
embodiments, a computer software can be used to parse the target sequence (e.g. A1-A 1 ) breaking
it down into a set of overlapping oligonucleotides (A1 , A2,A3, ..A) of specified length. Oligos
A1 ,A2, A3, ...A can be synthesized from a chip or microarray. In some embodiments, the
oligonucleotide sequences can may be designed to include: amplification primer sequence,
recognition site for a restriction enzyme, such as a type IIS restriction enzyme, padding, payload,
padding, reverse complement of the recognition site for a restriction enzyme (same or different),
reverse complement of a different amplification primer sequence. The payload can be an
overlapping subset of the target gene (or any arbitrary nucleic acid sequence). The payload can
be padded, if desired, with m nucleotides M (Mm) to allow the generation of a uniquely
complementary cohesive ends after cleavage with the restriction enzyme(s). The primers allow
amplification. The recognition sites for the restriction enzyme(s) allow the primers to be cleaved
off from the payload.
[0084]           In certain embodiments, it is advantageous to use the same recognition site across
multiple target sequences. However, it should be noted that if a target sequence already contains
the recognition site, then the oligo which contains that recognition site (in a left-to-right or right
to-left parse) will be cut, preventing correct assembly. In some embodiments, if the target
sequence only contains a single occurrence of the recognition site, the problem can be solved by
starting the parse within the site, and parsing one set of oligos to the left, and the other set to the
right of the recognition site. Since the site will be split between 2 oligos, it will not exist as an
intact sequence and thus will not be recognized or cut. If there is a desired oligo length or range
of lengths, the last oligo in each side of the parse can be padded with an appropriate number m of
nucleotides M (Mm).
[0085]           This approach can be extended to more than one occurrence of a recognition site
if those restriction sites appear within an integer multiple of the allowed length range for a
                                                   30

      WO 2013/032850                                                             PCT/US2012/052036
payload. As an example of the simplest case (and ignoring any desired overlap for purposes of
this example), if any portion of 2 restriction sites are exactly 100 bp apart for a desired 100 bp
payload size, then parsing from within either one will automatically split the other. If the
payload can vary from 90-110 bp, then a pair of restriction sites within this distance range can be
accommodated. With this same payload range, a pair could also be split at longer distances: 180
220 bp, 270-330 bp, etc.
[0086]            When parsing a target sequence into oligos, the length of the last oligo (or last in
each direction if parsing from the interior) may fall outside the desired range of oligo lengths.
The last oligo can be padded to the desired length. This may come however at the cost of
producing additional base pairs that are otherwise not useful, specially when a large number of
target sequences are assembled. In some embodiments, a solution to this problem is to
concatenate every target sequence into a single long pseudo-target (with optional primer
sequences between the actual target sequences), and then split into smaller, overlapping
fragments of the desired length (e.g., by cleavage or amplification by PCR). The computation of
the length of a fragment is presented below:
          length  = (pieces * maxoligolength) - (junctions * overlap)
          where junctions   = pieces - 1
For example:
          length 484  =  (pieces 5 * maxoligolength 100) - (junctions 4 * overlap 4)
          length 504  =  (pieces 5 * maxoligolength 104) - (junctions 4 * overlap 4)
[0087]            If some of the target sequences contain a restriction site, then in some cases, the
order in which the target sequences are concatenated can be chosen such as to have the
restriction site at a junction (and within the desired oligo length range). In the general case,
additional padding can be added just to the subset of target sequences that contain the restriction
site, still yielding the full benefit of eliminating the padding on the majority of target sequences.
[0088]            Examples of the present invention show that certain ligase enzymes in certain
conditions correctly distinguishing 2 oligos with overhangs having the same last base and
different second-to-last base. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to design the oligos
such that the last base in each overhang is unique. Unique A, C, G, T at the end (4 junctions)
allow ligation of up to 5 pieces, which is a commercially useful number to assemble. Larger
numbers of ligation pieces are also contemplated in the present invention, as exemplified below:
                                                     31

         - last 2 bases unique: 4 A 2 = 16 junctions, up to 17 pieces
         - last 3 bases unique: 4A 3= 64   junctions, up to 65 pieces
         - last 4 bases unique: 4A 4= 256   junctions, up to 257 pieces
[0089]            Aspects of the invention relate to algorithms to parse the input target nucleic acid
sequence. In some embodiments, algorithms can be used to ensure that the last base (or last 2, 3
or 4 bases) of the plurality of oligos is unique. For example, algorithms of the invention can be
used to define a plurality of parsed oligonucleotides that together comprise the target sequence
(naturally occurring, non-naturally occurring, or any arbitrary nucleic acid sequence, the
oligonucleotides having approximately the same length and with a 4 base overlap the last base
(or last 2, 3 or 4 bases) being unique. Yet in some embodiments, the oligonucleotides can be
defined such as the second-to-last or third-to-last, etc or combinations thereof is unique.
[0090]            In some embodiments, a first algorithm comprises the following design or
decomposition steps:
         Step 1: is to move over by the target amount, e.g. 100 bp,
         Step 2: store the relevant 1-4 bases in a set (e.g., in a memory),
         Step 3: back up by the overlap (4 bp),
         Step 4: move again. For this second and each subsequent move by 100 bp, if the relevant
         1-4 bases already exist in the set, then shift over 1 base at a time until encountering a 1-4
         base sequence that is not yet in the set.
         Step 5: add the new 1-4 base sequence to the set,
         Step 6: then repeat. If the desired number of pieces is reached before reaching the end of
         the DNA sequence, then start over with a new set, backing up by an appropriate overlap
         for assembly of fragments (which may or may not be a different method than assembly of
         oligos into a fragment).
[0091]            One skilled in the art will note that the 1-base shift could vary in direction, e.g.,
always left (shorter) if the nominal length is a maximum desired length, always right (longer) if
the nominal length is a minimum desired length, or some combination thereof. To center around
the nominal length, the shift could alternate, e.g., check positions in the following order: -1, +1,
2, +2, etc. The shift could also be weighted to prefer, for example, shorter but allow longer, e.g.,
-1, -2, +1, -3, -4, +2, etc.
                                                      32

     WO 2013/032850                                                            PCT/US2012/052036
[0092]           This algorithm may be limited to design of certain target sequences, as the
required shift may be large since the degrees of freedom are reduced with each subsequent
addition to the set. For example, the first end may be an "A", but the last end may not have an
"A" either within several bases, thus making the last oligo very short or very long, which may
be undesirable. One solution to this problem is to store an array of data for each junction, then
choose either the fewest number of oligos to shift, or the least total shift distance among all
oligos, or some combination thereof.
[0093]           The statistics for how often any given short sequence (e.g. for a restriction site)
will appear in a random 1,000 bp sequence is as follows. For example, if a 6-bp restriction site is
used which does not parse from the middle of a target sequence, then 22% of sequences could
not be built with that restriction site. With the same 6-bp site and parsing from the middle, only
the 3% of sequences that contain 2 sites could not be built (or would require additional parsing).
More particularly:
        - If a single occurrence a restriction site prevented building:
           With quantity 1 of length 5bp, 62% will have at least 1 site
           With quantity 1 of length 6bp, 22% will have at least 1 site
           With quantity 1 of length 7bp, 6% will have at least 1 site
        - If parsing from the interior allows 2 occurrences:
           With quantity 1 of length 5bp, 25% will have at least 2 sites
           With quantity 1 of length 6bp, 3% will have at least 2 sites
           With quantity 1 of length 7bp, <1% will have at least 2 sites (about 0.2%)
        - If more than one restriction enzyme (and corresponding site) is used and if allowing a
        single occurrence:
           With quantity 2 of length 5bp, 38% will have at least 1 site
           With quantity 2 of length 6bp, 5% will have at least 1 site
           With length 7bp and length 6bp, 1% will have at least 1 site
           With quantity 3 of length 5bp, 24% will have at least 1 site
           With quantity 3 of length 6bp, 1% will have at least 1 site
        - If more than one restriction enzyme, allowing 2 occurances:
           With quantity 2 of length 5bp, 6% will have at least 2 sites
           With quantity 2 of length 6bp, <1% will have at least 2 sites (about 0.06%)

Applications
[0094]           Aspects of the invention may be useful for a range of applications involving the
production and/or use of synthetic nucleic acids. As described herein, the invention provides
methods for assembling synthetic nucleic acids with increased efficiency. The resulting
assembled nucleic acids may be amplified in vitro (e.g., using PCR, LCR, or any suitable
amplification technique), amplified in vivo (e.g., via cloning into a suitable vector), isolated
and/or purified. An assembled nucleic acid (alone or cloned into a vector) may be transformed
into a host cell (e.g., a prokaryotic, eukaryotic, insect, mammalian, or other host cell). In some
embodiments, the host cell may be used to propagate the nucleic acid. In certain embodiments,
the nucleic acid may be integrated into the genome of the host cell. In some embodiments, the
nucleic acid may replace a corresponding nucleic acid region on the genome of the cell (e.g., via
homologous recombination). Accordingly, nucleic acids may be used to produce recombinant
organisms. In some embodiments, a target nucleic acid may be an entire genome or large
fragments of a genome that are used to replace all or part of the genome of a host organism.
Recombinant organisms also may be used for a variety of research, industrial, agricultural,
and/or medical applications.
[0095]           Many of the techniques described herein can be used together, applying suitable
assembly techniques at one or more points to produce long nucleic acid molecules. For example,
ligase-based assembly may be used to assemble oligonucleotide duplexes and nucleic acid
fragments of less than 100 to more than 10,000 base pairs in length (e.g., 100 mers to 500 mers,
500 mers to 1,000 mers, 1,000 mers to 5,000 mers, 5, 000 mers to 10,000 mers, 25,000 mers,
50,000 mers, 75,000 mers, 100,000 mers, etc.). In an exemplary embodiment, methods described
herein may be used during the assembly of an entire genome (or a large fragment thereof, e.g.,
about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 7 0%, 80%, 90%, or more) of an organism (e.g., of a
viral, bacterial, yeast, or other prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism), optionally incorporating
specific modifications into the sequence at one or more desired locations.
[0096]           Any of the nucleic acid products (e.g., including nucleic acids that are amplified,
cloned, purified, isolated, etc.) may be packaged in any suitable format (e.g., in a stable buffer,
lyophilized, etc.) for storage and/or shipping (e.g., for shipping to a distribution center or to a
                                                   34

      WO 2013/032850                                                             PCT/US2012/052036
customer). Similarly, any of the host cells (e.g., cells transformed with a vector or having a
modified genome) may be prepared in a suitable buffer for storage and or transport (e.g., for
distribution to a customer). In some embodiments, cells may be frozen. However, other stable
cell preparations also may be used.
[0097]            Host cells may be grown and expanded in culture. Host cells may be used for
expressing one or more RNAs or polypeptides of interest (e.g., therapeutic, industrial,
agricultural, and/or medical proteins). The expressed polypeptides may be natural polypeptides
or non-natural polypeptides. The polypeptides may be isolated or purified for subsequent use.
[0098]            Accordingly, nucleic acid molecules generated using methods of the invention
can be incorporated into a vector. The vector may be a cloning vector or an expression vector. In
some embodiments, the vector may be a viral vector. A viral vector may comprise nucleic acid
sequences capable of infecting target cells. Similarly, in some embodiments, a prokaryotic
expression vector operably linked to an appropriate promoter system can be used to transform
target cells. In other embodiments, a eukaryotic vector operably linked to an appropriate
promoter system can be used to transfect target cells or tissues.
[0099]            Transcription and/or translation of the constructs described herein may be carried
out in vitro (i.e. using cell-free systems) or in vivo (i.e. expressed in cells). In some
embodiments, cell lysates may be prepared. In certain embodiments, expressed RNAs or
polypeptides may be isolated or purified. Nucleic acids of the invention also may be used to add
detection and/or purification tags to expressed polypeptides or fragments thereof. Examples of
polypeptide-based fusion/tag include, but are not limited to, hexa-histidine (His6 ) Myc and HA,
and other polypeptides with utility, such as GFP5 GST, MBP, chitin and the like. In some
embodiments, polypeptides may comprise one or more unnatural amino acid residue(s).
[00100]           In some embodiments, antibodies can be made against polypeptides or
fragment(s) thereof encoded by one or more synthetic nucleic acids. In certain embodiments,
synthetic nucleic acids may be provided as libraries for screening in research and development
(e.g., to identify potential therapeutic proteins or peptides, to identify potential protein targets for
drug development, etc.) In some embodiments, a synthetic nucleic acid may be used as a
therapeutic (e.g., for gene therapy, or for gene regulation). For example, a synthetic nucleic acid
may be administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to express a therapeutic amount of a
                                                    35

protein. In other embodiments, a synthetic nucleic acid may be administered to a patient in an
amount sufficient to regulate (e.g., down-regulate) the expression of a gene.
[00101]         It should be appreciated that different acts or embodiments described herein may
be performed independently and may be performed at different locations in the United States or
outside the United States. For example, each of the acts of receiving an order for a target nucleic
acid, analyzing a target nucleic acid sequence, designing one or more starting nucleic acids (e.g.,
oligonucleotides), synthesizing starting nucleic acid(s), purifying starting nucleic acid(s),
assembling starting nucleic acid(s), isolating assembled nucleic acid(s), confirming the sequence
of assembled nucleic acid(s), manipulating assembled nucleic acid(s) (e.g., amplifying, cloning,
inserting into a host genome, etc.), and any other acts or any parts of these acts may be
performed independently either at one location or at different sites within the United States or
outside the United States. In some embodiments, an assembly procedure may involve a
combination of acts that are performed at one site (in the United States or outside the United
States) and acts that are performed at one or more remote sites (within the United States or
outside the United States).
Automated applications
[00102]         Aspects of the methods and devices provided herein may include automating one
or more acts described herein. In some embodiments, one or more steps of an amplification
and/or assembly reaction may be automated using one or more automated sample handling
devices (e.g., one or more automated liquid or fluid handling devices). Automated devices and
procedures may be used to deliver reaction reagents, including one or more of the following:
starting nucleic acids, buffers, enzymes (e.g., one or more ligases and/or polymerases),
nucleotides, salts, and any other suitable agents such as stabilizing agents. Automated devices
and procedures also may be used to control the reaction conditions. For example, an automated
thermal cycler may be used to control reaction temperatures and any temperature cycles that may
be used. In some embodiments, a scanning laser may be automated to provide one or more
reaction temperatures or temperature cycles suitable for incubating polynucleotides. Similarly,
subsequent analysis of assembled polynucleotide products may be automated. For example,
sequencing may be automated using a sequencing device and automated sequencing protocols.
Additional steps (e.g., amplification, cloning, etc.) also may be automated using one or more

EXAMPLES
[00111]          Figure 1 shows the sequence of an arbitrarily chosen, double-stranded sequence of
about 836 bp long. 60-bp fragments were selected and labeled I to 28 (fragments 1-14 are on the
positive strand; fragments 15-28 on the negative strand). These 60-bp fragments were ordered
from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa) ("IDT oligos"), with the following
flanking sequences:
               GTCACTACCGCTATCATGGCGGTCTC.....GAGACCAGGAGACAGGACCGACCAAA
               CAGTGATGGCGATAGTACCGCCAGAG.....CTCTGGTCCTCTGTCCTGGCTGGTTT
Underlined is the recognition site of BsaI-HF, which produces a 4-base overhang:
The BsaI-HF recognition sites are flanked by universal primers which are useful for
amplification of these fragments.
[00112]          PCR primers A-E were also designed (dashed arrows in Figure 1) for amplifying
the correct ligation product. Figure 2 shows the relative position of the primers ("oligoA" to
"oligoE") as arrowheads, as well as the predicted size of corresponding PCR products.
[00113]          Double-stranded IDT oligos were subject to BsaI-HF digestion, under the
following conditions:
         - IX NEBuffer 4
         - Supplemented with 100 tg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin
         - Incubate at 37 0 C.
[00114]          Digested double strand oligos having cohesive ends (oligos 1-28) were purified
by electrophoresis on a 4% gel. Various combinations of purified oligos 1-28 were then subject
to ligation reactions. Several different ligases, temperatures and incubation times were tested for
optimal ligation conditions. Ligases tested include:
         T4 DNA Ligase
         T4 DNA Ligase + 300 mM salt (for reduced activity, higher specificity)
         T3 DNA Ligase
         T7 DNA Ligase
         Pfu DNA Ligase
                                                   40

      WO 2013/032850                                                            PCT/US2012/052036
         Taq DNA Ligase
         E. coli DNA Ligase
[00115]           Exemplary results conducted at room temperature for 30 minutes are shown in
Figures 3-5. Figure 3 shows the electrophoresis results of pairwise ligation (of two oligos), from
left to right of the gel: ladder, no ligase, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase + salt, T3 DNA ligase,
T7 DNA ligase. The bands from bottom to top of gel correspond to: free oligos, correct ligated
product, one and a half ligated product, dimer of ligated product. T7 DNA ligase produced the
most correct ligated product and thus appeared the most efficient under this experimental
condition, other things being equal.
[00116]           Figure 4 shows the ligation results of oligos 1-10 (lanes 1-6) and oligos 11-14
(lanes 7-10), with different ligases indicated at the top of the gel. Multiple bands were observed,
indicating the presence of different ligation products. However, upon PCR amplification using
oligos A and B as primers, a strong band at about 300 bp was observed. Because the predicted
PCR product from oligos A and B is 337 bp (see Figure 2), this band corresponds to the correct
ligation product comprising oligos 1-6 (see Figure 1). The band was cut from the gel, purified,
and sequenced. The sequencing results are shown in Figure 6, confirming 100% fidelity of the
ligation product as compared to the expected sequence. Taq DNA ligase did not produce any
ligation product, probably because of the low reaction temperature (room temperature), as
Taq DNA ligase is only active at elevated temperatures (45 0 C-65 0 C).
[00117]           A pairwise mismatch assay was developed to test the specificity of various
ligases. A pair of oligos were designed with 4-base overhangs, where the perfect match ("P")
sequence is GGTG and the mismatch ("M") sequence is GCTG which differs from the correct
sequence by one nucleotide. As shown in Figures 7A and 7B, two major bands can be observed,
with the lower band corresponding to unligated oligos (as indicated by the no ligase controls),
and the upper band corresponding to ligated product. T4 DNA ligase + salt, T3 DNA ligase, T7
DNA ligase, and E. coli DNA ligase all produced a strong band corresponding to the ligated
product when using the perfect match overhangs. By contrast, when mismatch overhangs were
used, majority of the product was unligated oligos. These experiment show that under these
reaction conditions, T4 DNA ligase + salt, T3 DNA ligase, T7 DNA ligase, and E. coli DNA
ligase all demonstrated high specificity and discrimination of mismatch as little as one nucleotide
difference.

[00118]          In addition to the ligation product having oligos 1-6 shown above, other ligation
products were also produced, including longer products. One product appeared to have oligos 1
6 ligated to oligo 14. This is due to the fact that oligos 7 and 14 had the same cohesive end
(GTTC, boxes in Figure 8).
