  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                   The present invention relates to novel cationic lipids that can be used in
  combination with other lipid components such as cholesterol and PEG-lipids to form lipid
  nanoparticles with oligonucleotides, to facilitate the cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and
  to knockdown target mRNA both in vitro and in vivo.
                   Cationic lipids and the use of cationic lipids in lipid nanoparticles for the
  delivery of oligonucleotides, in particular siRNA and miRNA, have been previously disclosed.

  lipid scaffold that demonstrates enhanced efficacy along with lower liver toxicity as a result of
   lower lipid levels in the liver. The present invention employs low molecular weight cationic
   lipids with one short lipid chain to enhance the efficiency and tolerability of in vivo delivery of
   siRNA.

                  In another embodiment, the cationic lipids disclosed are useful in the
preparation of lipid nanoparticles.
                  In another embodiment, the cationic lipids disclosed are useful components in a
lipid nanoparticle for the delivery of oligonucleotides.

lipid nanoparticle for the delivery of siRNA and miRNA.
                  In another embodiment, the cationic lipids disclosed are useful components in a

                  The cationic lipids of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral
axes, and chiral planes (as described in: EL. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon
Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates,
racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures
thereof, including optical isomers, being included in the present invention. In addition, the
cationic lipids disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended
to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is
 depicted.
                  It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the cationic lipids
 of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide cationic
 lipids that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the
 art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials. If a
 substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple
 groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results.
                  It is understood that one or more Si atoms can be incorporated into the cationic
 lipids of the instant invention by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide cationic lipids that
 are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art from
 readily available starting materials.
                   In the compounds of Formula A, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic
 abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope
 having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic
 mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to
 include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula A. For example, different
 isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (IH) and deuterium ( 2 H). Protium is the
                                                    5

predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain
therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or
may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples.
Isotopically-enriched compounds within Formula A can be prepared without undue
experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by
processes analogous to those described in the Scheme and Examples herein using appropriate
isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates.

                    Included in the instant invention is the free form of cationic lipids of Formula A,
  as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof. Some of the
   isolated specific cationic lipids exemplified herein are the protonated salts of amine cationic
   lipids. The term "free form" refers to the amine cationic lipids in non-salt form. The
   encompassed pharmaceutically acceptable salts not only include the isolated salts exemplified
   for the specific cationic lipids described herein, but also all the typical pharmaceutically
   acceptable salts of the free form of cationic lipids of Formula A. The free form of the specific
   salt cationic lipids described may be isolated using techniques known in the art. For example,
   the free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base
   solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate.
   The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical
   properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise
   pharmaceutically equivalent to their respective free forms for purposes of the invention.
)                    The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the instant cationic lipids can be
   synthesized from the cationic lipids of this invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by
   conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic cationic lipids are prepared
   either by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base with stoichiometric
   amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid in a suitable
5  solvent or various combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are
   formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base.
                     Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the cationic lipids of this invention
   include the conventional non-toxic salts of the cationic lipids of this invention as formed by
                                                      9

reacting a basic instant cationic lipids with an inorganic or organic acid. For example,
conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from
organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric,
ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic,
2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic,
isethionic, trifluoroacetic (TFA) and the like.
                  When the cationic lipids of the present invention are acidic, suitable
"pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable
non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic
bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium,
manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particularly preferred are
the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from
pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and
tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic
amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine caffeine, choline, N,N'
dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamin, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol,
ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine,
glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine,
piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine,
trimethylamine tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like.
                  The preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described above and
other typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts is more fully described by Berg et al.,
"Pharmaceutical Salts," J Pharm.Sci., 1977:66:1-19.
                  It will also be noted that the cationic lipids of the present invention are
potentially internal salts or zwitterions, since under physiological conditions a deprotonated
 acidic moiety in the compound, such as a carboxyl group, may be anionic, and this electronic
 charge might then be balanced off internally against the cationic charge of a protonated or
 alkylated basic moiety, such as a quaternary nitrogen atom.
                                               EXAMPLES
                  Examples provided are intended to assist in a further understanding of the
 invention. Particular materials employed, species and conditions are intended to be further
 illustrative of the invention and not limitative of the reasonable scope thereof. The reagents
 utilized in synthesizing the cationic lipids are either commercially available or are readily
 prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art.
                  Synthesis of the novel cationic lipids is a linear process starting from lipid acid
 (I). Coupling to N,O-dimethyl hydroxylamine gives the Weinreb amide TJI Grignard addition
 generates ketone II. Titanium mediated reductive amination gives final products of type IV.

  partitioned between hexanes and water. The organics were washed with water, dried over
  sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated in vacuo. This material was purified by flash
D chromatography (0-5% EtOAc/hexanes) to give desired product (containing -20% of s.m.).

LNP process description:
                The Lipid Nano-Particles (LNP) are prepared by an impinging jet process. The
particles are formed by mixing lipids dissolved in alcohol with siRNA dissolved in a citrate
buffer. The mixing ratio of lipids to siRNA are targeted at 45-55% lipid and 65-45% siRNA.
The lipid solution contains a novel cationic lipid of the instant invention, a helper lipid
(cholesterol), PEG (e.g. PEG-C-DMA, PEG-DMG) lipid, and DSPC at a concentration of 5-15
mg/mL with a target of 9-12 mg/mL in an alcohol (for example ethanol). The ratio of the lipids
has a mole percent range of 25-98 for the cationic lipid with a target of 35-65, the helper lipid
has a mole percent range from 0-75 with a target of 30-50, the PEG lipid has a mole percent
range from 1-15 with a target of 1-6, and the DSPC has a mole precent range of 0-15 with a
target of 0-12. The siRNA solution contains one or more siRNA sequences at a concentration
range from 0.3 to 1 .0 mg/mL with a target of 0.3 -0.9 mg/mL in a sodium citrate buffered salt
solution with pH in the range of 3.5-5. The two liquids are heated to a temperature in the
range of 15-40'C, targeting 30-40*C, and then mixed in an impinging jet mixer instantly
forming the LNP. The teelD has a range from 0.25 to 1.0 mm and a total flow rate from 10
600 mL/min. The combination of flow rate and tubing ID has effect of controlling the particle
size of the LNPs between 30 and 200 nm. The solution is then mixed with a buffered solution
at a higher pH with a mixing ratio in the range of 1:1 to 1:3 vol:vol but targeting 1:2 vol:vol.
This buffered solution is at a temperature in the range of 15-40'C, targeting 30-40*C. The
mixed LNPs are held from 30 minutes to 2 hrs prior to an anion exchange filtration step. The
temperature during incubating is in the range of 15-40*C, targeting 30-40*C. After incubating
the solution is filtered through a 0.8 urn filter containing an anion exchange separation step.
This process uses tubing IDs ranging from 1 mm ID to 5 mm ID and a flow rate from 10 to
2000 mL/min. The LNPs are concentrated and diafiltered via an ultrafiltration process where
the alcohol is removed and the citrate buffer is exchanged for the final buffer solution such as
phosphate buffered saline. The ultrafiltration process uses a tangential flow filtration format
(TFF). This process uses a membrane nominal molecular weight cutoff range from 30 -500
KD. The membrane format can be hollow fiber or flat sheet cassette. The TFF processes with
the proper molecular weight cutoff retains the LNP in the retentate and the filtrate or permeate
contains the alcohol; citrate buffer; final buffer wastes. The TFF process is a multiple step
process with an initial concentration to a siRNA concentration of 1 -3 mg/mL. Following
concentration, the LNPs solution is diafiltered against the final buffer for 10 -20 volumes to
                                                   26

remove the alcohol and perform buffer exchange. The material is then concentrated an
additional 1-3 fold. The final steps of the LNP process are to sterile filter the concentrated
LNP solution and vial the product.
Analytical Procedure:
1) siRNA concentration
                 The siRNA duplex concentrations are determined by Strong Anion-Exchange
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (SAX-HPLC) using Waters 2695 Alliance system
(Water Corporation, Milford MA) with a 2996 PDA detector. The LNPs, otherwise referred to
as RNAi Delivery Vehicles (RDVs), are treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 to free total siRNA
and analyzed by SAX separation using a Dionex BioLC DNAPac PA 200 (4 x 250 mm)
column with UV detection at 254 nm. Mobile phase is composed of A: 25 mM NaClO 4 , 10
mM Tris, 20% EtOH, pH 7.0 and B: 250 mM NaClO 4, 10 mM Tris, 20% EtOH, pH 7.0 with
liner gradient from 0-15 min and flow rate of 1 ml/min. The siRNA amount is determined by
comparing to the siRNA standard curve.
2) Encapsulation rate
                  Fluorescence reagent SYBR Gold is employed for RNA quantitation to monitor
the encapsulation rate of RDVs. RDVs with or without Triton X- 100 are used to determine the
free siRNA and total siRNA amount. The assay is performed using a SpectraMax M5e
microplate spectrophotometer from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). Samples are excited
at 485 nm and fluorescence emission was measured at 530 nm. The siRNA amount is
determined by comparing to the siRNA standard curve.
                      Encapsulation rate = (1- free siRNA/total siRNA) x100%
 3) Particle size and polydispersity
                  RDVs containing 1 pg siRNA are diluted to a final volume of 3 ml with 1 x
 PBS. The particle size and polydispersity of the samples is measured by a dynamic light
 scattering method using ZetaPALS instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation,
 Holtsville, NY). The scattered intensity is measured with He-Ne laser at 25 0 C with a scattering
 angle of 90*.
 4) Zeta Potential analysis
                  RDVs containing 1 pg siRNA are diluted to a final volume of 2 ml with 1 mM
 Tris buffer (pH 7.4). Electrophoretic mobility of samples is determined using ZetaPALS
 instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY) with electrode and He-Ne
 laser as a light source. The Smoluchowski limit is assumed in the calculation of zeta potentials.
 5) Lipid analysis
                  Individual lipid concentrations are determined by Reverse Phase High
 Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) using Waters 2695 Alliance system (Water
 Corporation, Milford MA) with a Corona charged aerosol detector (CAD) (ESA Biosciences,
 Inc, Chelmsford, MA). Individual lipids in RDVs are analyzed using an Agilent Zorbax SB
                                                  27

C18 (50 x 4.6 mm, 1.8 pm particle size) column with CAD at 60 *C. The mobile phase is
composed of A: 0.1% TFA in H2 0 and B: 0.1% TFA in IPA. The gradient changes from 60%
mobile phase A and 40% mobile phase B from time 0 to 40% mobile phase A and 60% mobile
phase B at 1.00 min; 40% mobile phase A and 60% mobile phase B from 1.00 to 5.00 min;
40% mobile phase A and 60% mobile phase B from 5.00 min to 25% mobile phase A and 75%
mobile phase B at 10.00 min; 25% mobile phase A and 75% mobile phase B from 10.00 min to
5%mobile phase A and 95% mobile phase B at 15.00 min; and 5%mobile phase A and 95%
mobile phase B from 15.00 to 60% mobile phase A and 40% mobile phase B at 20.00 min with
flow rate of 1 ml/min. The individual lipid concentration is determined by comparing to the
standard curve with all the lipid components in the RDVs with a quadratic curve fit. The molar
percentage of each lipid is calculated based on its molecular weight.
General LNP Process Description for Compound 32 Formulations:
                 The lipid nanoparticles were prepared by an impinging jet process. The
particles were formed by mixing lipids dissolved in alcohol with siRNA dissolved in a citrate
buffer. The lipid solution contained a cationic lipid, a helper lipid (cholesterol), PEG (e.g.
PEG-C-DMA, PEG-DMG) lipid, and DSPC at a concentration of 5-15 mg/mL with a target of
9-12 mg/mL in an alcohol (for example ethanol). The ratio of the lipids had a mole percent
range of 25-98 for the cationic lipid with a target of 35-65, the helper lipid had a mole percent
range from 0-75 with a target of 30-50, the PEG lipid has a mole percent range from 1-15 with
a target of 1-6, and the DSPC had a mole percent range of 0-15 with a target of 0-12. The
siRNA solution contained one or more siRNA sequences at a concentration range from 0.3 to
0.6 mg/mL with a target of 0.3 -0.9 mg/mL in a sodium citrate buffered salt solution with pH in
the range of 3.5-5. The two solutions were heated to a temperature in the range of 15-40*C,
targeting 30-40*C, and then mixed in an impinging jet mixer instantly forming the LNP. The
teelD had a range from 0.25 to 1.0 mm and a total flow rate from 10-600 mL/minute. The
combination of flow rate and tubing ID had the effect of controlling the particle size of the
LNPs between 30 and 200 nm. The LNP suspension was then mixed with a buffered solution
 at a higher pH with a mixing ratio in the range of 1:1 to 1:3 vol:vol, but targeting 1:2 vol:vol.
 This buffered solution was at a temperature in the range of 15-40'C, targeting 30-40*C. This
 LNP suspension was further mixed with a buffered solution at a higher pH and with a mixing
 ratio in the range of 1:1 to 1:3 vol:vol, but targeting 1:2 vol:vol. The buffered solution was at a
 temperature in the range of 15-40*C, targeting 30-40*C. The mixed LNPs were held from 30
 minutes to 2 hrs prior to an anion exchange filtration step. The temperature during incubating
 was in the range of 15-40*C, targeting 30-40*C. After incubating, the LNP suspension was
 filtered through a 0.8 um filter containing an anion exchange separation step. This process
 used tubing IDs ranging from 1 mm ID to 5 mm ID and a flow rate from 10 to 2000 mL/minute
 The LNPs were concentrated and diafiltered via an ultrafiltration process where the alcohol
                                                   28

  was removed and the citrate buffer was exchanged for the final buffer solution such as
  phosphate buffered saline. The ultrafiltration process used a tangential flow filtration format
  (TFF). This process used a membrane nominal molecular weight cutoff range from 30 -500
  KD. The membrane format was hollow fiber or flat sheet cassette. The TFF processes with the
  proper molecular weight cutoff retained the LNP in the retentate and the filtrate or permeate
  contained the alcohol; citrate buffer; and final buffer wastes. The TFF process is a multiple
  step process with an initial concentration to a siRNA concentration of 1 -3 mg/mL. Following
  concentration, the LNP suspension was diafiltered against the final buffer for 10 -20 volumes
  to remove the alcohol and perform buffer exchange. The material was then concentrated an
  additional 1-3 fold. The final steps of the LNP process were to sterile filter the concentrated
  LNP solution and vial the product.
  Analytical Procedure:

                   The siRNA duplex concentrations were determined by Strong Anion-Exchange
  High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (SAX-HPLC) using Waters 2695 Alliance system
  (Water Corporation, Milford MA) with a 2996 PDA detector. The LNPs, otherwise referred to
  as RNAi Delivery Vehicles (RDVs), were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 to free total siRNA
  and analyzed by SAX separation using a Dionex BioLC DNAPac PA 200 (4 x 250 mm)
  column with UV detection at 254 nm. Mobile phase was composed of A: 25 mM NaClO 4, 10
  mM Tris, 20% EtOH, pH 7.0 and B: 250 mM NaClO 4, 10 mM Tris, 20% EtOH, pH 7.0 with a
   liner gradient from 0-15 min and a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. The siRNA amount was
   determined by comparing to the siRNA standard curve.
   Encapsulation rate
                   Fluorescence reagent SYBR Gold was employed for RNA quantitation to
   monitor the encapsulation rate of RDVs. RDVs with or without Triton X- 100 were used to
   determine the free siRNA and total siRNA amount. The assay is performed using a
D  SpectraMax M5e microplate spectrophotometer from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA).
   Samples were excited at 485 nm and fluorescence emission was measured at 530 nm. The
   siRNA amount is determined by comparing to an siNA standard curve.
   Encapsulation rate = (1- free siNA/total siNA) x100%
5  Particle size and polydispersity
                   RDVs containing 1 pig siRNA were diluted to a final volume of 3 ml with 1 x
   PBS. The particle size and polydispersity of the samples was measured by a dynamic light
   scattering method using ZetaPALS instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation,
                                                    29

  Holtsville, NY). The scattered intensity was measured with He-Ne laser at 25*C with a
  scattering angle of 90'.
  Zeta Potential Analysis
                   RDVs containing 1 pg siRNA were diluted to a final volume of 2 ml with 1 mM
  Tris buffer (pH 7.4). Electrophoretic mobility of samples was determined using ZetaPALS
  instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY) with electrode and He-Ne
  laser as a light source. The Smoluchowski limit was assumed in the calculation of zeta
  potentials.
  Lipid analysis
                   Individual lipid concentrations were determined by Reverse Phase High
  Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) using Waters 2695 Alliance system (Water
  Corporation, Milford MA) with a Corona charged aerosol detector (CAD) (ESA Biosciences,
  Inc, Chelmsford, MA). Individual lipids in RDVs were analyzed using an Agilent Zorbax SB
  C18 (50 x 4.6 mm, 1.8 pm particle size) column with CAD at 60*C. The mobile phase was
  composed of A: 0.1% TFA in H2 0 and B: 0.1% TFA in IPA. The gradient changed from 60%
  mobile phase A and 40% mobile phase B from time 0 to 40% mobile phase A and 60% mobile
  phase B at 1.00 min; 40% mobile phase A and 60% mobile phase B from 1.00 to 5.00 min;
  40% mobile phase A and 60% mobile phase B from 5.00 min to 25% mobile phase A and 75%
  mobile phase B at 10.00 min; 25% mobile phase A and 75% mobile phase B from 10.00 min to
  5% mobile phase A and 95% mobile phase B at 15.00 min; and 5%mobile phase A and 95%
  mobile phase B from 15.00 to 60% mobile phase A and 40% mobile phase B at 20.00 min with
  a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. The individual lipid concentration was determined by comparing to
  the standard curve with all the lipid components in the RDVs with a quadratic curve fit. The
  molar percentage of each lipid was calculated based on its molecular weight.
   General LNP Preparation For Various Formulations in Table 1.
                    siRNA nanoparticle suspensions in Table 1 are prepared by dissolving siRNAs
   and/or carrier molecules in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at a concentration of about
   0.40 mg/mL. Lipid solutions are prepared by dissolving a mixture of cationic lipid (e.g., 32, see
   structure in Table 2), DSPC, Cholesterol, and PEG-DMG (ratios shown in Table 1) in absolute
   ethanol at a concentration of about 8 mg/mL. The nitrogen to phosphate ratio is approximate to
5  6:1.
                    Nearly equal volumes of siRNA/carrier and lipid solutions are delivered with
   two FPLC pumps at the same flow rates to a mixing T connector. A back pressure valve is used
   to adjust to the desired particle size. The resulting milky mixture is collected in a sterile glass
                                                    30

  bottle. This mixture is then diluted with an equal volume of citrate buffer, followed by equal
  volume of PBS (pH 7.4), and filtered through an ion-exchange membrane to remove any free
  siRNA/carrier in the mixture. Ultra filtration against PBS (7.4)) is employed to remove ethanol
  and to exchange buffer. The final LNP is obtained by concentrating to a desired volume and
  sterile filtered through a 0.2 pim filter. The obtained LNPs are characterized in term of particle
  size, Zeta potential, alcohol content, total lipid content, nucleic acid encapsulated, and total
  nucleic acid concentration.
  LNP Manufacture Process
                    In a non-limiting example, LNP is prepared in bulk as follows. The process
  consists of (1) preparing a lipid solution; (2) preparing an siRNA/carrier solution; (3)
  mixing/particle formation; (4) incubation; (5) dilution; (6) ultrafiltration and concentration.
  Preparation of Lipid Solution
                    2L glass reagent bottles and measuring cylinders are depyrogenated. The lipids
  are warmed to room temperature. Into the glass reagent bottle is transferred 8.Og of Compound
  32 with a pipette and 1.2g of DSPC, 3.5g of Cholesterol, 0.9g of PEG-DMG are added. To the
  mixture is added 1L of ethanol. The reagent bottle is placed in heated water bath, at a
  temperature not exceeding 50*C. The lipid suspension is stirred with a stir bar. A
  thermocouple probe is put into the suspension through one neck of the round bottom flask with
  a sealed adapter. The suspension is heated at 30-40 *C until it became clear. The solution is
  allowed to cool to room temperature.
  Preparation of siRNA/Carrier Solution
                    Into a sterile container, such as the Coming storage bottle, is weighed 0.4 g
  times the water correction factor (approximately 1.2) of siRNA-1 powder. The siRNA is
  transferred to a depyrogenated 2 L glass reagent bottle. The weighing container is rinsed 3x
  with citrate buffer (20mM, pH 5.0) and the rinses are placed into the 2 L glass bottle, QS with
   citrate buffer to I L. The concentration of the siRNA solution is determined with a UV
)  spectrometer using the following procedure. 20 iL is removed from the solution, diluted 50
  times to 1000 ptL, and the UV reading recorded at A260 nm after blanking with citrate buffer.
   This is repeated. If the readings for the two samples are consistent, an average is taken and the
   concentration is calculated based on the extinction coefficients of the siRNAs. If the final
   concentration is out of the range of 0.40  0.01 mg/mL, the concentration is adjusted by adding
5  more siRNA/carrier powder, or adding more citrate buffer. This process is repeated for the
   second siRNA, if applicable.
                    Alternatively, if the siRNA/carrier solution comprised a single siRNA duplex
   and/or carrier instead of a cocktail of two or more siRNA duplexes and/or carriers, then the
                                                       31

   siRNA/carrier is dissolved in 20 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.0) to give a final concentration of 0.4
   mg/mL.
                    The lipid and ethanol solutions are then sterile filtered through a Pall Acropak
   20 0.8/0.2 gm sterile filter PN 12203 into a depyrogenated glass vessel using a Master Flex
   Peristaltic Pump Model 7520-40 to provide a sterile starting material for the encapsulation
   process. The filtration process is run at an 80 mL scale with a membrane area of 20 cm 2 . The
   flow rate is 280 mL/minute. This process is scaleable by increasing the tubing diameter and
   the filtration area.
   Particle formation - Mixing step
                    Using a two-barrel syringe driven pump (Harvard 33 Twin Syringe), the sterile
   lipid/ethanol solution and the sterile siRNA/carrier or siRNA/carrier cocktail/citrate buffer (20
   mM citrate buffer, pH 5.0) solutions are mixed in a 0.5mm ID T-mixer (Mixing Stage I) at
   equal, or nearly equal, flow rates. The resulting outlet LNP suspension contained 40-50 vol%
   ethanol. When a 45 vol% ethanol outlet suspension is desired, the sterile lipid/ethanol and the
   sterile siRNA/carrier or siRNA/carrier cocktail/citrate buffer solutions are mixed at flow rates
   of 54 mL/min and 66 mL/min, respectively, such that the total flow rate of the mixing outlet is
    120 mL/min.
   Dilution
                    The outlet stream of Mixing Stage I is fed directly into a 4mm ID T-mixer
    (Mixing Stage II), where it is diluted with a buffered solution at higher pH (20 mM sodium
   citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0) at a ratio of 1:1 vol:vol %. This buffered solution is
    at a temperature in the range of 30-40"C, and is delivered to the 4mm T-mixer via a peristaltic
   pump (Cole Parmer MasterFlex L/S 600 RPM) at a flow rate of 120 mL/min.
                    The outlet stream of Mixing Stage II is fed directly into a 6mm ID T-mixer
    (Mixing Stage III), where it is diluted with a buffered solution at higher pH (PBS, pH 7.4) at a
    ratio of 1:1 vol:vol%. This buffered solution is at a temperature in the range of 15-25 0 C, and
    is delivered to the 6mm T-mixer via peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer MasterFlex L/S 600 RPM)
C)  at a flow rate of 240 mL/min.
    Incubation and Free siRNA Removal
                    The outlet stream of Mixing Stage III is held after mixing for 30 minute
    incubation. The incubation is conducted at temperature of 35-40*C and the in-process
5   suspension was protected from light. Following incubation, free (un-encapsulated) siRNA is
    removed via anion exchange with Mustang Q chromatography filters (capsules). Prior to use,
    the chromatography filters are pre-treated sequentially with flushes of IN NaOH, IM NaCl,
    and a final solution of 12.5 vol% ethanol in PBS. The pH of the final flush is checked to
                                                     32

  ensure pH <8. The incubated LNP stream is then filtered via Mustang Q filters via peristaltic
  pump (Cole Parmer MasterFlex L/S 600 RPM) at flow rate of approximately 100 mL/min. The
  filtered stream is received into a sterile glass container for ultrafiltration and concentration as
  follows.
  Ultrafiltration, Concentration and Sterile Filtration
                    The ultrafiltration process is a timed process and the flow rates must be
  monitored carefully. This is a two step process; the first is a concentration step taking the
  diluted material and concentrating approximately 8-fold, to a concentration of approximately
  0.3-0.6 mg/mL siRNA.
                    In the first step, a ring-stand with an ultrafiltration membrane 100 kDa PES
  (Spectrum Labs) installed is attached to a peristaltic pump (Spectrum KrosFloJI System). 9.2 L
  of sterile distilled water is added to the reservoir; 3 L is drained to waste and the remainder is
  drained through permeate to waste. 5.3 L of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide is added to the
  reservoir with 1.5 L drained to waste and 3.1 L drained through permeate to waste.. The
  remaining sodium hydroxide is held in the system for sanitization (at least 10 minutes), and
  then the pump is drained. 9.2 L of 70 (v/v)% isopropyl alcohol is added to the reservoir with
   1.5 L drained to waste and the remainder drained through permeate to waste. 6 L of
  conditioning buffer (12.5% ethanol in phosphate buffered saline) is added with 1.5 L drained to
  waste and the remainder drained though the permeate until the waste is of neutral pH (7-8). A
  membrane flux value is recorded, and the pump is then drained.
                    The diluted LNP solution is placed into the reservoir to the 1.1 L mark. The
  pump is turned on at 2.3 L/min. After 5 minutes of recirculation, the permeate pump is turned
  on at 62.5 mL/min and the liquid level is constant at approximately 950 mL in the reservoir.
  The diluted LNP solution is concentrated from 9.8 L to 1.1 L in 140 minutes, and the pump is
  paused when all the diluted LNP solution has been transferred to the reservoir.
                    The second step is a diafiltration step exchanging the ethanol/aqueous buffer to
  phosphate buffered saline. During this step, approximately 10-20 diafiltration volumes of
  phosphate buffered saline are used. Following diafiltration, a second concentration is
) undertaken to concentrate the LNP suspension 3-fold to approximately 1-1.5 mg/mL siRNA.
  The concentrated suspension is collected into sterile, plastic PETG bottles. The final
  suspension is then filtered sequentially via Pall 0.45 um PES and Pall 0.2 um PES filters for
  terminal sterilization prior to vial filling.

                                              EXAMPLE I
  Mouse In Vivo Evaluation of Efficacy
                   LNPs utilizing Compounds 1-44, in the nominal compositions described
  immediately above, were evaluated for in vivo efficacy. The siRNA targets the mRNA
  transcript for the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene (Accession # M 15077). The primary
  sequence and chemical modification pattern of the luciferase siRNA is displayed above. The in
  vivo luciferase model employs a transgenic mouse in which the firefly luciferase coding
  sequence is present in all cells. ROSA26- LoxP-Stop-LoxP-Luc (LSL-Lue) transgenic mice
  licensed from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute are induced to express the Luciferase gene by
  first removing the LSL sequence with a recombinant Ad-Cre virus (Vector Biolabs). Due to the
  organo-tropic nature of the virus, expression is limited to the liver when delivered via tail vein
  injection. Luciferase expression levels in liver are quantitated by measuring light output, using
  an IVIS imager (Xenogen) following administration of the luciferin substrate (Caliper Life
  Sciences). Pre-dose luminescence levels are measured prior to administration of the RDVs.
  Luciferin in PBS (l5mg/mL) is intraperitoneally (IP) injected in a volume of 150 [pL. After a
5 four minute incubation period mice are anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in the IVIS
  imager. The RDVs (containing siRNA) in PBS vehicle were tail vein injected in a volume of
  0.2 mL. Final dose levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg siRNA. PBS vehicle alone was dosed
  as a control. Mice were imaged 48 hours post dose using the method described above.
                                                     37

Changes in luciferin light output directly correlate with luciferase mRNA levels and represent
an indirect measure of luciferase siRNA activity. In vivo efficacy results are expressed as %
inhibition of luminescence relative to pre-dose luminescence levels. Systemic administration of
the luciferase siRNA RDVs decreased luciferase expression in a dose dependant manner.
Greater efficacy was observed in mice dosed with Compound 1 containing RDVs than with the
RDV containing the octyl-CLinDMA (OCD) cationic lipid (Figure 1). OCD is known and
described in W02010/021865. Similar efficacy was observed in mice dosed with Compound
32 and 33 containing RDVs relative to the RDV containing the MC3 (Compound 46) cationic
lipid (Figure 11).

In vitro ApoE binding assay
                 LNPs are incubated at 374C in 90% rhesus serum at a final LNP concentration
of 4ug/mL. Incubation is for 20 minutes with orbital rotation. After incubation, the samples are
 diluted 1:20 in PBS and 100 uL of each diluted sample is aliquoted to wells of an anti-PEG
 antibody coated 96-well plate (Life Diagnostics Cat. No. P-OOOPL. After incubation at room
temperature for 1 hour, the plate is washed 5X with 300uL PBS. After washing, 50uL of 0.2%
 Triton X-100 is added to each well and the plate incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by
 shaking on a plate shaker for 1 minute at 750 rpm. Samples are frozen prior to performing the
 ApoE ELISA and stem loop PCR analysis of samples.
                  An ApoE ELISA assay is performed to quantitate ApoE bound to the LNPs after
 incubation in rhesus serum. Anti-ApoE antibody (Milipore, Cat No. AB947) is diluted 1:1000
 in PBS and 100 uL of diluted antibody is added to each well of a polystyrene high binding
 plate. The plate with antibody is incubated overnight at 40 C, after which the plate is washed 2X
 with 200uL of PBS. Next, 200uL of buffer containing 1%BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS
 (Incubation Buffer) is added to each well followed by incubation at room temperature for I
 hour. Plates are washed 5X with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Frozen Triton lysis test
 samples are thawed and diluted 1:6 with incubation buffer and 100 uL of test sample is
 aliquoted to wells of the ApoE antibody plate. Incubation is for 1 hour at room temperature
 followed by a 5X wash with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. After washing, 10OuL of
 biotinylated anti-ApoE antibody (Mabtech, Cat. ANo. E887-biotin), diluted 1:500 in incubation
 buffer, is added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by a 5X
 wash with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. 1OOuL per well, of Streptavidin-HPR (Thermo, Cat. No.
 TS-125-HR), is then added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing 5X
 with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, 10OuL of TMB Substrate (Thermo, Cat. No. 34028) is added to
  each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 minutes in the dark. The
  colorimetric reaction is stopped with I0OuL of TMB Stop Solution (KPL, Cat. No. 50-85-04)
                                                 38

  and absorbance at 450nm is determined. An ApoE standard curve is prepared by diluting
  rhesus Recombinant ApoE in incubation buffer with 0.03% Triton X-100 with concentrations
  ranging from 100 ng/mL to 0.78 ng/mL. ApoE standards are evaluated in the ELISA in
  parallel to the test samples. A rhesus serum only (no LNP) control is utilized to obtain a
  background subtraction for non-LNP dependent ApoE signal in the ELISA.
  Stem Loop RT-PCR Protocol
                   To normalize to the ApoE bound to the amount of LNP bound to the anti-PEG
  antibody plate, the amount of siRNA retained in the anti-PEG antibody well is quantitated by
   stem-loop PCR and related to the number of siRNAs encapsulated per LNP, to give an
   approximate measure of total LNP particles bound per well.
   Preparation of the Spiked Standard Curve Samples:
                   The standard curve is prepared using the molecular weight of the siRNA (13693
   g/mol for ApoB 17063) to calculate the copy number. The high standard should contain 10l
   copies per 3 pl. A 10-fold serial dilution is performed across a row of an assay plate until the
   lowest standard contains 102 copies per 3pl. Dilute 0.2% Triton X-100 1:80 in water and
   pipette 20 uL of the diluted Triton X-100 into 10 wells of a 96 well plate. 3OuL of the serial
   diluted standard curve and mix are added to each well of the plate. 10 uL of the spiked standard
   curve is used in the reverse transcription reaction.
   Stem-Loop RT-PCR - test samples and standard curve:
                   Triton lysates from the PEG antibody plate capture are diluted 1 to 2000 in
   nuclease free water. 1OuL of 'RT-Primer Mix' (Applied Biosystem's TaqMan MicroRNA

  Heparin Sepharose HI-TRAPTM Binding Assay
                  Lipid nanoparticles(LNP) with neutral surface charge are not retained after
  injection onto heparin sepharose with IX Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) as the
  running buffer but elute in the column void volume. Serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE) exhibits
  high affinity binding with heparin sulfate and it was shown that LNPs bind to heparin
  sepharose to an extent dependent on their intrinsic ability to bind ApoE (depending on both
  lipid nanoparticle composition and ApoE concentration) after incubation with purified and/or
  recombinant human ApoE or serum samples. Lipid nanoparticles with surface bound ApoE
  bind to heparin sepharose with high affinity and are eluted only at high salt (IM NaCl).
                  A heparin sepharose binding assay was developed to assess serum ApoE
  binding to lipid nanoparticles based on the high affinity interaction that ApoE-LNP complexes
  exhibit toward heparin sepharose.
  Incubations
                  Lipid nanoparticles were incubated at 370 C for 20 min at a final siRNA
  concentration of 50 pg/mL with various concentrations of either purified or recombinant
  human apolipoprotein E or 0.1-50% rat/mouse/rhesus monkey/human serum in IX Dulbecco's
  phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). After incubation with ApoE or serum LNP samples were
  diluted 10-fold using IX DPBS and analyzed by heparin sepharose chromatography. Peak area
  of retained LNP (after subtraction of appropriate blank signals) is compared to total peak area
  of LNP control without ApoE and/or serum incubation to determine the percentage of the LNP
  which undergoes shift to high affinity heparin interaction after incubation with ApoE/serum.
  Heparin Sepharose HI-TRAPTM Chromatographic Conditions
                  A heparin sepharose HI-TRAPTM chromatography column (GE Healthcare; 1
  mL bed volume) is equilibrated with either lX or 2X Dulbecco's PBS; the higher 2X salt
  concentration is used for LNPs with higher intrinsic retention on heparin sepharose
  (presumably due to higher positive surface charge).

  transferase in Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD) female rats (Charles River Labs). The siRNA
  targets the mRNA transcript for the ApoB gene (Accession # NM 019287). The primary
  sequence and chemical modification pattern of the ApoB siRNA is displayed above. The
  RDVs (containing siRNA) in PBS vehicle were tail vein injected in a volume of 1 to 1.5 mL.
  Infusion rate is approximately 3 ml/min. Five rats were used in each dosing group. After LNP
  administration, rats are placed in cages with normal diet and water present. Six hours post
  dose, food is removed from the cages. Animal necropsy is performed 24 hours after LNP
  dosing. Rats are anesthetized under isoflurane for 5 minutes, then maintained under anesthesia
  by placing them in nose cones continuing the delivery of isoflurane until ex-sanguination is
  completed. Blood is collected from the vena cava using a 23 gauge butterfly venipuncture set
  and aliquoted to serum separator vacutainers for serum chemistry analysis. Punches of the
  excised caudate liver lobe are taken and placed in RNALater (Ambion) for mRNA analysis.
  Preserved liver tissue was homogenized and total RNA isolated using a Qiagen bead mill and

                                                 46

  named TRE-MET. TRE-MET mice are transgenic mice in an FVB/N genetic background
  where the human MET transgene is expressed under an hCMV promoter with heptamerized
  upstream tet-operators. When TRE-MET mice are crossed with the LAP-tTA line, the double
  transgenic (TRE-MET/ LAP-tTA) mice express MET in a liver-specific manner which can be
  suppressed by administration of doxycycline. These mice develop HCC at ~ 3 months of age
  with visually identifiable tumor nodules on the liver surface and the tumors display a diffuse
  trabecular growth pattern typical for HCC and express the HCC tumor marker alpha
  fetoprotein (AFP). In addition, the mutation analysis in the tumor of TRE-MET mice has also
  identified activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene in approximately 95% of tumors. These
  features make the TRE-MET HCC mouse model suitable for evaluating LNP-mediated
  delivery of p-catenin siRNA and the resultant efficacy on tumor growth.
                  The effect of p-catenin containing LNPs in silencing r-catenin mRNA in both
  liver and tumor tissues was first evaluated in a pharmacodynamic (PD) study in TRE-MET
  mice bearing tumors. Different doses of LNPs or a high dose of LNPcontrol siRNA were
  intravenously administered and 72 hours later, necropsy was performed to collect liver and
  tumor tissues for the determination of p-catenin mRNA levels by Taqman. As shown in Figures
   8 and 9, Compound 33 induced robust and dose-dependent knockdown of p-catenin mRNA in
  both liver and tumor tissues, whereas no p-catenin knockdown was observed in animals
  receiving control siRNA or PBS. 0. 1 mpk and 0.05 mpk of LNP induced 88% and 69% KD in
  normal liver respectively. The KD in tumors ranges from 70% (2 mpk) to about 40% (0.1 or
   0.05 mpk). As shown in Figures 12 and 13, Compound 32 induced robust and dose-dependent
   knockdown of p-catenin mRNA in both liver and tumor tissues, whereas no p-catenin
   knockdown was observed in animals receiving control siRNA or PBS. 0.1 mpk and 0.05 mpk
   of LNP induced 76% and 78% KD in normal liver respectively. The KD in tumors ranges from
   47% (0.25 mpk) to about 20-30% (0.1 or 0.05 mpk).
                  The effect of LNP on tumor growth was evaluated in a multiple-dose efficacy
   study. TRE-MET HCC mice were dosed with Compound 33/siRNA-cat, Compound
   32/siRNAb-cat, control siRNA or PBS weekly for 3 weeks (3 doses) and the tumor volume in
   each animal was determined 7 days prior to the 1st dose and 3 days post the final dose by
D  microCT scan (Figures 10 and 14). In addition, 7 days after the final dose, liver and tumor
   tissues were collected for the assessment of p-catenin mRNA levels. While mice receiving PBS
   or control siRNA showed 360-470% growth in tumor burden, mice treated with Compound
   33/siRNAp-cat exhibited profound tumor growth inhibition or regression in a dose-dependent
   manner (Figure 10). 2 mpk and 0.5 mpk of Compound 33/siRNA-cat induced 60% and 40%
5  tumor regression respectively and 0.05 mpk caused tumor stasis. While mice receiving PBS or
   control siRNA showed -350% growth in tumor burden, mice treated with Compound
   32/siRNAp-cat exhibited profound tumor growth inhibition or regression in a dose-dependent
                                                   47

manner (Figure 14). 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 mg/kg of Compound 32/siRNAp-cat induced 37, 58, and
37% tumor regression respectively and 0.05 mpk caused tumor stasis.
