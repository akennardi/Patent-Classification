                     METHOD OF TREATMENT OF AGGRESSION
                                         BACKGROUND
  [0001]    Aggression and similar syndromes, including impulsivity and irritability, represent a
  broad category of behaviors that complicate the management of several disease states, such as
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, autism, and post traumatic
  stress disorder. In some cases, 25-50% of patients optimally treated for the underlying
  disorder continue to manifest these syndromes (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 2007
  Mar; 46(3):309-22).
  [00021    All of the publications, patent applications and patents cited in this specification are
  incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
  [0003]    Dopaminergic therapies are among the most prescribed for these behavioral
 syndromes, and include such molecules as haloperidol and other antipsychotics. The
 dopamine receptors for these molecules are grouped into two families: the Dl, which
 includes the Dl and D5 receptors, and the D2, which includes the D2, D3 and D4 receptors.
 The two families differ by the manner in which the receptor protein is incorporated into the
 cell membrane, and by the pharmacology of the molecules that have an affinity for each type.
 Each receptor type is a distinct entity with its unique gene, anatomy in the brain, and affinity
 for different molecules. Some dopamine receptor subtypes, such as the D2 receptor, have
 further modifications in the protein structure, giving rise to further sub-classification, e.g.,
 D2shor-t and D 2iong.
 [00041     There is increasing evidence that D5 receptor activity would be beneficial in the
treatment of aggression and similar behavioral syndromes.
 [0005]     The D5 receptor has very specific localization in the brain, and is found in such
areas as the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, as well as the prefrontal cortex,
hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra and raphe nucleus (Hartman DS,
Civelli 0. Molecular attributes of dopamine receptors: new potential for antipsychotic drug
development. Ann Med 1996; 28(3):211-9). The parafascicular nucleus is involved in the
behavioral process of attention to critical sensory input and activation of the subject toward
that stimulus. One of the important paradigms in which the parafascicular nucleus
participates is the activation of the fight or flight response. Therefore, the parafascicular
nucleus is likely involved in activating early components of aggressive behavior (Matsumoto

 N, Minamimoto T, Graybiel AM, Kimura M. Neurons in the thalamic CM-Pf complex supply
 striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events. J
 Neurophysiol 2001;85(2):960-76).
  [0006]   The gene for the D5 receptor, DRD5, is associated with impulsiveness and with
 symptomology associated with disruptive behavioral disorders, such as antisocial personality
 disorder (Vanyukov MM, Moss HB, Kaplan BB, Kirillova GP, Tarter RE. Antisociality,
 substance dependence, and the DRD5 gene: a preliminary study. Am J Med Genet
 2000;96(5):654-8). DRD5 is also associated with genetic transmission of a number of
 disorders associated with aggression, irritability and impulsivity, including schizophrenia,
 Tourette's, and ADHD (Maher BS, Marazita ML, Ferrell RE, Vanyukov MM. Dopamine
 system genes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis. Psychiatr Genet
 2002;12(4):207-15). Blockade of the D5 receptor in a knockout model is associated with
 decreased motor activity, which may be akin to decreased aggression (Holmes A, Hollon TR,
 Gleason TC, et al. Behavioral characterization of dopamine D5 receptor null mutant mice.
 Behav Neurosci 2001; 115(5): 1129-44).
 [0007]    Molindone is a typical antipsychotic drug that has high affinity for the D2 family of
 dopamine receptors, where it is thought to exert its therapeutic action. Molindone was
 previously suggested for the treatment of aggression in both adult and pediatric patients
 (Greenhill LL, Barmack JE, Spalten D, Anderson M, Halpern F. Molindone Hydrochloride in
the treatment of aggressive, hospitalized children [proceedings]. Psychopharmacol Bull
 1981;17(1):125-7; Itil TM, Wadud A. Treatment of human aggression with major
tranquilizers, antidepressants, and newer psychotropic drugs. J Nerv Ment Dis 1975; 160(2
 1):83-99). Molindone was also evaluated for children with the early-onset schizophrenia
spectrum disorders (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 2007, August, 46:8, p.9 6 9 - 978
and Am J Psychiatry, 165:11, Nov. 2008). WO 2010/080603 describes the use of molindone
for the treatment of aggression, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety
by reference.
[0008]     For adults with schizophrenia, the dose of molindone may range from 100 to 225mg
per day (Bagnall A, Fenton M, Kleijnen J, Lewis R. Molindone for schizophrenia and severe
mental illness. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2007(1):CD002083). In general, the dose of
other antipsychotics used for the treatment of aggressive behavior are about 50% relative to
those used for the treatment of psychosis in schizophrenia (J Am Acad Child Adolesc
Psychiatry. 2006 Jul;45(7):792-800).

                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[00091      The current invention offers a method of treatment of aggression in a human subject
suffering from ADHD, Tourette's and/or autism, comprising: (a) determining the weight or
age of the human subject; (b) calculating a dose of molindone needed to achieve a plasma
concentration, or other parameter (e.g., brain concentration), based on body weight or age,
that does not saturate the molindone receptors; (c) administering the dose of step (b)to the
human subject. The molindone receptors may comprise D2 receptors, D5 receptors, or both,
or others. The dose may be calculated such that the molindone administered would comprise
less than 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, even less than 20% of the molindone dose required for
treatment of schizophrenia.
[00101 The invention also provides a method of treating aggression in a human subject
suffering from ADHD, Tourette's and/or autism comprising administering a daily dose of
molindone between 15 mg and 60 mg for human subjects weighing over 30 kg and a daily
dose of molindone less than 25mg for human subjects weighing less than 30 kg.
    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00111      Unless otherwise specified, "a" or "an" means "one or more."
[0012]      A Phase Ilb study was conducted for the treatment of impulsive aggression in
Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients with a pharmaceutical
preparation of molindone. The study was a multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo
controlled clinical trial in children 6 to 12 diagnosed with ADHD and characterized by
impulsive aggression that is not controlled by optimal stimulant and psychosocial treatment.
It was a dose finding study with the primary objective of identifying an effective dose range
in children of different weight or age groups. The children were divided into two age groups
(i.e., less than 30 kg and greater than or equal to 30 kg). The low, medium, and high doses
for the under 30 kg group were 12 mg, 24 mg, and 36 mg, respectively. Similarly, the low,
medium, and high doses for the 30 kg and over group were 18 mg, 36 mg, and 54 mg,
respectively.
[00131     Three doses of molindone were studied with the primary endpoints of (a) effect in
reducing impulsive aggression (measured with change in the score of the Retrospective
Modified Overt Aggression Scale "R-MOAS" at the end of the study from the baseline), and
(b) rate of remission of aggression, after at least three weeks of treatment. Secondary

  objectives included safety and tolerability of molindone as well as the effect on the Clinical
  Global Impression and the Oppositional Defiant Disorder subscale score of the SNAP-IV
  Questionnaire and other endpoints [e.g., SNAP, clinical labs, AEs, etc.]. Patients who
  completed the study were offered the opportunity to continue into an open-label phase of six
  months duration.
  [0014]    The results varied by weight group of treated patients and by dose levels. For
 patients of weight 30 kg or more, the low (18 mg) and medium (36 mg) doses of molindone,
 but not the high (54 mg) dose showed statistical significance vs placebo on the change in R
 MOAS primary endpoint with p-values of 0.024 and 0.049 for the low and medium doses,
 respectively ( Example 1). In addition, both doses resulted in remission of aggression with
 statistical significance vs placebo with p-values of 0.004 and 0.02 1, respectively (Example 2).
 Finally, the low dose met all secondary endpoints of Clinical Global Impression for severity
 and improvement, and of Oppositional Defiant Disorder with statistical significance vs
 placebo with p-values of 0.007, 0.017 and 0.039, respectively. The high dose did not show
 efficacy across any of the measures.
 [0015]     It was unexpectedly discovered that for patients under 30 kg in weight the studied
 doses did not show statistical significance vs placebo on the R-MOAS endpoint. Coupled
 with the fact that the high dose did not show efficacy in the over 30 kg cohort, this
 observation indicates that the most effective doses are those that achieve certain plasma
 concentrations, exposure levels, or other parameters that do not exceed a level beyond which
 a saturation threshold is reached.
 [00161     The low (12 mg or 18 mg) and medium (24 mg or 36 mg) doses of molindone met
the efficacy endpoint of rate of remission of aggression for all patients with statistical
significance vs placebo and p-values of 0.009 and 0.043, respectively. The low and medium
doses showed a reduction in score for the R-MOAS with p-values of 0.071 and 0.115. The
clear and consistent trend for both arms reinforces the statistically significant remission
scores. Furthermore, the magnitude of the score reductions seen in both arms was in a range
that would be clearly clinically significant in patients.
[0017]     Molindone was well tolerated throughout the study across all doses. The patients
may also suffer from Tourette's and/or autism. Preferable ranges for low, medium, and high
doses for the under 30 kg group are 10 - 14 mg, 22-26 mg, and 34-38 mg, respectively.
Similarly, preferable ranges for the low, medium, and high doses for the 30 kg and over
group are 16 - 20 mg, 34-38 mg, and 52-56 mg, respectively.
