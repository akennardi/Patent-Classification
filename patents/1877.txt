       CONTAINER AND SET OF PREFORMS FOR FORMING A CONTAINER
[0001]     The invention relates to a container, especially of a bag-in-container type, and a
set of preforms for forming the same.
[0002]     The invention further relates to a tapping assembly for dispensing beverages. The
invention especially but not exclusively relates to such tapping assembly for dispensing a
beverage from a bag-in-container type container.
[0003]     The invention further relates to a connecting device for connecting a dispense line
or dispense tube or such dispense element and/or a gas line to a container.
[0004]     The invention further relates to a method for forming a container, especially of the
bag-in-container type.
[0005]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0006]     It is known to dispense beverages such as carbonated beverages, especially beer
from a rigid metal or wooden container such as a keg, barrel or cask by feeding pressurised
gas, such as C02 into the container, forcing the beverage out of the container.
[0007]     In an alternative system, as for example known from Heineken's DraughtKeg@ and
disclosed in for example EP1 064221, a beverage container can be provided with an
integrated, for example internal pressurizer, with which preferably automatically gas is
introduced into the container in order to pressurise the beverage for dispensing and maintain
as much as possible a constant pressure inside the container.
[0008]     It has further been known, as is for example known from Heineken's BeerTender@
and disclosed in WOOO/03944, to dispense beverages from a bag-in-container type of
container, in which a beverage is contained inside a flexible inner container, which is
suspended in a more rigid outer container. In such system a pressurising gas can be inserted
into the container, between the inner and outer container, thereby compressing the bag or
inner container, squeezing out the beverage without the pressurising gas coming into direct
contact with the beverage.

                                               -2
[0009]     In EP2148771 an integrally blow moulded bag-in-container is disclosed, for holding
and dispensing beverages, wherein at least one vent is provided running parallel to an
interface between inner and outer containers, which vent opens to the atmosphere at a
location adjacent to and orientated approximately coaxially with the bag-in-container's mouth.
EP2148771 fails to disclose how this container is used in a dispensing assembly, especially
how this is to be connected to a tapping line or tapping device.
[0010]     W02011/002295 further discloses a system in which a container is compressed
within a pressure chamber, such that beverage contained within the container is dispensed.
This requires a strong pressure chamber and an air tight closure of the pressure chamber to
the container.
[0011]     W02011/002294 discloses an integrally blow moulded bag-in-container type
container, wherein at a neck region of the inner container an opening is provided, opening
into a space between the inner and outer container. A closure can be provided, with a valve
and a gas feed channel, connecting to said opening for feeding gas under pressure into said
space. The full gas pressure is therein exerted on the neck region of the outer container, in
the neck region. In an alternative embodiment the opening could be in the neck of the outer
preform or container.
[0012]     The present invention aims at providing an alternative container, especially of a
BIC-type, for dispensing beverages. The present invention furthermore aims at a preform set
for manufacturing a container, especially of a BIC-type container. The invention further aims
at providing an alternative method for forming a beverage container. These aims are not
extensive. Other aims can and will be fulfilled by the present disclosure.
[0013]     Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the
claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
"including, but not limited to".
[0014]     In an aspect the present invention can be characterised by a container of a bag-in
container type, wherein a neck region of an outer container is provided with at least one
opening extending substantially radially there through, into a space between the outer
container and an inner container adjacent thereto. The neck region is provided with coupling
elements, preferably at opposite sides of said at least one opening, seen in circumferential
direction, for coupling of a connecting device to the container for introducing a pressure fluid
through said at least one opening into a space between the inner and outer container.

                                                -3
[0015]     In another aspect the present invention can be characterised by a set of preforms
for forming a container of a bag-in-container type, comprising an inner preform and an outer
preform. A neck region of an outer preform is provided with at least one opening extending
substantially radially there through, into a space between the outer preform and a part of the
inner preform adjacent thereto. The neck region is provided with coupling elements,
preferably at opposite sides of said at least one opening, seen in circumferential direction, for
coupling of a connecting device to a BIC container after blow moulding of the preforms, for
introducing a pressure fluid through said at least one opening into a space between the inner
and outer container.
[0016]     In embodiments the first container has a neck portion and the second container is
suspended in the first container, from the neck portion thereof. The neck portion of the
second container can extend at least partly and preferably entirely within the first container,
for example within the neck region of the first container. The container can for example be
used in an assembly which can further comprise a connecting device, connected or
connectable to the neck portion. The connecting device can then comprise at least one
connecting element for connecting to the at least one opening, wherein the connecting
element is connected to a source of a pressurising fluidum, preferably a pressurised gas.
[0017]     In embodiments the first container is more rigid than the second container, at least
in body portions thereof, whereas the at least one opening opens into said space in a
substantially radial direction, perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the neck region. The
connecting element can connect to said at least one opening in substantially the same radial
direction. Preferably the connecting element is movable relative to the opening, more
preferably in said substantially radial direction, between a release position spaced apart from
the opening and a connecting position gastight connecting to said opening.
[0018]     Another aspect of the invention can be characterised by a method for forming a
container, wherein a bag-in-container is blow moulded integrally from at least two super
positioned preforms or an integral, multilayer preform, such that an outer container and an
inner container or bag are formed. Prior to or after blow moulding the container a closure ring
can be provided, for example by spin welding the ring onto the inner and outer preforms,
closing off a space between the inner and outer preforms and the containers blow moulded
there from. Alternatively or additionally the two preforms or containers can be welded,
especially spin welded or otherwise connected to each other at the neck regions, closing off
the space between the containers or preforms. At least one opening is provided in a
peripheral wall of a neck region of one of the preforms and/or containers, preferably the outer
preform and/or container, opening into said space, for introducing gas under pressure into

                                                -4
said space and compressing the inner container within the outer container. After blow
moulding the container the inner container is filled with beverage and a valve is mounted in
or on an opening in said ring, opening into said inner container.
[0019]     When connecting the preforms by a ring, which can be an integral part of one of
the preforms or can be a separate ring, preferably at least one and more preferably two
labyrinth shaped sections are formed, within the neck region, preventing debris formed
during welding, especially spin welding, from falling into the space between the inner and
outer containers. Such debris, for example small pieces of plastic, could damage, especially
puncture the inner and/or outer container, which is avoided by the labyrinth sections.
[0020]     Preforms and preform assemblies will be discussed and disclosed for forming a
container.

[0051]     In this description embodiments are shown and disclosed of the invention, by way
of example only. These should by no means be interpreted or understood as limiting the
scope of the present invention in any way. In this description the same or similar elements
are indicated by the same or similar reference signs. In this description embodiments of the
present invention shall be discussed with reference to carbonated beverages, especially
beer. However, other beverages could also be used in the present invention.
[0052]     In this description references to above and below, top and bottom and the like shall
be considered, unless specifically stipulated differently, to a normal orientation of a container
standing on a bottom part and having a neck region comprising an orifice for filling and/or
dispensing facing substantially upward. This is for example shown in the drawings, especially
fig. 17, wherein top, bottom, up and down are indicated by arrows and appropriate wording,
for indicative purposes only. This does not necessarily reflect the orientation in which a
tapping device of the present disclosure or parts thereof have to be used.

                                               -7
[0053]     In this description a bag-in-container has to be understood as meaning at least a
container comprising an outer holder and an inner holder, wherein the inner holder is
designed to hold a beverage and is more flexible or compressible than the outer holder. The
outer holder can for example be a container, such as a bottle shaped container with a neck
and a body, a box shaped holder or the like, whereas the inner holder can be a flexible
container, such as a bag. The inner and/or outer holder can be made of mono materials or
blends, can be made entirely or partly by injection moulding and/or blow moulding, rotation
moulding or the like. Preferably a bag-in-container according to the invention is made by
integrally blow moulding. In embodiments the bag-in-container can be made by inserting at
least one preform into another preform and then blow moulding them together into a bag-in
container type container. In embodiments the bag-in-container can be made by over
moulding at least one preform forming a multi layered preform and then blow moulding them
together into a bag-in-container type container. In embodiments a bag can be suspended
inside an outer container, after forming the outer container and the bag separately, at least in
part.
[0054]     In the present disclosure by way of example a bag in container (BIC) shall be
described, integrally blow moulded from a preform set comprising two plastic preforms, super
imposed, which should be understood as meaning that one of the preforms is inserted into
the other, after which they are together blow moulded in a known manner into a BIC. In
embodiments prior to said blow moulding a closure ring is fitted over the preforms,
connecting them together and closing off the space, which can also be referred to as
interface or inter space, between the preforms, such that at least after blow moulding said
space is or can be in communication with the environment only through one or more
openings provided in a neck region of the container, especially an outward opening,
extending through a wall of the neck region of the outer preform and/or container. The said at
least one opening can be provided during manufacturing the preforms, especially during
injection moulding thereof, but could also be provided later, for example by punching, drilling
or otherwise machining. In embodiments the ring can be provided as an integral part of one
of the preforms.
[0055]     In this description a tapping assembly shall be described, comprising at least a
connecting device, a container, especially a bag in container (BIC) type container and a tap
or such device to which the container is to be coupled, as well as a source of pressurised
gas, such as air. The tap and source of gas shall not be discussed explicitly, since these are
commonly known in the art. In advantageous embodiments as a gas to be introduced into the
container air can be used, for example pressurised by a compressor, connected to the
connecting device by a gas line, especially an air hose. As pressure fluidum other gasses

                                                 -8
can however be used, such as C02, or another fluidum, such as water. The fluidum can be
supplied in any suitable way, as is known in the art. As a tap any fixed or mobile tap can be
used, depending on for example the tapping line used. In embodiments the tapping line can
be a replaceable tapping line, especially a disposable tapping line, as for example used in
Heineken's David@ system, as for example disclosed in EP1289874 or US2004226967, in
which case a tap can be used to which the tapping line can be releasably coupled, for
example by an in-line valve or by forming a valve assembly of the hose valve type, or by a
quick coupling type coupling. In other embodiments the tapping line used can be a fixed
tapping line of a beverage dispense system. Both types of systems are well known in the art
and shall not be further discussed.
[0056]      Fig. 1 shows in a side view part of a first embodiment of a tapping assembly 1,
showing a neck region 2 of a container 3, a gas connecting unit 4 of a connecting device 5,
connected to a gas line 6, such as an air line or air hose, and a connector 7 connected to a
tapping line 8, especially a flexible tapping line. As will be discussed the gas connecting unit
4 can be connected to the neck region 2, whereas the connector 7 can be coupled to or at
least over a valve 9 mounted in a closure ring 10 of the container 3. The container is a bag
in-container type container 3.
[0057]      Fig. 2 shows in a side view part of a second embodiment of a tapping assembly 1,
showing a neck region 2 of a container 3, a gas connecting unit 4 of a connecting device 5,
connected to a gas line 6, such as an air line or air hose, and a connector 11 connected to a
tapping line 8, especially a flexible tapping line. As will be discussed the gas connecting unit
4 can be connected to the neck region 2, whereas the connector 1 can be coupled to the gas
unit 4, in a position over a valve 9 mounted in a closure ring 10 of the container 3. The
container is a bag-in-container type container 3.
[0058]      Alternative to the embodiment of fig. 2 the connector 11 could also be integral to
the connecting device 5. In such embodiment preferably the tapping line 8 is provided with a
valve spaced apart from or in the connector 11 for closing off the tapping line 8, such that
when connecting the connecting device 5 to the container 3 and thereby opening the valve 9
as will be discussed, beverage will not flow out of the tapping line 8 unintended. Such valve
can for example be as disclosed in EP1 289874 or US2004226967, and as discussed here
above.
[0059]      In the embodiments of fig. 1 and 2 the container 3 and the unit 4 can be the same,
whereas the connectors 7 and 11 can be different, the connector 7 of the first embodiment
being designed basically for single use, i.e. for use with one container only, disposable with

                                                 -9
the tapping line 8, although it could be reusable for different containers, whereas in the
second embodiment the connector 11 is designed basically for repeated use, i.e. for use with
a series of different containers 3. A connecting device according to this description can
therefore comprise an air unit 4 and, depending on the intended use, either one or both of
the connectors 7, 11. The connector 7 of the first assembly could be provided with and/or
could be discarded with the container 3, such that for each subsequent container 3 a new
connector 7 is used.
[0060]      In fig. 1 and 2 schematically a tapping device 200 is shown, to which the tapping
line 8 is connected in a known and suitable manner, such that when operating a tapping
handle 201 of the tapping device 200, beverage from the container 3 can flow through the
tapping line 8 and out of the tapping device 200.
[0061]      Embodiments of the air unit 4 and container 3 shall be discussed in general,
whereas the connectors shall be described with specific references to the relevant figures.
[0062]     As can be seen in fig. 1 and 2 the container 3 can have an outer container 12 with
a body 13, of which a shoulder portion is visible in fig. 1 - 8, having a substantially cylindrical
neck 15 forming part of the neck region 2. The neck comprises a ring shaped flange 14 as is
common in the art and can for example be used for engaging the preform from which the
container is formed as well as the container during manufacturing, filling and/or further
handling, whereas the flange 14 can also increase the rigidity of the neck 15. The neck 15 is
further provided with a number of coupling elements 16, preferably above the flange 14,
which can cooperate with compatible coupling provisions 17 of the gas unit 4, as will be
explained hereafter. The coupling elements 16 and provisions can together form a bayonet
type coupling assembly.
[0063]      In fig. 11 a neck region 2 of a container 3 is shown, whereas fig. 14 - 18 show a
preform assembly 19 that can be used for forming such container as well as a container 3 as
such.
[0064]     The preform assembly 19 comprises an outer preform 20 and an inner preform 21,
which is inserted into the outer preform 20. Both preforms 20, 21 are in the embodiment
shown basically rotational symmetrical around a longitudinal axis X - X, though openings 22
as will be discussed can be provided in discrete positions. Other shapes and dimensions
would be possible too. The outer preform will, when blow moulded, form the outer container
12, whereas the inner preform 21 will by blow moulding form an inner container 35, which will

                                               -10
be more flexible than the outer container 12 and may for example be a bag or balloon or
such container.
[0065]      The outer preform 20 has a neck or neck region 15, as indicated before, which on
the inside is provided with a shoulder 23, for example at a longitudinal level substantially the
same as an upper face 14A of the flange 14. The inner preform 21 has a neck or neck region
24, which is wider than a body forming portion 25 thereof, such that a shoulder 26 is formed
which can rest on the shoulder 23 of the outer preform 20. Thus an insertion depth is
defined. As can be seen the shoulder 26 and the neck 24 of the inner preform 21 can be
provided with spacer elements 27, such as teeth, channels or the like, such that at least at
different peripheral positions gaps are maintained between the preforms at the neck and
shoulder regions, in order to prevent them from close contact, since such close contact could
seal off the shoulders 23, 26 and necks 15, 24 or at least substantially prevent gas such as
air passing the shoulders 23, 26 into the body 32 of the container, between outer and inner
containers 12, 35.
[0066]      In the embodiment shown the spacer elements 27 can comprise a flange or ridge
121 extending outward from the outer surface of the neck region of the inner preform 21, for
example approximately at a level of the lower end of or just below the outer wall part 49B of
the groove 49, which has an outer diameter only slightly smaller than the inner diameter of
the neck of the outer preform at the same level. This flange or ridge 121 thus can form at
least part of a shoulder 26 for resting on the shoulder 23 in the outer preform 20. The flange
or ridge 121 comprises at least one and preferably a number of cut-troughs 122. As is shown
in fig. 16 this or these cut-troughs 122 can each be in communication with a channel 122A
extending in an outer face of the inner preform and/or in an inner face of the outer preform,
extending over at least part of a shoulder forming part 123 thereof. Upon blow moulding the
BIC integrally from the preforms 20, 21 the shoulder forming part 123 will be expanded in
radial and tangential direction, for forming a shoulder of the inner and outer containers. The
cut troughs 122 and the channels 122A will remain open, even though the channels 122A will
deform slightly, such that a clear passage for pressurised gas is obtained or maintained from
the at least one opening 22 into the space 32 between the body forming portions of the inner
and outer containers. As can for example be seen in fig. 15 and 18 the neck 24 of the inner
preform 21 and the neck 15 of the outer preform 20 and/or outer and inner containers 12, 35
are connected to a closure ring 10, such that an air tight connection is provided between the
neck 26 and the ring 10 and between the neck 15 and the ring 10. The ring 10 thus closes off
the upper end of the space or interface 28 between the outer and inner preform 20, 21 or
containers 12, 35 formed there from.

                                                 - 11
[0067]      In the embodiments shown the ring 10 is mounted on the free ends 30, 31 of the
respective necks 15, 26 of the outer 20 and inner preform 21 or containers 12, 35. The free
ends 30, 31 are formed at a side of the respective necks 15, 26 at a side remote from the
body 32 of the container 3. These free ends 30, 31 are positioned at first and second
longitudinal levels A and B. Each level A, B can for example be represented as a plane
substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis X - X. The levels A and B can coincide,
but in the embodiment shown the level A at which the free end 30 of the outer preform 20 or
outer container 12 lies is positioned at a higher longitudinal level A, that is further from the
body 32 of the container 3 than the level B at which the free end 31 of the inner preform 21
or container 35 formed therefore, which may be a bag, is positioned.
[0068]      In the embodiment shown in fig. 14B the inner preform 21 can have longitudinal
length X, which is substantially smaller than the longitudinal length X 2 of the outer preform
20, such that a substantial open area is formed between bottom portions 33A, 33B of the
inner 20 and outer preform 21. This means that the outer longitudinal length of the inner
container below the neck region, including the bottom forming portion, is considerably
smaller than the inner longitudinal length of the outer container below the neck forming
portion. Thus when blow moulding the preforms into a container, the inner preform 21 is
likely to be stretched longitudinally first, before the outer preform is stretched as well, which
can mean that the wall thickness of the body forming portion 28 of the inner container 35 or
bag formed is reduced more significantly than the wall thickness of the outer container 12
when stretched. Moreover this may lead to different material properties of the inner and outer
containers formed, even if the same material is used. The same material should be
understood as at least meaning the same type of plastic, even if they are different grades of
such plastic, or the same blends of plastics, wherein blends are at least considered the same
within the context of this application when they contain substantially the same plastic
materials in substantially the same weight percentages. Substantially the same should be
understood in this context as at least meaning within 10% differences in weight ratios,
wherein substantially the same plastics should be understood as meaning that they should
comprise the same plastics, even if they are different grades, whereas if they contain
different plastics, the amount of difference may by weight ratio not exceed 10 percent of the
total weight of the preforms or containers. In embodiments the inner and outer preform may
be made of different plastic materials. Release agents or the like may be provided between
the preforms and/or parts thereof. A substantial open area should be understood as meaning
that the area is seen in the longitudinal length direction of the preforms larger than strictly
necessary for accommodating fabrication tolerances of the injection moulded preforms and
possibly a stub formed at the bottom portion 33B of the inner preform, which is due to the

                                                 -12
injection point of the preform being present centrally at said bottom portion 33B. By way of
example only, (X2-X1)/X2 could be in a range of for example between 0.1 and 0.3.
[0069]      In the embodiment of fig. 14D the lengths X1 and X2 of the inner and outer
preforms 21, 20 are chosen such that the bottom portion 33B of the inner preform 21 is
close, preferably as close as possible to the bottom portion 33A of the outer preform 20 as
physically possible, taking into account normal production tolerances for the preforms and
alignment of the preforms relative to each other and for accommodating the stub resulting
from the injection point of the inner preform 21. This can be understood that said lengths are
a close to being equal as allowable. In embodiments this means that the difference in length
X2 and X1 would be in the order of a few millimetres. The difference in length is preferably
sufficient to allow relative rotation of the inner preform and the outer preform during spin
welding steps. By way of example, which should not be understood as limiting the scope of
the disclosure in any way, for a BIC having an internal volume for beverage of between 15
and 20 litres, the difference in length X2 and X1 could be less than 5 mm, for example les
than 4 mm, at a total outer length of the outer preform 20 of for example about 250 mm. The
relation (X2-X1)/X2 can be in the order of less than 0.1, for example about 0.05 or less. By
making the preforms 20, 21 substantially of the same length, the stretch ratios of the
preforms 20, 21 during blow moulding them together into a BIC will be better controlled and
more optimal for the material properties of both the inner and outer container. For example
the inner container will be prevented from being over stretched. Over stretching the inner
container could be detrimental to its strength and could make the inner container prone to
breaking. The outer container could be prevented from being under stretched. Under
stretching of the outer container could lead to a container with insufficient stability necessary
for performing its functions, such as but not limited to protecting the inner container and
providing for a pressure barrel in order to be able to squeeze the inner container by
pressurising the space between the inner and outer container.
[0070]      The plastic materials and processing parameters for especially blow moulding
should be chosen such that the inner container 35 will release from the body 13 of the outer
container 12 when the space 32 in between them is pressurised to a pressure sufficient to
properly dispense the beverage by squeezing at least part of the body portion of the inner
container. The release pressure can be understood as the difference between the pressure
of the fluidum, especially gas, such as air or C02 introduced into the space 32 between the
inner and outer containers and the pressure inside the inner container, for example provided
by a carbonated beverage enclosed therein, such as but not limited to beer. This pressure
difference preferably is relatively low, such as for example less than about 1 bar (1.10 5 Pa),
more preferably less than 0.5 Bar (0.5.105 Pa), even more preferably less than 0.2 Bar

                                                -13
(0.2.10,5 Pa). A low release pressure will have the advantage that the absolute pressure
within the space 32 and therefore within the BIC can be kept relatively low, which can
increase safety. For example a pressure in said space can be kept below 4 barg , more
specifically less than 3 barg absolute. Preferably the outer and inner preforms 20, 21 or
containers 12, 35 are not connected to each other over any substantial area within the body
32.
[0071]     As can be seen in for example fig 11, 15 and 18 at least one opening 22 can be
provided, extending through the wall of the neck 15 of the outer container 12. In the
embodiment shown there are two such openings 22, diametrically opposite each other. The
opening or openings 22 is/are positioned at a longitudinal level C between the levels A and
B. i.e. above the flange 14 and below the free end 30 of the outer preform 20 or container 12.
[0072]     In embodiments the free ends 30, 31 are spaced apart over a longitudinal distance
W. The closure ring 10, as is shown for example in fig. 11, 12, 14, 15, 15A ,18A, 19A-D and
20A-D in more detail, can comprise a central opening 34, opening into the inner volume of
the inner preform 21 or inner container 35, and is designed to hold a valve 9 as will be
discussed. The closure ring 10 can be provided with an outer, first ring shaped portion or
flange 36 that can be positioned on the free end 30 of the outer preform 20 or outer container
12, an intermediate or second peripheral ring shaped flange or portion 37 that can be
positioned on the free end 31 of the inner preform 21 or inner container 35, and an inner or
third peripheral ring shaped flange or portion 38. The outer and intermediate portions 36, 37
are connected by a first peripheral wall 39, extending upward from an outer edge 43 of the
intermediate portion 37. The intermediate and inner portions 37 and 38 are connected by a
second peripheral wall 40, extending downward from an inner edge 44 of the intermediate
portion 37. From an inner edge 41 of the inner portion 38 a third peripheral wall 42 extends
upward, forming or at least enclosing the opening 34. The walls 39, 40 and 42 can be
considered as forming substantially concentric skirts. The second and third walls 40, 42 can
be substantially parallel to each other and to the longitudinal axis X - X, whereas the first wall
can slope slightly outward in upward direction.
[0073]     The first wall 39 preferably extends directly adjacent the inner face 45 of the neck
15 of the outer preform 20 or container 12, such that the outer edge 43 is positioned above
the shoulders 23 and 26, wherein the neck portion 24A of the neck 24 between the free edge
31 and the shoulder 26 is enclosed between the said edge 43 and the shoulder 23.
Preferably at least at a lower end of the first wall 39, close to the edge 43 a gap is provided
between the wall 43 and the inner face 45. The second wall 40 extends preferably adjacent
the inner face 46 of the neck 24 of the inner preform 21 or inner container 35. The inner

                                               -14
portion 38 of the closure ring 10 can be positioned at the longitudinal level of the shoulder 23
and/or the flange 14. Thus the neck 24 of the inner preform 21 or container 35 is well
enclosed. The third or inner wall 42 can extend from the portion 38 upward to a level D
substantially the same as level A, and preferably below a top surface 47 of the first or outer
portion 37. The contact surfaces between the ring 10 and the free ends 30, 31 could have
any suitable shape and configuration, and may depend on for example the method of
connecting. In embodiments the ring 10 can be connected to the preforms by mechanical or
physical means, such as but not limited to press fitting, screw threads, bayonet coupling,
glue, welding, over moulding or other suitable means. In the present disclosure especially
welding is disclosed, more specifically spin welding, by way of example. Combinations of
connecting techniques as discussed are also possible. The configuration discussed hereafter
is not limiting but may be advantageous for welding, especially spin welding.
[0074]      In the embodiment as shown in for example fig. 14 C and D and fig. 15A and 18A
the ring 10 is mounted substantially entirely within the neck portion of the outer container. In
this embodiment the ring 10 is not provided with the flange 36, or at least not such flange for
resting on top of the neck of the outer container but is during spin welding forced into and
fused with an internal portion of the neck of the outer preform 20.
[0075]      In the embodiments shown the ring 10 and free ends 30, 31 of the preforms or
containers form a labyrinth 32A type of connecting, which may be beneficial because it can
limit or even prevent debris coming from the plastic during spin welding or otherwise
connecting the parts from entering into the space 28 and/or into the inner volume 48 of the
inner preform 21 or inner container 35. In the embodiment shown the free edge 31 of the
inner preform 21 and/or of the inner container 35 is provided with an annular groove 49,
between an inner wall portion 49A and an outer wall portion 49B, open in upward direction,
away from the body 32. From the intermediate portion 38 a skirt 50 extends downward,
preferably a peripheral skirt, into the groove 49. The groove 49 is preferably somewhat
deeper than the height 51 of the skirt 50, whereas the skirt may be slightly wider than the
groove 49, at least over part of its height 51. In fig. 15 overlapping materials are shown at the
top right hand corner of the groove, which may be used during spin welding, to merge the
ring 10 and inner preform 21 or container 35. The free end 30 of the outer preform 20 and/or
of the outer container 35 can be provided with a further annular or peripheral skirt 52,
whereas the outer portion 37 of the ring may be provided, at the side facing said free edge
30, with an annular groove 53. The depth of the groove 53 may again be slightly larger than
the height of the skirt 53 above the free end 30. During welding any material released from
the ring 10 and/or the preforms 20, 21 or containers 12, 35 respectively may, at least to a
large extend, be caught within the grooves 49, 53.

                                               -15
[0076]      In the embodiment shown in fig. 14C and D and fig. 15A and 18A, a second
labyrinth 32B type of connection is provided between the inner and outer preforms 21, 20
and the ring 10. In this embodiment the outer wall portion 49B of the groove 49 of the inner
container 21 is extending further upward relative to the inner wall portion 49A thereof,
forming a peripheral lip portion 49C inclined outward, such that the free edge 49D of said lip
portion 49C is in close proximity of or in contact with the inner face 45 of the neck outer
preform or outer container, preferably above the at least one opening 22, that is at a side of
said at least one opening 22 facing towards the free ends 30, 31. In this embodiment any
debris forming during connecting the ring 10, especially to the outer preform, for example by
spin welding, or otherwise present at the ring will be caught by said lip portion 49C and will
be trapped, prevented from entering into the space 32.
[0077]      In the embodiment shown of the closure ring 10, the second wall 40 may be
provided with engagement elements 54 for engaging the ring 10 during spin welding, in
which the ring and preforms 20, 21 and/or containers 12, 35 are rotated relative to each other
around the longitudinal axis X - X at such speed and pressure that the materials of the ring
10 and the preforms 20, 21 and/or containers 12, 35 at least partly melt and merge, such that
a gas and liquid tight connection is obtained, as is schematically shown especially in the
cross section of fig. 18. Spin welding as such is a technique well known in the art and is
therefore not discussed herein in extenso. The engagement elements 54, here shown as
teeth, enable an easy and firm grip of the closure ring 10.
[0078]      In embodiments of a method of the disclosure the preforms 20, 21 and the ring 10
can be assembled prior to blow moulding. In embodiments they can be assembled directly or
shortly after injection moulding of the preforms, and then stored and shipped to a filling
station, where they can be blow moulded into a container directly prior to filling the container
with a beverage. In an alternative embodiment the preforms and the ring 10 can be shipped
in a position in which the ring 10 is not connected to both preforms 20, 21 or at least not to
one of them, such that the inner preform can be inserted into the outer preform directly prior
to blow moulding the container, which would typically be close to or in line with a blow
moulding apparatus and a filling station for filling beverage into the container. An advantage
thereof could be that when for example a release agent is used between the inner and outer
preforms, for preventing at least in part adherence between the inner and outer containers,
this release agent can be applied directly prior to blow moulding, which may prevent the
release agent from running, which could lead to an uneven distribution and therefore
improper functioning of the release agent. Such release agent, which in itself is known in the
art, could be applied for example by (dip)coating or spraying, for example using a silicon
based material. In embodiments the ring could be adhered to the inner preform first, and then

                                                -16
to the outer preform, for example after applying a release agent. In embodiments the ring 10
can be part of the inner preform, at least in part. In embodiments the ring 10 can be adhered
to the outer preform only after blow moulding the container from the set of preforms. In
embodiments the inner preform could be blow moulded into a container blow moulded from
the outer preform.
[0079]     When assembling the inner and outer preforms directly prior to blow moulding
them into the container an advantage can be obtained that the preforms, and especially the
inner preform, can be heated at least in part prior to inserting the inner preform into the outer
preform, which facilitates accurate heating of the preforms even further.
[0080]     During blow moulding of a container 3 a tool of a blow moulding apparatus, such
as for example a stretch rod, heating device or the like can be inserted through the opening
34 in the ring 10, if previously provided, wherein the opening 34 is preferably slightly larger
than the relevant cross section of the tool, such that pressure release of the inner volumes of
the preforms is possible, at least partly passed the tool.
[0081]     As can be seen in for example fig. 11, 15 and 18, the opening or openings 22 open
into the space or interface 28 between the necks 15, 24 at a level just above the level B. In
other words through such opening 22 the wall 39 and/or a lip portion 49C if applicable is
visible. Any gas such as air injected into and through the opening will therefore impinge onto
said wall, which is relatively rigid, and be forced down towards the body 32. By providing the
or each opening in the neck region 2, it is ensured that during blow moulding of the container
3 the opening or openings 22 will not be deformed or displaced, since the neck region 2 will
not deform during blow moulding.
[0082]     As is shown in for example fig. 11, a valve 9, such as but not limited to an aerosol
valve type valve as is commonly known in the art and for example described in WOOO/35803
or EP1 506129. The valve 9 is mounted in a clinch plate 55, for example made of metal or
plastic, which can be clinched onto a upper end 56 of the inner wall 42. In the embodiment
shown the valve 9 is a female type aerosol type of valve. Obviously also other such valves
can be used, such as but not limited to male aerosol valves and/or tilting aerosol valves and
the like. Any type of valve suitable for closing off the dispense opening and for being opened
by the connecting device or connector or dispense adapter can be used in the present
disclosure. The valve 9 preferably extends below the level 47 of the outer portion of the
closure ring 10, such that the valve 9 is well protected. The valve 9 with clinch plate 55
closes off the opening 34 and thus the inner volume of the inner container 35. In the
embodiment as for example shown in fig. 4, 5, 7 and 8 the valve 9 is connected to a dip tube

                                               -17
108. In the embodiment of fig. 5A such dip tube 108 is omitted. In this embodiment, which
could be used with the container standing on its bottom and the valve 9 on top, the head
space of the inner container will be emptied and removed immediately upon pressurising the
container and opening the valve 9 for the first time, such that after that the entire remaining
volume of the inner container will be filled with beverage when pressurised sufficiently,
improving the tapping behaviour and the quality of the beverage. In this embodiment a valve
body 130 of the valve 9 is biased in a manner known from for example aerosol valves,
against a seal 131 by a spring enclosed within a housing 132.1n this embodiment the housing
is provided with relatively large side openings 133 for not unduly restriction the flow when the
valve 9 is opened.
[0083]     As can be seen in for example fig. 9, the unit 4 comprises an opening 60,
extending through the unit 4, such that the unit 4 can be placed over the neck region 2 of the
container 3, The opening 60 can be dimensioned such that the neck region, especially the
neck 15 first relatively snugly into said opening 60, up to the flange 14, as is for example
shown in fig. 4 and 5 for the first embodiment and fig. 7 and 8 for the second.
[0084]      Fig. 1OA shows an exploded view of an embodiment of a gas connecting unit 4.
This unit 4 comprises a first part 61 or housing, and a second part 62 which may also be
referred to as operating ring 62. In the embodiment shown the housing 61 comprises a top
part 61A and a bottom part 61 B, which can enclose the second part 62 and can be screwed
or otherwise connected together. Screws 63 are indicatively shown. The second part 62 has
a substantially ring shaped wall 64, defining a central opening 65 extending around and/or
forming part of a wall of the opening 60. Two wings 66 extend from opposite sides of the ring
shaped wall 64. On the inside facing side of the wall 64 recesses 67 are provided, for
receiving coupling elements 16 from below. The lower part 61 A of the housing comprises a
peripheral edge 68 with complementary recesses 69 through which the coupling elements 16
can pass, when aligned with the recesses 67, into or out of the recesses 67. The second part
62 is movable relative to the first part 61 such that the recesses 67 and 69 can be brought
into and out off alignment, such that when in alignment the unit 4 can be placed on or
removed from a container 3, whereas when out of alignment the position of the unit 4 is
secured on the container or at least such placing or removing of the unit is prohibited. In the
embodiment shown the relative movement is a rotation around the longitudinal axis X - X or
around the longitudinal axis Y - Y of the opening 60, which may coincide with axis X - X when
the unit is placed on the container.
[0085]     As can be understood from the drawings, in the embodiment shown the first part
61 is provided such that the second part 62 can rotate around said axis Y - Y within the first

                                              -18
part 61 over an angle, but is substantially prevented from any further movement, such as
translations or other rotations, for example by said edge 68. By placing the unit 4 on a
container 3 with the coupling elements 16 within the recesses 67, the second part 62 is
substantially prevented from rotation around the axis X - X by the engaging coupling
elements 16 and recesses 67. Thus a rotation of the first part 61 will lead to a movement
thereof relative to the second part 62 and the container 3 around the axis X - X and thus to
locking the coupling elements 16 within the recesses 67 by the edge 68. The edge 68 can
engage the lower sides of the coupling elements 16. By positioning the elements 16 at a non
equal peripheral spacing, the position of the unit on the container is defined or at least only a
limited and well defined number of positions is possible. In the embodiment shown there are
four such coupling elements, positioned in pairs, such that two positions of the unit are
possible, which differ in an orientation over 180 degrees. Obviously it could be possible to
position the elements 16 such that only one such position is possible, or for example four.
The opening or openings 22 can be positioned between two adjacent coupling elements 16,
such that the adjacent elements 16 are closer to each other than to an next coupling element
16 of the or an other pair of such elements 16.
[0086]     In the wall 64 between the relevant recesses 67 an opening 69 is provided, for
example at the position of one of the wings 66. A connecting element 70 is movable relative
to the opening 69, between a retracted position, as for example shown in fig. 10 left hand
side, and a forward or extended position, in which the connecting element 70 extends from
the opening 69 into the opening 60, such that a forward end 71 engages the neck 12 of the
container 3 at an the opening 22, such that gas can be inserted through the connecting
element 70 into and through the opening 22 into the space 28 for compressing the inner
container 35 within the outer container 12. A mechanism 72 is provided for forcing said
movement of the connecting element 70 between the extended and the retracted position
and vice versa. Such mechanism 72 can for example be operated manually, separate from
the locking of the unit 4 onto the coupling elements 16, pneumatically by using pressure gas
from the pressure gas source, or separate there from, or in any other suitable way.
[0087]     In the embodiment shown for example in fig. 10, left hand side, the mechanism 72
is mechanical and actuated by the rotation of the first part 61 of the unit relative to the
second part 62. The connecting element 70 in this embodiment comprises a body 73 slidable
with guides 74 of the wing, wherein the body 73 comprises the element 70 with a channel 75
extending from a radial inlet 76 to a forward end 77 which is open and preferably surrounded
by a sealing ring 78 for sealingly engaging a preferably substantially flat surface area 79
around the opening 22. A spring element 90 can be provided between an end of the element
70 and the body 73, for biasing the element towards the extended position. The radial inlet

                                                 -19
76 connects to a gas inlet line when the connecting element 70 is in the extended position,
whereas the radial inlet is isolated from the gas inlet line when the element 70 is in the
retracted position. The body 73 is provided with teeth 80 at a side thereof, engaged by
complementary teeth 81 of an arm 82, pivotably supported on the wing 66 within the housing
61. At an end 83 of the arm 82 opposite the teeth 81 a spring element 84 can be provided for
biasing the arm 82 and thus the teeth 80, 81 in an engaging position.
[0088]      Upon rotation of the first part 61 relative to the second part 62, in the direction U in
fig. 10, the arm 82 will be pivoted, such that the teeth 80, 81 will push the body 73 in the
direction R, towards the extended position of the connecting element 70. Thus when the unit
4 is positioned on the neck region 2 of a container 3, and the first part 61 is rotated in order
to lock the unit 4 on the container 3, the mechanism 72 will force the connecting element 70
outward, towards the extended position, in sealing engagement with the area around the
opening 22 and in fluid communication with opening 22, such fluidly connecting the gas
supply with the opening 22 and thus with the space 28. When on the other hand the housing
61 is turned in the opposite direction, the connecting element 70 will be retracted and the unit
4 will be released for removal from the container 3.
[0089]      As can be seen for example in fig. 10A, on the wings 66 an indicator element 91
can be provided, visible through a window 93 of the upper housing part 61A, which indicates
whether the unit 4 is locked onto the container 3 or not.
[0090]      A unit 4 could be provided solely with such connecting element for connecting a
gas supply to the opening 22. In such embodiment the container is preferably only provided
with one opening 22, or the unit is provided with a sealing element for sealing the or each
further such opening 22.
[0091]      In the embodiment shown in fig. 10 and 1OA opposite the connecting element 70 a
pressure release provision 109 is provided, which can have a mechanism 94 of similar
design to the mechanism 72 of the connecting element 70. Fig. 10 and 1OA show such at the
right hand side of the opening 60. Again a body 74A is provided, slidable relative to the wing
66, wherein again an arm 82A with teeth 81A engages teeth 80 on the body 74A. Upon
rotation of the housing 61 relative to the second part 62 the body is moved in the direction R
towards an extended position. In the body 74A again a connecting element 70A with a
channel 75A is provided, biased by a spring element 90A and having a sealing ring 78A at
the free forward end 77A thereof for engaging an area around an opening 22 opposite the
earlier described opening for allowing gas into the space 28. The channel 75A again
comprises a radial outlet opening 76A, which in this case connects to a pressure relief valve

                                               - 20
system 95, especially when the element 70A is in the forward position, engaging an opening
22. The pressure relief valve 95 can be set at a desired safety pressure, sufficiently higher
than the pressure required or desired for compressing the inner container 35 when
dispensing a beverage there from, but below a safe maximum pressure that would be
allowable in said container 3. The safety pressure could for example be set such that
pressure is released when it exceeds for example 5 Bar absolute, for example when it
exceeds a pressure 4 Bar, such as but not limited to a pressure above 3 Bar, which
pressures are only provided by way of example and should by no means be understood as
limiting. Preferably the pressure is settable by the valve system 95, more preferably only
when the housing 61 is opened, which should not be done or even possible by unauthorised
persons, which can for example be prohibited by closing the unit with special tools, sealing or
the like. More preferably the release pressure is defined by the construction and is not
settable after manufacturing of the connecting device.
[0092]      In the embodiment shown in fig. 1OB and 10C the connecting device or unit 4
differs from that as shown in fig. 10 and 10 in that the connecting element 70 shown on the
left hand side in the fig. 10 is connected to the gas supply line 6, whereas the other
connecting element 70A is "blind", which means that it can connect to an opening 22 in the
container, as described before, but gas cannot pass through said connecting element 70A
such that this element functionally closes off said opening 22 it connects to. To this end for
example the channel 75A can be closed and the radial outlet opening 76A can be closed. In
this embodiment between the gas line 6 and the connecting element 70 a pressure relief
provision 109A is provided, in line. In this embodiment the provision 109A comprises a first
housing part 110 connected to the gas line 6 and provided with at least one opening 111
opening into the environment. A second housing part 112 is connected to the connecting
element 70, preferably by a flexible tubing 113. The first and second housing parts 110, 112
can be connected to each other, enclosing therein a spring 114 forcing a valve body 115 with
a head 119 against an inlet opening 116 of the first housing part 110. The valve body
extends with a stem 117 through a washer 118 or such seal. Through the valve body a
channel 120 extends with a relatively small cross section. In a normal condition the head 119
is forced against the inside of the housing part 110, such that an inlet side of the channel 120
is in communication with the gas inlet, whereas the at least one opening 11 is shielded from
the gas channel 6 by the head 119. Gas can flow from the gas line 6 directly through the
channel 120 and through the tubing 113 into the connecting element 70 for feeding the gas
into the space 32. If however the gas pressure in the gas line 6 becomes too high, that is
above a set limit, the valve body 115 will be pushed back against the spring 114, forcing the
head 119 away from the gas inlet of the first housing part 110, such that gas can escape
through the at least one opening 111. Preferably several such openings are provided for

                                                - 21
reducing the flow resistance to the environment. If the pressure again falls below the set limit,
the valve body will regain its original position, closing off again the communication between
the gas line 6 and the at least one opening 111. In an alternative embodiment the valve body
and housing 110, 112 can be made such that upon increasing pressure of the gas supply
through the gas supply line 6 to above an upper limit pressure the valve body will entirely
close of the gas supply to the openings 22 by closing off the gas line 6. This may lead to
bursting of the gas supply line 6 or coming loose thereof, but will prevent the risk of gas still
flowing into the container. In embodiment a pressure release connector could be provided in
the gas supply line 6.
[0093]     As indicated before the second connecting element 70 can in this embodiment be
similar to the one described before, but closed off or blind, such that the operation and feel of
the connecting device remains substantially the same.
[0094]      In fig. 17 and 17A schematically a container is shown in side view, with in broken
lines the preforms 20, 21 from which the container has been blow moulded integrally. In fig.
17 the bottom of the container has a petaloid shape, as known in the art. In the embodiment
of fig. 17A the bottom is hemispherical. Especially but not exclusively in the latter
embodiment the container can be packaged in a outer package such as a box, for example
made of cardboard, fibre board, plastic or wood, for supporting and protecting the container
and/or for enabling stable positioning of the container during for example transport, storage
and dispensing and other use.
[0095]      In an embodiment of the unit as shown in for example fig. 10 and 10A the rotation
of the housing 61 relative to the container 3 forces the elements 70 and 70A to move in
substantially radial direction R, substantially normal to the longitudinal axis X - X, which
provides for a secure movement and sealing, prevents wear and allows for easy adjustment
to for example tolerances is sizes and dimensions of the neck and connecting device.
[0096]     As can be seen in fig. 1 and 3 - 5, in the first embodiment the connector 7 can be
connected directly to the valve 7, for example by fitting the connector 7 to the closure ring 10,
especially to the third wall 43 and/or to the clinch plate 55. In the embodiment shown to that
end the connector 7 has a substantially dome shaped housing 100 with a rim portion 101 that
fits as a snap fitting over the outer edge 102 of the clinch plate 55 and snaps below said
edge 102, against the wall 43. Preferably this snap fit is such that the dome and thus the
connector 7 cannot be removed, once fitted, without damage to the connector 7 and/or the
ring 10 and/or the clinch plate 55, preferably such that proper refitting the connector 7 to the
same or a different container 3 is prohibited. The connector 7 comprises a stem 103 that

                                                - 22
engages the valve 9, such that the valve 9 is opened and beverage can flow from the inner
container 35 through the valve into the stem 103, to further flow into a tapping line connected
thereto, to be fed to a tap for dispensing. By fitting the connector 7 properly to the container
3, especially over the valve 9, the valve is thus opened and preferably cannot be opened and
closed repeatedly. The connector can be fitted prior to placing the unit 4 on the container 3,
or after such placing of the unit 4. The connector 7 can extend inside the opening 60,
whereas the taping line can extend through or from the opening 60. The upper housing part
61A can be provided with a guide edge 104 for supporting the tapping line.
[0097]     As can be seen in fig. 2, and 6 - 8 in the second embodiment the connector 11 can
be connected to the unit 4, especially to the upper housing part 61 A, for example by screw
threads, bayonet engagement or the like. In fig. 2, 9 and 10A schematically cooperating
elements 105A, B to that end are shown. In fig. 8 the elements 105A are shown, locked
below the elements 105B. By rotation of the connector 11 around the axis Y - Y it can be
locked in this position or can be released. In this embodiment again a stem 103A is provided,
extending substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis Y - Y of opening 60. The stem 103A
again acts on the vale 9 for opening it and allowing beverage to be passed from the inner
volume of the inner container 35 to a tapping line connected to the connector 11. The tapping
line can in this embodiment be part of a tapping device with for example an in line cooler
106, schematically shown in fig. 2 in part. In this embodiment a non-return valve 107 is
shown in the connector 11, between the stem 103A and the tapping line, such that liquid or
gas is substantially prevented from flowing back into the stem from the tapping line. Again
the connector 11 can be placed in the unit 4 after the unit has been placed on the container,
or before, and can be removed from the unit 4 before or after the unit is removed from the
container 3.
[0098]     When the placement or removal of the connector 7, 11 is or at least can at least
partly be independent from placing and/or removing of the unity onto or from the container,
the connector, especially connector 11 can be removed from the container, for example for
cleaning, without decompression of the container.
[0099]     In fig. 4, 5, 7 and 8 the connecting elements have been shown in a retracted
position, for clarity. When the connecting device is placed and rotated appropriately, as
described, they are brought into close connection with the neck and are connected to the at
least one opening 22, as also described before.
[00100]    In the embodiments shown the outer preform 20 has a body forming portion which
is substantially cylindrical with a longitudinal axis X - X and closed off at the bottom by a

                                                - 23
bottom forming portion. The cylindrical portion has a maximum cross section or maximum
diameter Db and preferably a substantially constant outer diameter Db over its cylindrical
length Lb between the flange 14 and the bottom forming portion, wherein the body forming
portion may have a draft over said length Lb, suitable for release from an injection moulding
mould, as is known to the person skilled in the art. The maximum diameter Db is preferably
smaller than that of the flange 14, if applicable. The neck portion or region preferably is also
substantially cylindrical with a longitudinal axis X-X substantially coinciding with the
longitudinal axis of the body forming portion. The substantially cylindrical part of the neck
region has an average outer diameter Dn(out) which is larger than the maximum diameter
Db. In the embodiment shown the neck portion has a substantially constant outer diameter
Dn(out) above the flange 14. The wall thickness of the neck region of the outer preform 20 is
preferably slightly smaller than that of at least most of the body forming portion. In the
embodiment shown the inner surface 45 of the neck region of the outer preform is positioned
above and substantially coinciding with the outer surface of the body forming portion of said
preform 20, or positioned only slightly inward, providing for the shoulder on which the inner
container can be supported. The inner surface of the body forming portion of the outer
preform 20 slopes inward over a part directly adjacent the flange 14. The wall part
comprising the sloping surface will during blow moulding form at least most of a shoulder of
the outer container. Over at least part of this sloping surface and/or the facing surface part of
the adjacent inner container spacing elements and/or channel forming parts are provided
which remain at least partly open during and after blow moulding the container from the
preforms, allowing gas to be inserted from said at least one opening 22 into the space
between the body forming portions of the container. Such outer preform can be
manufactured easily, by injection moulding, without complicated movable parts in the mould.
Only for forming the at least one opening and the coupling elements at least one part has to
be provided in the injection moulding mould moving in a direction different from a direction
parallel to the longitudinal axis X - X of the preforms. In the embodiments shown the coupling
elements 16 are provided substantially as tubular elements 16 having a release direction in a
mould parallel to the release direction of the at least one opening 22, such that they can
easily be formed by the same mould part.
[00101]    In fig. 19A - D an embodiment of a preform assembly 19 is shown again, in
longitudinal section through a mid sectional plane along the line A - A in fig. 19C, in both
assembled condition (fig. 19A) and pre assembling (fig. 19B) and, in fig. 19C, in cross
section along the line B - B in fig. 19A. Fig. 19D shows a detail of fig. 19C.
[00102]    In fig. 20A - D an embodiment of a preform assembly 20 is shown again, in
longitudinal section through a mid sectional plane along the line A - A in fig. 20C, in both

                                                - 24
assembled condition (fig. 20A) and pre assembling (fig. 20B) and, in fig. 20C, in cross
section along the line B - B in fig. 20A. Fig. 20D shows a detail of fig. 20C.
[00103] These preform assemblies can for example be similar to the assembly according to
fig. 14. Only some details will be discussed herein, whereas for the further description
reference is made to the earlier descriptions of the preform assembly 19 and parts thereof,
including the closure ring 10.
[00104]     Fig. 19B shows the outer preform 20, the inner preform 21 and the closure ring 10,
aligned for assembling. In fig. 19B the shoulder forming part 123 of the inner preform 21 is
only partly cut away, such that the cut through 122 and the spacing elements and/or channel
forming parts 122A can be clearly seen in side view. The neck region 24 with the shoulder 26
is shown, being wider than the body forming portion 25. The shoulder forming part 123 is
slightly frusto conical, widening from the body forming portion 25 to the neck region 24. In the
outer periphery of the neck region 24 at least one, and in the embodiment shown two
diametrically opposed cut outs 22 are provided, though the neck region 24, extending in
longitudinal direction thereof and open to the peripheral surface. On the outer surface of the
shoulder forming portion 123 of the inner preform 21 directly below the cut out 122 spacer
elements 27 are provided, formed by two adjacent ribs 122B enclosing a channel 122A there
between. This channel 122A extends from the cut out 122 towards at least near and
preferably passed the end of the shoulder forming portion 123 at the side of the body forming
portion 25. Thus it is prevented that when blow moulding the container from the assembly,
the outer preform 20 can fully engage the outer surface of the shoulder forming part 123 of
the inner container, thus obstructing a pressure fluidum from entering into the space the
between the then formed inner and outer containers.
[00105]     By providing two diametrically opposed cut throughs 122 and adjacent channels
122A, the spacer elements 27 can be formed relatively easy in mold parts releasing to two
opposite sides. When assembled, as can be seen in fig. 19A and B, the outer surface of the
inner preform and the inner surface of the outer preform will be spaced apart mostly, over a
distance approximately similar to the radial height of the ribs 122B. The ribs 122B are placed
relatively close together, such that the channel 122A will remain open, even after blow
moulding the container.
[00106]     When assembling the preforms 20, 21, preferably the cut throughs 122 and
adjacent channels 122A are positioned such that the openings 22 open adjacent said cut
throughs 122. However, as can be seen in fig. 19B, the shoulder 23 on which the shoulder
26 can rest can be provided with a stepped surface such that there will always be sufficient

                                              - 25
openings between the shoulders 23, 26 for allowing a pressure fluid to proceed from the
opening 22 or openings 22 into the channel or channels 122A and into the space between
the inner and outer preforms. In this embodiment again the length X1 of the inner preform is
significantly smaller than the length X2 of the outer preform 20, as shown and discussed with
reference to fig. 14A, for the same or similar reasons.
[00107]    In fig. 20 an alternative embodiment of a preform assembly is shown, both pre
assembling (fig. 20B) and in assembled condition (fig. 20A) In this embodiment the spacing
elements 7 are primarily formed on the inner surface of the outer preform 20, at least in the
shoulder forming part 23 thereof. In the embodiment shown again, as discussed with
reference to fig. 19, the elements 7 can be formed as channels 122A between adjacent ribs
122B, which channels open in lower parts 7A of a stepped surface 7b of the shoulder 23 on
which the shoulder 26 of the inner preform 20 can come to rest. In this embodiment there are
several such channels 122A, preferably more than two, for example six, spaced around the
periphery of the inner surface of the shoulder forming portion, 23, as shown in fig. 20C. By
increasing the number of channels 122A the area for allowing a pressure medium to flow
from the opening or openings 22 is increased, better ensuring proper pressurising of the
space between the inner and outer containers after blow moulding. Moreover, these
channels can be more easily maintained at least in part during blow moulding, due to their
positioning on the outer preform 20. By providing them on the inner surface of the outer
preform it is easier to manufacture a multitude of such channels. During blow moulding the
inner preform may be heated to a higher temperature, which could be detrimental to the
channels if they are provided on the inner preform. The inner preform will be more fluid
during blow moulding, which would reduce the accuracy of the shape of the ribs and thus of
the remaining channel. Especially since during blow moulding the pressure exerted for
forming the container will be from the inside out, meaning that the inner preform will be
pushed against the inner surface of the outer preform. Again, providing the ribs and channels
on the outer preform will then be advantageous for maintaining the proper profiles of the ribs
and channels.
[00108]    In the embodiments shown the height H of the ribs 122B can be similar to the
radial distance between the preforms 20, 21 in the neck region and/or shoulder forming part
23 of the preforms, for example a few millimetres.
[00109]    In this embodiment the lengths X1 and X2 are again as similar as possible, as
described with reference to fig. 14D, for the same or similar reasons.

                                                - 26
[00110]     Obviously the configuration of the elements 7 and/or the neck region configuration
of fig. 20 could be used in a set of preforms according to fig. 19 or vice versa, or in the
embodiments of fig. 14.
[00111]     It is preferred that the spacing elements and/or channel forming parts 122 are at
least mainly formed on the inside surface of the outer preform 20, at least in the shoulder
forming part or region 123 thereof. This can have a number of advantages, including but not
limited to that the wall thickness of the outer preform may be larger, that during blow
moulding there may be less deformation in the outer preform, especially in the shoulder
forming part or region 123, so that the shape and dimensions of the spacing elements and/or
channel forming parts 122 will be maintained more easily. Moreover, when the shoulder
forming part 123 widens in the direction of the open upper end 30, these spacing elements
and/or channel forming parts 122 can easily be formed by a releasing core of an injection
moulding mould, providing sufficient draft. Moreover, by providing them on the outer preform
there may be less stress in the container formed,
[00112]     In the embodiments shown gas or such pressure fluid will be introduced in a
substantially radial direction A, of the neck portion of the container, i.e. at an angle a relative
to the axis X - X of the neck, which angle a preferably is between 30 and 150 degrees, more
preferably between 45 and 135 degrees and more preferably about 90 degrees. By this
direction the safety of the assembly can be increased, for example because the pressure
exerted by the gas is not in a direction in which the connecting device can be removed from
the container. Moreover, the direction is such that the gas will aid in providing passage for
the gas into said space between the containers. Furthermore by providing the at least one
opening in a wall of the neck region the gas inlet will not interfere with the positioning of the
beverage dispense line or tube or the removal thereof. By moving the connecting element or
elements between the extended and the retracted position in substantially radial direction,
wear of the elements will be prevented such that safety is further enhanced. By providing an
over pressure safety in the connecting device overpressure in the container can be avoided
and/or resolved easily. By providing the at least one inlet opening 22 at a level such that it
faces a wall part of the ring, i.e. for example at a level above the free end of the inner
container 21, it is further ensured that the passage of gas between the opening 22 and the
space 32 between the containers is not obstructed. In the embodiments shown having the lip
portion 49C gas flow will be directed by the sloping surface of the lip portion 49C towards the
space 32.
[00113]     In embodiment the source of the pressurised gas can be or at least can comprise a
compressor for air. Preferably the direction of the compressor is reversible, such that when

                                                - 27
the inner container 35 is emptied to a desired extend, the air can be sucked from the space
28 through the relevant opening 22, with the valve 9 still closed, which would lead to
reducing the volume of the container since the outer container 12 will be compressed by
pressure reduction within it. This will significantly reduce the volume of the container to be
discarded.
[00114]   The invention is by no means limited to the embodiments specifically disclosed and
discussed here above. Many variations thereof are possible, including but not limited to
combinations of parts of embodiments shown and described. For example the at least one
opening 22 can be provided in a different position, for example extending through the ring 10,
preferably in substantially radial direction outward, for example through the inner surface 39
or wall 40 of the ring, into the space 32 between the containers, wherein the connecting
device can extend into the ring for communicating properly with said at least one opening.
The container can be provided with only one opening in the neck or several such openings.
In embodiments the relative movement of the first and second parts of the connecting device
can be obtained at least partly by relative translation.
