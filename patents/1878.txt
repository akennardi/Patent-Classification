                             ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
            Provided is a method for isolating and proliferating autologous cancer
   antigen-specific CD8*T cells, and more particularly, a method for selecting an
 5 epitope recognized by CD8* T cells from autologous cancer antigens present in
   blood of individual cancer patients; and isolating autologous cancer antigen-specific
   CD8* T cells by using a peptide of the selected epitope, and a method of massively
   proliferating CD8* T cells by using the method. According to the present invention,
   it is possible to isolate autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells by using the
10 peptide of the CD8 T cell epitope of the autologous cancer antigen present in blood
   of individual cancer patients instead of a heterologous antigen. Therefore, by using
   T cells recognizing the autologous cancer antigen, it is possible to effectively select
   and eliminate cancer cells derived from the cancer patient's own cells. Thus, T cells
   can be applied to treatment and alleviation of cancer diseases without side effects.

      METHODS FOR ISOLATING AND PROLIFERATING AUTOLOGOUS
                      CANCER ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CD8* T CELLS
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5 [0001]            The present invention relates to        a method for isolating      and
   proliferating autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8*T cells. More particularly, the
   present invention relates to a method for selecting an epitope recognized by CD8* T
   cells from autologous cancer antigens present in blood of individual cancer patients;
   and isolating autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells by using a peptide of
10 the selected epitope, and to a method for mass proliferating CD8* T cells by using
   the method.
   [0002]            Since CD8* T cells have relatively simple functions than other cells
   such as dendritic cells, CD4* T cells, and NK cells, it is less likely to cause
   unexpected side effects during anticancer immunotherapy. Generally, antigen
15 specific CD8* T cells are isolated by using MHC class I/peptide multimer, but the
   method has a drawback in that due to the high cell death rate caused by cell apoptosis
   after cell isolation, a long period of culture is required to produce a sufficient amount
   of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, needed is a surrogate marker which
   can isolate antigen-specific CD8* T cells instead of MHC multimer which stimulates
20 a T cell receptor (TCR). Thus, the present inventors have been studying for a long
   time about the immune regulatory protein, i.e. 4-1BB (CD 137).
   [0003]           It has been known that 4-1BB, which is expressed in T cells activated
   by an inducible costimulatory molecule, particularly enhances a CD8* T cell activity
   and as well as increases expression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2, Bcl
25 XL, and Bfl-1 so that activation-induced cell death (AICD) is inhibited. The
   characteristic of 4-1BB simulation are suitable for cancer treatment. Thus, based on
                                                 1

   the characteristic, a therapeutic effect of an anti-4-1BB mAb on a cancer is validated
   by using an animal model. In the previous study, the present inventors have
   established a method for isolating and proliferating antigen-specific CD8* T cells by
   using the anti-4-1BB antibody on the basis of 4-1BB expression of activated CD8* T
 5 cells in an antigen-specific manner (see Korean registered patent No. 10-0882445).
   However, in vitro and in vivo half life of an antibody are long, and the total result is
   shown as combination of a signal transduction result through an Fc receptor and a
   signal transduction effect through a target protein recognized by the antibody.       In
   addition, in many cases, there are various antibodies for the same antigen, and the
10 antibodies show effects having little differences from each other. To overcome this
   limitation, it has been developed a method for successfully isolating and proliferating
   antigen-specific CD8* T cells by using the pentamer, COMP-4-1BBL protein (see
   Korean registered patent No. 10-1103603).
   [0004]           Those two patents relate to techniques for isolating/mass-culturing
15 CD8 T cells specific for a viral antigen (e.g., EBV/LMP2A, CMV/pp65) which is a
   heterologous antigen, and the techniques are relatively easy to implement because
   the in vivo ratio of those cells are high. However, since most of cancer cells are
   formed by cells which compose our bodies, it is necessary to selectively isolate and
   mass culture CD8 T cells which recognize an autologous cancer antigen (self-tumor
20 Ag), wherein the autologous cancer antigen is a protein to form the body and
   overexpressed in cancer cells while present in a low ratio in normal cells.
                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0005]           Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for
25 isolating and proliferating autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells which
                                                2

   makes it possible to selectively isolate and mass culture autologous cancer antigen
   specific CD8* T cells within 31 days, wherein, the autologous cancer antigen is
   present in the body in an extremely low ratio.
   [0006]          To achieve the object, the present invention provides a method for
 5 isolating autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells, the method including: a)
   selecting a CD8* T cell epitope of the autologous cancer antigen present in blood of a
   cancer patient; b) culturing a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolated
   form blood of the cancer patient in a medium together with a peptide of the epitope
   and IL-2; c) inducing 4-1BB expression in the cultured cells by adding the peptide
10 same as in step b); and d) culturing cells in which 4-1BB expression is induced on a
   culture plate coated with an anti-4-IBB antibody, and removing unattached cells.
   [0007]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the autologous cancer
   antigen in step a) may be selected from the group consisting of hTERT, WT1, NY
   ESO1 and MAGE-A3.
15 [0008]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the epitope in step b)
   may be a peptide formed by an amino acid sequence selected from the group
   consisting of SEQ ID NOs: I to 15.
   [0009]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the induction of
   expression in step c) may be performed for 12 to 36 hours with culturing.
20 [0010]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the culture in step d)
   may be performed for 1 to 20 minutes.
   [0011]          Further, the present invention provides a method for mass culturing
   autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells, the method including: suspending
   autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells isolated by the method and
25 allogenic PMBCs irradiated with radiation in a medium including IL-2, an anti-CD3
                                               3

   antibody, and autoplasma; and then injecting the suspension into a culture bag; and
   additionally injecting the medium and culturing.
   [0012]          In the mass culture method of the present invention, the PBMC may
   be isolated from a healthy doner.
 5 [0013]          In the mass culture method of the present invention, the culture may
   be performed for 4 to 15 days.
   [0014]          According to the present invention, it is possible to isolate autologous
   cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells by using the peptide of the CD8 T cell epitope
   of the autologous cancer antigen present in blood of individual cancer patients
10 instead of the heterologous antigen. Therefore, by using the T cell, which is isolated
   by the method of the present invention and recognizes the autologous cancer antigen
   present in an extremely low ratio in a healthy person, it is possible to effectively
   select and eliminate cancer cells derived from the cancer patient's own cells.

           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
20 [0016]         Since cancer cells are derived from cells which form our body, it is
   necessary to selectively isolate and mass culture CD8* T cells specific for an
   autologous cancer antigen (self-tumor Ag), which is overexpressed in cancer cells, to
   selectively eliminate cancer cells.      However, a T cell, which recognizes the
   autologous cancer antigen, is present in an extremely low ratio in a healthy person
25 with an activity which is inhibited by immune tolerance.      Accordingly, it has not
                                               5

   been yet developed a standardized process of selectively isolating and mass culturing
   autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells from blood of a cancer patient.
   Thus, the present inventors have been developed a standardized technique of a
   process of selectively isolating and mass culturing CD8* T cell within 31 days by
 5 using an anti-4-1BB antibody, wherein the CD8* T cell is present in the body in an
   extremely low ratio and specific for an autologous cancer antigen such as hTERT,
   WT1, NY-ESO1, and MAGE-A3.
   [0017]          Therefore, the present invention provides a method for isolating
   autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells.         Specifically, the method for
10 isolating autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells of the present invention
   includes: a) selecting a CD8* T cell epitope of the autologous cancer antigen present
   in blood of a cancer patient; b) culturing a peripheral blood mononuclear cell
   (PBMC) isolated from blood of the cancer patient in a medium together with a
   peptide of the epitope and IL-2; c) inducing 4-1BB expression in the cultured cells
15 by adding the peptide same as in step (b); and d) culturing cells, in which 4-1BB
   expression is induced, on a culture plate coated with an anti-4-IBB antibody, and
   removing unattached cells.
   [0018]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the autologous cancer
   antigen in step a) may be any cancer antigen present in the cancer patient's own body,
20 and a suitable autologous cancer antigen may be selected and used depending on the
   type of cancer.     Preferably, hTERT (GenBank: BACi1010.1), WT1 (GenBank:
   AA061088.1),      NY-ESO1       (GenBank:    CAA05908.1),     and   MAGE-A3      (NCBI
   Reference Sequence: NP_005353.1), etc. may be used as a typical autologous cancer
   antigen used in anticancer immunotherapy.            The hTERT is an enzyme for
25 synthesizing telomeric DNA at the end of a chromosome and known as a target
                                               6

   antigen for various solid cancers including lung cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic
   cancer because cancer cells over-activate the enzyme to avoid telomerase-dependent
   cell death (see Kim NW, et al. Science. 1994;266:2011-2015). Also, the WT1, which
   is a gene associated with Wilms tumor, encodes a zinc-finger transcriptional factor
 5 which is a protein involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and
   development of an organ and kwon as a target antigen of brain and spinal cancer, and
   lung cancer, etc. (see Call KM, et al., Cell. 1990. 60:509-520; Nakahara Y, et al.,
   Brain Tumor Pathol. 2004. 21:113-6).          In addition, the NY-ESO1, one of the
   proteins belonging to a cancer testis antigen (CTA), has been known to be expressed
10 in various cancer cells including germ cell cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer;
   however, it has not been well known about functions of NY-ESO1 in those cells (see
   Gnjatic S, et al., Adv Cancer Res. 2006;95:1-30).         The MAGE-A3 is a protein
   belonging to melanoma-associated antigen family.         Although any function of the
   MAGE-A3 in normal cells has not found, it has been known that MAGE-A3 is
15 overexpressed in various cancer cells including lung cancer, sarcoma, and melanoma
   so that MAGE-A3 is assessed as a target antigen suitable for immunotherapy of a
   cancer (see Decoster L, et al., Ann Oncol. 2012 Jun;23(6):1387-93).
   [0019]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the epitope in step b)
   may be a peptide formed by an amino acid sequence selected from the group
20 consisting of SEQ ID NOs: I to 15.
   [0020]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the medium in step b)
   may be a medium including autoplasma, and the culture in step b) may be performed
   for 12 to 16 days.
                                               7

   [0021]          In the isolation method of the present invention, the induction of
   expression in step c) may be performed for 12 to 36 hours with culturing, and the
   culture in step d) may be performed for 1 to 20 minutes.
   [0022]          Further, the present invention provides a method for mass culturing
 5 autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells, the method including: suspending
   autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells isolated by the isolation method
   described above, and allogenic PMBCs irradiated with radiation in a medium
   including IL-2, an anti-CD3 antibody, and autoplasma, and then injecting the
   suspension into a culture bag; and additionally injecting the medium and culturing.
10 [0023]          In the mass culturing method of the present invention, the PBMCs
   may be isolated from a normal doner, and the culture may be performed for 4 to 15
   days. In particular, during the culture, the medium may be additionally injected on
   day 4, 7, 9, 11 and 14 of culture.
   [0024]          Hereinafter, the method for isolating and proliferating autologous
15 cancer antigen-specific CD8* T cells of the present invention will be described in
   stepwise.
   [0025]          (1) EPITOPE SCREENING (PRE-SELECTION TEST)
   [0026]          According to the present invention, autologous cancer antigen
   specific CD8 T cells are selectively isolated and proliferated by using a peptide.
20 Since epitopes of an autologous cancer antigen recognized by a CD8 T cell are
   different depending on HLA-A types and status of individual patients, a CD8 T cell
   epitope of the autologous cancer antigen present in blood of individual patients is
   selected through epitope screening so that 3-4 types of peptides for preparing a T cell
   therapeutic agent are selected.
                                              8

   [0027]          (2) PROLIFERATION OF AUTOLOGOUS CANCER ANTIGEN
   SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS
   [0028]          Since autologous cancer antigen-specific CD8 T cells are present in
   blood in 0.1% or less, 3-4 types of peptides for preparation and IL-2 are added to
 5 PBMCs isolated from blood, and the mixture is culture for 14 days to induce
   proliferation of CD8 T cells specific for a peptide derived from the autologous cancer
   antigen. On day 14 of culture, whole cells are collected and reactivated with the
   same peptides for 24 hours to induce peptide-specific CD8 T cells to simultaneously
   express 4-1BB.
10 [0029]          (3)  SELECTIVE       ISOLATION       OF AUTOLOGOUS            CANCER
   ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS
   [0030]          Cells reactivated with the peptide are seeded to a culture plate coated
   with an anti-4-IBB antibody and cultured for 10 minutes to allow CD8 T cells
   expressing 4-1BB to be attached.        Then, unattached cells are entirely removed
15 through washing. Thereafter, IL-2-containing medium is added and culture is then
   performed for two days to proliferate the isolated T cells and also to allow the T cells
   to be detached from the culture plate.
   [0031]           (4) MASS CULTURE OF AUTOLOGOUS CANCER ANTIGEN
   SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS
20 [0032]          In a IL culture bag, 5 x 105 of isolated CD8 T cells, 1 x 108 of
   irradiated allogenic PBMC cells, 1000 U/ml of IL-2, and 40 ng of an anti-CD3 mAb
   are mixed, and the medium is periodically added for 14 days to culture cells to a
   degree of about 109 cells/L such that the cells are proliferated to a level sufficient to
   be administered to a cancer patient.
                                               9

   [0033]         Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail
   with reference to the following examples.       However, these examples are only
   provided to more specifically describe the present invention, and the scope of the
   invention is not limited thereto.
 5 [0034]         EXPERIMENTAL            EXAMPLE.         EPITOPE      SCREENING
   PROCESS
   [0035]         CD 8 T cell epitopes of an autologous cancer antigen were selected
   through algorithm. To evaluate a type of CD8 T cell epitope with which T cells
   present in blood of a cancer patient react, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
10 (PBMCs) were isolated from blood of the cancer patient, washed, and suspended in
   CTL medium (RPMI1640 medium + 4 mM L-glutamine + 12.5 mM HEPES + 50
   [M 2-mercaptoethanol + 3% autoplasma) to become the concentration of 1x106
   cell/ml. Then, 1 ml of the suspension was aliquoted in a 14 ml round tube. Peptides
   for each epitope selected by the analysis with algorithm were added to each tube in
15 the concentration of 1 [tg/ml. Thereafter, culture in a C02 incubator was started.
   Two days after culture, 1 ml of CTL medium including 50 U/ml IL-2 was added to
   each tube. On day 7, 9, 11, and 13 of culture, 1 ml of the medium was removed and
   CTL medium including 50 U/ml IL-2 was added. On day 14 of culture, RPM11640
   medium was added to each tube, and the tube was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1400
20 rpm. Then, cells were washed three times. Washed cells were suspended in 1 ml
   CTL medium, and the same peptide was added in the concentration of 5 [tg/ml.
   Thereafter, the resultant was cultured.   After 24 hours, cells in each tube were
   collected and stained with an anti-CD8-PE-Cy5 and anti-4-1BB-PE antibodies for
   flow cytometry. Then, by analyzing a ratio of CD8 T cell expressing 4-1BB, a type
25 of peptide which CD8 T cell reacted with and was thus activated has been
                                            10

   determined. FIG. 2 is a flow chart showing an epitope screening process according
   to the present invention.
   [0036]          The anti-CD8-PE-Cy5 and anti-4-1BB-PE used in the experiment
   were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA). RPMI1640, L-glutamine,
 5 HEPES, and 2-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA,
   USA).

   Brain Tumor Pathol. 2004. 21(3):113-6) evaluating which type of cancer antigen is
   suitable for immunotherapy of a cancer depending on the type of cancer, an
   autologous cancer antigen, which is suitable for immunotherapy of frequently
15 occurring cancer in Korean and hard-to treat cancers (e.g., gastric cancer, lung cancer
   and pancreatic cancer), is selected.       hTERT (GenBank: BAC11010.1),           WT1

5 [0045]         EXAMPLE         2.   EPITOPE   SCREENING    ON     CLINICAL
  CANCER PATIENT
  [0046]          To evaluate whether CD8 T cell epitopes of autologous cancer
  antigens, i.e. hTERT, WT1, NY-ESO1, and MAGE-A3, selected in Example 1
                                            13

   substantially induce proliferation of CD8 T cells present in blood of a clinical cancer
   patient, epitope screening as depicted in FIG. 2. was performed.      hTERT epitope
   screening was performed on gastric cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, as a
   main subject matter. Also, WT1 epitope screening was performed on brain and
 5 spinal cancer and lung cancer; NY-ESO1 epitope screening was performed on
   ovarian cancer and sarcoma; and MAGE-A3 epitope screening was performed on
   sarcoma and lung cancer as a main subject matter.
   [0047]          FIG. 3 shows an hTERT epitope screening result using PBMCs
   obtained from a healthy doner.
10 [0048]          FIG. 4 shows a WT1 epitope screening result using PBMCs obtained
   from the healthy doner.
   [0049]          As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, CD8 T cell epitopes of hTERT and WT1
   did not induce T cell response by PBMCs derived from blood of the healthy doner.
   Thus, it has been found that the selected epitope of the present invention cannot be
15 recognized by T cells of the healthy doner.
   [0050]          FIGS. 5 to 7 show hTERT epitope screening results using PBMCs
   respectively obtained from patients with gastric cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic
   cancer.
   [0051]          FIGS. 8 and 9 show WT1 epitope screening results using PBMCs
20 respectively obtained from patients with glioblastoma and lung cancers.
   [0052]          FIGS 10 and 11 show NY-ESO1 epitope screening results using
   PBMCs respectively obtained from patients with ovarian cancer and sarcoma.
   [0053]          FIGS. 12 and 13 show MAGE-A3 epitope screening results using
   PBMCs respectively obtained from patients with sarcoma and lung cancers.
                                             14

   [0054]             As shown in FIGS. 5 to 13, as a result of investigating reactivity of
   CD8 T cells on hTERT, WT1, NY-ESOl, and MAGEA3 by performing epitope
   screening on PBMCs isolated from blood of the clinical cancer patient, it has been
   found that in contrast with the result in the health doner, high degree of T cell
 5 response was exhibited to the selected autologous cancer antigens.                             Reactivity on
   each autologous cancer antigen was then evaluated by repeatedly performing epitope
   screening on gastric cancer, lung cancer, sarcoma, and ovarian cancer.
   [0055]             In addition, to objectively analyze the epitope screening result, a
   scoring system was made as shown in Table 6 below.

   results were analyzed, and the analyzed results were shown in Tables 7 to 15 below.

   [0076]              As shown in Tables 7 to 13, when CD8 T cells express 4-1BB with at
   least score 3 by peptide stimulation, these cells can be effectively isolated by using
 5 an anti-4-1BB antibody. For each type of cancer, since the ratio of T cell responsive
   to the autologous cancer antigen with at least score 3 was in a degree of 40 to 50%, it
   has been determined that a T cell therapeutic agent can be prepared by using the
   selected epitopes of the autologous cancer antigen.                       The selected peptides are as
   follows: hTERT peptide: CLKELVARV (SEQ ID NO: 1), PLFLELL (SEQ ID NO:
10 2), AAVTPAA (SEQ ID NO: 3); WTl peptide: SLGEQQVSV (SEQ ID NO: 4),

   ANTIGEN
   [0078]          Through epitope screening, 3-4 types of peptides of epitopes for each
   autologous cancer antigen suitable for preparation of a T cell therapeutic agent were
   selected, and pilot production of a T cell therapeutic agent specific for hTERT, WT1,
10 NY-ESO1, and MAGE-AC was performed by using the peptides. Production of a T
   cell therapeutic agent includes three steps, that is, a first proliferation of autologous
   anticancer T cells, isolation and mass culture.
   [0079]          (1) PROLIFERATION OF AUTOLOGOUS CANCER ANTIGEN
   SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS
15 [0080]          50 ml of blood was collected from a cancer patient who has been
   proven to have one or more of epitope having the score of at least 3, through epitope
   screening.
   [0081]          1) Isolation of PBMCs from blood of a patient: 7 ml of blood was
   allowed to slowly flow a 15 ml conical tube filled with 7 ml of ficollhypaque such
20 that the blood was overlaid on supernatant of the ficoll solution.          The tube was
   centrifuged for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm at room temperature, and then only a cell
   layer, which is located between ficoll and plasma and has white color, was collected,
   washed, and used as PBMCs.
   [0082]          2) Isolated PBMCs were suspended in CTL medium (RPMI1640
25 medium + 4 mM L-glutamine + 12.5 mM HEPES + 50 [M 2-mercaptoethanol + 3%
                                               24

   autoplasma) to become the concentration of 1 X 106 cells/ml, 3-4 types of peptides
   selected by epitope screening of the present invention were added such that the
   concentration of each peptide became 1 [tg/ml.        1 ml of the cell suspension was
   aliquoted in a 14 ml round tube, and cultured in a CO2 incubator.
 5 [0083]          3) Two days after culture, 1 ml of CTL medium including 50 U/ml
   IL-2 (Proleukin, Novatis) was added to each tube.
   [0084]          4) On day 7, 9, 11, and 13 of culture, 1 ml of the supernatant medium
   was removed, and CTL medium including 50 U/ml IL-2 was added.
   [0085]          5) After 14 days of culture, cells in each tube were collected in a 50
10 ml comical tube.     Then, RPMI1640 medium was added, and the tube was then
   centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1400 rpm to wash cells. The process was repeated twice
   more.
   [0086]          6) The washed cells were suspended in CTL medium such that the
   concentration of cells became 2 x 106 cells/ml. Then, 3-4 types of the same peptides
15 were added in the concentration of 5 [tg/ml, respectively, and thereafter the resultant
   was cultured.
   [0087]           (2) SELECTION OF AUTOLOGOUS                   CANCER ANTIGEN
   SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS
   [0088]          1) After 24 hours of culture, PBMCs, which were reactivated for a
20 day, were collected, and washed twice with RPMI1640 medium. Then, PBMCs
   were suspended in CTL medium such that the concentration of PBMCs became 5 x
    106 cells/ml. Thereafter, 50 U/ml of IL-2 was added.
   [0089]          2) 1 ml of the cells were added to a 6-well or 12-well culture plate
   which was coated with an anti-4-1BB antibody in the concentration of 50 [g/ml for a
25 day, and then the resultant was cultured for 10 minutes in a C02 incubator.
                                              25

   [0090]         After 10 minutes of culture, washing was performed to remove all
   cells which were not attached to the plate. Then, 2 to 4 ml of CTL medium including
   1000 U/ml IL-2 was added to each well, and the resultant was cultured for two days
   in a C02 incubator.
 5 [0091]          (3) MASS CULTURE OF AUTOLOGOUS CANCER ANTIGEN
   SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS
   [0092]         1) Whole cells, which were isolated with the anti-4-1BB antibody and
   cultured for two days, were collected, washed with RPM11640 medium twice and
   counted.
10 [0093]         2) PBMCs were isolated from a healthy doner; suspend such that the
   concentration of PBMCs became 1x10 8 cells/ml; and irradiated with radiation of
   3000 rad to induce cell death so that the resultant was used as a culture additive
   capable of providing costimulation which is needed to induce proliferation of T cells.
   [0094]         3) To a 50 ml conical tube, were added 5 x 105 cells of the isolated
15 CD8 T cells and 1 x 108 cells of irradiated allogenic PBMCs.       Then, ALyS505N
   medium (CELL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY INST., INC. (CSTI)) including 1,000
   U/ml of IL-2, 40 ng/ml of an anti-CD3 mAb (BD Bioscience) and 3% of autoplasma
   was added q.s. to 50 ml.
   [0095]         4) 50 ml of cell suspension was injected in a 1 L culture bag and
20 cultured in a C02 incubator.
   [0096]         5) After 4 days of culture, 50 ml of ALyS505N medium including
   1,000 U/ml of IL-2, and 3% of autoplasma was additionally injected to the 1 L
   culture bag.
                                              26

   [0097]          6) After 7 days of culture, 100 ml of ALyS505N medium including
    1,000 U/ml of IL-2, and 3% of autoplasma was additionally injected to the 1 L
