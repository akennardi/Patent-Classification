               The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian patent application
 5 no. <removed-apn> is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present specification.
                                        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
               The invention concerns methods and means for preventing the reduction of disulfide
   bonds during the recombinant production of disulfide-containing polypeptides. In particular, the
10 invention concerns the prevention of disulfide bond reduction during harvesting of disulfide
   containing polypeptides, including antibodies, from recombinant host cell cultures.
                                     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
               In the biotechnology industry, pharmaceutical applications require a variety of proteins
15 produced using recombinant DNA techniques. Generally, recombinant proteins are produced by
   cell culture, using either eukaryotic cells, such as mammalian cells, or prokaryotic cells, such as
   bacterial cells, engineered to produce the protein of interest by insertion of a recombinant
   plasmid containing the nucleic acid encoding the desired protein.          For a protein to remain
   biologically active, the conformation of the protein, including its tertiary structure, must be
20 maintained during its purification and isolation, and the protein's multiple functional groups
   must be protected from degradation.
               Mammalian cells have become the dominant system for the production of mammalian
   proteins for clinical applications, primarily due to their ability to produce properly folded and
   assembled heterologous proteins, and their capacity for post-translational modifications.
25 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and cell lines obtained from various other mammalian
   sources, such as, for example, mouse myeloma (NSO), baby hamster kidney (BHK), human
   embryonic kidney (HEK-293) and human retinal cells, such as the PER.C6@ cell line isolated
   from a human retinal cell, which provides human glycosylation characteristics, and is able to
   naturally produce antibodies that match human physiology,. have been approved by regulatory
30 agencies for the production of biopharmaceutical products.
               Usually, to begin the production cycle, a small number of transformed recombinant host
   cells are allowed to grow in culture for several days (see, e.g., Figure 23). Once the cells have
   undergone several rounds of replication, they are transferred to a larger container where they are
   100014281 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   prepared to undergo fermentation. The media in which the cells are grown and the levels of
   oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide that exist during the production cycle may have a
   significant impact on the production process. Growth parameters are determined specifically for
   each cell line and these parameters are measured frequently to assure optimal growth and
 5 production conditions.
                When the cells grow to sufficient numbers, they are transferred to large-scale production
   tanks and grown for a longer period of time. At this point in the process, the recombinant
   protein can be harvested. Typically, the cells are engineered to secrete the polypeptide into the
   cell culture media, so the first step in the purification process is to separate the cells from the
10 media. Typically, harvesting includes centrifugation and filtration to produce a Harvested Cell
   Culture Fluid (HCCF). The media is then subjected to several additional purification steps that
   remove any cellular debris, unwanted proteins, salts, minerals or other undesirable elements. At
   the end of the purification process, the recombinant protein is highly pure and is suitable for
   human therapeutic use.
15              Although this process has been the subject of much study and improvements over the
   past several decades, the production of recombinant proteins is still not without difficulties.
   Thus, for example, during the recombinant production of polypeptides comprising disulfide
   bonds, especially multi-chain polypeptides comprising inter-chain disulfide bonds such as
   antibodies, it is essential to protect and retain the disulfide bonds throughout the manufacturing,
20 recovery and purification process, in order to produce properly folded polypeptides with the
   requisite biological activity.

                                       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
                The instant invention generally relates to a method for preventing reduction of a
   disulfide bond in a polypeptide expressed in a recombinant host cell, comprising supplementing
   the pre-harvest or harvested culture fluid of the recombinant host cell with an inhibitor of
30 thioredoxin or a thioredoxin-like protein.
                In one embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is added to the pre-harvest culture fluid.
                In another embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is added to the harvested culture fluid.
                In a further embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is a direct inhibitor of thioredoxin.
                                                             2
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

                In all embodiments, the thioredoxin inhibitor may, for example, be an alkyl-2-imidazolyl
   disulfide or a naphthoquinone spiroketal derivative.
                In a further embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is a specific inhibitor of thioredoxin
   reductase.
 5              In a still further embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is a gold complex, where the gold
   complex may, for example, be aurothioglucose (ATG) or aurothiomalate (ATM). While the
   effective inhibitory concentration may vary, it typically is between about 0.1 mM and 1 mM.
   Similarly, the minimum effective inhibitory concentration varies depending on the nature of the
   polypeptide and overall circumstances, and is typically reached when the ATG or ATG
10 concentration is at least about four-times of thioreduxin concentration in the pre-harvest or
   harvested culture fluid.
                In another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the thioredoxin inhibitor is a
   metal ion, where the metal ion, without limitation, may be selected from the group consisting of
        2+2
   Hg 2, Cu2+, Zn2, Co2+, and Mn2+. When the metal ion is added in the form of cupric sulfate, the
15 effective inhibitory concentration generally is between about 5 [LM and about 100 PM, or
   between about 10 [tM and about 80 pM, or between about 15 pLM and about 50 pM. The
   minimum inhibitory concentration of cupric sulfate also varies, but typically is reached when
   cupric sulfate is added at a concentration at least about two-times of thioredoxin concentration in
   the pre-harves or harvested culture fluid.
20              In different embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is an oxidizing agent, e.g., an inhibitor
   of G6PD, such as, for example, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, 1 fluoro-2,4 dinitrobenzene,
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or epiandrosterone (EA) ; cystine or cysteine.                     Typical
   effective inhibitor concentrations of DHEA are between abour 0.05 mM and about 5 mM, or
   between about 0.1 mM and about 2.5 mM.
25              In a further embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is an inhibitor of hexokinase activity,
   including, without limitation, chelators of metal ions, such as, for example, ethylenediamine
   tetraacetic acid (EDTA).           EDTA is typically added and effective at a concentration between
   about 5 mM and about 60 mM, or about 10 mM and about 50 mM, or about 20 mM and about
   40 mM.
30              In other preferred embodiments, the inhibitor of hexokinase activity is selected from the
   group consisting of sorbose-l-phosphate, polyphosphates,                 6-deoxy-6-fluoroglucose, 2-C
   hydroxy-methylglucose, xylose, and lyxose.

   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

                Other inhibitors include cystine, cysteine, and oxidized glutathione which are typically
   added at a concentration at least about 40-times of the concentration of the polypeptide in
   question in the pre-harvest or harvested culture fluid.
                In a still further embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is an siRNA, an antisense
 5 nucleotide, or an antibody specifically binding to a thioredoxin reductase.
                In another embodiment, the thioredoxin inhibitor is a measure indirectly resulting in the
   inhibition of thioredoxin activity. This embodiment includes, for example, air sparging the
   harvested culture fluid of the recombinant host cell, and/or lowering the pH of the harvested
   culture fluid of the recombinant host cell.
10              In various embodiments, indirect means for inhibiting thioredoxin activity, such as air
   sparging and/or lowering of the pH, can be combined with the use of direct thioredoxin
   inhibitors, such as those listed above.
                In all embodiments, the polypeptide may, for example, be an antibody, or a biologically
   functional fragment of an antibody.              Representative antibody fragments include Fab, Fab,'
15 F(ab) 2, scFv, (scFv) 2, dAb, complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, linear
   antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, minibodies, diabodies, and multispecific antibodies
   formed from antibody fragments.

   analysis (each lane representing a time point) showing that ocrelizumab outside the dialysis bag
   was reduced during the incubation period. This is evidenced by the loss of intact antibody (~
    150 kDa) and the formation of antibody fragments depicted in the Figure. At the 48-hour time
   point (Lane 7), the reduced antibody appeared to be reoxidized, presumably as a result of
30 loosing reduction activity in the Harvested Cell Culture Fluid (HCCF). The band appearing just
   above the 28 kDa marker arose from the light chain of antibody. There was a significant
   amount of free light already present in the HCCF before the incubation began. The presence of

   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was inside the dialysis bag and HCCF containing ocrelizumab

   comparable levels within a few hours, indicating a good exchange of small molecule
   components in the HCCF between inside and outside the dialysis bag.
                Figure 4. Thioredoxin System and Other Reactions Involved in Antibody
   Reduction:                The thioredoxin system, comprising thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase
10 (TrxR) and NADPH, functions as a hydrogen donor system for reduction of disulfide bonds in
   proteins. Trx is a small monomeric protein with a CXXC active site motif that catalyzes many
   redox reactions through thiol-disulfide exchange. The oxidized Trx can be reduced by NADPH
   via TrxR. The reduced Trx is then able to catalyze the reduction of disulfides in proteins. The
   NADPH required for thioredoxin system is provided via reactions in pentose phosphate pathway
15 and glycolysis.

   Bioanalyzer analysis (each lane representing a time point) demonstrating that incubation of
   intact ocrelizumab (1 mg/mL) with 0.1 mM TrxR (rat liver), 5 mM Trx (human), and 1 mM
   NADPH in PBS resulted in the complete reduction of ocrelizumab; the ocrelizumab was

   reduction activity had been lost (see Figure 13). In contrast to the results shown in Figure 17,
   the presence of EDTA did not block the reduction of ocreliumab.

   of EDTA, (2) addition of CuSO 4 , and (3) adjustment of pH to 5.5, used independently, were
   effective in inhibiting ocrelizumab reduction.         This was demonstrated by the depicted
   quantitative Bioanalyzer results that showed that nearly 100% intact (150 kDa) antibody
20 remained in the protein A elution pools. In contrast, ocrelizumab was completely reduced in the
   control HCCF after 20 hours of HCCF hold time.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
                I.                    Definitions
                In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
30 context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
   "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e.
                                                         11
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of
   further features in various embodiments of the invention.
                In the present invention, in the context of proteins, including antibodies, in general, or
   with regard to any specific protein or antibody, the term "reduction" is used to refer to the
 5 reduction of one or more disulfide bonds of the protein or antibody. Thus, for example, the
   terms "ocrelizumab reduction" is used interchangeably with the term "ocrelizumab disulfide
   bond reduction" and the term "antibody (Ab) reduction" is used interchangeably with the term
   "antibody (Ab) disulfide bond reuction."
                The terms "reduction" or "disulfide bond reduction" are used in the broadest sense, and
10 include complete and partial reduction and reduction of some or all of the disulfide bonds,
   interchain or intrachain, present in a protein such as an antibody.
                By "protein" is meant a sequence of amino acids for which the chain length is sufficient
   to produce the higher levels of tertiary and/or quaternary structure. This is to distinguish from
   "peptides" or other small molecular weight drugs that do not have such structure. Typically, the
15 protein herein will have a molecular weight of at least about 15-20 kD, preferably at least about
   20 kD. Examples of proteins encompassed within the definition herein include all mammalian
   proteins, in particular, therapeutic and diagnostic proteins, such as therapeutic and diagnostic
   antibodies, and, in general proteins that contain one or more disulfide bonds, including multi
   chain polypeptides comprising one or more inter- and/or intrachain disulfide bonds.
20              The term "therapeutic protein" or "therapeutic polypeptide" refers to a protein that is
   used in the treatment of disease, regardless of its indication or mechanism of action. In order for
   therapeutic proteins to be useful in the clinic it must be manufactured in large quantities.
   "Manufacturing scale" production of therapeutic proteins, or other proteins, utilize cell cultures
   ranging from about 400L to about 80,000 L, depending on the protein being produced and the
25 need. Typically such manufacturing scale production utilizes cell culture sizes from about 400
   L to about 25,000 L. Within this range, specific cell culture sizes such as 4,000 L, about 6,000
   L, about 8,000, about 10,000, about 12,000 L, about 14,000 L, or about 16,000 L are utilized.
                The term "therapeutic antibody" refers to an antibody that is used in the treatment of
   disease.          A therapeutic antibody may have various mechanisms of action.          A therapeutic
30 antibody may bind and neutralize the normal function of a target associated with an antigen. For
   example, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of the of protein needed for the survival
   of a cancer cell causes the cell's death. Another therapeutic monoclonal antibody may bind and
   activate the normal function of a target associated with an antigen. For example, a monoclonal
                                                         12
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   antibody can bind to a protein on a cell and trigger an apoptosis signal. Yet another monoclonal
   antibody may bind to a target antigen expressed only on diseased tissue; conjugation of a toxic
   payload (effective agent), such as a chemotherapeutic or radioactive agent, to the monoclonal
   antibody can create an agent for specific delivery of the toxic payload to the diseased tissue,
 5 reducing harm to healthy tissue. A "biologically functional fragment" of a therapeutic antibody
   will exhibit at least one if not some or all of the biological functions attributed to the intact
   antibody, the function comprising at least specific binding to the target antigen.
                The term "diagnostic protein" refers to a protein that is used in the diagnosis of a
   disease.
10              The term "diagnostic antibody" refers to an antibody that is used as a diagnostic reagent
   for a disease. The diagnostic antibody may bind to a target antigen that is specifically associated
   with, or shows increased expression in, a particular disease. The diagnostic antibody may be
   used, for example, to detect a target in a biological sample from a patient, or in diagnostic
   imaging of disease sites, such as tumors, in a patient. A "biologically functional fragment" of a
15 diagnostic antibody will exhibit at least one if not some or all of the biological functions
   attributed to the intact antibody, the function comprising at least specific binding to the target
   antigen.
                "Purified" means that a molecule is present in a sample at a concentration of at least 80
   90% by weight of the sample in which it is contained.
20              The protein, including antibodies, which is purified is preferably essentially pure and
   desirably essentially homogeneous (i.e. free from contaminating proteins etc.).
                An "essentially pure" protein means a protein composition comprising at least about
   90% by weight of the protein, based on total weight of the composition, preferably at least about
   95% by weight.
25              An "essentially homogeneous" protein means a protein composition comprising at least
   about 99% by weight of protein, based on total weight of the composition.
                As noted above, in certain embodiments, the protein is an antibody. "Antibodies" (Abs)
   and "immunoglobulins" (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics.
   While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both
30 antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which generally lack antigen specificity.
   Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and
   at increased levels by myelomas.
                                                         13
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

                The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal
   antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody
   compositions with polyepitopic specificity, bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain
   molecules such as scFv molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab') 2 , and Fv).
 5              The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a
   population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising
   the population are identical except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally occurring mutations,
   that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character
   of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a
10 monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that
   binds a target, wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that
   includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of
   polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the selection of a unique
   clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones, or
15 recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can
   be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding
   sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to
   create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding
   sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody
20 preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants
   (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a
   single determinant on an antigen.             In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibody
   preparations              are advantageous in that they   are typically   uncontaminated  by other
   immunoglobulins.
25              The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained
   from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as
   requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal
   antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of
   techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler et al., Nature, 256: 495
30 (1975); Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
   Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas
   563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
   4,816,567), phage display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991);

                The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in which a
   portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding
15 sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody
   class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to
   corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another
   antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the
   desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
20 Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)).
                "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that
   contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin.              In one embodiment, a
   humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from a
   hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a
25 non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the
   desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues
   of the          human immunoglobulin    are replaced by corresponding         non-human residues.
   Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient
   antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody
30 performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one,
   and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops
   correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all the FRs are
   those of a human immunoglobulin sequence.            The humanized antibody optionally will also

   comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human
   immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et
   al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992).            See also

   (1995); Hurle and Gross, Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994).                  The humanized antibody
   includes a Primatized              antibody wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived
   from an antibody produced by immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.
                A "human antibody" is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds
10 to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques
   for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody
   specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.
                An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
   CDRs/HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen,
15 compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity
   matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen.
   Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al.,
   Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain
   shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR/HVR and/or framework residues is described by:

                The "variable region" or "variable domain" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal
   domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain
25 may be referred to as "VH." The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as "VL
   These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen
   binding sites.
                The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ
   extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each
30 particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed
   throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called
   complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the

   variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy
   and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration,
   connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the
   beta-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR
 5 regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen
   binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,
   Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The constant domains are not
   involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector
   functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
10              The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be
   assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (?), based on the
   amino acid sequences of their constant domains.
                Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains,
   antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes
15 of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided
   into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG 1, IgG 2 , IgG 3 , IgG 4 , IgA 1, and IgA 2 . The heavy chain
   constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called a, d, e,
   g, and m, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different
   classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et
20 al., Cellular and Mol. Immunology, 4th ed. (2000). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion
   molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more
   other proteins or peptides.
                The terms "full length antibody," "intact antibody" and "whole antibody" are used
   herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not antibody
25 fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that
   contain the Fc region.
                "Antibody fragments" comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion
   retains at least one, and as many as most or all, of the functions normally associated with that
   portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment
30 comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind
   antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc
   region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region
   when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC
                                                            17

   function and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent
   antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example,
   such an antibody fragment may comprise an antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence
   capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.
 5              Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called
   "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose
   name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab' ) fragment that
   has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.
                The Fab fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and also
10 contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy
   chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments bythe addition of a few residues at the
   carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the
   antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which thecysteine
   residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab' )2 antibody fragments originally
15 were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other
   chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
                "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site.
   In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light
   chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species,
20 one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide
   linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a "dimeric" structure analogous to
   that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable
   domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer.
   Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a
25 single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has
   the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
                "Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of an
   antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv
   polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which
30 enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see
   Pluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore
   eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).

                The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites,
   which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain
   variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short
   to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with
 5 the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies
   may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097;
   W093/1161; Hudson et al., (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al.,
   (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134.
10              The antibody may bind to any protein, including, witout limitation, a member of the
   HER receptor family, such as HERI (EGFR), HER2, HER3 and HER4; CD proteins such as
   CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, and CD34; cell adhesion molecules such as LFA
    1, Mol, p150,95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM and av/p3 integrin including either a or          P or

15 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); IgE; blood group antigens; flk2/flt3 receptor;
   obesity (OB) receptor; and protein C. Other exemplary proteins include growth hormone (GH),

   derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, -4, -5, or -6 (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, or NT-6),
30 or a nerve growth factor such as NGF-P; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); fibroblast
   growth factor such as aFGF and bFGF; epidermal growth factor (EGF); transforming growth
   factor (TGF) such as TGF-a and TGF-p, including TGF-p1, TGF-p2, TGF-p3, TGF-34, or

   example, a portion of the AIDS envelope; transport proteins; homing receptors; addressins;
   regulatory proteins; immunoadhesins; antibodies; and biologically active fragments or variants
   of any of the above-listed polypeptides.Many other antibodies and/or other proteins may be used
10 in accordance with the instant invention, and the above lists are not meant to be limiting.
                A "biologically functional fragment" of an antibody comprises only a portion of an
   intact antibody, wherein the portion retains at least one, and as many as most or all, of the
   functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one
   embodiment, a biologically functional fragment of an antibody comprises an antigen binding
15 site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, a
   biologically functional fragment of an antibody, for example one that comprises the Fc region,
   retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when
   present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC
   function and complement binding. In one embodiment, a biologically functional fragment of an
20 antibody is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact
   antibody. For example, such a biologically functional fragment of an antibody may comprise an
   antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the
   fragment.
                The terms "thioredoxin inhibitor" and "Trx inhibitor" are used interchangeably, and
25 include all agents and measures effective in inhibiting thioredoxin activity. Thus, thioredoxin
   (Trx) inhibitors include all agents and measures blocking any component of the Trx, G6PD
   and/or hexokinase enzyme systems. In this context, "inhibition" includes complete elimination
   (blocking) and reduction of thioredoxin activity, and, consequently, complete or partial
   elimination of disulfide bond reduction in a protein, such as an antibody.
30              An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered
   from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural
   environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses
   for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or
                                                         20
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified (1) to greater than 95%
   by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some
   embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15
   residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a spinning cup
 5 sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions
   using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in
   situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment
   will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one
   purification step.
10              The terms "Protein A" and "ProA" are used interchangeably herein and encompasses
   Protein A recovered from a native source thereof, Protein A produced synthetically (e.g. by
   peptide synthesis or by recombinant techniques), and variants thereof which retain the ability to
   bind proteins which have a CH2 /CH3 region, such as an Fc region. Protein A can be purchased
   commercially from Repligen, GE Healthcare and Fermatech. Protein A is generally
15 immobilized on a solid phase support material. The term "ProA" also refers to an affinity
   chromatography resin or column containing chromatographic solid support matrix to which is
   covalently attached Protein A.
                The term "chromatography" refers to the process by which a solute of interest in a
   mixture is separated from other solutes in a mixture as a result of differences in rates at which
20 the individual solutes of the mixture migrate through a stationary medium under the influence of
   a moving phase, or in bind and elute processes.
                The term "affinity chromatography" and "protein affinity chromatography" are used
   interchangeably herein and refer to a protein separation technique in which a protein of interest
   or antibody of interest is reversibly and specifically bound to a biospecific ligand. Preferably,
25 the biospecific ligand is covalently attached to a chromatographic solid phase material and is
   accessible to the protein of interest in solution as the solution contacts the chromatographic solid
   phase material. The protein of interest (e.g., antibody, enzyme, or receptor protein) retains its
   specific binding affinity for the biospecific ligand (antigen, substrate, cofactor, or hormone, for
   example) during the chromatographic steps, while other solutes and/or proteins in the mixture
30 do not bind appreciably or specifically to the ligand. Binding of the protein of interest to the
   immobilized ligand allows contaminating proteins or protein impurities to be passed through the
   chromatographic medium while the protein of interest remains specifically bound to the
   immobilized ligand on the solid phase material. The specifically bound protein of interest is then
                                                        21
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   removed in active form from the immobilized ligand with low pH, high pH, high salt, competing
   ligand, and the like, and passed through the chromatographic column with the elution buffer,
   free of the contaminating proteins or protein impurities that were earlier allowed to pass through
   the column. Any component can be used as a ligand for purifying its respective specific binding
 5 protein, e.g. antibody.
                The terms "non-affinity chromatography" and "non-affinity purification" refer to a
   purification process in which affinity chromatography is not utilized. Non-affinity
   chromatography includes chromatographic techniques that rely on non-specific interactions
   between a molecule of interest (such as a protein, e.g. antibody) and a solid phase matrix.
10              A "cation exchange resin" refers to a solid phase which is negatively charged, and which
   thus has free cations for exchange with cations in an aqueous solution passed over or through the
   solid phase. A negatively charged ligand attached to the solid phase to form the cation exchange
   resin may, e.g., be a carboxylate or sulfonate. Commercially available cation exchange resins
   include carboxy-methyl-cellulose, sulphopropyl (SP) immobilized on agarose (e.g. SP
15 SEPHAROSE FAST FLOW T M or SP-SEPHAROSE HIGH PERFORMANCE T M, from GE
   Healthcare) and sulphonyl immobilized on agarose (e.g. S-SEPHAROSE FAST FLOW T M from
   GE Healthcare). A "mixed mode ion exchange resin" refers to a solid phase which is covalently
   modified with cationic, anionic, and hydrophobic moieties. A commercially available mixed
   mode ion exchange resin is BAKERBOND ABX TM (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) containing
20 weak cation exchange groups, a low concentration of anion exchange groups, and hydrophobic
   ligands attached to a silica gel solid phase support matrix.
                The term "anion exchange resin" is used herein to refer to a solid phase which is
   positively charged, e.g. having one or more positively charged ligands, such as quaternary
   amino groups, attached thereto. Commercially available anion exchange resins include DEAE
25 cellulose, QAE SEPHADEX TM and FAST Q SEPHAROSE TM (GE Healthcare).
                A "buffer" is a solution that resists changes in pH by the action of its acid-base conjugate
   components. Various buffers which can be employed depending, for example, on the desired pH
   of the buffer are described in Buffers. A Guidefor the Preparationand Use ofBuffers in
   BiologicalSystems, Gueffroy, D., ed. Calbiochem Corporation (1975). In one embodiment, the
30 buffer has a pH in the range from about 2 to about 9, alternatively from about 3 to about 8,
   alternatively from about 4 to about 7 alternatively from about 5 to about 7. Non-limiting
   examples of buffers that will control the pH in this range include MES, MOPS, MOPSO, Tris,
                                                            22
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   HEPES, phosphate, acetate, citrate, succinate, and ammonium buffers, as well as combinations
   of these.
                The "loading buffer" is that which is used to load the composition comprising the
   polypeptide molecule of interest and one or more impurities onto the ion exchange resin. The
 5 loading buffer has a conductivity and/or pH such that the polypeptide molecule of interest (and
   generally one or more impurities) is/are bound to the ion exchange resin or such that the protein
   of interest flows through the column while the impurities bind to the resin.
                The "intermediate buffer" is used to elute one or more impurities from the ion exchange
   resin, prior to eluting the polypeptide molecule of interest. The conductivity and/or pH of the
10 intermediate buffer is/are such that one or more impurity is eluted from the ion exchange resin,
   but not significant amounts of the polypeptide of interest.
                The term "wash buffer" when used herein refers to a buffer used to wash or re
   equilibrate the ion exchange resin, prior to eluting the polypeptide molecule of interest.
   Conveniently, the wash buffer and loading buffer may be the same, but this is not required.
15              The "elution buffer" is used to elute the polypeptide of interest from the solid phase. The
   conductivity and/or pH of the elution buffer is/are such that the polypeptide of interest is eluted
   from the ion exchange resin.
                A "regeneration buffer" may be used to regenerate the ion exchange resin such that it
   can be re-used. The regeneration buffer has a conductivity and/or pH as required to remove
20 substantially all impurities and the polypeptide of interest from the ion exchange resin.
                The term "substantially similar" or "substantially the same," as used herein, denotes a
   sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated
   with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator
   antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values
25 to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological
   characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two
   values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than
   about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.
                The phrase "substantially reduced," or "substantially different," as used herein with
30 regard to amounts or numerical values (and not as reference to the chemical process of
   reduction), denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values
   (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator
   molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values
                                                           23
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by
   said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater
   than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or
   greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.
 5              The term "vector," as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable
   of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a
   "plasmid," which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments
   may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral
   vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors
10 are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g.,
   bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors).
   Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a
   host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host
   genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which
15 they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant expression
   vectors," or simply, "expression vectors." In general, expression vectors of utility in
   recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification,
   "plasmid" and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used
   form of vector.
20              "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to a reference polypeptide
   sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are
   identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the
   sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence
   identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.
25 Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in
   various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer
   software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those
   skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any
   algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being
30 compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated
   using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence
   comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been
   filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is
                                                           24
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is
   publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California, or may be compiled
   from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating
   system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the
 5 ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.
                In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the %
   amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given
   amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A
   that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino
10 acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:
                                       100 times the fraction X/Y
                                      where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by
                                      the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program' s alignment of A
                                      and B, and
15                                    where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B.
   It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length
   of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the %
   amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid
   sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding
20 paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.
                "Percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity" is defined as the percentage of nucleotides
   in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides in a reference Factor D-encoding
   sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the
   maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent nucleic
25 acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for
   instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or
   Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters
   for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over
   the full length of the sequences being compared. Sequence identity is then calculated relative to
30 the longer sequence, i.e. even if a shorter sequence shows 100% sequence identity wit a portion
   of a longer sequence, the overall sequence identity will be less than 100%.
                "Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative
   measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in
                                                                   25

   which the disorder is to be prevented.                  "Treatment" herein encompasses alleviation of the
   disease and of the signs and symptoms of the particular disease.
                A "disorder" is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the protein. This
   includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which
 5 predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be
   treated herein include carcinomas and allergies.
                "Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal,
   including humans, non-human higher primates, other vertebrates, domestic and farm animals,
   and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc. Preferably, the mammal is
10 human.
                An "interfering RNA" or "small interfering RNA (siRNA)" is a double stranded RNA
   molecule less than about 30 nucleotides in length that reduces expression of a target gene.
   Interfering RNAs may be identified and synthesized using known methods (Shi Y., Trends in
   Genetics 19(1):9-12 (2003), WO/2003056012 and W02003064621), and siRNA libraries are
15 commercially available, for example from Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colorado.                      Frequently,

                 1. Preventionof disulfide bond reduction
                The present invention concerns methods for the prevention of the reduction of disulfide
   bonds of proteins during recombinant production. In particular, the invention concerns methods
15 for preventing the reduction of disulfide bonds of recombinant proteins during processing
   following fermentation. The methods of the invention are particulary valuable for large scale
   production of disulfide bond containing proteins, such as at a manufacturing scale.             In one
   embodiment, the methods of the invention are useful for large scale protein production at a scale
   of greater than 5,000 L.
20              It has been experimentally found that disulfide bond reduction occurs during processing
   of the Harvested Cell Culture Fluid (HCCF) produced during manufacturing of recombinant
   proteins that contain disulfide bonds.         Typically, this reduction is observed after cell lysis,
   especially mechanical cell lysis during harvest operations, when it reaches a certain threshold,
   such as, for example, from about 30% to about 70%, or from about 40% to about 60%, or from
25 about 50% to about 60% total cell lysis. This threshold will vary, depending on the nature of the
   protein (e.g. antibody) produced, the recombinant host, the production system, production
   parameters used, and the like, and can be readily determined experimentally.
                Theoretically, such reduction might result from a variety of factors and conditions during
   the manufacturing process, and might be caused by a variety of reducing agents. The present
30 invention is based, at least in part, on the recognition that the root cause of this reduction is an
   active thioredoxin (Trx) or thioredoxin-like system in the HCCF.
                The Trx enzyme system, composed of Trx, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and NADPH,
   is a hydrogen donor system for reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins.                Trx is a small
                                                         27
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   monomeric protein with a CXXC active site motif that catalyzes many redox reactions through
   thiol-disulfide exchange. The oxidized Trx can be reduced by NADPH via TrxR. The reduced
   Trx is then able to catalyze the reduction of disulfides in proteins. The NADPH required for
   thioredoxin system is provided via reactions in pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. The
 5 results presented herein demonstrate that NADPH, which is required for activity of the Trx
   system is provided by glucose-6-phosphate dehyrogenase (G6PD) activity, which generates
   NADPH from glucose and ATP by hexokinase (see Figure 4). These cellular enzymes (Trx
   system, G6PD, and hexokinase) along with their substrates are released into the CCF upon cell
   lysis, allowing reduction to occur.                  Accordingly, disulfide reduction can be prevented by
10 inhibitors of the Trx enzyme system or upstream enzyme systems providing components for an
   active Trx system, such as G6PD and hexokinase activity.

                According to one aspect of the present invention, disulfide bond reduction can be
   prevented by blocking any component of the Trx, G6PD and hexokinase enzyme systems.
   Inhibitors of these enzyme systems are collectively referred to herein as "thioredoxin inhibitors,"
   or "Trx inhibitors." The Trx inhibitors are typically added to the cell culture fluid (CCF), which
30 contains the recombinant host cells and the culture media, and/or to the harvested cell culture
   fluid (HCCF), which is obtained after harvesting by centrifugation, filtration, or similar
   separation methods. The HCCF lacks intact host cells but typically contains host cell proteins
   and other contaminants, including DNA, which are removed in subsequent purification steps.

   Thus, the Trx inhibitors may be added before harvest and/or during harvest, preferably before
   harvest.
                Alternatively or in addition other, non-specific methods can also be used to prevent the
   reduction of disulfide bond reduction following fermentation during the recombinant production
 5 of recombinant proteins, such as air sparging or pH adjustment. Certain reduction inhibition
   methods contemplated herein are listed in the following Table 1.

10              "Trx inhibitors" for use in the methods of the present invention include, without
   limitation, (1) direct inhibitors of Trx, such as alkyl-2-imidazolyl disulfides and related
   compounds (e.g., 1 methylpropyl-2-imidazolyl disulfide) (Kirkpatrick et al., 1998 and 1999,
                                                            30

   supra) and naphthoquinone spiroketal derivatives (e.g., palmarumycin CP i) (Wipf et al., 2001,
   supra); (2) specific inhibitors of TrxR, including gold complexes, such as aurothioglucose
   (ATG) and aurothiomalate (ATM) (see, e.g., the review by Gromer et al., 2004), which are
   examples of irreversible inhibitors of TrxR; (3) metal ions, such as Hg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and
         2+
 5 Mn 2,       which can form readily complexes with thiols and selenols, and thus can be used in
   embodiments of the instant invention as inhibitors of TrxR or Trx; (4) inhibitors of G6PD, such
   as, for example, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and 1 fluoro-2,4 dinitrobenzene (Milhausen and Levy
   1975, supra), certain steroids, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and epiandrosterone
   (EA) (Gordon et al., 1995, supra); and (4) inhibitors of hexokinase activity (and thereby
10 production of G6P for the G6PD), including chelators of metal ions, e.g. Mg2, such as EDTA,
   and compounds that react with SH groups, sorbose-l-phosphate, polyphosphates, 6-deoxy-6
   fluoroglucose, 2-C-hydroxy-methylglucose, xylose and lyxose (Sols et al., 1958, supra;
   McDonald, 1955, supra); further hexokinase inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
   5,854,067 entitled "Hexokinase Inhibitors." It will be understood that these inhibitors are listed
15 for illustration only.             Other Trx inhibitors exists and can be used, alone or in various
   combinations, in the methods of the present invention.
                "Trx inhibitors" for use in the methods of the present invention also include reagents
   whereby the reduction of recombinantly produced antibodies or proteins may be reduced or
   prevented by decreasing the levels of enzymes of the Trx system, the pentose phosphate
20 pathway or hexokinase at various points during the production campaign. In some
   embodiments, this reduction of enzyme levels may be accomplished by the use of targeted
   siRNAs, antisense nucleotides, or antibodies. To design targeted siRNAs or antisense
   nucleotides to the genes as found in CHO cells, these gene sequences are available from public
   databases to select sequences for targeting enzymes in different organisms. See Example 9
25 below for examples of the genes of the E. coli and mouse Trx system.
                In addition to using inhibitors discussed above, it is also possible in certain
   embodiments of the instant invention to prevent the reduction of a recombinant protein to be
   purifed by sparging the HCCF with air to maintain an oxidizing redox potential in the HCCF.
   This is a non-directed measure that can deplete glucose, G6P and NADPH by continuously
30 oxidizing the reduced forms of Trx and TrxR. Air sparging of the HCCF tank can be
   performed, for example, with an air flow of about 100 liters to about 200 liters, such as, for
   example, 150 liters per minutes. Air sparging can be performed to reach an endpoint
   percentage of saturation; for example, air sparging can be continued until the HCCF is about
                                                            31
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

    100%       saturated with air, or it can be continued until the HCCR is about 30% saturated with
   air, or until it is between about 100% saturated to about 30% saturated with air. The
   minimum amount of dissolved oxygen (dO 2) required for the desired inhibitory effect also
   depends on the antibody or other recombinant protein produced. Thus, for example, about
 5  10%     dO 2 (or about 10 sccm for continuous stream) will have the desired effect during the
   production of antibody 2H7 (Variant A), while Apomab might require a higher (about 30%)
   dO 2 .
                In further embodiments of the instant invention, another non-directed method usable
   to block the reduction of the recombinant protein is lowering the pH of the HCCF. This
10 embodiment takes advantage of particularly slow thiol-disulfide exchange at lower pH values
   (Whitesides et al., 1977, supra; Pleasantset al., 1989, supra). Therefore, the activity of the
   Trx system is significantly lower at pH values below 6, and thus the reduction of the
   recombinant protein, such as ocrelizumab, can be inhibited.
                The non-directed approaches can also be combined with each other and/or with the use
15 of one or more Trx inhibitors.
                Disulfide bond reduction can be inhibited (i.e., partially or fully blocked) by using one or
   more Trx inhibitors and/or applying non-directed approaches following completion of the cell
   culture process, preferably to CCF prior to harvest or in the HCCF immediately after harvest.
   The optimal time and mode of application and effective amounts depend on the nature of the
20 protein to be purified, the recombinant host cells, and the specific production method used.
   Determination of the optimal parameters is well within the skill of those of ordinary skill in the
   art.
                For example, in a mammalian cell culture process, such as the CHO antibody production
   process described in the Examples herein, if cupric sulfate (CuSO 4 in the form of pentahydrate
25 or the anhydrous form) is used as a Trx inhibitor, it can be added to supplement the CCF or
   HCCF in the concentration range of from about 5 pM to about 100 pM, such as from about 10
   pLM to about 80 pM, preferably from about 15 pM to about 50 pM. Since some cell cultures
   already contain copper (e.g. about 0.04 pIM CuSO 4 for the CHO cell cultures used in the
   Examples herein), this amount is in addition to the copper, if any, already present in the cell
30 culture. Any copper (II) salt can be used instead of CuSO 4 as long as solubility is not an issue.
   For example, copper acetate and copper chloride, which are both soluble in water, can be used
   instead of CuSO 4 . The minimum effective concentration may also depend on the antibody
   produced and the stage where the inhibitor is used. Thus, for example, when cupric sulfate is

   added pre-lysis, for antibody 2H7 (Variant A) the minimum effective concentration is about 30
   pM, for Apomab is about 75 pLM, and for antibody Variant C (see Table 2) is about 50 pM.
   When cupric sulfate is added in CC medium, for antibody 2H7 (Variant A) the minimum
   effective concentration is about 15 tM, for Apomab is about 25 pM, and for antibody Variant C
 5 is about 20 piM. One typical minimal CuSO 4 inhibitor concentration of 2 x Trx concentration
   (or Trx equivalence).
                EDTA can be used in a wide concentration range, depending on the extent of cell lysis,
   the recombinant host cell used, and other parameters of the production process. For example,
   when using CHO or other mammalian host cells, EDTA can be typically added in a
10 concentration of between about 5 mM to about 60 mM, such as from about 10 mM to about 50
   mM, or from about 20 mM to about 40 mM, depending on the extent of cell lysis. For lower
   degree of cell lysis, lower concentrations of EDTA will suffice, while for a cell lysis of about
   75% - 100%, the required EDTA concentration is higher, such as, for example, from about 20
   mM to about 40 mM. The minimum effective concentration may also depend on the antibody
15 produced. Thus, for example, for antibody 2H7 (Variant A) the minimum effective EDTA
   concentration is about 10 mM.
                DHEA as a Trx inhibitor is typically effective at a lower concentration, such as for
   example, in the concentration range from about 0.05 mM to about 5 mM, preferably from about
   0.1 mM to about 2.5 mM.
20              Other Trx inhibitors, such as aurothioglucose (ATG) and aurothiomalate (ATM) inhibit
   reduction of disulfide bonds in the ptM concentration range. Thus, for example, ATG or ATM
   may be added in a concentration between about 0.1 mM to about 1 mM. While the minimum
   inhibitory concentration varies depending on the actual conditions, for ATG and ATM typically
   it is around 4 x TrxR concentration.
25              It is noted that all inhibitors can be used in an excess amount, therefore, it is not always
   necessary to know the amount of Trx or TrxR in the system.
                In a preferred embodiment, the mammalian host cell used in the manufacturing process

                A preferred host cell for the production of the polypeptides herein is the CHO cell line
10 DP12 (CHO KI dhfr). This is one of the best known CHO cell lines, widely used in laboratory
   practice (see, for example, EP 0,307,247, published March 15, 1989). In addition, other CHO
   KI (dhfr) cell lines are known and can be used in the methods of the present invention.
                The mammalian host cells used to produce peptides, polypeptides and proteins can be
   cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F 10 (Sigma),
15 Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified
   Eagle's Medium ((DMEM, Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of
   the media described in Ham and Wallace (1979), Meth. in Enz. 58:44, Barnes and Sato (1980),
   Anal. Biochem. 102:255, U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; or 4,560,655; WO
   90/03430; WO 87/00195; U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30,985; or U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469, the disclosures
20 of all of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used as culture media for the host
   cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other
   growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium
   chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as
   adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GentamycinTM drug), trace elements (defined as
25 inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and
   glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included
   at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture
   conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell
   selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
30              A protocol for the production, recovery and purification of recombinant antibodies in
   mammalian, such as CHO, cells may include the following steps:
   Cells may be cultured in a stirred tank bioreactor system and a fed batch culture, procedure is
   employed. In a preferred fed batch culture the mammalian host cells and culture medium are
                                                         34
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   supplied to a culturing vessel initially and additional culture nutrients are fed, continuously or in
   discrete increments, to the culture during culturing, with or without periodic cell and/or product
   harvest before termination of culture. The fed batch culture can include, for example, a semi
   continuous fed batch culture, wherein periodically whole culture (including cells and medium) is
 5 removed and replaced by fresh medium. Fed batch culture is distinguished from simple batch
   culture in which all components for cell culturing (including the cells and all culture nutrients)
   are supplied to the culturing vessel at the start of the culturing process. Fed batch culture can be
   further distinguished from perfusion culturing insofar as the supernate is not removed from the
   culturing vessel during the process (in perfusion culturing, the cells are restrained in the culture
10 by, e.g., filtration, encapsulation, anchoring to microcarriers etc. and the culture medium is
   continuously or intermittently introduced and removed from the culturing vessel).
                Further, the cells of the culture may be propagated according to any scheme or routine
   that may be suitable for the particular host cell and the particular production plan contemplated.
   Therefore, a single step or multiple step culture procedure may be employed. In a single step
15 culture the host cells are inoculated into a culture environment and the processes are employed
   during a single production phase of the cell culture. Alternatively, a multi-stage culture can be
   used. In the multi-stage culture cells may be cultivated in a number of steps or phases. For
   instance, cells may be grown in a first step or growth phase culture wherein cells, possibly
   removed from storage, are inoculated into a medium suitable for promoting growth and high
20 viability. The cells may be maintained in the growth phase for a suitable period of time by the
   addition of fresh medium to the host cell culture.
                In certain embodiments, fed batch or continuous cell culture conditions may be devised
   to enhance growth of the mammalian cells in the growth phase of the cell culture. In the growth
   phase cells are grown under conditions and for a period of time that is maximized for growth.
25 Culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (dO 2) and the like, are those used
   with the particular host and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. Generally, the pH is
   adjusted to a level between about 6.5 and 7.5 using either an acid (e.g., C0 2 ) or a base (e.g.,
   Na2CO 3 or NaOH). A suitable temperature range for culturing mammalian cells such as CHO
   cells is between about 30'C to 38'C, and a suitable dO 2 is between 5-90% of air saturation.
30              At a particular stage the cells may be used to inoculate a production phase or step of the
   cell culture. Alternatively, as described above the production phase or step may be continuous
   with the inoculation or growth phase or step.

                The cell culture environment during the production phase of the cell culture is typically
   controlled. Thus, if a glycoprotein is produced, factors affecting cell specific productivity of the
   mammalian host cell may be manipulated such that the desired sialic acid content is achieved in
   the resulting glycoprotein. In a preferred aspect, the production phase of the cell culture process
 5 is preceded by a transition phase of the cell culture in which parameters for the production phase
   of the cell culture are engaged. Further details of this process are found in U.S. Patent No.
   5,721,121, and Chaderjian et al., Biotechnol. Prog. 21(2):550-3 (2005), the entire disclosures of
   which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.
                Following fermentation proteins are purified. Procedures for purification of proteins
10 from cell debris initially depend on the site of expression of the protein. Some proteins can be
   caused to be secreted directly from the cell into the surrounding growth media; others are made
   intracellularly. For the latter proteins, the first step of a purification process involves lysis of the
   cell, which can be done by a variety of methods, including mechanical shear, osmotic shock, or
   enzymatic treatments. Such disruption releases the entire contents of the cell into the
15 homogenate, and in addition produces subcellular fragments that are difficult to remove due to
   their small size. These are generally removed by differential centrifugation or by filtration. The
   same problem arises, although on a smaller scale, with directly secreted proteins due to the
   natural death of cells and release of intracellular host cell proteins and components in the course
   of the protein production run.
20              Once a clarified solution containing the protein of interest has been obtained, its
   separation from the other proteins produced by the cell is usually attempted using a combination
   of different chromatography techniques. These techniques separate mixtures of proteins on the
   basis of their charge, degree of hydrophobicity, or size. Several different chromatography resins
   are available for each of these techniques, allowing accurate tailoring of the purification scheme
25 to the particular protein involved. The essence of each of these separation methods is that
   proteins can be caused either to move at different rates down a long column, achieving a
   physical separation that increases as they pass further down the column, or to adhere selectively
   to the separation medium, being then differentially eluted by different solvents. In some cases,
   the desired protein is separated from impurities when the impurities specifically adhere to the
30 column, and the protein of interest does not, that is, the protein of interest is present in the "flow
   through." Thus, purification of recombinant proteins from the cell culture of mammalian host
   cells may include one or more affinity (e.g. protein A) and/or ion exchange chomarographic
   steps.

                Ion exchange chromatography is a chromatographic technique that is commonly used
   for the purification of proteins. In ion exchange chromatography, charged patches on the surface
   of the solute are attracted by opposite charges attached to a chromatography matrix, provided
   the ionic strength of the surrounding buffer is low. Elution is generally achieved by increasing
 5 the ionic strength (i.e. conductivity) of the buffer to compete with the solute for the charged sites
   of the ion exchange matrix. Changing the pH and thereby altering the charge of the solute is
   another way to achieve elution of the solute. The change in conductivity or pH may be gradual
   (gradient elution) or stepwise (step elution). In the past, these changes have been progressive;
   i.e., the pH or conductivity is increased or decreased in a single direction.

   example, Fahrner et al., Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 18:301-27 (2001), the entire disclosure of

                In addition to mammalian host cells, other eukaryotic organisms can be used as host
   cells for expression of the recombinant protein. For expression in yeast host cells, such as
15 common baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suitable vectors include episomally
   replicating vectors based on the 2-micron plasmid, integration vectors, and yeast artificial
   chromosome (YAC) vectors. Other yeast suitable for recombinant production of heterologous

   exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony, The Biochemistry of
   Methylotrophs, 269 (1982).         Expression systems for the listed and other yeasts are well known
   in the art and/or are commercially available.

                The methods of the present invention also extend to cultures of prokaryotic host cells.
10 Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies and other proteins to be protected by
   means of the instant invention include ArchaebacteriaandEubacteria,such as Gram-negative
   or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include Escherichia(e.g., E. coli),
   Bacilli (e.g., B. subtilis), Enterobacteria,Pseudomonas species (e.g., P. aeruginosa),Salmonella
   typhimurium, Serratiamarcescans,Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella,Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla, or
15 Paracoccus. In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used. Examples of E. coli strains
   include strain W3 110 (Bachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.:
   American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219; ATCC Deposit No. 27,325) and
   derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3 110 AfhuA (AtonA) ptr3 lac Iq
   lacL8 AompTA(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635).                  Other strains and
20 derivatives thereof, such as E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), E. coli B, E. colil 1776 (ATCC 31,537)
   and E. coli RV308(ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than
   limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having
   defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., Proteins,
   8:309-314 (1990). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into
25 consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli,
   Serratia,or Salmonella species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such
   as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the
   host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease
   inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.
30              Methods for the production, recovery and purification of recombinant proteins from
   non-mammalian host cell cultures are also well known in the art. If the polypeptide is produced
   in a non-mammalian cell, e.g., a microorganism such as fungi or E. coli, the polypeptide will be
   recovered inside the cell or in the periplasmic space (Kipriyanov and Little, Molecular
                                                           38

   Biotechnology, 12: 173 201 (1999); Skerra and Pluckthun, Science, 240: 1038 1040 (1988)).
   Hence, it is necessary to release the protein from the cells to the extracellular medium by
   extraction such as cell lysis. Such disruption releases the entire contents of the cell into the
   homogenate, and in addition produces subcellular fragments that are difficult to remove due to
 5 their small size. These are generally removed by differential centrifugation or by filtration.
                Cell lysis is typically accomplished using mechanical disruption techniques such as
   homogenization or head milling. While the protein of interest is generally effectively liberated,
   such techniques have several disadvantages (Engler, Protein Purification Process Engineering,
   Harrison eds., 37 55 (1994)). Temperature increases, which often occur during processing, may
10 result in inactivation of the protein. Moreover, the resulting suspension contains a broad
   spectrum of contaminating proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides. Nucleic acids and
   polysaccharides increase solution viscosity, potentially complicating subsequent processing by
   centrifugation, cross-flow filtration, or chromatography. Complex associations of these
   contaminants with the protein of interest can complicate the purification process and result in
15 unacceptably low yields. Improved methods for purification of heterologous polypeptides from
   microbial fermentation broth or homogenate are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No.
   7,169,908, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.
                It is emphasized that the fermentation, recovery and purification methods described
   herein are only for illustration purposes. The methods of the present inventon can be combined
20 with any manufacturing process developed for the production, recovery and purification of
   recombinant proteins.

10              Many of these antibodies are widely used in clinical practice to treat various diseases,
   including cancer.
                In certain specific embodiments, the methods of the present invention are used for the
   production of the following antibodies and recombinant proteins.
15              Anti-CD20 antibodies
                Rituximab (RITUXAN") is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human
   monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen. Rituximab is the antibody called
   "C2B8" in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137 issued Apr. 7, 1998 (Anderson et al.). Rituximab is
   indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20
20 positive, B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In vitro mechanism of action studies have
   demonstrated that rituximab binds human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines through
   complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Reff et al., Blood 83(2):435-445 (1994)).
   Additionally, it has significant activity in assays for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
   (ADCC). More recently, rituximab has been shown to have anti-proliferative effects in tritiated
25 thymidine incorporation assays and to induce apoptosis directly, while other anti-CD 19 and
   CD20 antibodies do not (Maloney et al., Blood 88(10):637a (1996)). Synergy between
   rituximab and chemotherapies and toxins has also been observed experimentally. In particular,
   rituximab. sensitizes drug-resistant human B cell lymphoma cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of
   doxorubicin, CDDP, VP-i 6, diphtheria toxin and ricin (Demidem et al., Cancer Chemotherapy
30 & Radiopharmaceuticals 12(3):177-186 (1997)). In vivo preclinical studies have shown that
   rituximab depletes B cells from the peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of
   cynomolgus monkeys, presumably through complement and cell-mediated processes (Reff et
   al., Blood 83(2):435-445 (1994)).

30              In certain embodiments, the humanized 2H7 antibody of the invention further
   comprises amino acid alterations in the IgG Fc and exhibits increased binding affinity for
   human FcRn over an antibody having wild-type IgG Fc, by at least 60 fold, at least 70 fold, at
   least 80 fold, more preferably at least 100 fold, preferably at least 125 fold, even more
                                                        47

   preferably at least 150 fold to about 170 fold.
                The N-glycosylation site in IgG is at Asn297 in the CH2 domain. Humanized 2H7
   antibody compositions of the present invention include compositions of any of the preceding
   humanized 2H7 antibodies having a Fc region, wherein about 80-100% (and preferably about
 5 90-99%) of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure
   which lacks fucose, attached to the Fc region of the glycoprotein. Such compositions were
   demonstrated herein to exhibit a surprising improvement in binding to Fc(RIIIA(F158),
   which is not as effective as Fc(RIIIA (V158) in interacting with human IgG. Fc(RIIIA
   (F158) is more common than Fc(RIIIA (V158) in normal, healthy African Americans and
10 Caucasians. See Lehrnbecher et al., Blood 94:4220 (1999). Historically, antibodies produced
   in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO), one of the most commonly used industrial hosts,
   contain about 2 to 6% in the population that are nonfucosylated. YB2/0 and Lec 13, however,
   can produce antibodies with 78 to 98% nonfucosylated species. Shinkawa et al., J Bio.
   Chem. 278 (5), 3466-347 (2003), reported that antibodies produced in YB2/0 and Lec13
15 cells, which have less FUT8 activity, show significantly increased ADCC activity in vitro.
   The production of antibodies with reduced fucose content are also described in e.g., Li et al.,
   (GlycoFi) "Optimization of humanized IgGs in glycoengineered Pichiapastoris" in Nature
   Biology online publication 22 Jan. 2006; Niwa R. et al., Cancer Res. 64(6):2127-2133

                A bispecific humanized 2H7 antibody encompasses an antibody wherein one arm of the
   antibody has at least the antigen binding region of the H and/or L chain of a humanized 2H7
   antibody of the invention, and the other arm has V region binding specificity for a second
25 antigen. In specific embodiments, the second antigen is selected from the group consisting of
   CD3, CD64, CD32A, CD 16, NKG2D or other NK activating ligands.

   receptor; and fragments of any of the above-listed polypeptides.
                4.             General methods for the recombinantproduction of antibodies
                The antibodies and other recombinant proteins herein can be produced by well known
10 techniques of recombinant DNA technology. Thus, aside from the antibodies specifically
   identified above, the skilled practitioner could generate antibodies directed against an antigen of
   interest, e.g., using the techniques described below.
                Antigen selection and preparation
                The antibody herein is directed against an antigen of interest. Preferably, the antigen
15 is a biologically important polypeptide and administration of the antibody to a mammal
   suffering from a disease or disorder can result in a therapeutic benefit in that mammal.
   However, antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated
   glycolipid antigens; see US Patent 5,091,178) are also contemplated. Where the antigen is a
   polypeptide, it may be a transmembrane molecule (e.g. receptor) or ligand such as a growth
20 factor. Exemplary antigens include those proteins described in section (3) below. Exemplary
   molecular targets for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD proteins
   such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD40; members of the ErbB receptor
   family such as the EGF receptor, HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; cell adhesion molecules
   such as LFA-1, Mac1, p150,95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM and u/p integrin including either
25  or f ubunits thereof (             e.g. anti-CD11a, anti-CD18 or anti-CD11b antibodies); growth
   factors such as VEGF; IgE; blood group antigens; fik2/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB) receptor;
   mpl receptor; CTLA-4; protein C, or any of the other antigens mentioned herein. Antigens
   to which the antibodies listed above bind are specifically included within the scope herein.
                Soluble antigens or fragments thereof, optionally conjugated to other molecules, can
30 be used as immunogens for generating antibodies. For transmembrane molecules, such as
   receptors, fragments of these (e.g. the extracellular domain of a receptor) can be used as the
   immunogen. Alternatively, cells expressing the transmembrane molecule can be used as the
   immunogen. Such cells can be derived from a natural source (e.g. cancer cell lines) or may
                                                              53

   be cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques to express the
   transmembrane molecule.
                Other antigens and forms thereof useful for preparing antibodies will be apparent to
   those in the art.
 5              Polyclonalantibodies
                Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc)
   or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to
   conjugate the antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g.,
   keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin
10 inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl
   sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide
   (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl 2 , or RIN=C=NR, where
   R and R1 are different alkyl groups.
                Animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives
15 by combining, e.g., 100 [tg or 5 [tg of the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or mice,
   respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution
   intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with 1/5 to 1/10 the
   original amount of antigen or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous
   injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is
20 assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably, the
   animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen, but conjugated to a different
   protein and/or through a different cross-linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in
   recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are
   suitably used to enhance the immune response.
25              Monoclonal antibodies
                Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by
   Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S.
   Patent No. 4,816,567).
                In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster
30 or macaque monkey, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that
   produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used
   for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes
   then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol,
                                                         54
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice,pp.59
    103 (Academic Press, 1986)).
                The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium
   that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the
 5 unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the
   enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture
   medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine
   (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.
                Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level
10 production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a
   medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine
   myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-1 1 mouse tumors available
   from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or
   X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,
15 Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have
   been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J Immunol.,
    133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and
   Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).
                Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of
20 monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of
   monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation
   or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked
   immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).
                After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity,
25 affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and
   grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice,
   pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for
   example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in
   vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.
30              The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the
   culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification
   procedures such as, for example, Protein A-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel
                                                         55
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. Preferably the Protein A
   chromatography procedure described herein is used.
                DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using
   conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding
 5 specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The
   hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be
   placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells,
   simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not
   otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies
10 in the recombinant host cells.
                The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for
   human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine
   sequences (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison, et al., Proc.Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851
   (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the
15 coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide.
                Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant
   domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen
   combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen
   combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having
20 specificity for a different antigen.
                In a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies can be isolated from antibody phage
   libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554
   (1990). Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581
   597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage
25 libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human
   antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as
   combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large
   phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., Nuc. Acids. Res., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these
   techniques are viable alternatives to traditional hybridoma techniques for isolation of
30 monoclonal antibodies.
                Humanized and human antibodies
                A humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a
   source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as
                                                      56
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain.
   Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers
   (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988);
   Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR
 5 sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such
   "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567) wherein
   substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the
   corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are
   typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are
10 substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.
                The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making
   the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called
   "best-fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened
   against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence
15 which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human FR for the humanized
   antibody (Sims et al., J Immunol., 151:2296 (1993)). Another method uses a particular
   framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular
   subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different
   humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al.,
20 J Immnol., 151:2623 (1993)).
                It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for
   the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a
   preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental
   sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the
25 parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are
   commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are
   available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures
   of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits
   analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin
30 sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate
   immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined
   from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as
                                                           57
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are
   directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.
                Alternatively, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are
   capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the
 5 absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that
   the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric
   and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production.
   Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice
   will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge.          See, e.g.,
10 Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature,
   362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immuno., 7:33 (1993); and Duchosal et al.,
   Nature 355:258 (1992). Human antibodies can also be derived from phage-display libraries
   (Hoogenboom et al., J Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581-597
   (1991); Vaughan et al., Nature Biotech 14:309 (1996)).
15              Antibodyfragments
                Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments.
   Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see,
   e.g., Morimoto et al., Journalof Biochemical and BiophysicalMethods 24:107-117 (1992)
   and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced
20 directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from
   the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be
   directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab') 2 fragments (Carter et
   al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab') 2 fragments
   can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the
25 production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other
   embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv) (see WO
   93/16185).
                Multispecific antibodies
                Multispecific antibodies have binding specificities for at least two different antigens.
30 While such molecules normally will only bind two antigens (i.e. bispecific antibodies,
   BsAbs), antibodies with additional specificities such as trispecific antibodies are
   encompassed by this expression when used herein.
                                                          58
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

                Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production
   of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin
   heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et
   al., Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin
 5 heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10
   different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure.
   Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps,
   is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in
   WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J, 10:3655-3659 (1991).
10              According to another approach described in W096/2701 1, the interface between a pair
   of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which
   are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part
   of the CH3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino
   acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side
15 chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of identical or similar size to
   the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by
   replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This
   provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end
   products such as homodimers.
20              Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For
   example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to
   biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to
   unwanted cells (US Patent No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO
   91/00360, WO 92/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using
25 any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the
   art, and are disclosed in US Patent No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking
   techniques.
                Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also
   been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using
30 chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein
   intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab') 2 fragments. These fragments
   are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize
   vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated
                                                         59
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives
   is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with
   an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The
   bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of
 5 enzymes.
                Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from E. coli,
   which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J Exp. Med.,
   175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab') 2
   molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed
10 chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus
   formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T
   cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human
   breast tumor targets.
                Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly
15 from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies
   have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553
   (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab'
   portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced
   at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody
20 heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers.
   The "diabody" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
   90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody
   fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a
   light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the
25 two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are
   forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby
   forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody
   fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et
   al., J Immunol., 152:5368 (1994). Alternatively, the antibodies can be "linear antibodies" as
30 described in Zapata et al., ProteinEng. 8(10):1057-1062 (1995). Briefly, these antibodies
   comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which form a pair of antigen
   binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.
                                                          60
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

                Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific
   antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J Immunol. 147: 60 (1991).
                Immunoadhesins
                The simplest and most straightforward immunoadhesin design combines the binding
 5 domain(s) of the adhesin (e.g. the extracellular domain (ECD) of a receptor) with the hinge
   and Fc regions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. Ordinarily, when preparing the
   immunoadhesins of the present invention, nucleic acid encoding the binding domain of the
   adhesin will be fused C-terminally to nucleic acid encoding the N-terminus of an
   immunoglobulin constant domain sequence, however N-terminal fusions are also possible.
10              Typically, in such fusions the encoded chimeric polypeptide will retain at least
   functionally active hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of the constant region of an immunoglobulin
   heavy chain. Fusions are also made to the C-terminus of the Fc portion of a constant domain,
   or immediately N-terminal to the CHI of the heavy chain or the corresponding region of the
   light chain. The precise site at which the fusion is made is not critical; particular sites are
15 well known and may be selected in order to optimize the biological activity, secretion, or
   binding characteristics of the immunoadhesin.
                In a preferred embodiment, the adhesin sequence is fused to the N-terminus of the Fc
   domain of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG 1 ). It is possible to fuse the entire heavy chain constant
   region to the adhesin sequence. However, more preferably, a sequence beginning in the
20 hinge region just upstream of the papain cleavage site which defines IgG Fc chemically (i.e.
   residue 216, taking the first residue of heavy chain constant region to be 114), or analogous
   sites of other immunoglobulins is used in the fusion. In a particularly preferred embodiment,
   the adhesin amino acid sequence is fused to (a) the hinge region and CH2 and CH3 or (b) the
   CHI,     hinge, CH2 and            CH3 domains, of an IgG heavy chain.
25              For bispecific immunoadhesins, the immunoadhesins are assembled as multimers, and
   particularly as heterodimers or heterotetramers. Generally, these assembled
   immunoglobulins will have known unit structures. A basic four chain structural unit is the
   form in which IgG, IgD, and IgE exist. A four chain unit is repeated in the higher molecular
   weight immunoglobulins; IgM generally exists as a pentamer of four basic units held together
30 by disulfide bonds. IgA globulin, and occasionally IgG globulin, may also exist in multimeric
   form in serum. In the case of multimer, each of the four units may be the same or different.

   schematically diagrammed below:

   chain is obtained. In this embodiment, the adhesin sequences are fused to the 3' end of an
   immunoglobulin heavy chain in each arm of an immunoglobulin, either between the hinge
   and the CH2 domain, or between the CH2 and CH3 domains. Similar constructs have been
   reported by Hoogenboom, et al., Mol. Immunol. 28:1027-1037 (1991).
25              Although the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain is not required in the
   immunoadhesins of the present invention, an immunoglobulin light chain might be present
   either covalently associated to an adhesin-immunoglobulin heavy chain fusion polypeptide,
   or directly fused to the adhesin. In the former case, DNA encoding an immunoglobulin light
   chain is typically coexpressed with the DNA encoding the adhesin-immunoglobulin heavy
30 chain fusion protein. Upon secretion, the hybrid heavy chain and the light chain will be
   covalently associated to provide an immunoglobulin-like structure comprising two disulfide
   linked immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs. Methods suitable for the preparation
                                                           62

   of such structures are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567, issued 28 March
    1989.
                Immunoadhesins are most conveniently constructed by fusing the cDNA sequence
   encoding the adhesin portion in-frame to an immunoglobulin cDNA sequence. However, fusion
 5 to genomic immunoglobulin fragments can also be used (see, e.g. Aruffo et al., Cell 61:1303
    1313 (1990); and Stamenkovic et al., Cell 66:1133-1144 (1991)). The latter type of fusion
   requires the presence of Ig regulatory sequences for expression. cDNAs encoding IgG heavy
   chain constant regions can be isolated based on published sequences from cDNA libraries
   derived from spleen or peripheral blood lymphocytes, by hybridization or by polymerase chain
10 reaction (PCR) techniques. The cDNAs encoding the "adhesin" and the immunoglobulin parts
   of the immunoadhesin are inserted in tandem into a plasmid vector that directs efficient
   expression in the chosen host cells.

10
                Generationof Cell CultureFluid (CCF)
                In order to generate ocrelizumab CCF for the various reduction studies, a
   representative small-scale fermentation process was utilized similar to the methods described
   previously (Chaderjian et al., 2005). Briefly, 3 liter glass stirred-tank Applikon@ bioreactors
15 fitted with pitched blade impellers were used for the inoculum-train and production cultures
   with the ocrelizumab media components. The bioreactors were outfitted with calibrated
   dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and temperature probes. DO, pH, temperature, and agitation rate
   were controlled using digital control units to the defined parameters of the ocrelizumab
   manufacturing process. The working volume for both the inoculum-train and production
20 cultures was 1.5 L. Daily samples were analyzed on a NOVA Bioprofile blood gas analyzer
   to ensure the accuracy of the on-line value for pH and dissolved oxygen as well as to monitor
   the glucose, lactate, ammonium, glutamine, glutamate, and sodium concentrations in the
   cultures. Daily samples were also taken to monitor cell growth, viability, and titer. Cell
   growth was measured both by viable cell counts using a ViCell as well as on a packed cell
25 volume (PCV) basis. Culture viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion on a ViCell
   instrument. Supernatant samples were assayed by an HPLC-based method to measure
   ocrelizumab titer values.
                Harvested Cell Culture Fluid (HCCF) Preparation
30              Complete lysis of CCF was achieved by high pressure homogenization using a
   Microfluidics HC-8000 homogenizer. The pressure regulator of the instrument was set to
   4,000-8,000 psi, and the CCF was pulled in through the homogenizer to obtain complete cell
   lysis (membrane breakage) after a single pass. The CCF homogenate was collected once
                                                       64
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   water was purged through the system. The homogenate was transferred to centrifuge bottles
   and centrifuged in a Sorval RC-3B rotor centrifuge at 4,500 rpm for 30 minutes at 20 OC.
   The centrate was decanted and then depth filtered followed by 0.22 tm sterile filtration using
   a peristaltic pump with silicon tubing to generate the final HCCF from the homogenized CCF
 5 (100% cell lysis). Alternatively, the CCF was centrifuged straight from the fermentor
   without any homogenization and then the centrate was filtered with a sterile 0.22 pm filter to
   generate the HCCF.
                Mini-tank Handling
10              A laminar flow hood was used in handling all mini-tanks and all materials used in the
   HCCF incubation experiments were either autoclaved or rinsed using 70% isopropanol to
   minimize bacterial contamination.

   (1992), which are hereby incorporated by reference.
                Dialvsis Experiment
                A dialysis experiment was carried out in order to determine whether the components
20 causing reduction of ocrelizumab were small molecules or macromolecules (i.e. enzymes).
   A sample of 3 mL of purified and formulated ocrelizumab (30.2 mg/mL) was dialyzed
   against 1 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM pH 7.2) for 24 hours and the PBS was
   changed after 8 hours. The concentration of the ocrelizumab sample was then adjusted to 1
   mg/mL using the absorbance at 280 nm. Aliquots were stored at -70 0 C prior to use.
25 Dialysis tubing was hydrated overnight in a 0.05% azide solution and rinsed with sterile
   water prior to use. The HCCF obtained from homogenization of CCF from a 3-L fermentor
   was thawed and filtered through a 0.22 pm Millipak filter using a peristaltic pump. Six short
   mini-tanks were filled with 30 mL of HCCF each. To each mini-tank, 500 pL of
   ocrelizumab sample in sealed dialysis tubing was added. The mini-tanks were sealed and
30 loaded into a bench top mixer (Barnstead Lab-Line MAX           Q 4000)  operating at 35 rpm and
   ambient temperature. For each time-point, one mini-tank was removed from the mixer, and
   aliquots of the HCCF (in the mini-tank) and ocrelizumab sample (in the dialysis bag) were
                                                        65

   taken and stored at -70 'C until analyzed with the free thiol assay and the Bioanalyzer assay
   (described below).
                Test Inhibitorsfor Reduction in a Small-Scale In Vitro System
 5              A tall mini-tank was filled with 27 mL of HCCF. Depending on the experiment
   design, various reagents (NADPH, G6P, inhibitors of G6PD or TrxR) were added to the
   desired concentration, and the final volume in the mini-tank was brought to 30 mL with PBS
   (10 mM pH 7.2). The mini-tanks were sealed and loaded into a bench top mixer running at
   35 rpm and ambient temperature. At each-time point for sampling, the exteriors of the mini
10 tanks were sterilized with 70% IPA and opened in a laminar flow hood for the removal of an
   aliquot. The mini-tanks were then re-sealed and loaded back into the bench top mixer. All
   aliquots were stored at -70 'C until analyzed with the free thiol assay and Bioanalyzer assay
   (described below).
15              In vitro Trx/TrxRreductase Studies
                A commercial TrxR (rat liver) solution (4 pM) was diluted with water to yield a 2.86
   pM solution. Lyophilized Trx (human) was reconstituted with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.2)
   yielding a 500 pM solution. A solution of 20 mM NADPH and 10 mM ATG and ATM
   solutions were prepared in water.
20              In a black polypropylene 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tube, 437 pL PBS, 25 pL NADPH,
    16 pL formulated ocrelizumab solution (30.2 mg/mL) and 5 pL Trx were gently mixed. The
   reaction was initiated by the addition of 17.5 pL TrxR. The reaction was incubated at room
   temperature for 24 hours. Aliquots of 20 pL were taken at each sampling time-point and
   stored at -70 'C until analyzed by the Bioanalyzer assay (see below). Controls were
25 performed to determine if the enzymatic pathway was active when an enzyme was omitted by
   substituting an equal volume of PBS for either Trx and/or TrxR in the reaction mixture.
                Inhibition of the Trx system was demonstrated using the same reaction conditions
   described above with the addition of 5 pL ATG or ATM. To demonstrate the inhibition of
   Trx system by Cu2+, 2.5 pL of CuSO 4 (10 mM) was added to reaction mixture using the same
30 enzymes but a different buffer (10 mM histidine, 10 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 137 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
   KCl, pH 7.0) to prevent formation of insoluble Cu 3 (PO 4 ) 2 .

                Free Thiol Assa
                A standard curve using GSH was generated in PBS (10 mM, pH 6.00.05). From a
    110 mM GSH solution, standards were prepared at concentrations of 0, 5.5, 11, 22, 44, 55,
    110 and 550 pM through serial dilution. From an acetonitrile stock solution of mBB (10 mM
 5 stored at -20 'C), a 100 pM solution of mBB was prepared in PBS (10 mM, pH 10.00.05)
   and stored away from light.
                In a black, flat bottomed 96 well plate, 100 pL of mBB was dispensed into each well.
   For the standard curve, 10 pL of standard GSH solution was added yielding a working pH of
   8.0  0.2. For samples, 10 pL of sample was added to the wells. All wells were prepared in
10 triplicate. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark then read using
   a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax@ Gemini XS) with an excitation
   wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm. A linear standard curve was
   generated using the average result of the three standard wells plotted versus GSH
   concentration. Free thiol levels in samples were calculated from the linear equation of the
15 standard curve using the average value of the three sample wells.
                Bioanalyzer Assay
                Capillary electrophoresis measurements were acquired using the Agilent 2100
   Bioanalyzer. Sample preparation was carried out as described in the Agilent Protein 230
20 Assay Protocol (manual part number G2938-90052) with minor changes. HCCF samples
   were diluted, 1:4 and Protein A samples werediluted to 1.0 g/L with water prior to
   preparation. For HCCF samples at the denaturing step, 24 pL of a 50 mM iodoacetamide
   (IAM), 0.5% SDS solution was added in addition to the 2 pL of denaturing solution
   provided. For Protein A samples, 0.5% SDS with no IAM and 2 pL of denaturing solution
25 were used. Digital gel-like images were generated using Agilent 2100 Expert software.
                Stock Solutions for HCCF Hold Time Studies
                Three separate stock solutions were used in the lab scale HCCF hold time studies: (1)
   250 mM stock solution of EDTA (pH 7.4) prepared using EDTA, disodium dihydrate
30 (Mallinckrodt, cat. # 7727-06 or Sigma, cat. # E-5134) and EDTA, tetrasodium dihydrate
   (Sigma, cat. #E-6511), (2) 50 mM stock solution of cupric sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO 4 ,
   Sigma, cat. # C-8027), and (3) 1 M acetic acid solution (Mallinckrodt, cat. # V193).
                                                          67
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

                InhibitorAdditions and Cell CultureFluid (CCF) Blending
                A stock solution of either 250 mM EDTA or 50 mM CuSO 4 was added to the CCF
   prior to homogenization to evaluate a range of final concentrations to prevent antibody
   disulfide reduction. Once the final HCCF was generated from the homogenized CCF, these
 5 solutions were then mixed with the HCCF generated from the non-homogenized CCF (also
   containing EDTA or CuSO 4 ) in order to dilute and decrease the total level of cell lysis to
   below the 100% maximum. Alternatively, a stock solution of 1 M acetic acid was added to a
   final blended HCCF solution (homogenized CCF and non-homogenized CCF) to decrease the
   pH of the solution to prevent antibody disulfide reduction.
10              Approximately 30 - 50 mL of each HCCF solution (containing EDTA, CuSO 4 , acetic
   acid, or no addition for the control) was held in a 50 mL 316L stainless steel vial. The vial
   was sealed with a clamp, and the solution was not aerated or agitated. The vial was stored at
   room temperature (18 - 22 C). At pre-determined time points, the solution was removed
   and purified over a lab scale protein A affinity resin.
15              Similar results can be obtained with other oxidizing agents, such as, for example,
   cystine and oxidized glutathione.
                Air Sparging
                To evaluate air sparging of the HCCF generated from homogenized CCF to prevent
20 antibody disulfide reduction, 3-L glass or 15-L stainless steel vessels were utilized.
   Approximately 1-5 L of HCCF was 0.22 pLm sterile filtered into each sterilized vessel.
   Experimental conditions were maintained at 18-22'C and 50 (15-L fermentor) or 275 rpm (3
   L fermentor) agitation either with or without pH control by the addition of carbon dioxide.
   Solutions were either sparged with air to increase the dissolved oxygen level to air saturation
25 or with nitrogen (control) to remove any dissolved oxygen in solution. Gas flow to each
   vessel was variable dependent upon whether a constant aeration rate was used or a minimum
   level of dissolved oxygen was maintained. At pre-determined time points, 25-50 mL samples
   were removed from both vessels and purified over a lab scale protein A affinity resin prior to
   analysis.

                ProteinA Processing
                Antibody in harvested cell culture fluid samples can be captured and purified using a
   specific affinity chromatography resin. Protein A resin (Millipore, Prosep-vA High
                                                         68
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   Capacity) was selected as the affinity resin for antibody purification. The resin was packed
   in a 0.66 cm inner diameter glass column (Omnifit@) with a 14 cm bed height resulting in a
   4.8 mL final column volume. Chromatography was performed using an AKTA Explorer 100
   chromatography system (GE Healthcare).
 5              The resin was exposed to buffers and HCCF at a linear flow rate between 350-560
   cm/hr. The resin was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.1.
   For each purification, the resin was loaded between 5 -15 mg antibody per mL of resin. The
   antibody concentration in the HCCF was determined using an immobilized protein A HPLC
   column (Applied Biosystems, POROS A). After loading, the resin was washed with 25 mM
10 Tris, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M TMAC, pH 7.1, and then the antibody was eluted
   using 0.1M acetic acid, pH 2.9. Elution pooling was based on UV absorbance at 280 nm
   measured inline after the column. The purified elution pools were pH-adjusted using 1 M
   Sodium HEPES to pH 5.0-5.5. After regeneration of the resin with 0. IM phosphoric acid,
   the same or similar packed resins were used for subsequent purification of other HCCF
15 solutions.
                The antibody concentration in the purified protein A pool was measured using UV
   spectrometry at 280 nm. The purified protein A elution pools were analyzed by the
   Bioanalyzer assay to quantitate the percentage of intact antibody at 150 kDa molecular
   weight.
20
                Example 2
                Dialysis Experiment
                A dialysis experiment was designed and carried out to determine if the reduction of
   ocrelizumab was caused by small reducing molecules or macromolecules (e.g., enzymes). In
25 this dialysis experiment, purified intact ocrelizumab was placed in a dialysis bag with a
   molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 7000 and incubated the dialysis bag in HCCF
   containing ocrelizumab in a stainless steel mini-tank. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the
   ocrelizumab inside the bag was not reduced after the incubation period (Figure 1), whereas
   the ocrelizumab outside the bag in the HCCF was significantly reduced soon after the
30 incubation started. This was evidenced by the loss of intact ocrelizumab (~150 kDa) and the
   formation of ocrelizumab fragments (various combinations of heavy and light chains) (Figure
   2). The mass spectrometry analysis of the ocrelizumab in the protein A elution pools from
                                                        69
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   the reduced manufacturing runs indicated that those observed fragments were formed by
   reduction of only the inter-chain disulfide bonds.
                The free thiol measurement showed that no free thiols were present inside the dialysis
   bag at the beginning of the incubation; however the levels of free thiols inside and outside the
 5 dialysis bag become comparable in less than five hours after the incubation started, indicating
   that the small molecule components in the HCCF are fully equilibrated inside and outside the
   dialysis bag (Figure 3). Since the reduction was observed only outside but not inside the
   dialysis bag with a MWCO of 7000 Da, the molecular weight of the reducing molecule(s)
   must be greater than 7000 Da. Thus, an enzymatic reaction is responsible for the reduction of
10 ocrelizumab.
                Example 3
                Reduction of Ocrelizumab (rhuMAb 2H7, Variant A) by Trx/TrxR In Vitro
                The Trx system was tested for its ability to reduce ocrelizumab in vitro by incubating
15 intact ocrelizumab with Trx, TrxR, and NADPH. The Bioanalyzer results indicate that
   ocrelizumab was reduced in vitro by the Trx system (Figure 5). The rate of reduction in this
   in vitro system appears to be slower than that in the HCCF (for example when compared to
   the reduction shown in Figure 2). This is likely due to lower concentrations of the enzymes
   (Trx and Trx-R) and/or the buffer system used in the in vitro reaction because reaction rate of
20 Trx system is dependent on both the enzyme concentrations and buffer systems.
                Example 4
                Inhibitors of the Trx System
                (i) Inhibition of Reduction of Recombinant Antibody by Cupric Sulfate
25              Cupric sulfate is known for its ability to provide oxidizing redox potential and has
   been used in the cell culture processes to minimize free thiol (i.e., minimize unpaired
   cysteine) levels in recombinant antibody molecules (Chaderjian et al., 2005, supra). Cupric
   sulfate was tested for efficacy in inhibiting the Trx system in vitro and the subsequent
   reduction of ocrelizumab. In this in vitro reduction experiment, the buffer system was
30 changed from PBS to histidine sulfate to avoid the formation of insoluble Cu 3 (PO 4 )2 . Figure
   8 shows that ocrelizumab was readily reduced by the Trx system in the histidine sulfate
   buffer (even faster than in PBS buffer). The addition of CuSO 4 to this reaction clearly
   inhibits the ocrelizumab reduction (Figure 9).

                (ii) Inhibition of Reduction of Recombinant Antibody in HCCF by A TG and A TM
                Two commercially available specific inhibitors of TrxR, aurothioglucose (ATG) and
   aurothiomalate (ATM), were tested for their ability to inhibit the Trx system in vitro and the
 5 reduction of ocrelizumab. Both ATG and ATM can effectively inhibit the reduction of
   ocrelizumab in the assay described above (see Figures 6 and 7). The addition of
   aurothioglucose or aurothiomalate, at a concentration of 1 mM to the same reaction mixture
   as described in the caption for Figure 5 effectively inhibited the ocrelizumab reduction as
   shown in the digital gel-like image from Bioanalyzer analysis.
10              If the Trx system was active in the HCCF and reduced ocrelizumab as observed in the
   manufacturing runs resulting in reduced antibody molecules or in the lab scale experiments,
   both gold compounds (ATG and ATM) should be able to inhibit the reduction of ocrelizumab
   in HCCF. Figure 10 shows that ocrelizumab was readily reduced in an HCCF from
   homogenized CCT generated from a 3-L fermentor after a period of incubation. However,
15 the ocrelizumab reduction event was completely inhibited when either 1 mM ATG or ATM
   was added to the HCCF (Figures 11 and 12). These results demonstrated that the Trx system
   is active in the HCCF and is directly responsible for the reduction of ocrelizumab.
                Example 5
20              The Source of NADPH for Trx System Activity and the Roles of G6P and Glucose in
                Reduction Mechanism
                The reduction of disulfides by the Trx system requires the reducing equivalents from
   NADPH (Figure 4). The main cellular metabolic pathway that provides NADPH for all
   reductive biosynthesis reactions is the pentose phosphate pathway. For the antibody
25 reduction event to occur, the enzymes in this pathway must be still active in the HCCF in
   order to keep the Trx system active. At a minimum, the first step in the pentose phosphate
   pathway (catalyzed by G6PD) must be active to reduce NADP to NADPH while converting
   G6P to 6-phosphogluconolactone. In addition, G6P is most likely produced from glucose
   and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) by the hexokinase activity in HCCF. The overall
30 mechanism of ocrelizumab reduction is summarized in Figure 4.
                The reducing activity in the HCCF appeared to be transitory in some cases and may
   be inhibited over time under certain storage conditions or after multiple freeze/thaw cycles.

   HCCF that has fully lost reducing activity provided an opportunity to explore the role of
   NADPH and G6P in the reduction of ocrelizumab by Trx system.
                An HCCF from a large scale manufacturing run (the "beta" run) was subjected to
   several freeze/thaw cycles and used in an experiment designed to measure reduction; no
 5 ocrelizumab reduction was observed (Figure 13) despite its ability to bring about antibody
   reduction seen previously in freshly-thawed HCCF from this same fermentation. NADPH
   was added to this non-reducing HCCF at a concentration of 5 mM and the reduction event
   returned (Figure 14). Therefore, the Trx system is still intact and active in the HCCF where
   reduction no longer occurs, and capable of reducing protein and/or antibody if supplied with
10 cofactors. Additionally, the reducing activity was lost over time as the NADPH source was
   depleted (presumably due to the oxidation of NADPH by all of the reductive reactions that
   compete for NADPH), and not because the Trx system was degraded or inactivated.
                This was verified by another experiment. 10 mM G6P was added to a HCCF that had
   been repeatedly freeze-thawed from the beta run. This G6P addition reactivated the Trx
15 system which subsequently reduced ocrelizumab in the HCCF incubation experiment
   (Figure 15). This demonstrated that the reduction of ocrelizumab in the HCCF was caused
   by the activities of both the Trx system and G6PD. Furthermore, G6PD is still active in a
   repeatedly freeze/thawed HCCF of the beta run; the loss of reduction activity in this a
   repeatedly freeze/thawed HCCF beta run appears to be due to the depletion of G6P, which
20 thus eliminated the conversion of NADP to NADPH.
                In our studies, we have observed that EDTA can effectively inhibit the ocrelizumab
   reduction in the HCCF incubation experiment. As shown in Figure 16, the ocrelizumab was
   reduced after incubating the HCCF from a 12,000 L scale ocrelizumab manufacturing run
   (not repeatedly freeze/thawed and no loss of reducing activity) at ambient temperature for
25 more than 19 hours. However, the reduction was completely inhibited when 20 mM EDTA
   was added to the 12 kL HCCF and held in a separate stainless steel minitank (Figure 17). In
   the first step of glycolysis, the hexokinase catalyzes the transfer of phosphate group from
   Mg2+-ATP to glucose, a reaction that requires the complexation of Mg2+ with ATP
   (Hammes & Kochavi, 1962a & 1962b, supra). Since EDTA is a metal ion chelator,
30 especially for Mg2+, it can be an effective inhibitor of hexokinase. The observation that an
   excess amount of EDTA can effectively block the reduction indicates the involvement of
   hexokinase (i.e. providing G6P) in the mechanism of ocrelizumab reduction. Without being
   bound by this, or any other theory, EDTA blocks the reduction of ocrelizumab by eliminating
                                                       72
   10001428_1 (GHMatters) P82944.AU.3

   the hexokinase activity and thereby reducing the G6P level available for G6PD, and
   subsequently the NADPH level available for the Trx system.
                Although EDTA is every effective in blocking the reduction of ocrelizumab in fresh
   HCCF, it was unable to prevent the reduction of ocerlizumab in the beta run HCCF in which
 5 the Trx system activity was lost then reactivated by the addition of G6P. For example, the
   reduction of ocrelizumab was observed in an HCCF incubation experiment in which 5 mM
   G6P and 20 mM EDTA (final concentrations) were added to the beta run HCCF that had
   fully lost reducing activity (Figure 18). However, no reduction was seen in the control
   incubation experiment in which no G6P and EDTA were added. Without being bound by
10 this or any other theory, the EDTA used in this manner may therefore inhibit neither the Trx
   system nor the G6PD, and may function as an inhibitor for hexokinase, which produces the
   G6P for the G6PD. Without G6P, the Trx system would not be supplied with the necessary
   NADPH for activity.
15              Example 6
                Inhibition of Reduction of Recombinant Antibody by DHEA
                Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as well as other similar G6PD inhibitors,
   effectively blocks G6PD activity (Gordon et al., 1995, supra). G6PD inhibitors also prevent
   the reduction of an antibody in HCCF, for example, ocrelizumab, by blocking the generation
20 of NADPH. The ability of DHEA to inhibit the reduction of orcelizumab is demonstrated in
   an HCCF incubation experiment. Adding DHEA to a HCCF prevents antibody reduction.
                DHEA is typically used in the concentration range from about 0.05 mM to about 5
   mM. DHEA is also typically used in the concentration range from about 0.1 mM to about 2.5
   mM.

                Inhibition of Reduction of Recombinant Antibody by (i) EDTA, (ii) Cupric Sulfate,
                and (iii) Acetic Acid Additions
                Four different HCCFs were stored and held in the stainless steel vials. The solutions
30 were similar in the amount of cell lysis, which were generated by diluting HCCF from
   homogenized CCF with HCCF from non-homogenized CCF. For example, 150 mL of the
   first lysed solution was mixed with 50 mL of the second solution, respectively. The four
   HCCF mixtures evaluated in this study contained either: (1) 20 mM EDTA, (2) 30 pM
                                                       73

   CuSO 4 , (3) 15 mM acetic acid (pH 5.5), and (4) no chemical inhibitor was added for the
   control solution. The ocrelizumab antibody from all four mixtures was purified immediately
   (t = 0 hr) using protein A chromatography and then again after 20 hr and 40 hr of storage in
   the stainless steel vials. Purified protein A elution pools were analyzed by the Bioanalyzer
 5 assay to quantitate the percentage of intact antibody (150 kDa). The results showed that
   greater than 90% intact antibody was present in all four mixtures at the initial time point
   (Figure 19). However, at the 20 hr time point, intact antibody was not detected in the control
   mixture (without any addition) indicating reduction of the antibody disulfide bonds. In the
   three other mixtures, over 90% intact antibody was still detected at both 20 hr and 40 hr time
10 points, demonstrating the prevention of disulfide bond reduction by all three inhibitors tested.
                Example 8
                Inhibition of Reduction of Recombinant Antibody by Air Sparging the HCCF
                One HCCF mixture generated from homogenized CCF was stored and held in two
15 separate 10 L stainless steel fermentors. One vessel was sparged with air while the other vessel
   was sparged with nitrogen gas. The ocrelizumab antibody was purified immediately (t         = 0 hr)
   from the initial mixture using protein A chromatography.          At selected time points, 50 mL
   samples were removed from each vessel and the antibody was purified using protein A
   chromatography. Purified protein A elution pools were then analyzed by the Bioanalyzer assay
20 to quantitate the percentage of intact antibody at 150 kDa.              The results showed that
   approximately 85% intact antibody was present in the initial solution (Figure 20), indicating
   some early reduction of the antibody disulfide bonds prior to exposure to oxygen (i.e. sparged
   air in the fermentor). Once the mixture was sparged with air for two hours, greater than 90%
   intact antibody was measured for the remainder of the 36 hr study.           In contrast, when the
25 mixture was sparged with nitrogen gas, the antibody reduction event continued as measured at 2
   hr (28% 150 kDa peak) and 6 hr (5% 150 kDa peak). These results demonstrated the prevention
   of disulfide bond reduction in the antibody when the HCCF mixture generated from
   homogenized CCF was exposed to oxygen.

20              A commercial TrxR (rat liver) solution (4 pM) was diluted with water to yield a 2.86
   pM solution. Lyophilized Trx (human) was reconstituted with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.2)
   yielding a 500 pM solution. A solution of 20 mM NADPH and 10 mM ATG and ATM
   solutions were prepared in water.
                In a black polypropylene 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tube, 437 pL reaction buffer (10
25 mM histidine, 10 mM Na2SO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, pH 7.0), 25 pL NADPH, 16 pL
   formulated ocrelizumab solution (30.2 mg/mL) and 5 pL Trx were gently mixed. The
   reaction was initiated by the addition of 17.5 pL TrxR. The reaction was incubated at room
   temperature for 24 hours. Aliquots of 20 pL were taken at each sampling time-point and
   stored at -70 'C until analyzed by the Bioanalyzer assay.
30              Inhibition of the Trx system was demonstrated using the same reaction conditions
   described above with the addition of various inhibitors.

                Figure 24 shows a digital gel-like image from Bioanalyzer analysis (each lane
   representing a time point) showing that incubation of intact ocrelizumab ("2H7," a
   humanized anti-CD20 antibody, referred to as "Variant A" above) (1 mg/mL) with 0.1 ptM
 5 TrxR (rat liver), 5 tM Trx (human) and 1 mM NADPH in 10 mM histidine sulfate buffer
   results in the reduction of ocrelizumab in less than one hour.
                2.            In vitro activity of thioredoxin system inhibited bv aurothioglucose
                Aurothioglucose (ATG) was added to the ocrelizumab mixture described above, at the
10 following concentrations: 1 mM; 0.6 ptM (6:1 ATG:TrxR); 0.4 pLM (4:1 ATG:TrxR); and 0.2
   ptM (2:1 ATG:TrxR).
                As attested by the digital gel-like images from Bioanalyzer analysis shown in Figures
   25-27, aurothioglucose added at concentrations 1 mM, 0.6 PM, and 0.4 tM effectively
   inhibits the reduction of ocrelizumab by the thioredoxin system. However, as shown in
15 Figure 28, under these experimental conditions aurothioglucose added at a concentration of
   0.2 ptM cannot inhibit ocrelizumab reduction after 24 hours.
                3.            In vitro activity of thioredoxin system inhibited bv aurothiomalate
                Aurothiomalate (ATM) was added to the ocrelizumab mixture described above, at
20 concentrations of 0.1 mM and 0.01 mM. As attested by the digital gel-like images from
   Bioanalyzer analysis shown in Figures 29 and 30, ATM effectively inhibits the reduction of

25              CuSO 4 was added to the ocrelizumab mixture described above, at concentrations of
   20 pM (4:1 Cu2+:Trx) ; 10 pm (2:1 Cu2+:Trx); and 5 PM (1:1 Cu2+:Trx). As shown in
   Figures 31-33, CuSO 4 effectively inhibits thioredoxin-induced reduction of ocrelizumab at
   concentrations of 20 pM and 10 pM (Figures 31 and 32), but the 5 ptM concentration is
   insufficient to result in a complete inhibition of reduction (Figure 33).

                5.            In vitro activity of thioredoxin system inhibited bv cvstamine
                Cystamine was added to the ocrelizumab mixture describe above at the following
   concentrations: 532 pM (20:1 cystamine:2H7 (Variant A) disulfide); 266 [LM (10:1
   cystamine:2H7 (Variant A) disulfide); 133 pM (5:1 cystamine:2H7 disulfide); and 26.6 PM
 5 (1:1 cystamine:2H7 (Variant A) disulfide). As shown in Figures 34-37, cystamine effectively
   inhibits thioredoxin-induced reduction of ocrelizumab at concentrations of 532 pM (20:1
   cystamine:2H7 (Variant A) disulfide) and 266 pM (10:1 cystamine:2H7 (Variant A))
   (Figures 34 and 35) but the 133 pM (5:1 cystamine:2H7 (Variant A) disulfide) and 26.6 pM
   (1:1 cystamine:2H7 (Variant A) disulfide) concentrations are insufficient to inhibit the
10 reduction of ocrelizumab after 24 hours (Figures 36 and 37).
                6.            In vitro activity of thioredoxin system inhibited bv cvstine
                Cystine was added to the ocrelizumab mixture described above at a concentration of
   2.6 mM. As shown in Figure 38, at this concentration cystine effectively inhibits reduction
15 of ocrelizumab by the thioredoxin system. It is noted that the minimum effective
   concentration of cystine (just as the effective minimum concentration of other inhibitors)
   depends on the actual circumstances, and might be different for different proteins, such as
   antibodies, and might vary depending on the timing of addition. Thus, for example, if
   cystine is added pre-lysis, the minimum effective concentration for antibody 2H7 (Variant A)
20 is about 1.3 mM, for Apomab about 1 mM and for antibody Variant C about 4.5 mM. When
   cystine is added in the cell culture medium, the minimum effective concentration typically is
   somewhat higher, and is about 5.2 mM for 2H7 (Variant A), 6 mM for Apomab and 9 mM
   for antibody Variant C. Usually, for cystine, cystamine and oxidized glutathione (see below)
   the minimum effective inhibitory concentration is about 40x of the antibody concentration (
25 in pM).
                7.            In vitro activity of thioredoxin system inhibited bv oxidized glutathione
   (GSSG)
                GSSG was added to the ocrelizumab mixture described above at a concentration of
30 2.6 mM. As shown in Figure 39, at this concentration GSSG effectively inhibits reduction of
   ocrelizumab by the thioredoxin system. It is noted, however, that the minimum effective
   concentration of oxidize glutathione (just as that of the other inhibitors) depends on the actual
                                                                 80

   circumstances, such as, for example, on the nature of the protein (e.g. antibody) produced and
   the timing of addition. For example, for antibody 2H7 (Variant A) the minimum effective
   concentration is about 1.3 mM for addition prior to lysis.
                8.            In vitro activity of enzvmatic reduction system
 5              Figure 40 shows a digital gel-like image from Bioanalyzer analysis (each lane
   representing a time point) showing that incubation of intact ocrelizumab ("2H7," a
   humanized anti-CD20 antibody, Variant A) (1 mg/mL) with 10 pIg/mL hexokinase, 50 pg/mL
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5 pM thioredoxin, 0.1 pM thoredoxin reductase, 2 mM
                                                  2+
   glucose, 0.6 mM ATP, 2 mM Mg 2, and 2 mM NADP in 50 mM histidine sulfate buffered at
10 pH 7.38 results in the reduction of ocrelizumab in about one hour. Addition of 0.1 mM
   HDEA, a known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor does not inhibit the reduction.
                9.            In vitro activity of enzvmatic reduction system requiresNADPH
                As shown in the digital gel-like image from Bioanalyzer analysis of Figure 41,
15 incubation of intact ocrelizumab (1 mg/mL) with 5 pM thioredoxin, 0.1 pM thioredoxin
   reductase, and 2 mM NADP in 50 mM histidine sulfate buffer at pH 7.38 does not result in
   the reduction of the ocrelizumab antibody. Reduction of ocrelizumab could not occur
   without hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and their substrates to generate
   NADPH.
