                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
20 [0004]     The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I
   motifs) proteins are a family of metalloproteinases containing a number of conserved
   domains, including a zinc-dependant catalytic domain, a cystein-rich domain, a disintegrin
   like domain, and at least one, and in most cases multiple, thrombospondin type I repeats (for
   review, see Nicholson et al., BMC Evol Biol. 2005 Feb 4;5(1):l 1). These proteins, which are
25 evolutionarily related to the ADAM and MMP families of metalloproteinases (Jones GC,
   Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Feb;7(l):25-31), are secreted enzymes that have been linked to
   a number of diseases and conditions including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
   (Moake JL, Semin Hematol. 2004 Jan;41(1):4-14), connective tissue disorders, cancers,
   inflammation (Nicholson et al.), and severe plasmodium falciparum malaria (Larkin et al.,
30 PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000349). Because of these associations, the ADAMTS
   enzymes have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets for a number of pathologies
   (Jones GC, Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Feb;7(l):25-3 1). Accordingly, methods of
                                                   1

   WO 2011/014838                                                           PCT/US2010/044020
   producing large yields of ADAMTS proteins having high specific activities, which are free of
   contaminants such as viruses, BSE, and pathogens like Mycoplasma bacteria, are needed.
    [0005]   For cultivation of cells, particularly eukaryotic cells, and more specifically
   mammalian cells, there is a constant need to use special culture media providing nutrient
 5 substances that are required for efficient growth of cells and for the production of biological
   products, especially biopharmaceuticals, such as, for example, recombinant proteins,
   antibodies, viruses, viral antigens, and virus-like particles. For the efficient production of
   said biological products, it is important to achieve an optimal cell density as well as an
   increase of the protein expression itself in order to obtain maximal product yield.
10 [0006]    Cell culture media formulations have been supplemented with a range of additives,
   including undefined components like fetal calf serum (FCS), several animal derived proteins
   and/or protein hydrolysates of bovine origin as well as protein hydrolysates derived from
   plants or yeast.
   [00071    In general, serum or serum-derived substances, such as, e.g., albumin, transferrin or
15 insulin, may comprise unwanted agents that can contaminate the cell cultures and the
   biological products obtained thereof. Furthermore, human serum derived additives have to be
   tested for all known viruses, including hepatitis viruses and HIV which can be transmitted via
   serum. Moreover, bovine serum and products derived thereof bear the risk of BSE
   contamination. In addition, all serum-derived products can be contaminated by unknown
20 substances. When using serum or protein additives derived from human or animal sources in
   cell culture, there are numerous problems (e.g., the varying quality in composition of
   different batches and the risk of contamination with mycoplasma, viruses or BSE),
   particularly if the cells are used in the manufacture of drugs or vaccines for human
   administration.
25 [0008]    Therefore, many attempts have been made to provide efficient host systems and
   cultivation conditions, which do not require serum or other animal protein compounds.
   [0009]    Such serum-free media have been developed on the basis of protein extracts derived
   from plants or yeast. For example, soy hydrolysates are known to be useful for fermentation
   processes and can enhance the growth of many fastidious organisms, yeasts and fungi. WO
30 96/26266 describes that papaic digests of soy meal are a source of carbohydrate and nitrogen
   and many of the components can be used in tissue culture. Franek et al. (Biotechnology
   Progress (2000) 16, 688-692) describe growth and productivity promoting effects of defined
   soy and wheat hydrolysate peptide fractions.

   [0010]    WO 96/15231 discloses a serum-free medium composed of a synthetic minimal
   essential medium and a yeast extract for the propagation of vertebrate cells and a virus
   production process. A medium formulation composed of a basal cell culture medium
   comprising a rice peptide and an extract of yeast and an enzymatic digest thereof, and/or a
 5 plant lipid for growth of animal cells is disclosed in WO 98/15614. A medium comprising
   purified soy hydrolysate for the cultivation of recombinant cells is disclosed in WO
   01/23527. WO 00/03000 discloses a medium that comprises a soy hydrolysate and a yeast
   extract, but also requires the presence of recombinant forms of animal proteins, such as
   growth factors.
10 [0011]    EP-A-0 481 791 describes a biochemically defined culture medium for culturing
   engineered CHO cells, which is free from protein, lipid and carbohydrate isolated from an
   animal source, further comprising a recombinant insulin or insulin analogue, 1%to 0.025%
   w/v papain digested soy peptone and putrescine. WO 98/08934 describes a serum-free
   eukaryotic cell culture comprising hydrolyzed soy peptides (1-1000 mg/L), 0.01 to 1 mg/L
15 putrescine and a variety of animal-derived components, including albumin, fetuin, various
   hormones and other proteins. In this context, it should be noted that putrescine is also known
   to be comprised in standard media like DMEM/Ham's F12 in a concentration of 0.08 mg/L.
   [00121     The plant and/or yeast hydrolysates, however, are undefined mixtures of
   oligopeptides and other unknown components and contaminants. Moreover, the quality of
20 commercially available lots of hydrolysates varies extremely. As a result, there are large
   variations in the production of recombinant proteins or viral products (a variation of up to a
   factor of three) as a function of the lots of hydrolysates used ("lot-to-lot variation"). This
   drawback affects the proliferation of the cells as well as the protein expression of each cell.
   US 2007/0212770 describes various animal protein-free and oligopeptide-free, chemically
25 defined culture mediums that are useful for the large-scale production of recombinant protein
   biopharmaceuticals.
   [0013]     One ADAMTS family member, ADAMTS13, cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF)
   between residues Tyr 1605 and Met 1606, a function responsible for the degradation of large
   vWF multimers in vivo. Loss of ADAMTS13 activity has been linked to a number of
30 conditions, such as TTP (Moake JL, Semin Hematol. 2004 Jan;41(1):4-14), acute and
   chronic inflammation (Chauhan et al., J Exp Med. 2008 Sep 1;205(9):2065-74), and most
   recently, severe plasmodium falciparum malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009
   Mar;5(3):e1000349).

    [00141   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disorder characterized by
   thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia and microvascular thrombosis that can cause
   various degrees of tissue ischemia and infarction. Clinically, TTP patients are diagnosed by
   symptoms such as thrombocytopenia, schistocytes (fragments of erythrocytes) and elevated
 5 levels of lactate dehydrogenase (Moake J L. Thrombotic microangiopathies. N Engl J Med.

    [00151   In 1982, Moake et al. found unusually large von Willebrand factor (UL-vWF)
   multimers in the plasma of the patients with chronic relapsing TTP (Moake J L, Rudy C K,

15 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1982; 307:1432-1435). The link
   between UL-vWF and TTP gained support with independent findings by Furlan et al. and
   Tsai and Lian that most patients suffering from TTP are deficient in a plasma
   metalloprotease, now known to be ADAMTS 13, that cleaves vWF (Furlan M, Robles R,

   ADAMTS gene family cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Nature. 2001; 413:488
   494). Idiopathic TTP, often caused by autoantibodies inhibiting ADAMTS-13 activity, is a
   more common disorder that occurs in adults and older children and can recur at regular
15 intervals in 11% to 36% of patients (Tsai H M, Lian E C. Antibodies to von Willebrand

20  [00181    Non neutralizing autoantibodies could also inhibit ADAMTS13 activity by inducing
   clearance from circulation (Scheiflinger F, Knobl P, Trattner B, Plaimauer B, Mohr G,

   factor-cleaving protease (ADAMTS-13) in a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic
   purpura. Blood. 2003; 102:3241-3243). Plasma ADAMTS13 activity in healthy adults ranges
25 from 50% to 178% (Moake J L. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic
   uremic syndrome. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002; 126:1430-1433). In most patients with
    familial or acquired TTP, plasma ADAMTS 13 activity is absent or less than 5% of normal
    activity. Without treatment, the mortality rate for TTP exceeds 90%, but plasma therapy has
   reduced mortality to about 20% (Moake J L. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the
30 hemolytic uremic syndrome. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002; 126:1430-1433).

    [0020]    ADAMTS13 cleaves at the Tyr842-Met843 bond in the central A2 domain of the

25  immunochemical detection of molecular abnormalities in type IIA von Willebrand factor.

    Handin R I. Native conformation of human von Willebrand protein. Analysis by electron
    microscopy and quasi-elastic light scattering. J Biol. Chem. 1985; 260:8559-8563).
30  Furthermore, atomic force microscopy confirms that vWF exits in a globular conformation
    under static conditions and an unfolded filamentous state after exposure to shear stress
    (Siedlecki C A, Lestini B J, Kottke-Marchant K K, Eppell S J, Wilson D L, Marchant R E.

   Blood. 1996; 88:2939-2950). This could occur also in vivo when one end of the vWF
   filament is anchored to a surface.
    [0021]    Thrombi of TTP patients consist of little fibrin and mainly of vWF and platelets,
   suggesting vWF-mediated platelet aggregation as a cause of thrombosis (Asada Y, Sumiyoshi
 5 A, Hayashi T, Suzumiya J, Kaketani K. Immunohistochemistry of vascular lesion in
   thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, with special reference to factor VIII related antigen.
   Thromb Res. 1985; 38:469-479). Patients with relapsing TTP have ultra-large multimers in
   the plasma. The UL-vWF multimers accumulate over time because the persistence of the
   inhibitor (Anti-ADAMTS 13 Ab) decreases ADAMTS 13 activity. The UL-vWF multimers
10 are hyperactive and unfold as a result of shear stress causing platelet aggregation, resulting in
   intravascular thrombosis (Tsai H M. Von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS 13, and thrombotic
   thrombocytopenic purpura. J Mol Med. 2002; 80:639-647; Tsai H M. Deficiency of
   ADAMTS-13 in thrombotic and thrombocytopenic purpura. J Thromb Haemost. 2003;
    1:2038-2040; discussion 2040-2035).
15  [00221    It is believed that the presence of hyper-reactive UL-vWF multimers in the plasma
   due to ADAMTS 13 deficiency could be associated with an increased risk of arterial
   thrombosis linked to coronary heart disease.
    [0023]    As ADAMTS proteins have been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions,
   there is a need in the art for methods of large scale production of recombinant ADAMTS
20 proteins having high specific activities, which are suitable for pharmaceutical formulation
   and administration. The present invention provides methods which satisfy these and other
   needs in the art for the production and purification of ADAMTS proteins.
                               BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
25  [0024]    In one aspect, the present invention provides methods of expressing a disintegrin
   and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) protein. In certain
   embodiments, the methods provided herein advantageously result in increased expression
   levels and in the production of ADAMTS proteins with substantially improved activities.
   These improved properties may be achieved, in one example, by supplementing the culture
30 medium used for the expression of ADAMTS proteins with increased levels of various
   components, such as calcium, zinc, or nicotinamide (vitamin B3). In a preferred
   embodiment, the ADAMTS protein is an ADAMTS 13 protein.

    [00251     In another aspect, the invention relates to methods of increasing the expression
    and/or the activity levels of an ADAMTS protein by culturing recombinant cells harboring a
    nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS protein in animal protein-free and chemically defined
    mediums under batch, fed-batch or continuous cell-culture conditions. In some
 5  embodiments, these methods comprise the use of batch, fed-batch, perfusion, or chemostat
    cell-cultivation that may be performed in either cell suspension or cell adherent fashions. In a
    preferred embodiment, the ADAMTS protein is an ADAMTS 13 protein.
    [0026]     In another aspect, the present invention provides methods of reducing the amount of
    activity lost during the purification of an ADAMTS protein. In certain embodiments, the
10  methods comprise supplementing purification buffers with additional levels of calcium and/or
    zinc. In a specific embodiment, the methods relate to stabilizing the activity of an ADAMTS
    protein during ultrafiltration and/or diafiltration steps used during purification. In a preferred
    embodiment, the ADAMTS protein is an ADAMTS13 protein.
     [0027]     In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to methods of producing an
15   ADAMTS protein with increased activity for use in the preparation of a pharmaceutical
     composition. In certain embodiments, these methods comprise the use of animal protein-free
     and/or chemically defined culture mediums under conditions suitable for increased
     expression of an ADAMTS protein having increased activities. In a preferred embodiment,
     the ADAMTS protein is an ADAMTS13 protein.
20   [00281     In a related aspect, the present invention provides animal protein-free, oligopeptide
     free, and chemically defined mediums that are useful for the expression of ADAMTS
                                                                                             protein is
     proteins having high specific activities. In a preferred embodiment, the ADAMTS

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 5  .       Introduction
   [0031]     The ADAMTS proteins (i.e., ADAMTS-1 to ADAMTS-20) are a family of secreted
   zinc metalloproteinases that share a common modular domain organization (for review, see,
   Flannery C.R., FrontBiosci. 2006 Jan 1;11:544-69). All of the ADAMTS protein share a
   common core domain architecture, consisting of a signal peptide, followed by a prodomain, a
10 zinc-dependent metalloproteinase catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a
   thrombospondin type I repeat, a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain (Apte S.S., J Biol
   Chem. 2009 Nov 13;284(46):31493-7). Additionally, all but ADAMTS-4 contain at least one
   more thrombospondin type I repeat domain, and many of the ADAMTS protein contain one
   or more additional ancillary domains. Notably, it has been reported that all ADAMTS
15 protein appear to contain at least one calcium binding site and at least one zinc binding site
   located within the metalloproteinase catalytic domain (Andreini et al., J. Proteome Res.,
   2005, 4 (3), pp 881-888).
   [0032]     Biological roles for ADAMTS proteins have been reported for various diseases and
   conditions, including, Antiangiogenesis, Renal interstitial fibrosis, Bone remodeling, Ovarian
20 folliculogenesis, Atherosclerosis, Urogenital development, and Tumor growth/remodeling
   (ADAMTS-1); Ehler-Danlos syndrome type 7C and Bovine dermatopraxis (ADAMTS-2);
   Arthritis, Atherosclerosis, and Tendinopathy (ADAMTS-4); Arthritis and Glioblastoma
   (ADAMTS-5); Arthritis (ADAMTS-7); Antiangiogenesis, Brain malignancy, Arthritis, and
   Atherosclerosis (ADAMTS-8); Arthritis (ADAMTS-9, -12); Thrombotic thrombocytopenic
25 purpura (ADAMTS-13); and Antithrombosis/stroke (ADAMTS 18) (for review, see, Lin and
   Liu, Open Access Rheumatology Research andReviews 2009:1 121-131).
   [00331    Recombinant ADAMTS13 (A13) has been expressed before in mammalian cells,
   however the specific activity varies widely dependent on the cell culture conditions. It has
   been found that many commercially available culture mediums are not sufficient for
30 expression of A13 with high specific activities, expressed as the ratio of activity, measured by
   FRETS-VWF73 assay, to antigen content, as determined by ELISA. In one aspect, the
   methods provided herein are based on several advantageous findings that allow for cell
   culture expression of A13 having increased levels of total and specific activity.
                                                   9

   WO 2011/014838                                                            PCT/US2010/044020
   [0034]     The studies described herein demonstrate that a certain minimum concentration of
   calcium in the culture medium, about 0.5mM to about 1.5mM, is required for expression of
   active A13. Additionally, it was found that by supplementing the culture medium with
   increased levels of zinc, the resultant expressed A13 protein had higher total and specific
 5 activities. For example, in cultures supplemented with additional zinc at 2 to 3 times the
   normal concentration, as compared to concentrations found in standard chemically defined
   mediums such as DMEM/F12 based mediums, the specific activity of A13 was significantly
   increased. Furthermore, an additional increase in the specific activity of A13 could be
   achieved by increasing the nicotinamide (vitamin B3) concentration from about 2mg/L, as in
10 standard DMEM/F12 based mediums, to about 7 mg/L. By culturing recombinant CHO or
   HEK293 cells in mediums supplemented with additional calcium, zinc, and/or nicotinamide,
   specific activities of at least about 500 mU/pg, 1000 mU/tg, up to about 2000 mU/gg could
   be achieved in large scale expression cultures of recombinant human A13. These levels of
   specific activity for recombinantly produced A13 proteins have not been reported previously.
15 Advantageously, these increased levels of A13 activity were achieved in chemically defined
   medium free of animal derived components, allowing for consistent and reproducible
   expression of ADAMTS proteins on a large scale suitable for production of proteins for
   pharmaceutical formulation. Furthermore, these mediums are even free of recombinant
   proteins, e.g. insulin, resulting in products that can more safely be used in formulations for
20 pharmaceutical administration.
   [0035]     The present disclosure also provides methods that prevent the loss of activity and
   specific activity during standard ultra/diafiltration and other purification steps.
   Advantageously, it was found that by supplementing the buffer used for diafiltration with
   additional calcium and zinc, a significant reduction in the loss of Al 3 activity, as measured
25 by a FRETS-VWF73 assay, could be achieved.
   [0036]     Accordingly, due to the shared structure-function relationship between the
   ADAMTS family of secreted metalloproteinases, the methods provided by the present
   invention allow for the expression of all ADAMTS proteins in cell culture and recovery from
   the cell medium.
30 II.      Definitions
   [0037]     As used herein, the terms "vitamin B3," "nicotinamide," "niacinamide," "niacin,"
   and "nicotinic acid" may be used interchangeably to refer to any member of the B3 family of
                                                     10

   WO 2011/014838                                                            PCT/US2010/044020
   vitamins. Accordingly, any member of this family may be used to supplement medium used
   in the methods of the present invention.
   [0038]     As used herein, an "ADAMTS protein" refers to a polypeptide of the disintegrin and
   metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs family of metalloproteinases. Members
 5 of this family include the human proteins ADAMTS1 (NM_006988), ADAMTS2
   (NM_014244; NM_021599), ADAMTS3 (NM_014243), ADAMTS4 (NM_005099),
   ADAMTS5 (NM 007038), ADAMTS6 (NM_014273), ADAMTS7 (NM_0142727),
   ADAMTS8 (NM_007037), ADAMTS9 (NM_182920; NM_182921; NM_020249),
   ADAMTS10 (NM_030957), ADAMTS12 (NM_030955), ADAMTS13 (NM_139025;
10 NM_139026; NM_139027; NM_139028), ADAMTS14 (NM_139155; NM_080722),
   ADAMTS15 (NM_139055), ADAMTS16 (NM_139056), ADAMTS17 (NM_139057),
   ADAMTS18 (NM_199355; NM_139054), ADAMTS19 (NM_133638), and ADAMTS20
    (NM_025003, NM_175851). ADAMTS proteins include both full-length proteins and partial
   polypeptides that display at least partial biological activity, for example, at least 10%, 20%,
15  30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more of the activity demonstrated by the full
    length protein, in particular the protease activity demonstrated by the full length protein. In
    certain instances, an ADAMTS protein will be post-translationally modified either in vivo or
    in vitro, for example, by enzymatic or chemical means. It is understood that the ADAMTS
    proteins of the present invention include alternatively spliced isoforms, conservatively
20  modified proteins, substantially identical proteins, homologues, and the like.
    [0039]     In the context of the present invention, an ADAMTS protein embraces any member
    of the ADAMTS family from, for example, a mammal such as a primate, human, monkey,
    rabbit, pig, rodent, mouse, rat, hamster, gerbil, canine, feline, and biologically active
    derivatives thereof. Mutant and variant ADAMTS proteins having activity are also
25  embraced, as are functional fragments and fusion proteins of the ADAMTS proteins.
    Furthermore, the ADAMTS proteins of the invention may further comprise tags that facilitate
    purification, detection, or both. The ADAMTS proteins described herein may further be
    modified with a therapeutic moiety or a moiety suitable imaging in vitro or in vivo.
     [0040]    As used herein, an "ADAMTS 13 protein" refers to any protein or polypeptide with
30   ADAMTS 13 activity, particularly the ability to cleave the peptide bond between residues
     Tyr-842 and Met-843 of VWF. In an exemplary embodiment, an ADAMTS13 protein refers
     to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is highly similar to that of
     NP_620594 (ADAMTS13 isoform 1, preproprotein) or amino acids 75 to 1427 of
     NP_620594 (ADAMTS13 isoform 1, mature polypeptide). In another embodiment, an
                                                      11

   WO 2011/014838                                                         PCT/US2010/044020
   ADAMTS13 protein refers to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is highly
   similar to that of NP_620596 (ADAMTS13 isoform 2, preproprotein) or amino acids 75 to
   1371 of NP 620594 (ADAMTS13 isoform 2, mature polypeptide). In yet another
   embodiment, ADAMTS13 proteins include polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence
 5 highly similar to that of NP_620595 (ADAMTS13 isoform 3, preproprotein) or amino acids
   75 to 1340 of NP_620595 (ADAMTS13 isoform 1, mature polypeptide). As used herein, an
   ADAMTS 13 protein includes natural variants with vWF cleaving activity and artificial
   constructs with vWF cleaving activity. As used in the present invention, ADAMTS 13
   encompasses any natural variants, alternative sequences, isoforms or mutant proteins that
10 retain some basal activity. Examples of ADAMTS 13 mutations found in the human
   population include, without limitation, R7W, V88M, H96D, R102C, R193W, T1961, H234Q,
   A250V, R268P, W390C, R398H, Q448E, Q456H, P457L, C508Y, R528G, P618A, R625H,
   1673F, R692C, A732V, S903L, C908Y, C951G, G982R, C1024G, A1033T, R1095W,
   R1123C, C1213Y, T12261, G1239V, R1336W, many of which have been found associated
15 with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). ADAMTS13 proteins also includes
   polypeptides containing post-translational modifications. For example, ADAMTS13 has
   been shown to be modified by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at residues 614, 667, and
   1354, and it has been predicted that residues 142, 146, 552, 579, 707, 828, and 1235 may also
   be modified in this fashion.
20 [0041]    Proteolytically active recombinant ADAMTS13 may be prepared by expression in
   mammalian cell cultures, as described in Plaimauer et al., (2002, Blood. 15;100(10):3626-32)
   and US 2005/0266528, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their
   entireties for all purposes. Methods of recombinant culture of ADAMTS 13 expressing cells
   are disclosed in Plaimauer B, Scheiflinger F. (Semin Hematol. 2004 Jan;41(1 ):24-33, the
25 disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).
    [0042]    As used herein, "one unit of ADAMTS activity" is defined as the amount of activity
   in 1 mL of pooled normal human plasma, regardless of the assay being used. For example,
   when the ADAMTS protein is ADAMTS 13, one unit of ADAMTS13 FRETS-VWF73
   activity is the amount of activity needed to cleave the same amount of FRETS-VWF73
30 substrate (Kokame et al., Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr; 129(1):93-100) as is cleaved by one mL
   of pooled normal human plasma. Conveniently, ADAMTS13 activity may be determined by
   functional assays, such as functional assays employing modified von Willebrand factor
   peptides as substrate for ADAMTS13 (Tripodi et al. J Thromb Haemost. 2008 Sep;6(9):
    1534-41). A preferred method of determining recombinant human ADAMTS13 activity is
                                                   12

   WO 2011/014838                                                              PCT/US2010/044020
   disclosed in Gerritsen et al. (Assay of von Willebrand factor (vWF)-cleaving protease based
   on decreased collagen binding affinity of degraded vWF: a tool for the diagnosis of
   thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Thromb Haemost 1999; 82: 1386- 1389). In
   one embodiment, to be considered as a ADAMTS13 protein as defined above, a polypeptide
 5 or protein must have at least 1%of the vWF cleaving activity of native ADAMTS13. In
   other embodiments, an ADAMTS 13 protein will contain at least 10% of the activity of native
   ADAMTS13. In yet other embodiments, an ADAMTS13 protein will contain at least 5%,
   10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% of the activity of native
   ADAMTS13. The quantity of an ADAMTS13 protein may also be determined by
10 measurement of an ADAMTS 13 antigen, for example using the ELISA method disclosed in
   Rieger et al., (2006, Thromb Haemost. 2006 95(2):212- 20).
   [00431      As used herein, "pg of ADAMTS13" or "pg of ADAMTS13 antigen" means an
   amount of ADAMTS13 which provides the same level of detectable protein by ELISA assay
   as 1 mL of pooled normal human plasma. This is based on published estimates of 1 mg of
15 ADAMTS13 being present in 1 mL of normal human plasma, and is thus an approximate
   measurement.
    [0044]     As used herein, the term "biologically active derivative", when used in the context
   of an ADAMTS protein, also embraces polypeptides obtained via recombinant DNA
   technology. This may include any method known in the art for (i) the production of
20 recombinant DNA by genetic engineering, e.g., via reverse transcription of RNA and/or
    amplification of DNA, (ii) introducing recombinant DNA into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells
   by transfection, i.e., via electroporation or microinj ection, (iii) cultivating said transformed
    cells, e.g., in a continuous or batch-wise manner, (iv) expressing an ADAMTS protein, e.g.,
    constitutively or upon induction, and (v) isolating said ADAMTS protein, e.g., from the
25  culture medium or by harvesting the transformed cells, in order to (vi) obtain substantially
    purified recombinant ADAMTS protein, e.g., via ion exchange chromatography, size
    exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydrophobic interaction
    chromatography, and the like. The term "biologically active derivative" includes also
    chimeric molecules such as e.g. an ADAMTS protein, or functional fragment thereof, in
30  combination with a second polypeptide, e.g., an immunoglobulin Fc domain or an albumin
    domain, in order to improve the biological/pharmacological properties such as e.g., half life
    of the ADAMTS protein in the circulation system of a mammal, particularly a human.
    [0045]      As used herein, the term "ultrafiltration" encompasses a variety of membrane
    filtration methods in which hydrostatic pressure forces a liquid against a semi-permeable
                                                       13

   WO 2011/014838                                                             PCT/US2010/044020
   membrane. Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight are retained, while water
   and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane. This separation process is
   often used for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (103       - 106 Da) solutions,
   especially protein solutions. A number of ultrafiltration membranes are available depending
 5 on the size of the molecules they retain. Ultrafiltration is typically characterized by a
   membrane pore size between 2 nm and 0.05 pim and operating pressures between 1 and 10
   bar, and is particularly useful for separating colloids like proteins from small molecules like
   sugars and salts. In contrast, nanofiltration is another pressure-driven filtration method
   typically characterized by a membrane pore size between 0.5 and 2 nm and operating
10 pressures between 5 and 40 bar. Nanofiltration is frequently used to achieve a separation
   between sugars, other organic molecules and multivalent salts on one hand and monovalent
   salts and water on the other. Generally, ultrafiltration may be performed in either dead-end
   filtration mode or tangential flow filtration (TFF) mode.
    [0046]    As used herein, the term "diafiltration" refers to another membrane filtration
15 method, sometimes referred to as tangential flow filtration (TFF), wherein the liquid is
   pumped tangentially along the surface of an ultrafiltration membrane. Typically, the retentate
   liquid is diluted with diafiltration buffer after passing over the membrane and subsequently
   returned to the membrane in a continuous flow process. Generally, diafiltration may be
   performed in either dead-end filtration mode or tangential flow filtration (TFF) mode. As
20  such, a single system may be used for both ultrafiltration and diafiltration operations, for
    example, to first concentrate the sample using ultrafiltration and then perform buffer
    exchange by diafiltration.
    [0047]    As used herein, the term "polyamine" refers to any of a group of organic compounds
    composed of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen, and containing two or more amino groups. For
25  example, the term encompasses molecules selected from the group consisting of cadaverine,
    putrescine, agmatine, ornithine, spermine and spermidine.
    [0048]    In certain embodiments of the chemically defined culture medium used for the
    expression of an ADAMTS protein, the concentration of the polyamine is present in a
    concentration ranging from about 0.5 mg/L to about 30 mg/L, or from about 0.5 mg/L to
30  about 20 mg/L, or from about 0.5 mg/L to about 10 mg/L, or from about 1mg/L to about 10
    mg/L, or from about 2 mg/L to about 10 mg/L, or from about 2 mg/L to about 8 mg/L, or
     from about 2 mg/L to about 5 mg/L in the medium. In one specific embodiment, the
    polyamine is putrescine at a concentration from about 2 mg/L to about 8 mg/L.

   [00491    As used herein, the term "chemically defined medium" refers to a synthetic growth
   medium in which the identity and concentration of all the components are known.
   Chemically defined mediums do not contain bacterial, yeast, animal, or plant extracts,
   although they may or may not include individual plant or animal-derived components (e.g.,
 5 proteins, polypeptides, etc.). Non-limiting examples of commercially available chemically
   defined mediums include, various EX-CELL@ mediums (SAFC Biosciences, Inc), various
   Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's (DME) mediums (Sigma-Aldrich Co; SAFC Biosciences, Inc),
   Ham's Nutrient Mixture (Sigma-Aldrich Co; SAFC Biosciences, Inc), and the like. Methods
   of preparing chemically defined culture mediums are known in the art, for example in U.S.

   [00501    As used herein, the term "oligopeptide-free culture medium" refers to a protein-free
   medium that does not comprise oligopeptides, such as, e.g., oligopeptides derived from a
15 protein hydrolysate. In one embodiment, the medium does not comprise oligopeptides
   having twenty or more amino acids. In one embodiment of the present invention, the
   medium does not comprise oligopeptides having fifteen or more amino acids. In another
   embodiment of the invention, the medium does not comprise oligopeptides having ten or

20 seven or more amino acids. In another embodiment the medium does not comprise
   oligopeptides having five or more amino acids. In still another embodiment the medium does
   not comprise oligopeptides having three or more amino acids. According to a further

    [0053]      An "expression vector" is a nucleic acid construct, generated recombinantly or
    synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a
    particular nucleic acid in a host cell. The expression vector can be part of a plasmid, virus, or
    nucleic acid fragment. Typically, the expression vector includes a nucleic acid to be
15  transcribed operably linked to a promoter.
     [00541     The term "heterologous" when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid
    indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the
    same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically
    recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to
20  make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region
     from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises
    two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature
     (e.g., a fusion protein).
     [0055]     A "promoter" is defined as an array of nucleic acid control sequences that direct
25   transcription of a nucleic acid. As used herein, a promoter includes necessary nucleic acid
     sequences near the start site of transcription, such as, in the case of a polymerase II type
     promoter, a TATA element. A promoter also optionally includes distal enhancer or repressor
     elements, which can be located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of
     transcription. A "constitutive" promoter is a promoter that is active under most
 30  environmental and developmental conditions. An "inducible" promoter is a promoter that is
     active under environmental or developmental regulation. The term "operably linked" refers
     to a functional linkage between a nucleic acid expression control sequence (such as a
     promoter, or array of transcription factor binding sites) and a second nucleic acid sequence,
                                                      16

   wherein the expression control sequence directs transcription of the nucleic acid
   corresponding to the second sequence.
   [0056]     As used herein, the term "about" denotes an approximate range of plus or minus
   10% from a specified value. For instance, the language "about 20%" encompasses a range of
 5 18-22%.
   III.     ADAMTS Protein Expression
   [0057]     In one aspect, the present invention provides methods of expressing a disintegrin
   and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) protein having high specific
   activity. In one embodiment, the method comprises culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid
10 encoding an ADAMTS protein in culture medium supplemented with at least one component
   selected from calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide (Vitamin B3). In a specific embodiment, an
   ADAMTS protein is expressed in a medium supplemented with at least two components
   selected from calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide (Vitamin B3). In yet another embodiment, the
   culture medium is supplemented with calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide (Vitamin B3). In
15 certain embodiments, the culture medium used for the expression of an ADAMTS protein
   may comprise an animal protein-free, an oligopeptide-free, or a chemically defined medium.
   [00581     In one aspect, methods are provided for the production of an ADAMTS protein. In
   one embodiment, the methods comprise the steps of culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid
   encoding an ADAMTS protein in a culture medium supplemented with at least one of zinc,
20 calcium, and nicotinamide; removing a fraction of the supernatant from the culture;
   performing a centrifugation or a filtration step to remove any residual cells; performing an
   ultrafiltration step to concentrate the ADAMTS protein; and performing a diafiltration step
   with a buffer comprising at least calcium or zinc. In some embodiments, the concentration of
   calcium may be at least about 0.1 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.5 mM, 0,75 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, 2 mM, 3
25 mM, 5 mM or more than 5 mM calcium. In other embodiments, the concentration of zinc
   may be at least about 0.5 jM, 1 gM, 2 pM, 3 pM, 5 FM, 10 pLM or more than 10 jIM zinc. In
    a certain embodiment the harvest, cell free supernatant or the diafiltration buffer contains
    combinations of calcium and zinc in the above mentioned concentrations. In a certain
    embodiment the cut off of the ultra and/or diafiltration membranes can be e.g. about 150 kD
30  or 125 kD or 100 kD or 75 kD or 50 kD or 30 kD or 10 kD or less than 10 kD. In a certain
    embodiment, the ADAMTS protein is ADAMTS 13 or a biologically active derivative
    thereof. In a specific embodiment, the ADAMTS13 protein is a human ADAMTS13 protein
                                                    17

   WO 2011/014838                                                           PCT/US2010/044020
   or biologically active derivative thereof. In certain embodiments, the culture medium used in
   the method may be an animal protein-free, oligopeptide-free, or chemically defined medium.
    [0059]    In one embodiment, the method further comprises a purification step selected from
   the group consisting of ion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography,
 5 affinity chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.
    [00601    In yet another embodiment, zinc supplementation may be provided by addition of a
   protein or polypeptide preparation containing zinc. For example, typical preparations of
   insulin contain zinc at concentrations such that medium supplementation with between about
    1 mg/L and about 10 mg/L insulin would also result in supplementation of about 0.03 tM to
10 about 1.5 tM zinc, as calculated from the detailed monograph for Novolin N InnoLet SubQ,
   recombinant human insulin, which can be found on the Medscape server. Accordingly, in
   one embodiment, culture medium used for the expression of an ADAMTS protein may be
    supplemented with a zinc-containing insulin preparation.
    [0061]    The basal medium, which is supplemented with zinc, calcium, and/or nicotinamide
15  (vitamin B3) as disclosed herein, chosen for culturing the host cell line is not critical to the
   present invention and may be any one of, or combination of, those known to the art which are
    suitable for culturing mammalian cells. Medium such as Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
    Medium, Ham's F-12 Medium, Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium and RPMI-1640 Medium
    and the like are commercially available. The addition of growth factors such as recombinant
20  insulin is optional.
    [00621     In one embodiment, the basal medium used to culture a cell expressing an
    ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) may comprise a mixture of one or more commercially
    available chemically defined mediums, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
    (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 Medium, which has been supplemented with one or more
25  components other than zinc, calcium, and nicotinamide (vitamin B3). Non-limiting examples
    of components that may be used to supplement a commercially available medium include,
    essential amino acids (e.g., glutamine), non-ionic surfactants (e.g., Synperonic), primary
    amines (e.g., ethanolamine), polyamines (e.g., putrescine), trace metals (e.g., iron), and
    buffering agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate). In a specific embodiment, the medium is a BCS
30  medium as provided in Table 1. In another specific embodiment, the medium is a BACD
    medium, for example, BACD-A13 medium.

   [00631     Historically, animal cells have been cultured in media containing animal serum.
   However, such media are incompletely defined and carry the risk of infection. Those in the
 5 art have therefore devised "protein-free" media that are either completely free of any protein
   or at least are free of any protein that is not recombinantly produced. Human serum albumin
   is commonly used as a serum-free culture supplement for the production of recombinant
   proteins. Preferred media include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 6,171,825 and
   6,936,441, WO 2007/077217, and U.S. Patent Application Publication Numbers
10 2008/0009040 and 2007/0212770.
    [0064]    Optionally, a non- ionic surface-active agent such as a polypropylene glycol (e.g.
   Pluronic* F-61 , Pluronic* F-68, Pluronic* F-71, Pluronic* F-108 or a Synperonic*) maybe
   added to the medium as a defoaming agent. This agent is generally applied to protect the
   cells from the negative effects of aeration ("sparging"). The amount of non-ionic surface
15  active agent may range between 0.05 and 10 g/L, preferably between 0.1 and 5 g/L.
    [0065]    The medium of US 6 936 441 is particularly well suited to the culturing of CHO
    cells but may be used with other cells as well. A further suitable medium is the oligopeptide
    -free medium disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2007/0212770 (Baxter International
   Inc., Baxter Healthcare S.A.).

   ADAMTS 13 activity per L of culture per day (U/L/D). In one embodiment, the methods
   provide cultures that yield at least 800U of ADAMTS 13 activity per L of culture per day
   (U/L/D).
            A.      ADAMTS13
10 [0077]     In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for expressing an
   ADAMTS 13 protein having increased total and/or specific activity. Advantageously, it was
   found that by supplementing a growth medium with calcium, zinc, and/or nicotinamide
   (Vitamin B3), ADAMTS 13 polypeptides having high specific activity could be
   recombinantly expressed and recovered from cell culture.
15 [0078]     Methods for the expression of ADAMTS13 are provided in WO 2009/086309, the
   disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. This
   reference describes suitable methods and culture conditions, which may be maintained
   throughout the duration of the culture. As described herein, cell cultures used for the
   expression of ADAMTS13 proteins will generally be maintained at a temperature at or about
20 between 34*C and 37'C and a pH at or about between 6.8 and 7.3.
   [0079]     Ways of monitoring culture temperature and pH are well known in this art and
   generally rely on probes that are inserted into the bioreactor, or included in loops through
   which the culture medium is circulated, or inserted into extracted samples of culture medium.
   Suitable in-line pH sensors include the Mettler Toledo InPro 3100/125/Pt100 sensor (Mettler
25 Toledo Ingold, Inc., Bedford, MA). Ways of altering the specified parameter in order to keep
   it at the predefined level are also well known. For example, keeping the temperature constant
   usually involves heating or cooling the bioreactor or the feed medium (if it is a fed-batch or
   continuous process); keeping the pH constant usually involves choosing and supplying
   enough of an appropriate buffer (typically bicarbonate) and adding acid, such as hydrochloric
30 acid, or alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate or a mixture thereof, to the
   feed medium as necessary. It is possible that the calibration of an in-line pH probe may drift
   over time, such as over periods of days or weeks, during which the cells are cultured. In that
                                                    23

   WO 2011/014838                                                          PCT/US2010/044020
   event, it may be beneficial to reset the in-line probe by using measurements obtained from a
   recently calibrated off-line probe.
    [00801     In one embodiment, the methods comprise culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid
   encoding an ADAMTS13 protein in culture medium supplemented with at least one
 5 component selected from calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide (Vitamin B3). In a specific
   embodiment, an ADAMTS protein is expressed in a medium supplemented with at least two
   components selected from calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide (Vitamin B3). In yet another
    embodiment, the culture medium is supplemented with calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide
    (Vitamin B3). In some embodiments, the culture medium may be an animal protein-free, an
10  oligopeptide-free, or a chemically defined culture medium.
                     1.     Zinc Supplementation
    [00811      Advantageously, it was found that increased ADAMTS13 enzymatic activity and
    specific activity could be recovered from a cell culture grown in a medium supplemented
    with zinc. For example, Example 1, demonstrates that ADAMTS13 protein expressed in
15  culture medium containing 1.432 mg/L ZnSO 4-7H20 (5 gM zinc) has a 40% to 100% higher
    specific activity than ADAMTS 13 protein expressed in culture medium containing only
    0.432 mg/L ZnSO4-7H 2 0 (1.5 gM zinc) (compare, Table 10 and Table 11). Furthermore, this
    effect is reproducible, as shown in Example 2 (compare, Table 13 and Table 14); Example 4
    (Table 16 to Table 19); and Example 5 (Table 20 and Table 21).
20   [00821     Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides methods for expressing
    an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) having an increased specific activity by culturing a
    cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) in a culture
    medium supplemented with zinc, for example, containing at least 2 pM zinc. Similarly, the
    present invention also provides methods for preparing an ADAMTS protein composition
25   (e.g., an ADAMTS 13 composition) having increased total activity or specific activity by
     culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13)
     in a culture medium supplemented with zinc, for example, containing at least 2 jiM zinc.
     [0083]     In one embodiment, a method for expressing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
     with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS 13) protein is provided, the method comprising
30   culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS13 protein in a culture
     medium comprising at least at or about 2 jiM zinc. In another embodiment, the method
     comprises culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS13 protein in a
                                                     24

   WO 2011/014838                                                          PCT/US2010/044020
   culture medium comprising at least at or about 5 ptM zinc. In one embodiment, the culture
   medium contains at or about between 2 pM and 12 pM zinc. In another embodiment, the
   culture medium contains at or about between 5 p.M and 12 M zinc. In yet other
   embodiments, the culture medium may contain at least at or about 2 tiM, or at least at or
 5 about 3 pM, 4 pM, 5 pM, 6 pM, 7 pM, 8         M, 9 pM, 10 pM, 11 pM, 12 pM, 13 pM, 14 pM,
   15 pM, 20 RM,25 pM, 30 pM, or more zinc. Suitable zinc concentration ranges are
   generally determined by cell culture toxicities that may occur in the presence of high
   concentrations of zinc, e.g., at concentrations greater than 20 pM, 25 pM, 30 gM, 40 ptM,
   and the like. As will be understood by the skilled artisan, the extent to which zinc
10 concentrations are inhibitory to a particular culture system will be highly dependent upon,
   among other factors, the type of cell used to express an ADAMTS protein, the components of
   the culture medium utilized, and the operative mode employed for the culture (e.g., batch vs.
   continuous; suspension vs. adherent; chemostat vs. perfusion; etc.). In certain instances,
   higher zinc concentrations may be required where components of the culture medium may
15 sequester zinc from the solution, for example, in cases where the culture medium contains
   albumin. Accordingly, suitable zinc concentration ranges are generally determined by the
   identity of the cultured cells, medium and operative mode employed. One of skill will
   readily be able to determine appropriate upper limits for the use of zinc supplementation
   based on the individual culture system employed.

                          2.      Calcium Supplementation
    [00911         Advantageously, it was found that increased ADAMTS13 enzymatic activity and
15  specific activity could be recovered from a cell culture grown in a medium supplemented
    with calcium. Traditional cell culture mediums, e.g., DMEM/F12, typically contained about
     1 mM calcium. Historically, these high calcium levels were introduced into the medium to
    assist with adherent cell cultures. Nowadays, however, commercially available mediums
    designed for suspension cultures contain significantly lower calcium levels, e.g., about 0.1
20  mM calcium. Such lower calcium levels are relied upon to prevent aggregation of cells
     cultured via suspension methods. It is known that lower calcium levels are sufficient for
    propagating cells in suspension and expressing recombinant proteins, however, the inventors

   [01041     Generally, any calcium salt may be used to supplement the mediums of the

                    3.      Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) Supplementation
    [0105]    Advantageously, it was found that increased ADAMTS13 enzymatic activity and
20 specific activity could be recovered from a cell culture grown in a medium supplemented
   with nicotinamide (vitamin B3). For example, Example 2, demonstrates that ADAMTS13
   protein expressed in culture medium containing 7 mg/L nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has a 60%
   higher specific activity than ADAMTS13 protein expressed in culture medium containing
    only 2 mg/L nicotinamide (Table 13; compare days 4 and 7 with day 11). Surprisingly, this
25  effect is synergistic with zinc supplementation, as expression of ADAMTS 13 in medium
    containing 7 mg/L nicotinamide (vitamin B3) and 5 jM zinc results in a 200% to 300%
    increase in the specific activity of ADAMTS 13 protein (compare Table 14 day 11 with Table
    13 days 4 and 7).
    [01061     Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides methods for expressing
30  an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) having an increased specific activity by culturing a
    cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) in a culture
    medium supplemented with nicotinamide (vitamin B3), for example, containing at least 2
    mg/L nicotinamide (vitamin B3). Similarly, the present invention also provides methods for
                                                    39

   WO 2011/014838                                                            PCT/US2010/044020
   preparing an ADAMTS protein composition (e.g., an ADAMTS 13 composition) having
   increased total activity or specific activity by culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid
   encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) in a culture medium supplemented with
   nicotinamide (vitamin B3), for example, containing at least 2 mg/L nicotinamide (vitamin
 5 B3).
   [0107]     In one embodiment, a method for expressing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
   with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS 13) protein is provided, the method comprising
   culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS13 protein in a culture
   medium comprising at least at or about 2 mg/L nicotinamide (vitamin B3). In another
10 embodiment, the method comprises culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an
   ADAMTS 13 protein in a culture medium comprising at least at or about 7 mg/L nicotinamide
   (vitamin B3). In one embodiment, the culture medium contains at or about between 2 mg/L
   and 10 mg/L nicotinamide (vitamin B3). In yet other embodiments, the culture medium may
   contain at least at or about 2 mg/L, 3 mg/L, 4 mg/L, 5 mg/L, 6 mg/L, 7 mg/L, 8 mg/L, 9
15 mg/L, 10 mg/L, 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, or higher concentrations of nicotinamide (vitamin B3).
    Suitable nicotinamide (vitamin B3) concentration ranges are generally determined by cell
    culture toxicities that may occur in the presence of high concentrations of nicotinamide
    (vitamin B3), e.g., at concentrations greater than 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 40 mg/L, and
    the like. As will be understood by the skilled artisan, the extent to which nicotinamide
20  (vitamin B3) concentrations are inhibitory to a particular culture system will be highly
    dependent upon, among other factors, the type of cell used to express an ADAMTS protein,
    the components of the culture medium utilized, and the operative mode employed for the
    culture (e.g., batch vs. continuous; suspension vs. adherent; chemostat vs. perfusion; etc.). In
    certain instances, higher nicotinamide (vitamin B3) concentrations may be required where
25  components of the culture medium may sequester nicotinamide (vitamin B3) from the
    solution. Accordingly, suitable nicotinamide (vitamin B3) concentration ranges are generally
    determined by the identity of the cultured cells, medium and operative mode employed. One
    of skill will readily be able to determine appropriate upper limits for the use of nicotinamide
    (vitamin B3) supplementation based on the individual culture system employed.

            B.       Host Cells and Vectors
    [0124]    Recombinant ADAMTS proteins can be produced by expression in any suitable
   prokaryotic or eukaryotic host system. Examples of eukaryotic cells include, without
    limitation, mammalian cells, such as CHO, COS, HEK 293, BHK, SK-Hep, and HepG2;
10  insect cells, for example SF9 cells, SF21 cells, S2 cells, and High Five cells; and yeast cells,
    for example Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces cells. In one embodiment, the
    ADAMTS proteins can be expressed in bacterial cells, yeast cells, insect cells, avian cells,
    mammalian cells, and the like. For example, in a human cell line, a hamster cell line, or a
    murine cell line. In one particular embodiment, the cell line is a CHO, BHK, or HEK cell
15  line. In a preferred embodiment, the cell line is a CHO cell line.
    10125]    In one embodiment, the cells may be any mammalian cell that can be cultured,
    preferably in a manufacturing process (i.e., at least 1 liter), to produce a desired ADAMTS
    protein such as ADAMTS 13. Examples include the monkey kidney CV 1 line transformed by
    SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651 ); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells

   subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36:59 (1977)); baby
   hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR, such as
   the DUKX-B1 1 subclone (CHO, Uriaub and Chasin, Proc.NatL. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216
   (1980)); mouse Sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod, 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey
 5 kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC
   CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells
   (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung
   cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor
   (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51 ); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci., 383:44-68
10 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and the human hepatoma line (Hep G2). Preferably, the cell
   line is a rodent cell line, especially a hamster cell line such as CHO or BHK.
    [01261    A wide variety of vectors can be used for the expression of an ADAMTS protein
   (e.g., ADAMTS 13) and can be selected from eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors.
   In certain embodiments, a plasmid vector is contemplated for use in expressing an ADAMTS
15 protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13). In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control
    sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in
    connection with these hosts. The vector can carry a replication site, as well as marking
    sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. The
   plasmid will comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g.,
20  ADAMTS 13) operable linked to one or more control sequences, for example, a promoter.
    [0127]    A preferred method of preparing stable CHO cell clones expressing a recombinant
    ADAMTS protein is as follows. A DHFR deficient CHO cell line DUKX-B 11 is transfected
    with a DHFR expression vector to allow for expression of the relevant recombinant protein,
    essentially as described in U.S. Patent Number 5,250,421 (Kaufman et al., Genetics Institute,
25  Inc.). Selection is carried out by growth in Hypoxanthine/Thymidine (HT) free media and
    amplification of the relevant region coding for expression of the recombinant ADAMTS
    protein and DHFR gene is achieved by propagation of the cells in increasing concentrations
    of methotrexate. Where appropriate, CHO cell lines may be adapted for growth in serum
    and/or protein free medium, essentially as described in US 6,100,061 (Reiter et al, lmmuno
30  Aktiengesellschaft).
    [0128]     In another preferred embodiment, stable HEK293 cells are prepared by transfecting
    with a construct containing a hygromycin selectable marker and selecting transformants by
    antibiotic resistance.

   [01291     The ability of certain viruses to infect cells or enter cells via receptor-mediated
   endocytosis, and to integrate into host cell genome and express viral genes stably and
   efficiently have made them attractive candidates for the transfer of foreign nucleic acids into
   cells (e.g., mammalian cells). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a viral vector is used to
 5 introduce a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) into a
   host cell for expression. The viral vector will comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an
   ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) operable linked to one or more control sequences, for
   example, a promoter. Alternatively, the viral vector may not contain a control sequence and
   will instead rely on a control sequence within the host cell to drive expression of the
10 ADAMTS protein. Non-limiting examples of virus vectors that may be used to deliver a
   nucleic acid include Adenoviral vectors, AAV vectors, and Retroviral vectors.
    [01301    In one embodiment, an Adenovirus expression vector include those constructs
   containing adenovirus sequences sufficient to support packaging of the construct and to
   ultimately express an ADAMTS construct that has been cloned therein. Adenoviral vectors
15 allow for the introduction of foreign sequences up to 7 kb (Grunhaus et al., Seminar in
   Virology, 200(2):535-546, 1992)).
    [0131]    In another embodiment, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) can be used to introduce a
   nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) into a host cell for
   expression. AAV systems have been described previously and are generally well known in
20 the art (Kelleher and Vos, Biotechniques, 17(6):1110-7, 1994; Cotten et al., ProcNatl Acad
   Sci USA, 89(13):6094-6098, 1992; Curiel, Nat Immun, 13(2-3):141-64, 1994; Muzyczka,
    Curr Top MicrobiolImmunol, 158:97-129, 1992). Details concerning the generation and use
    of rAAV vectors are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,139,941 and 4,797,368,
    each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.
25  [0132]     In one embodiment, a retroviral expression vector can be used to introduce a
    nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) into a host cell for
    expression. These systems have been described previously and are generally well known in
    the art (Mann et al., Cell, 33:153-159, 1983; Nicolas and Rubinstein, In: Vectors: A survey of
    molecular cloning vectors and their uses, Rodriguez and Denhardt, eds., Stoneham:

    Plenum Press, pp. 149-188, 1986). In a specific embodiment, the retroviral vector is a
    lentiviral vector (see, for example, Naldini et al., Science, 272(5259):263-267, 1996;

   [01331     Non-limiting examples of vectors for prokaryotic expression include plasmids such
   as pRSET, pET, pBAD, etc., wherein the promoters used in prokaryotic expression vectors
   include lac, trc, trp, recA, araBAD, etc. Examples of vectors for eukaryotic expression
   include: (i) for expression in yeast, vectors such as pAO, pPIC, pYES, pMET, using

   such as pMT, pAc5, pIB, pMIB, pBAC, etc., using promoters such as PH, p10, MT, Ac5,

    [0134]     In certain embodiments, the cell-culture methods of the invention may comprise the
   use of a microcarrier. The present invention provides, among other aspect, methods of large
   scale ADAMTS protein expression. In some embodiments, the cell-cultures of the
   embodiments can be performed in large bioreactors under conditions suitable for providing
15 high volume-specific culture surface areas to achieve high cell densities and protein
    expression. One means for providing such growth conditions is to use microcarriers for cell
    culture in stirred tank bioreactors. In another embodiment, these growth requirements are
    met via the use of a suspension cell culture.
             C.      Cultivation Methods
20  [0135]     In certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention can comprise the use
    of a cell culture system operated under a batch or continuous mode of operation. For
    example, when batch cell cultures are utilized, they may be operated under single batch, fed
    batch, or repeated-batch mode. Likewise, continuous cell cultures may be operated under, for
    example, perfusion, turbidostat or chemostat mode. Batch and continuous cell cultivation
25  may be performed under either suspension or adherence conditions. When operated under
    suspension conditions, the cells will be freely suspended and mixed within the culture
    medium. Alternatively, under adherence conditions, the cells will be bound to a solid phase,
    for example, a microcarrier, a porous microcarrier, disk carrier, ceramic cartridge, hollow
    fiber, flat sheet, gel matrix, and the like.
30   [0136]     A batch culture is typically a large scale cell culture in which a cell inoculum is
    cultured to a maximum density in a tank or fermenter, and harvested and processed as a
     single batch. A fed-batch culture it typically a batch culture which is supplied with either
     fresh nutrients (e.g., growth-limiting substrates) or additives (e.g., precursors to products).
                                                      59

   WO 2011/014838                                                             PCT/US2010/044020
   The feed solution is usually highly concentrated to avoid dilution of the bioreactor. In a
   repeated-batch culture, the cells are placed in a culture medium and grown to a desired cell
   density. To avoid the onset of a decline phase and cell death, the culture is then diluted with
   complete growth medium before the cells reach their maximum concentration. The amount
 5 and frequency of dilution varies widely and depends on the growth characteristics of the cell
   line and convenience of the culture process. The process can be repeated as many times as
   required and, unless cells and medium are discarded at subculture, the volume of culture will
   increase stepwise as each dilution is made. The increasing volume may be handled by having
   a reactor of sufficient size to allow dilutions within the vessel or by dividing the diluted
10 culture into several vessels. The rationale of this type of culture is to maintain the cells in an
    exponentially growing state. Serial subculture is characterized in that the volume of culture
   is always increasing stepwise, there can be multiple harvests, the cells continue to grow and
   the process can continue for as long as desired. In certain embodiments, an ADAMTS
   protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) may be recovered after harvesting the supernatant of a batch
15  culture.
    [01371    A continuous culture can be a suspension culture that is continuously supplied with
    nutrients by the inflow of fresh medium, wherein the culture volume is usually kept constant
    by the concomitant removal of spent medium. In chemostat and turbidostat methods, the
    extracted medium contains cells. Thus, the cells remaining in the cell culture vessel must
20  grow to maintain a steady state. In the chemostat method, the growth rate is typically
    controlled by controlling the dilution rate, i.e., the rate at which fresh medium is added. The
    growth rate of the cells in the culture may be controlled, for example, at a sub-maximal
    growth rate, by alteration of the dilution rate. In contrast, in the turbidostat method, the
    dilution rate is set to permit the maximum growth rate that the cells can achieve at the given
25  operating conditions, such as pH and temperature.
    [0138]    In a perfusion culture, the extracted medium is depleted of cells, which are retained
    in the culture vessel, for example, by filtration or by centrifugal methods that lead to the
    reintroduction of the cells into the culture. However, typically membranes used for filtration
    do not retain 100% of cells, and so a proportion are removed when the medium is extracted.
30  It may not be crucial to operate perfusion cultures at very high growth rates, as the majority
    of the cells are retained in the culture vessel.
    [0139]     Stirred-tank reactor system can be used for batch and continuous cell cultures
    operated under suspension or adherent modes. Generally, the stirred-tank reactor system can

    culture mediums supplemented with zinc at concentrations up to at least about 12 piM
    provided for expression of an ADAMTS protein with increased specific activities (Table 20).
    Notably, in fed-batch cultures supplemented with zinc at a final concentration of 12pM,
                                                                                      activities of
    specific cell growth rates and total activity were unaffected, while the specific
10  the expressed ADAMTS 13 proteins continued to increase. This is in contrast to what was
    seen in experiments employing chemostatic cell-cultivation. In these experiments,
                                                                                of 5 pM resulted in
    supplementation of the culture medium with zinc at a final concentration
    an increase in the specific activity of the ADAMTS13 in the supernatant (Table 21).
    However, at higher levels of supplementation, 8.5pM and 12tM, specific cell growth rates
15   and total ADAMTS 13 protein yields were decreased, although the specific activity of
     ADAMTS 13 in the culture supernatant remained high.

     an animal protein-free, oligopeptide-free, or chemically defined medium.

      [0142]    Advantageously, the present invention provides methods of expressing an
      ADAMTS protein, for example ADAMTS13, with high specific activity in a continuous
      culture. These methods allow for the continued expression and purification of an ADAMTS
                                                                                          found that

    16, 17, 18 months or longer. In some of these embodiments, the level of total ADAMTS
   protein expression, activity, or specific activity is maintained in the culture for an extended
10 period of time. In other embodiments, the specific growth rate, cell density, and the like is
   maintained in the culture for an extended period of time. In some embodiments, the culture
   medium may be supplemented with at least one of calcium, zinc, or nicotinamide (vitamin
   B3), for example, at a concentration according to any one of Var. 1 to Var. 149 (Table 2 to
    Table 9). In one particular embodiment, the method comprises the use of chemostat cell
15  cultivation. In another embodiment, the method comprises the use of turbidostat cell
    cultivation. In yet another embodiment, the method comprises the use of perfusion cell
    cultivation. In certain embodiments, the medium may be an animal protein-free,

                    3.      Culture Conditions
    [01681    Surprisingly, it has also been found that cell viabilities and ADAMTS13 activities
    can be increased by small variations in the temperature and pH of the cell culture. As can be
20  seen in Figure 2, the specific activity of the expressed ADAMTS13 is greatly enhanced when
    cells harboring a nucleotide encoding an ADAMTS 13 protein are cultured at a pH below
    about 7.30. Temperature, although to a lesser degree, is also a factor contributing to
    ADAMTS 13 specific activity in these studies. Similarly, it was found that the volumetric
    productivity of A13 (measured by FRETS-VWF73) in the supernatants of cultures grown at a
25  pH of between about 6.80 and about 7.3 was greatly increased as compared to pH levels
    above and below that range. ADAMTS13 productivity was also affected by the temperature
    of the culture. Maximum activity was found in cultures grown at temperature between about
    34'C and about 37'C.
     [0169]    In other embodiments, the methods of ADAMTS protein expression comprise a step
30  of maintaining the temperature of the culture medium at a temperature of about 34'C and
     about 37'C. In certain embodiments, the culture medium may be maintained at a temperature
     of 36.5'C or less, 36.00 or less, 35.5'C or less, or less than 35.0'C. In a specific
     embodiment, the temperature is maintained at a temperature of about 36'C. In a specific

    embodiment the culture is maintained at a combination of the temperature and pH ranges
    mentioned above, e.g. 36.5'C or less and a pH of e.g. 7.15 or less. In a preferred embodiment
    the culture is maintained at a temperature of 36.0'C and a pH of 7.10.
    [01701     Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods of ADAMTS protein expression
 5  comprise a step of maintaining the pH of the culture medium at a pH of between about 6.8
    and 7.3. In certain embodiments, the pH may be between about 7.0 and about 7.25 or
    between about 7.05 and about 7.15. In certain embodiments the ph may be maintained at a
    pH of 7.20 or less, 7.15 or less, 7.10 or less or 7.05 or less. In one specific embodiment, the
    pH of the culture medium is maintained at a pH of about 7.1.

    ADAMTS protein comprises culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS
    protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) at a temperature at or about between 34'C and about 37'C at a
    pH of at or about between 6.8 and 7.3. In another embodiment, the temperature of the culture
     will be at or about between 350 C and about 37'C and the pH will be at or about between 6.8
15   and 7.3. In another embodiment, the temperature of the culture will be at or about between

    [0174]      The concept of cell-growth on microcarriers was first described by van Wezel (van
    Wezel AL., Nature 1967 Oct 7;216(5110):64-5) and allows for cell attachment on the surface
10  of small solid particles suspended in the growth medium. These methods provide for high
    surface-to-volume ratios and thus allow for efficient nutrient utilization. Furthermore, for
                                                                                               ratio
    expression of secreted proteins in eukaryotic cell lines, the increased surface-to-volume
    allows for higher levels of secretion and thus higher protein yields in the supernatant of the
    culture. Finally, these methods allow for the easy scale-up of eukaryotic expression cultures.
15   [01751     The cells expressing an ADAMTS protein can be bound to a spherical or a porous
    microcarrier during cell culture growth. The microcarrier can be a microcarrier selected from
                                                                                            and

     others as described in Butler (1988. In: Spier & Griffiths, Animal cell Biotechnology 3:283
     303). Therefore, according to one embodiment of the invention cells expressing an
20   ADAMTS protein are cultured on spherical microcarriers. According to another embodiment
     of the invention cells expressing an ADAMTS protein are cultured on porous microcarriers.
     It is also possible to grow the cells to a biomass on a spherical microcarriers and subculture
     the cells when they have reached final fermenter biomass and prior to production of the
     expressed protein on a porous microcarrier or vice versa. Spherical microcarrier are those

      V.       ADAMTS Protein Purification
       [02081     ADAMTS13 is secreted into the plasma in vivo, where it functions to regulate
 30    clotting activity by cleaving large multimers of vWF. The ability of mammalian cells to
       secrete ADAMTS 13 after expression can be exploited during the production and purification
       of ADAMTS13 compositions in cell culture. For example, by expressing recombinant
                                                      87

   WO 2011/014838                                                            PCT/US2010/044020
   ADAMTS13 in mammalian cell culture, ADAMTS13 compositions can readily be recovered
   directly from the culture supernatant without the need to harvest and lyse cells. This permits
   the use of techniques such as continuous cell culture (e.g., perfusion or chemostatic cell
   culture) to produce large amounts of the protein without multiple culture lag and recovery
 5 periods. In one aspect of the invention, methods are provided for the purification of
   ADAMTS proteins having high specific activity from cell culture.
    [0209]     Accordingly, in one embodiment, ADAMTS13 proteins are expressed in culture and
   recovered directly from the culture supernatant. In this fashion, ADAMTS 13 proteins are
   recovered by removing a fraction of the culture and purifying ADAMTS13 away from the
10 other components of the supernatant. Generally, this involves separating any cells that are
   recovered along with the supernatant by filtration or centrifugation and subjecting the
    supernatant to one or more ADAMTS13 purification steps.
    [0210]     U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2005/0266528 and Zheng et al., (2001,
   Blood, 98:1662-1666), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their
15 entireties for all purposes) provide exemplary methods for purifying ADAMTS 13. Purified
   ADAMTS 13 may be formulated according to conventional methods and used therapeutically,
   for example, to treat TTP.
    [0211]     In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for producing an ADAMTS
   protein composition (e.g., an ADAMTS13 composition). In a first embodiment, the method
20  comprises the steps of: (a) culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS
   protein in an animal protein-free culture medium; (b) removing a fraction of the supernatant
    from the culture; (c) performing a filtration or centrifugation step to remove any residual
    cells; (d) performing an ultrafiltration step to concentrate the ADAMTS protein; and (e)
   performing a diafiltration step with a buffer comprising at least about 0.5 pM zinc and at least
25  about 0.1 mM calcium; thereby preparing an ADAMTS composition.
    [02121     In certain embodiments, the step of culturing a cell comprises batch cell cultivation.
    In other embodiments, the step of culturing a cell comprises continuous cell cultivation.
    [0213]     In certain embodiments, the culture medium contains calcium. In a specific
    embodiment, the culture medium contains at least 0.5 mM calcium. In other embodiments,
30  the culture medium contains zinc. In a specific embodiment, the culture medium contains at
    least 2 pM zinc. In yet other embodiments, the culture medium contains nicotinamide
    (vitamin B3). In a specific embodiment, the culture medium contains at least 2 mg/L
                                                      88

   WO 2011/014838                                                            PCT/US2010/044020
   nicotinamide (vitamin B3). In certain embodiments, the diafiltration buffer contains at least
   about 5 pM zinc and at least about 2 mM calcium.
   [0214]     In certain embodiments, less than about 20% of the ADAMTS13 specific activity is
   lost between the end of step (c) and the end of step (e). In other embodiments, less than
 5 about 10% of the ADAMTS 13 specific activity is lost between the end of step (c) and the end
   of step (e). In yet other embodiments, the ADAMTS 13 composition has a specific activity of
   at least about 1000 U/mg. In another embodiment, the ADAMTS 13 composition has a
   specific activity of at least about 1500 U/mg.
            A.      Buffer Exchange
10 [0215]     Typically, when purifying a secreted protein from a culture supernatant, the first
   step of the purification process involves exchanging the culture medium for a buffered
   solution, which facilitates further purification of the protein of interest. Several options exist
   for exchanging the culture medium for a buffer, including without limitation, diafiltration,
   dialysis, buffer exchange techniques, gel filtration, chromatography, and the like.
15  [0216]    It was found that ADAMTS13 protein compositions lost a significant fraction of
   their specific activity during such purification steps that require the introduction of new
   buffers, e.g., diafiltration, dialysis, buffer exchange, chromatography, and similar steps,
   regardless of the length of time between harvesting the supernatant from the culture and the
   purification step. Advantageously, however, the present inventors have discovered that by
20 including zinc and calcium in the buffer being introduced into the system, such as in
   diafiltration, dialysis, buffer exchange, gel filtration, and chromatographic steps, that the high
    specific activities of the ADAMTS 13 composition is retained. As evidence of this, Example
    6 demonstrates that diafiltration of an ADAMTS 13 composition with a buffer lacking
    calcium and zinc results in an average loss of almost 25% of the specific activity of the
25  composition, while inclusion of calcium and zinc almost entirely prevent this loss (Table 22).
    Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for reducing the loss of activity for an
    ADAMTS protein compositions after diafiltration, or similar methods, e.g., dialysis, buffer
    exchange, chromatography, by the inclusion of zinc and calcium into the buffer system.
    [0217]     In one embodiment, a method is provided for purifying an ADAMTS protein (e.g.,
30  ADAMTS 13) composition, the method comprising the steps of (a) culturing a cell harboring
    a nucleic acid encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) in a culture medium; (b)
    recovering a portion of the culture medium supernatant containing an ADAMTS protein (e.g.,
    ADAMTS 13); and (c) exchanging the culture medium supernatant with a buffered solution

   composition. In one embodiment, the culture medium contains zinc, calcium, and optionally
   nicotinamide (vitamin B3). In a preferred embodiment, the step of culturing a cell comprises
   a continuous culture (e.g., perfusion or chemostatic culture). In another preferred

   another preferred embodiment, the culture is maintained at a pH between 6.9 and 7.2.
   [0218]      In one specific embodiment, the step of exchanging the culture medium supernatant
   with a buffered solution comprises the use of a buffer containing at least at or about 0.5 mM
   calcium and at least at or about 0.5pM zinc. In another embodiment, the buffer contains at
10 least at or about 2 mM calcium and at least at or about 5 IM zinc. In certain embodiments,
   the concentration of calcium may be at least about 0.1 mM, 0.3 mM, 0.5 mM, 0,75 mM, 1
   mM, 1.5 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 5 mM or more calcium. In certain embodiments, the
   concentration of zinc may be at least about 0.5 [LM, 1 piM, 2 gM, 3 pM, 5 [LM, 10 pM or
   more zinc. Generally, any combination of the concentrations above is suitable for use in the
15 present methods.
    [0219]     In one embodiment, a method is provided for the buffer exchange of an ADAMTS
   protein composition (e.g., ADAMTS13) by performing the buffer exchange (e.g.,
   diafiltration, dialysis, gel filtration, etc.) with a buffer containing calcium and zinc. In one
    specific embodiment, the method comprises the use of a buffer containing at least at or about
20  0.5 mM calcium and at least at or about 0.5 gM zinc. In another embodiment, the buffer
    contains at least at or about 1 mM calcium and at least at or about 1 pM zinc. In one
    embodiment, the buffer contains at least at or about 2 mM calcium and at least at or about 2
    pM zinc. In another embodiment, the buffer contains at least at or about 2 mM calcium and
    at least at or about 5 pM zinc. In yet other embodiments, the buffer contains between 0.5
25 mM and 5 mM calcium and between 0.5 ptM and 5 pM zinc. In certain embodiments, the

    1.5 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 5 mM or more calcium. In certain embodiments, the concentration of
    zinc may be at least about 0.5 pM, 1 pM, 2 pM, 3 pM, 5 pM, 10 gM or more zinc. In a
    certain embodiment the harvest, cell free supernatant or the diafiltration buffer contains
30  combinations of calcium and zinc in the above mentioned concentrations.

    of an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS 13) after expression in cell culture comprising
    supplementing the cell containing harvest, the cell free supernatant or a diafiltration buffer

   diafiltration buffer contains combinations of calcium and zinc in the above mentioned
10 concentrations.
    [0221]    In other embodiments, the methods provided herein result in a loss of less than 15%
   of the specific activity present during any individual step. In a preferred embodiment, the
   methods provided herein result in a loss of less than 10% of the specific activity after present
   during any individual step. In a particular embodiment, less than 15% of the specific activity
15 present in the recovered culture supernatant is lost during an initial buffer exchange step (e.g.,
   diafiltration or dialysis). In a preferred embodiment, less than 10% of the specific activity
   present in the recovered culture supernatant is lost during an initial buffer exchange step (e.g.,
   diafiltration or dialysis).

    10234]       In order to inactivate various viral contaminants which may be present in ADAMTS
    culture, one or more ADAMTS (e.g., ADAMTS 13) intermediate solutions may be subjected
    to a solvent detergent (S/D) treatment. Methods for the detergent treatment of solutions are

15   10236]      In order to reduce the viral load of an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13)
     composition provided herein, the composition may be nanofiltered using a suitable
     nanofiltration device. In certain embodiments, the nanofiltration device will have a mean
                                                                                                    this

     between 19 and 35 nm, or of at or about 15 nm, 19 nm, 20 nm, 35 nm, or 72 nm. In a
     preferred embodiment, the nanofilter will have a mean pore size of at or about 19 nm, 20 nm,
     or 35 nm, such as an Asahi PLANOVA* 20N or PLANOVA* 35N filter or equivalent

 5  (e.g., ADAMTS13) composition, which may have previously been subjected to
    inactivation or removal steps such as nanofiltration, may be further reduced by heat treatment
    of the lyophilized composition. Heat treatments for the inactivation of viral loads in blood
    factors are well known in the art (for example, see, Piszkiewicz et al., Thromb Res. 1987 Jul
     15;47(2):235-41; Piszkiewicz et al., Curr Stud Hematol Blood Transfus. 1989;(56):44-54;

    VI.      ADAMTS Compositions
     [02381    Advantageously, it has been found that ADAMTS proteins, such as ADAMTS13,
     expressed in cell cultures supplemented with zinc, calcium, and/or nicotinamide (vitamin B3)

     specific activities. For example, continuous cell culture methods provided
     the expression of greater than 1 mg ADAMTS 13 per liter per day with specific activities of
     greater than 1000 U/mg for more than a week or longer. Similarly, methods for reducing the
     loss of activity typically encountered during the purification of ADAMTS 13 protein are also

      compositions (e.g., ADAMTS 13 compositions) expressed in cell culture according
      methods provided herein. For example, ADAMTS protein compositions are provided,
      wherein the protein is expressed by culturing a cell harboring a nucleic acid encoding an
25    ADAMTS protein in culture medium supplemented with at least one component selected
      from calcium, zinc, and nicotinamide (Vitamin B3). Also provided, are ADAMTS protein
      compositions (e.g., ADAMTS 13 compositions) that are purified according to a method
                                                                                          have been

15 VII.     Examples
   Example 1
    [0253]    Fed-batch experiments were performed using bioreactor cultures of the recombinant
   HEK293 cell line 1020/1 013-2 expressing human ADAMTS13 in chemically defined
   BACD-A13 medium. The effect of supplementing the culture medium with additional zinc
20 was investigated.
    [02541    Recombinant HEK293 cells expressing human ADAMTS13 were cultivated by fed
   batch cell-cultures in 1.5 L bioreactors with blade impellers under an inline controlled pH of
   7.20 at 37'C with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 20% air saturation. Cell suspension
   was transferred to 2 identical bioreactors containing a DMEM/F 12 based chemically defined
25 culture medium (BACD-A13; Table 12). The two cultures were grown in BACD-A13
   mediums prepared with either 0.432 mg/L ZnSO 4-7H 2 0, as in DMEM/F12, or with an
    additional supplementation of 1 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 20 for a final concentration of 1.432 mg/L.
    The two fed-batch cultures were otherwise treated the same and thus may be compared
    directly to one another.
30  [0255]     The activity of A13 in culture supernatants were measured by FRETS-VWF73
    assay after centrifuging or filtering the supernatants to remove residual cells. The total
    amount of A13 was measured by ELISA, using an A13-specific antibody (Table 10).

   Supernatant from the culture employing BACD-A13 medium with a standard DMEM/F12
   zinc concentration had an A13 activity of 728 and 826 mU/mL on days 3 and 6, respectively.
   Specific activities for the cultures were 482 mU/gg and 526 mU/pg A13, respectively. In
   contrast, supernatants from cultures having additional supplementation of Zn, while having
 5 only slightly improved yields of A13 expression (7% and 19% greater at days 3 and 6,
   respectively), showed dramatically improved total and specific activities A13 activities
   (Table 11). As can be seen by comparing the results in Table 10 and Table 11, total A13
   FRETS-VWF73 activity was 118% higher (1589 vs. 728) at day 3 and 61% higher (1381 vs.
   728) at day 6 for cultures grown in the presence of 1.432 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 2 0 as compared to
10 cultures grown at 0.432 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 20. Similarly, the specific activity of the A13
   protein in the supplemented cultures was 104% higher (981 vs. 482 mU/gg) at day 3 and 42%
   higher (739 vs. 526 mU/tg) at day 6.
    [0256]    Samples from the bioreactors were taken and analyzed for A13 by ELISA, A13
   activity was measured by FRETS-VWF73 assay. Cell counts were determined by
15 Nucleocounter technology. Dilution rates were measured and used for calculation of growth
   rates and volumetric productivities.

      greater (2366 vs. 791 mU/mL) total activity and 174% greater (1189 vs. 432
25    activity than did supernatant harvested from culture 1.
      [0261]     Supplementation of the medium with nicotinamide alone resulted in about a 60%
      increase in the total activity (791 mU/ml vs. 488 mU/ml; compare Table 13 at days 7 and 11)
      and specific activity (432 mU/pg vs. 273 mU/pg; compare Table 13 at days 7 and 11) of
      A13. Similarly, supplementation of the medium with zinc alone resulted in increases of
 30   between about 70% and 80% in the total activity and specific activity of A13 (compare Table
       13 and Table 14 at days 4 and 7). Surprisingly, supplementation of the culture medium with
      both nicotinamide and zinc resulted in a synergistic increase of between about 300% to 400%
       total activity (compare Table 14 day 11 with Table 13 days 4 and 7) and between about 200%

     supplemented with zinc and nicotinamide at a final concentration of 1.432 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H2 0

    mg/L/D, and specific activities, between about 800 and 1100 mU/pg A13, were achieved
     (Table 15). These results were consistent with protein production and specific activities
 10  achieved with CHO clone #938, as in example 2. Notably, volumetric and cell specific
    productivities increased over time in the long term culture, likely due to increasing growth
     and dilution rates over time. The high specific activity of the expressed A13 could be at least
    maintained at a constantly high level over at least entire 7 weeks the culture was grown under
    chemostatic conditions. In fact, the specific activity of the Al 3 produced in the culture

   continuous cell-cultivation actually improved over an extended period of time (see, example
 5 3). To investigate whether or not this result could be repeated, the cultures grown in medium
   supplemented with additional zinc were continued for an additional week. As seen in Table
   18 and Table 19, the specific activity of A13 in the supernatants of both cultures again
   increased over time. The specific activity of A13 found in the supernatant of the medium
   supplemented with 0.5 mg/L ZnSO4-7H 2 0 increased from 697 mU/mg at week 2 to 759
10 mU/mg at week 3 (Table 18). Similarly, the specific activity of A13 found in the supernatant
   of the medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L ZnSO 4 .7H 20 increased from 729 mU/mg at
   week 2 to 812 mU/mg at week 3 (Table 19). As before, specific cell growth was unaffected
   by supplementation with additional zinc. Notably, however, A13 protein production
    appeared to increase in both cultures supplemented with additional zinc as compared to
15 production in cultures not supplemented with zinc.

   [0272]    Fed-batch and chemostat cell-culture experiments were performed using bioreactor
   cultures of the recombinant CHO cell line #F6 expressing human ADAMTS13 in chemically
   defined BACD-A1 3 medium. The effect of supplementing the culture medium with higher
 5 levels of zinc was investigated.
   [02731    Recombinant CHO cells expressing human ADAMTS 13 were adapted to a
   chemically defined proprietary medium, BCS medium, in fed-batch mode. The adapted
   populations were subcloned and a clone #F6 was derived therefrom.
   [02741    Briefly, DWCB#19 was thawed and cell inoculum was prepared in BCS medium.
10 Cells were transferred to three 1.5L bioreactors with blade impellers and in proprietary
   BACD-A13 medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L, 2.0 mg/L, and 3.0 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 2 0 for
   final concentrations of 1.432 mg/L, 2.432 mg/L, and 3.432 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 2 0, respectively.
   Cultures were grown under an inline controlled pH of 7.15 at 36'C with a dissolved oxygen
   concentration of 20% air saturation.
15  [0275]   Cultures were grown in repeated batch mode (3 batches) for about a week and the

   continuous culture conditions using the mediums with different zinc supplementations, as
   described above.
20  [0276]   Under fed-batch culture conditions, supplementation of the culture mediums with
   increasing amounts of zinc further increased the specific activity of Al 3 secreted in the
   culture supernatants. Consistent with the previous results reported above, supplementation of
   the medium with an additional 1.0 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 2O resulted in a high specific activity of
   806 mU/tg. Further increases in the zinc concentration, i.e. supplementation with 2.0 mg/L
25 and 3.0 mg/L, resulted in even higher levels of A13 specific activity (880 mU/tg and 889
   mU/tg, respectively) (Table 20). As before, other parameters, including total A13 protein
   production and specific cell growth, were unaffected by supplementation with additional

 5 [0284]    Chemostat and perfusion continuous cell-culture methods were compared to
   determine the relative production and specific activities of A13 expressed in several
   recombinant CHO cell lines.
    [0285]   Briefly, different clones of recombinant CHO cell expressing recombinant human
   A13 were adapted to a chemically defined proprietary medium (BCS), which was used for
10 inoculums preparation. Cells were further cultivated in bioreactor cultures in proprietary
   BACD-A13 medium supplemented with zinc and nicotinamide at final concentrations of
    1.432 mg/L ZnSO 4 -7H 20 and 7.02 mg/L nicotinamide. Inocula from each cell clone were
   then transferred to two bioreactors, of which one was cultured under chemostatic conditions
    (CST) and the other under perfusion, as indicated in Table 23. Cells were cultured at a
15  density of between about 2x10 6 and 4x10 6 cells/ml on CytoporeTM II microcarriers (GE
    Biosciences).
    [0286]    Cultures were grown under continuous culture conditions for 3 to 4 weeks and
    samples of the supernatant from the bioreactors were analyzed periodically for Al 3 protein
    production by ELISA and A13 activity by FRETS-VWF73 assay. Values given in Table 23

    [02871     In order to determine the effect of temperature and pH on the production of
    recombinant human ADAMTS13 protein grown in eukaryotic cell culture using a chemically
    defined animal protein-free culture medium, cultures were grown at temperatures between
    35.0'C and 38.0 0 C at pH's of between 7.05 and 7.30.
10   [0288]    Briefly, recombinant CHO cells expressing human A13 were transferred to 1.5L

    under inline controlled pH's between 7.05 and 7.30 at temperatures ranging from 35.0'C to
     38.0'C with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 20% air saturation. The experiments were
     designed and executed using the response surface approach. The statistical analysis was done
15   using the statistical Software package Minitab@ 15.1.0.0.
     [02891     Samples from the bioreactors were taken and analyzed for A13 by ELISA, A13
     activity was measured by FRETS-VWF73 assay. Cell counts were determined by
     Nucleocounter technology. Dilution rates were measured and used for calculation of growth
     rates and volumetric productivities.
