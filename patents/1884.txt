                CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
           This application represents the first application for a patent directed
   towards the invention and the subject matter.
 5                      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to harvesting leaves from the shrub
   Camellia Sinensis for the production of tea. Traditionally, leaves have been
   picked by hand but some automated machines have been introduced. Some
   designs are moved manually, by one or more operatives, and others are
10 tractor-like with driven wheels. However, treaded machines arranged to
   support their own weight are less sympathetic to the terrains experienced on
   many plantations. Manually operated machines are preferred but these are
   often cumbersome and regular resting periods are required by operatives.
                       BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
15        According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
   apparatus for harvesting tea, comprising: a support-frame;            an engine
   attached to said support-frame; a reciprocating-cutter mounted to said
   support-frame and configured to be operated by said engine; a blowing
   device located on said support-frame and activated by said engine; and
20 characterized in that said support-frame is moulded from carbon-fibre and
   has: a base-plate extending between a left-end-plate and a right-end-plate; a
   leading-upper-box-section and a trailing-upper-box-section located between
   said left-end-plate and said right-end-plate; and a longitudinal-platform
   supported between said leading-upper-box-section and said trailing-upper
25 box-section.
           The invention will be described, by way of example only, with
   reference to the accompanying drawings.

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
                                        Figure 1
20             An apparatus 101 for harvesting tea is shown in Figure 1. The
   apparatus includes a support-frame, attached to which are an engine and a
   reciprocating-cutter, along with a blowing-device; described in detail with
   reference to Figure 13. Handles extend from the apparatus, as described
   with reference to Figure 12, allowing operatives to harvest the top one or two
25 inches of recently grown buds and leaves, usually referred to as flushes.
   During a growing season, typical plants will grow a new flush over a period of
   one to two weeks. Many sub varieties of the shrub Camellia Sinensis are
   grown typically in rows, such as first-row 102, second-row 103 and third-row
   104. To harvest the flushes, operatives gain access via channels between
30 the rows, such as a first-channel 105 and a second-channel 106. During a
   first pass, as illustrated in Figure 1, operatives may cut a first side of a row,

                                            3
   such as the first side of row 103 on the side of channel 105. The harvesting
   apparatus is then rotated to allow a harvesting operation to be performed
   upon the other side of the row, such that, for row 103, the side closest to
   channel 106 is harvested with the operatives walking in the opposition
 5 direction.
            If left uncultivated, the shrub can grow to a height in excess of ten
   metres but cultivated plants are usually pruned, to a height substantially
   equal to that of an operative's waist, to facilitate flush picking. Thus, each row
   of cultivated plants defines a mature-base at substantially waist height, with
10 flushes of new growth extending above this mature-base. After attaching
   handles, the       harvesting-apparatus   is located upon        the  mature-base.
   Harvesting is performed by manually pushing the harvesting-apparatus, with
   an engine operational to drive a reciprocating-cutter and the blowing-device,
   thereby cutting and blowing; and collecting the cut flushes in a bag 107
15 attached to the harvesting-apparatus 101.
            The engine, along with its fuel tank, the reciprocating-cutter, the
   blowing-device and the trailing bag all contribute to the overall weight of the
   harvesting-apparatus. However, the present invention mitigates the weight
   problem by attaching these components to a support-frame that is moulded
20 from carbon-fibre. Without deploying the present invention and when using
   conventional material such as mild steel, it would be necessary for operatives
   of such a harvesting-apparatus to rest regularly, at times when the apparatus
   itself remained fully functional.
            Given the nature of the reciprocating-cutter, it is necessary to stop
25 periodically to provide lubrication (using a non-toxic lubricating oil) and to
   refuel the apparatus. However, by using a support-frame constructed from
   carbon-fibre, thereby significantly reducing the weight of the apparatus,
   stopping to lubricate and stopping to refuel are still required; but it may not be
   necessary to include additional rest breaks due to operator fatigue, or at least
30 fewer of them.
                                         Figure 2

                                           4
           The harvesting-apparatus 101 is constructed by attaching an engine to
   a support-frame, mounting a reciprocating-cutter to the support-frame and
   configuring the engine to operate the reciprocating-cutter. In addition, a
   blowing-device is located on the support-frame and the engine is also
 5 arranged to activate this blowing-device. In accordance with an aspect of the
   present    invention,  the  support-frame   is  moulded    from    carbon  fibre
   components by moulding an upper-carbon-fibre-component and a base
   plate-carbon-fibre-component. The upper-carbon-fibre-component includes a
   left-end-plate with a left-base-surface; a right-end-plate with a right-base
10 surface; a leading-upper-box-section; a trailing-upper-box-section; and a
   longitudinal-platform supported between the leading-upper-box-section and
   the trailing-upper-box-section. A base-plate-carbon-fibre-component is then
   attached to left-base-surface and the right-base-surface.
           To construct the upper-carbon-fibre-component and the base-plate
15 carbon-fibre-component, sheets of a resin impregnated carbon-fibre textile
   are placed over a mould. A typical material is identified by commercial
   designation with a designation MTC510 and may have a weight per unit area
   of typically two hundred and forty-five grams per square metre. A mould is
   constructed from components and the overall assembly may be referred to
20 as a mould-kit. In an embodiment, the upper-carbon-fibre-component
   includes substantially three-dimensional portions including the leading-upper
   box-section and the trailing-upper-box-section. Thus, the mould-kit may
   include    additional  mould-plates   to  establish  these    three-dimensional
   structures.
25         A portion of a main-mould 201 is illustrated in Figure 2. This may be
   identified as a portion of the mould responsible for producing a box section
   and cooperates with an additional mould-plate, as described with reference
   to Figure 6.
           An internal surface 202 of the main mould 201 defines an exterior
30 surface for the moulded component. Consequently, the carbon-fibre fabric
   with impregnated resin is inserted and forced within the internal space 203

                                           5
   defined by the main-mould 201 and then solidified, as is known in the art, by
   the application of heat and pressure.
          The required structure is built up in layers of the carbon-fibre fabric
   and over some portions, layers may be created using a greater thickness of
 5 material; possibly having a weight of four hundred grams per square metre.
   Typically, structures are built up to a thickness of between two millimetres
   and three millimetres.
                                        Figure 3
          The main-mould 201 is shown in Figure 3, in to which a first layer 301
10 of the carbon-fibre fabric has been inserted. This does not completely fill the
   mould, and a second layer will be required to cover a remaining-portion 302.
                                        Figure 4
               As illustrated in Figure 4, a second-layer 401 has been located
   within mould-region 302, abutting against the first-layer 301. A layer-joint 402
15 therefore exists between the first-layer 301 and the second-layer 401.
                                        Figure 5
               In Figure 5, the thickness of the component has been increased by
   the application of a third-layer 501. This covers the first-layer 301 and the
   second-layer 401. Furthermore, the shape of the layer is different, such that a
20 discontinuity 402 created by the layer-joint 401 is covered by the third-layer
   501. Furthermore, the layers are designed such that overlaps of this type do
   not occur along edges and corners.
                                        Figure 6
               An image is shown in Figure 6, looking in the direction of arrow
25 600 of Figure 5. Within the main-mould 201, second-layer 401 is shown with
   the third-layer 501      and an inner-layer 601.     To establish the three
   dimensionality of the box section, an additional-mould-plate 602 is deployed
   in the direction of arrow 603 to establish the required shape within the main
   mould 201.
30        Thus, after been fully assembled in this way, the textile material is

                                           6
   surrounded by external enclosure material prior to being heated under
   pressure, thereby causing the resin to set.
                                        Figure 7
               After the setting procedure has been completed, the moulded
 5 component 701 is removed from the main-mould 201 and excess material
   702 is cut away. Furthermore, the mould itself may include scoring lines,
   such that cut-lines 703 are defined on the component 701, showing where a
   cutting operation is to take place.
                                       Figure 8
10             A moulded upper-carbon-fibre-component 801 is shown in Figure
   8, produced using the procedure described with reference to Figures 2 to 7.
   The upper-carbon-fibre-component 801 includes a left-end-plate, with a
   base-surface upon which the component is testing in the configuration shown
   in Figure 8. Similarly, there is a right-end-place (further described with
15 reference to Figure 9) again having a right-base-surface upon which the
   component is resting in the configuration of Figure 8.
          When assembled as part of a harvesting-apparatus, the component is
   moved in the direction of arrow 802. It includes upper-box-sections, identified
   as a leading-box-section 803 and a trailing-box-section 804. A longitudinal
20 platform 805 is supported between the leading-upper-box-section 803 and
   the trailing-upper-box-section 804. The longitudinal-platform 805 is provided
   to support an engine, described further with reference to Figure 13. To
   provide further strength, the component also includes a central-brace 806.
                                       Figure 9
25             A right-end-plate 901 is shown in Figure 9, as seen when viewed
   in the direction of arrow 900 of Figure 8. This includes a right-base-surface
   902 to which is connected a base-plate-carbon-component; this also being
   attached to a similar left-base-surface, as described with reference to Figure
   10.

              The upper-carbon-fibre-component 801 is shown upside down in
   Figure 10, thereby displaying the underside of the leading-upper-box-section
   803 and the underside of the longitudinal-platform 805. Internal surfaces of
   the right-end-plate 901 and a similar left-end-plate 1001 are also visible.

              A fully assembled support-frame 1101 is illustrated in Figure 11, in
   its normal orientation. The support-frame has been moulded from carbon
10 fibre as previously described and has a base-plate-component 1002
   extending between the left-end-plate 1001 and a right-end-plate 901. The
   support-frame also includes a leading-upper-box-section 803 and a trailing
   upper-box-section 804 both located between the left-end-plate 1001 and the
   right-end-plate 901. In addition, the longitudinal-platform 805 is supported
15 between the leading-upper-box-section 803 and the trailing-upper-box
   section 804. The support-frame 1101 also includes the central-brace 806.
                                     Figure 12
              The support-frame 1101 is shown in Figure 12, rotated, such that
   the leading-upper-box-section 803 is towards the front. As previously
20 described with reference to Figure 1, when deployed, carrying handles are
   attached to the support-frame. In this embodiment, a left-handle 1201 has
   been attached to the left side of the support-frame, and a right-handle 1202
   has been attached to the right side of the support-frame. In an embodiment,
   both the left-handle 1201 and the right-handle 1203 are also constructed by
25 carbon-fibre moulding, using a similar technique to that described with
   reference to Figures 2 to 7.
          During assembly and transportation, the left-handle 1201 and the
   right-handle 1202 are removed and are then attached, by the application of
   bolts 1203, when deployed, as described with reference to Figure 1.

              The harvesting-apparatus 101 includes an engine 1301 that is
   attached to the support-frame 1101. The engine 1301 drives a reciprocating
   cutter 1302 mounted to the support-frame 1101. In addition, a blowing-device
   1303 is located on the support-frame and is also activated by the engine
 5 1301.
          The blowing-device 1303 includes a main pipe with an end that is
   closed by a rotatable-sealing-device 1304. The engine 1301 is supported by
   the longitudinal-platform 805 and includes a fuel-tank 1305.

              In an embodiment, the apparatus includes at least one skid 1501
15 that extends from the bottom of the support-frame 1101. In an embodiment,
   two skids are provided, with a first skid 1501 attached to the left-end-plate
   1001, with a similar second skid attached to the right-end-plate 902.
          For each skid, a support-bracket 1502, having a plurality of attachment
   holes 1503, allows for vertical adjustment, thereby allowing adjustments to be
20 made to the cut height when the harvesting-apparatus has been located
   upon the mature-base.

   embodiment, a first-cooperating-bracket 1601 extends from the end-plate
25 1001, along with a second-cooperating-bracket 1602. The cooperating
   brackets are configured to engage with respective support-brackets, such
   that support-bracket 1502 engages within the first-cooperating-bracket 1601
   and is secured therein, following adjustment to the required height, by the
   application of two bolts.
