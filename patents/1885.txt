                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      Highly effective combinations of a compound of formula A (a P13K6 selective
inhibitor) and anti-CD20 antibodies are provided herein for the treatment and amelioration of
P13K6 and/or CD20 mediated diseases and disorderes. In particular, the combination can be used
to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases. More particularly, the invention provided for a
combination of a compound of formula A, or stereoisomers thereof, and ublituximab for the
treatment and/or amerioration of hematological malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      There is considerable evidence indicating that both P13K6 enzymes and CD20
contribute individually to tumourigenesis in a wide variety of human cancers and especially in
hematological malignancies. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes
that regulate diverse biological functions in every cell type by generating phosphoinositide
second-messenger molecules. As the activity of these phosphoinositide second messengers is
determined by their phosphorylation state, the kinases and phosphatises that act to modify these
lipids are central to the correct execution of intracellular signaling events. PI3Ks phosphorylate
lipids at the 3-hydroxyl residue of an inositol ring (Whitman et al., Nature 332:664 (1988)) to
generate phosphorylated phospholipids (PIP3s) which act as second messengers recruiting
kinases with lipid binding domains (including plekstrin homology (PH) regions), such as Akt and
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Binding of Akt to membrane PIP3s causes the
translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane, bringing Akt into contact with PDK1, which is
responsible for activating Akt. The tumor-suppressor phosphatase, PTEN (Phosphatase and
Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten), dephosphorylates PIP3 and therefore acts as a
negative regulator of Akt activation. The P13-kinases Akt and PDK1 are important in the
regulation of many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, proliferation, survival,
apoptosis and motility and are significant components of the molecular mechanisms of diseases
                                                -1-

such as cancer, diabetes and immune inflammation (Vivanco et al., Nature Rev. Cancer 2:489
(2002); Phillips et al., Cancer 83:41 (1998)).
[0004]     The PI3Ks family is constituted by four different classes: Classes I, II , III and IV.
Classes I- III are lipid kinases and Class IV are serine/threonine protein kinases.
[0005]     The members of the Class I family of PI3Ks are dimers of a regulatory and a catalytic
subunit. The Class I family consists of four isoforms, determined by the 110 kDa catalytic
subunits a, P, y and 6. See Engelman J.A., Nat Rev Genet 7:606-619 (2006); Carnero A., Curr
CancerDrug Targets 8:187-198 (2008); and Vanhaesebroeck B., Trends Biochem Sci 30:194
204 (2005). Class I can be subdivided into two subclasses: Class Ia, formed by the combination
of p110 a, P, and 6, and a regulatory subunit (p85, p 5 5 or p50); and Class Ib, formed by p110 y
and p101 regulatory subunits.
[0006]     Studies regarding P13K and related protein kinase pathways have been published by
various research groups, including, Liu et al., Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 8:627-644 (2009);
Nathan et al, Mol. Cancer Ther. 8(1) (2009); and Marone et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta
1784:159-185 (2008). Two known P13K inhibitors, LY294002 and Wortmannin, are non
specific P13K inhibitors as they do not distinguish the four members of Class I P13K: a, P, y, and
6. A number of P13K inhibitors have entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancers, and
various types of cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
hematological cancers, are being considered as areas of therapeutic interest.
[0007]     CD20 is a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of 35-37 kDa
which is present on the surface of mature B lymphocytes. It is expressed during the development
of B lymphocyte cells (B cells) as from the early pre-B stage until differentiation into
plasmocytes, a stage at which this expression disappears. CD20 is present on both normal B
lymphocytes and malignant B cells including most non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas (NHL) and
B-type Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia's (B-CLL). The CD20 antigen is not expressed on
haematopoietic stem cells or on plasmocytes.
[0008]     Anti-CD20 antibodies have been, and continue to be, developed for the treatment of B
cell diseases. Successes have been reported for the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. However,
there are a substantial number of patients who are refractory to treatment with rituximab or who
develop resistance in the course of prolonged treatment with rituximab (used as a single agent or
even in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens).
                                                 -2-

[0009]      Accordingly, there is a need for more effective therapies for the treatment and/or
amelioration of diseases or disorders associated with modulation of P13K6 enzymes and/or CD20
protein, and in particular for the treatment and or amelioration of B-cell diseases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        I.      Definitions
[0063]     To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases
are defined below.
[0064]     The term "CD20" (also known as B lymphocyte CD20 antigen, MS4A1, B lymphocyte
surface antigen BI, Bp35, Leukocyte surface antigen Leu-16) refers to any native CD20, unless
otherwise indicated. The term "CD20" encompasses "full-length," unprocessed CD20 as well as
any form of CD20 that results from processing within the cell. The term also encompasses
naturally occurring variants of CD20, e.g., splice variants, allelic variants and isoforms. The
CD20 polypeptides described herein can be isolated from a variety of sources, such as from
human tissue types or from another source, or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods.
Examples of CD20 sequences include, but are not limited to NCBI reference numbers
NP_068769.2 and NP_690605.1.
[0065]     The term "antibody" means an immunoglobulin molecule that recognizes and
specifically binds to a target, such as a protein, polypeptide, peptide, carbohydrate,
polynucleotide, lipid, or combinations of the foregoing through at least one antigen recognition
site within the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term
"antibody" encompasses intact polyclonal antibodies, intact monoclonal antibodies, antibody
fragments (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments), single chain Fv (scFv) mutants,
multispecific antibodies such as bispecific antibodies generated from at least two intact
antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, fusion proteins
comprising an antigen determination portion of an antibody, and any other modified
immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site so long as the antibodies
exhibit the desired biological activity. An antibody can be of any of the five major classes of
immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, or subclasses (isotypes) thereof (e.g., IgGI,
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2), based on the identity of their heavy-chain constant domains
referred to as alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The different classes of
immunoglobulins have different and well known subunit structures and three-dimensional
configurations. Antibodies can be naked or conjugated to other molecules such as toxins,
radioisotopes, proteins, etc.
[0066]     A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist" antibody is one which inhibits or reduces
biological activity of the antigen it binds, such as CD20. In a certain embodiment, blocking
                                                 - 12 -

antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of
the antigen. Desirably, the biological activity is reduced by 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%,
90%, 950%, or even 100%.
[0067]     The term "anti-CD20 antibody" or "an antibody that binds to CD20" refers to an
antibody that is capable of binding CD20 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful
as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting CD20. The extent of binding of an anti
CD20 antibody to an unrelated, non-CD20 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the
antibody to CD20 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an
antibody that binds to CD20 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of <1 paM, 5100 nM, <10 nM, <1
nM, or 50.1 nM.
[0068]     The term "antibody fragment" refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to the
antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments
include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, single
chain antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
[0069]     A "monoclonal antibody" refers to a homogeneous antibody population involved in the
highly specific recognition and binding of a single antigenic determinant, or epitope. This is in
contrast to polyclonal antibodies that typically include different antibodies directed against
different antigenic determinants. The term "monoclonal antibody" encompasses both intact and
full-length monoclonal antibodies as well as antibody fragments (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv),
single chain (scFv) mutants, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other
modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site. Furthermore,
"monoclonal antibody" refers to such antibodies made in any number of manners including but
not limited to by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant expression, and transgenic animals.
[0070]     The term "humanized antibody" refers to forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies
that are specific immunoglobulin chains, chimeric immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof that
contain minimal non-human (e.g., murine) sequences. Typically, humanized antibodies are
human immunoglobulins in which residues from the complementary determining region (CDR)
are replaced by residues from the CDR of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster)
that have the desired specificity, affinity, and capability (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525
(1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534
1536 (1988)). In some instances, the Fv framework region (FR) residues of a human
immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human
                                                 - 13 -

species that has the desired specificity, affinity, and capability. The humanized antibody can be
further modified by the substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region
and/or within the replaced non-human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity,
affinity, and/or capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of
at least one, and typically two or three, variable domains containing all or substantially all of the
CDR regions that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all or substantially all
of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized
antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain
(Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Examples of methods used to generate
humanized antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. 5,225,539 or 5,639,641.
[0071]      A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light
chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The
variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR)
connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also known as hypervariable
regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the
CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies.
There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species
sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed.,
1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on
crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Al-lazikani et al J. Molec. Biol.
273:927-948 (1997)). In addition, combinations of these two approaches are sometimes used in
the art to determine CDRs.
[0072]      The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the
variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy
chain) (e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)).
[0073]      The amino acid position numbering as in Kabat, refers to the numbering system used
for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies
in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual
linear amino acid sequence can contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a
shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain
                                                  - 14 -

variable domain can include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after
residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g., residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat)
after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues can be determined for a given
antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a "standard"
Kabat numbered sequence. Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia
and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The end of the Chothia CDR-H1 loop when
numbered using the Kabat numbering convention varies between H32 and H34 depending on the
length of the loop (this is because the Kabat numbering scheme places the insertions at H35A and
H35B; if neither 35A nor 35B is present, the loop ends at 32; if only 35A is present, the loop
ends at 33; if both 35A and 35B are present, the loop ends at 34). The AbM hypervariable
regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are
used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software.

[0074]     The term "human antibody" means an antibody produced by a human or an antibody
having an amino acid sequence corresponding to an antibody produced by a human made using
any technique known in the art. This definition of a human antibody includes intact or full
length antibodies, fragments thereof, and/or antibodies comprising at least one human heavy
and/or light chain polypeptide such as, for example, an antibody comprising murine light chain
and human heavy chain polypeptides.
[0075]     The term "chimeric antibodies" refers to antibodies wherein the amino acid sequence
of the immunoglobulin molecule is derived from two or more species. Typically, the variable
region of both light and heavy chains corresponds to the variable region of antibodies derived
from one species of mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, etc) with the desired specificity, affinity,
                                                - 15  -

and capability while the constant regions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived
from another (usually human) to avoid eliciting an immune response in that species.
[0076]      The term "epitope" or "antigenic determinant" are used interchangeably herein and
refer to that portion of an antigen capable of being recognized and specifically bound by a
particular antibody. When the antigen is a polypeptide, epitopes can be formed both from
contiguous amino acids and noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a
protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained upon protein
denaturing, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost upon protein
denaturing. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino
acids in a unique spatial conformation.
[0077]      "Binding affinity" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent
interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner
(e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity" refers to intrinsic
binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g.,
antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented
by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the
art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and
tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend
to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art,
any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments
are described herein.
[0078]      "Or better" when used herein to refer to binding affinity refers to a stronger binding
between a molecule and its binding partner. "Or better" when used herein refers to a stronger
binding, represented by a smaller numerical Kd value. For example, an antibody which has an
affinity for an antigen of "0.6 nM or better," the antibody's affinity for the antigen is <0.6 nM,
i.e., 0.59 nM, 0.58 nM, 0.57 nM etc. or any value less than 0.6 nM.
[0079]      The phrase "substantially similar," or "substantially the same," as used herein, denotes
a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated
with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody)
such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of
little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological
characteristics measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values
                                                   - 16 -

is less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, or less
than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator antibody.
[0080]      A polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is
"isolated" is a polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is in a
form not found in nature. Isolated polypeptides, antibodies, polynucleotides, vectors, cells or
compositions include those which have been purified to a degree that they are no longer in a form
in which they are found in nature. In some embodiments, an antibody, polynucleotide, vector,
cell, or composition which is isolated is substantially pure.
[0081]      As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to material which is at least 50% pure (i.e.,
free from contaminants), at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 98% pure, or at least 99%
pure.
[0082]      The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in
mammals in which a population of cells are characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples
of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and
leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell
lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the
lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast
cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland
carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic
carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancers.
[0083]      "Tumor" and "neoplasm" refer to any mass of tissue that result from excessive cell
growth or proliferation, either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous) including pre
cancerous lesions.
[0084]       The terms "cancer cell," "tumor cell," and grammatical equivalents refer to the total
population of cells derived from a tumor or a pre-cancerous lesion, including both non
tumorigenic cells, which comprise the bulk of the tumor cell population, and tumorigenic stem
cells (cancer stem cells). As used herein, the term "tumor cell" will be modified by the term
"non-tumorigenic" when referring solely to those tumor cells lacking the capacity to renew and
differentiate to distinguish those tumor cells from cancer stem cells.
[0085]      The term "subject" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to
humans, non-human primates, rodents, and the like, which is to be the recipient of a particular
                                                 - 17 -

treatment. Typically, the terms "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably herein in
reference to a human subject.
[0086]      A cell "population" can refer to a single cell or to multiple cells. The cell or cells can
be cells in culture or cells in an organism. For example, a cell population can be in a subject or
patient.
[0087]      The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation which is in such form as
to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective, and which contains no
additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would
be administered. Such formulation can be sterile.
[0088]      An "effective amount" of an antibody as disclosed herein is an amount sufficient to
carry out a specifically stated purpose. An "effective amount" can be determined empirically and
in a routine manner, in relation to the stated purpose.
[0089]      The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of an antibody or
other drug effective to "treat" a disease or disorder in a subject or mammal. In the case of cancer,
the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the
tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and in a certain embodiment, stop) cancer cell
infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and in a certain embodiment,
stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one
or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. See the definition herein of "treating." To
the extent the drug can prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it can be cytostatic and/or
cytotoxic. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for
periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not
necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease,
the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.
[0090]      Terms such as "treating" or "treatment" or "to treat" or "alleviating" or "to alleviate"
refer to both 1) therapeutic measures that cure, slow down, lessen symptoms of, and/or halt
progression of a diagnosed pathologic condition or disorder and 2) prophylactic or preventative
measures that prevent and/or slow the development of a targeted pathologic condition or
disorder. Thus, those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder; those prone to
have the disorder; and those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. In certain embodiments, a
subject is successfully "treated" for cancer according to the methods of the present invention if
the patient shows one or more of the following: reduction in cachexia, increase in survival time,
                                                   - 18 -

elongation in time to tumor progression, reduction in tumor mass, reduction in tumor burden
and/or a prolongation in time to tumor metastasis, time to tumor recurrence, tumor response,
complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, progression free survival
(PFS), overall survival (OS), each as measured by standards set by the National Cancer Institute
and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the approval of new drugs. See Johnson et al,J.
Clin. Oncol. 21(7):1404-1411 (2003).
[0091]     A "combination" of an anti-CD20 antibody and a P13K6 selective inhibitor refers to an
anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof and Compound A as defined herein that are intended to
be administered to the same population of cells or to the same subject simultaneously,
sequentially, or both simulteously and sequentially. Thus, by way of example, administration of
an anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof preceeding or following (e.g., by an hour, day, week,
or month) administration of Compound A constitutes administration of a combination of an anti
CD20 antibody or fragment thereof and Compound A. In addition, simultaneous administration
of an anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof and Compound A also constitutes administration
of a combination of the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof and Compound A, regardless of
whether the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof and Compound A are administered together
in a single pharmaceutical formulation or are administered simultaneously in separate
pharmaceutical formulations by either the same or different routes of administration.
[0092]     A tumor which "does not respond," "responds poorly," or is "refractory" to treatment
with an anti-CD20 antibody does not show statistically significant improvement in response to an
anti-CD20 antibody treatment when compared to no treatment or treatment with placebo in a
recognized animal model or human clinical trial, or which responds to an initial treatment with
anti-CD20 antibodies but grows as treatment continues.
[0093]      The ability of a tumor or cell type to respond to an anti-CD20 antibody can be tested
using laboratory cell lines such as Raji or Wil2-S, or patient donor cell lines. In addition, activity
can be measured using B-cell depletion assays, e.g., in whole blood from patients.
[0094]      "Polynucleotide" or "nucleic acid," as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers
of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be
deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or
any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase. A
polynucleotide can comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their
analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure can be imparted before or after
                                                  - 19 -

assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides can be interrupted by non-nucleotide
components. A polynucleotide can be further modified after polymerization, such as by
conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of modifications include, for example,
"caps," substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog,
internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl
phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, cabamates, etc.) and with charged linkages
(e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as,
for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.),
those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals,
radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with
modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the
polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars can be
replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard
protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or can be
conjugated to solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with
amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls can
also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous
forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example,
2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha-anomeric
sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars,
sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or
more phosphodiester linkages can be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative
linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by
P(O)S ("thioate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"), (O)NR 2 ("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH 2
("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1
20 C) optionally containing an ether (-0-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or
araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies
to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.
[0095]      The term "vector" means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and expressing,
one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are
not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid or phage
vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or
                                                 - 20 -

RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain eukaryotic cells, such as
producer cells.
[0096]     The terms "polypeptide," "peptide," and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to
refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer can be linear or branched, it can
comprise modified amino acids, and it can be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also
encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for
example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any
other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also
included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of
an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other
modifications known in the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention
are based upon antibodies, in certain embodiments, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or
associated chains.
[0097]     The terms "identical" or percent "identity" in the context of two or more nucleic acids
or polypeptides, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a
specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and
aligned (introducing gaps, if necessary) for maximum correspondence, not considering any
conservative amino acid substitutions as part of the sequence identity. The percent identity can
be measured using sequence comparison software or algorithms or by visual inspection. Various
algorithms and software are known in the art that can be used to obtain alignments of amino acid
or nucleotide sequences. One such non-limiting example of a sequence alignment algorithm is
the algorithm described in Karlin et al, Proc.Natl. A cad. Sci., 87:2264-2268 (1990), as modified
in Karlin et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci., 90:5873-5877 (1993), and incorporated into the NBLAST
and XBLAST programs (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402 (1991)). In certain
embodiments, Gapped BLAST can be used as described in Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res.,
25:3389-3402 (1997). BLAST-2, WU-BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology,
266:460-480 (1996)), ALIGN, ALIGN-2 (Genentech, South San Francisco, California) or
Megalign (DNASTAR) are additional publicly available software programs that can be used to
align sequences. In certain embodiments, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences
is determined using the GAP program in GCG software (e.g., using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix
and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 90 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). In certain
alternative embodiments, the GAP program in the GCG software package, which incorporates
                                               - 21 -

the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) can be used to
determine the percent identity between two amino acid sequences (e.g., using either a Blossum
62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight
of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Alternatively, in certain embodiments, the percent identity between nucleotide
or amino acid sequences is determined using the algorithm of Myers and Miller (CABIOS, 4:11
17 (1989)). For example, the percent identity can be determined using the ALIGN program
(version 2.0) and using a PAM 120 with residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap
penalty of 4. Appropriate parameters for maximal alignment by particular alignment software
can be determined by one skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, the default parameters of
the alignment software are used. In certain embodiments, the percentage identity "X" of a first
amino acid sequence to a second sequence amino acid is calculated as 100 x (Y/Z), where Y is
the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches in the alignment of the first and
second sequences (as aligned by visual inspection or a particular sequence alignment program)
and Z is the total number of residues in the second sequence. If the length of a first sequence is
longer than the second sequence, the percent identity of the first sequence to the second sequence
will be longer than the percent identity of the second sequence to the first sequence.
[0098]      As a non-limiting example, whether any particular polynucleotide has a certain
percentage sequence identity (e.g., is at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 90%
identical, and in some embodiments, at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical) to a
reference sequence can, in certain embodiments, be determined using the Bestfit program
(Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group,
University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, WI 53711). Bestfit uses the local
homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2: 482 489
(1981), to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any
other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance,
95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set
such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide
sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of nucleotides in the
reference sequence are allowed.
[0099]      In some embodiments, two nucleic acids or polypeptides of the invention are
substantially identical, meaning they have at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%,
at least 90%, and in some embodiments at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% nucleotide or amino
                                                 - 22 -

acid residue identity, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured
using a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection. In certain embodiments, identity
exists over a region of the sequences that is at least about 10, about 20, about 40-60 residues in
length or any integral value therebetween, or over a longer region than 60-80 residues, at least
about 90-100 residues, or the sequences are substantially identical over the full length of the
sequences being compared, such as the coding region of a nucleotide sequence for example.
[00100]     A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which one amino acid residue is
replaced with another amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid
residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g.,
lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar
side chains (e.g., asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side
chains (e.g., glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine,
tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side
chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). For example, substitution of a
phenylalanine for a tyrosine is a conservative substitution. In certain embodiments, conservative
substitutions in the sequences of the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention do not abrogate
the binding of the polypeptide or antibody containing the amino acid sequence, to the antigen(s),
i.e., the FOLR1 to which the polypeptide or antibody binds. Methods of identifying nucleotide
and amino acid conservative substitutions which do not eliminate antigen binding are well
known in the art (see, e.g., Brummell et al., Biochem. 32: 1180-1 187 (1993); Kobayashi et al.
ProteinEng. 12(10):879-884 (1999); and Burks et al. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:.412-417
(1997)).
[00101]     All numbers in this disclosure indicating amounts, ratios of materials, physical
properties of materials, and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about," except
as otherwise explicitly indicated. The term "about" when referring to a number or a numerical
range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within
experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or
numerical range can vary from, for example, between 1%and 150%of the stated number or
numerical range.
[00102]     The compound of the invention can contain one or more asymmetric centers (chiral
centers) and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that
can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present disclosure is
                                                  - 23 -

meant to encompass all such possible forms, as well as their racemic and resolved forms and
mixtures thereof. The individual enantiomers can be separated according to methods known in
the art in view of the present disclosure.
[00103]     As used herein, the term "stereoisomers" is a general term for all isomers of individual
molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes enantiomers and
isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another
(diastereomers).
[00104]     The term "chiral center" refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are
attached.
[00105]     The terms "enantiomer" and "enantiomeric" refer to a molecule that cannot be
superimposed on its mirror image and hence is optically active wherein the enantiomer rotates
the plane of polarized light in one direction and its mirror image compound rotates the plane of
polarized light in the opposite direction.
[00106]     The term "racemic" refers to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers and which
mixture is optically inactive.
[00107]     The term "resolution" refers to the separation, concentration or depletion of one of the
two enantiomeric forms of a molecule.
[00108]     The present disclosure encompasses solvates of compounds of the invention. Solvates
typically do not significantly alter the physiological activity or toxicity of the compounds, and as
such may function as pharmacological equivalents. The term "solvate" as used herein is a
combination, physical association and/or solvation of a compound of the present disclosure with
a solvent molecule, e.g. a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate, where the ratio of solvent
molecule to compound of the present disclosure is about 2:1, about 1:1 or about 1:2, respectively.
This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including
hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, such as when one or more
solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, "solvate"
encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Compounds of the invention can be
present as solvated forms with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol,
ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the disclosure includes both solvated and unsolvated
forms of compounds of the invention. One type of solvate is a hydrate. A "hydrate" relates to a
particular subgroup of solvates where the solvent molecule is water. Solvates typically can
function as pharmacological equivalents. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. See, e.g.,
                                                  - 24 -

M. Caira et al., J. Pharmaceut.Sci., 93(3):601-611 (2004); E.C. van Tonder et al., AAPS Pharm.
Sci. Tech. 5(1):Article 12 (2004); and A.L. Bingham et al., Chem. Commun. 603-604 (2001). A
typical, non-limiting, process of preparing a solvate would involve dissolving a compound of the
invention in a desired solvent (organic, water, or a mixture thereof) at temperatures about 20'C to
about 25'C, then cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the
crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques such as infrared spectroscopy
can be used to confirm the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.
[00109]     The term "prodrug" refers to a compound, which is an inactive precursor of a
compound, converted into its active form in the body by normal metabolic processes. Prodrug
design is discussed generally in Hardma, et al. (Eds.), Goodman and Gilman's The
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed., pp. 11-16 (1996). A thorough discussion is
provided in Higuchi, et al., Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ASCD Symposium
Series, and in Roche (ed.), Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical
Association and Pergamon Press (1987). To illustrate, prodrugs can be converted into a
pharmacologically active form through hydrolysis of, for example, an ester or amide linkage,
thereby introducing or exposing a functional group on the resultant product. The prodrugs can be
designed to react with an endogenous compound to form a water-soluble conjugate that further
enhances the pharmacological properties of the compound, for example, increased circulatory
half-life. Alternatively, prodrugs can be designed to undergo covalent modification on a
functional group with, for example, glucuronic acid, sulfate, glutathione, amino acids, or acetate.
The resulting conjugate can be inactivated and excreted in the urine, or rendered more potent
than the parent compound. High molecular weight conjugates also can be excreted into the bile,
subjected to enzymatic cleavage, and released back into the circulation, thereby effectively
increasing the biological half-life of the originally administered compound. Prodrugs of the
compounds of the invention are intended to be covered within the scope of this invention.
[00110]     The instant invention also includes the compounds which differ only in the presence of
one or more isotopically enriched atoms, for example, replacement of hydrogen with deuterium
or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by   1C-  or "C-enriched carbon. The compounds of the
present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of
atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with
radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (mI) or carbon-14 ( 14 C). All
                                                 - 25 -

isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are
encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
[00111]     The present disclosure further encompasses salts of the compounds of the invention,
including non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable
addition salts include inorganic and organic acid addition salts and basic salts. The
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, metal salts such as sodium salt,
potassium salt, cesium salt and the like; alkaline earth metals such as calcium salt, magnesium
salt and the like; organic amine salts such as triethylamine salt, pyridine salt, picoline salt,
ethanolamine salt, triethanolamine salt, dicyclohexylamine salt, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine
salt and the like; inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate
and the like; organic acid salts such as citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate,
acetate, dichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, formate, succinates, palmoates, benzoates,
salicylates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates, ketoglutarates and the like; sulfonates such as
methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and the like; salts of natural amino acids
such as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, tyrosine, cystine, cysteine,
methionine, proline, hydroxy proline, histidine, omithine, lysine, arginine, and serine; and salts of
non-natural amino acids such as D-isomers or substituted amino acids; salts of guanidine; and
salts of substituted guanidine wherein the substituents are selected from nitro, amino, alkyl,
alkenyl, alkynyl, ammonium or substituted ammonium salts and aluminum salts.
[00112]     The term "selective inhibitor" as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the
agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target
signaling activity, via direct or indirect interaction with the target.
[00113]     The term "P13K6 selective inhibitor" refers to Compound A as defined herein, which
selectively inhibits the activity of the P13K 6 isoform more effectively than other isoforms of the
P13K family (a, P, and y). For instance, a compound of formula A can be a compound that
exhibits a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 5 0 ) with respect to the 6 type P13-kinase that is at least
20-fold lower than the inhibitor's IC 50 with respect to the rest of the other P13K isoforms (i.e., a,
P, and y).
[00114]     Inhibition of P13K 6 may be of therapeutic benefit in treatment of various conditions,
e.g., conditions characterized by an inflammatory response including but not limited to
autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, and arthritic diseases. Importantly, inhibition of P13K 6
function does not appear to affect biological functions such as viability and fertility.
                                                  - 26 -

[00115]      "Inflammatory response" as used herein is characterized by redness, heat, swelling and
pain (i.e., inflammation) and typically involves tissue injury or destruction. An inflammatory
response is usually a localized, protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues,
which serves to destroy, dilute or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured
tissue. Inflammatory responses are notably associated with the influx of leukocytes and/or
leukocyte (e.g., neutrophil) chemotaxis. Inflammatory responses can result from infection with
pathogenic organisms and viruses, noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following
myocardial infarction or stroke, immune responses to foreign antigens, and autoimmune diseases.
Inflammatory responses amenable to treatment with the methods and compounds according to
the invention encompass conditions associated with reactions of the specific defense system as
well as conditions associated with reactions of the non-specific defense system.
[00116]      The therapeutic methods of the invention include methods for the treatment of
conditions associated with inflammatory cell activation. "Inflammatory cell activation" refers to
the induction by a stimulus (including, but not limited to, cytokines, antigens or auto-antibodies)
of a proliferative cellular response, the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited
to cytokines, oxygen radicals, enzymes, prostanoids, or vasoactive amines), or cell surface
expression of new or increased numbers of mediators (including, but not limited to, major
histocompatibility antigens or cell adhesion molecules) in inflammatory cells (including, but not
limited to, monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes
(polymorphonuclear leukocytes including neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) mast cells,
dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and endothelial cells). It will be appreciated by persons skilled
in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can
contribute to the initiation, perpetuation, or exacerbation of an inflammatory condition.
[00117]      The term "autoimmune disease" as used herein refers to any group of disorders in
which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell-mediated responses to the body's own
constituents.
[00118]      The term "transplant rejection" as used herein refers to an immune response directed
against grafted tissue (including organs or cells, e.g., bone marrow, characterized by a loss of
function of the grafted and surrounding tissues, pain, swelling, leukocytosis, and
thrombocytopenia).
[00119]      The term "allergic disease" as used herein refers to any symptoms, tissue damage, or
loss of tissue function resulting from allergy.

[00120]     The term "arthritic disease" as used herein refers to any disease that is characterized by
inflammatory lesions of the joints attributable to a variety of etiologies.
[00121]     The term "dermatitis" as used herein refers to any of a large family of diseases of the
skin that are characterized by inflammation of the skin attributable to a variety of etiologies.
[00122]     The term "synergistic effect," as used herein, refers to a greater-than-additive
therapeutic effect produced by a combination of compounds wherein the therapeutic effect
obtained with the combination exceeds the additive effects that would otherwise result from
individual administration the compounds alone. Embodiments of the invention include methods
of producing a synergistic effect in the treatment of hematological cancer, wherein said effect is
at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at
least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 500%, or at least
1000% greater than the corresponding additive effect.
[00123]     "Therapeutic synergy," as used herein, means that a combination of an anti-CD20
antibody with Compound A produce a therapeutic effect in treatment which is greater than the
additive effects of the anti-CD20 antibody the P13K6 selective inhibitor when each is used alone.
[00124]     As used in the present disclosure and claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the"
include plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
[00125]     It is understood that wherever embodiments are described herein with the language
"comprising," otherwise analogous embodiments described in terms of "consisting of' and/or
''consisting essentially of' are also provided.

        II.     Anti-CD20 Antibodies
[00131]     CD20 is a tetraspanning transmembrane phospho-protein that is expressed
predominantly in pre-B cells and in mature peripheral B cells in humans and mice. In humans,
CD20 is also strongly and homogeneously expressed on most mature B-cell malignancies.
[00132]     As provided herein, anti-CD20 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof can
be used in combination with P13K6 selective inhibitor.
[00133]     A number of anti-CD20 antibodies are known, including for example, ublituximab
rituximab, ofatumumab (HuMax; Intracel), ocrelizumab, veltuzumab, GA1O (obinutuzumab),
AME-133v (Applied Molecular Evolution), ocaratuzumab (Mentrik Biotech), PRO131921,
                                                   - 29 -

tositumomab, ibritumomab-tiuxetan, hA20 (Immunomedics, Inc.), BLX-301 (Biolex
Therapeutics), Reditux (Dr. Reddy's Laboratories), and PR070769 (described in
W02004/056312).
[00134]    Ublituximab (Utuxin TM , LFB-R603, TG20, EMAB603) is a monoclonal antibody that
targets a specific and unique epitope on CD20 and that has been bioengineered for enhanced
clinical activity and potency.
[00135]     Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody
directed against the CD20 antigen. Rituximab is the antibody called "C2B8" in U.S. Pat. No.
5,736,137. The amino acid sequence of rituximab antibody and exemplary methods for its
production via recombinant expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are disclosed in
U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[00136]     Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 IgGiK human monoclonal antibody. Studies indicate
that ofatumumab dissociates from CD20 at a slower rate compared to the rituximab and binds a
membrane-proximal epitope. Zhang et al., Mabs 1: 326-331 (2009). Epitope mapping has
indicated that ofatumumab binds an epitope located closer to the N-terminus of CD20 compared
to the location targeted by rituximab and includes an extracellular loop of the antigen. Id.
[00137]     Thus, in some embodiments, the anti CD-20 antibody or fragment thereof is selected
from the group consisting of antibodies that bind to the same epitope as ublituximab rituximab,
ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, veltuzumab, GA101, AME-133v, PRO131921, tositumomab, hA20,
or PR070769. In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof is ublituximab
rituximab, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, veltuzumab, GA101, AME-133v, PRO131921,
tositumomab, hA20, PR070769, or a fragment thereof.
[00138]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof binds to the same
epitope as ublituximab. In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof binds
to a sequence comprising amino acids N153-S179 of CD20. In some embodiments, the anti
CD20 antibody or fragment thereof binds to a discontinuous epitope in amino acids N153-S179
of CD20.
[00139]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof binds to CD20 with
an affinity characterized by a dissociation constant KD of less than about 10-7 M, less than about
10-8 M or less than about 10-9 M. In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment
thereof binds to CD20 with an affinity characterized by a dissociation constant KD of 10-10 to 10
9 M. In some embodiments the anti-CD20 antibody or fragment thereof binds to CD20 with an
                                               - 30 -

affinity characterized by a dissociation constant KD of 0.7 x 10-9 M. As used in the context of
antibody binding dissociation constants, the term "about" allows for the degree of variation
inherent in the methods utilized for measuring antibody affinity. For example, depending on the
level of precision of the instrumentation used, standard error based on the number of samples
measured, and rounding error, the term "about 10-2 M" might include, for example, from 0.05 M
to 0.005 M.
[00140]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody exhibits a high affinity to Fc
gammaRIII (CD 16). In some embodiments, as a result of their high affinity for the Fc region of
the antibody to CD16, such antibodies are not displaced by IgG polyclonal antibodies, especially
by IgG present in blood serum. In some embodiments the antibody binds to CD16 (e.g.,
expressed on a macrophage) with an affinity of at least 2x 106 M-1, at least 2x 107 M- , 2x 10 M- or
2x10 7 M-1 , e.g., as determined by Scatchard analysis or BlAcore technology (Label-free surface
plasmon resonance based technology) .
[00141]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody exhibits a glycosylation pattern
characterized by low fucose content in its Fc region. For example, in some embodiments, a
composition comprises anti-CD20 antibodies in which the antibodies comprise N-glycoside
linked sugar chains bound on the Fc-gamma glycosylation site (Asn 297, EU numbering),
wherein among the N-glycoside-linked sugar chains of all the antibodies of the composition, the
fucose content is less than 65%, less than 60%, less than 55%, less than 50%, less than 45%, or
less than 40%. In some embodiments, among the N-glycoside-linked sugar chains of all the
antibodies of the composition, the fucose content is 15 to 45% or 20 to 40%.
[00142]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody exhibits potent in vitro antibody
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody
produces an ADCC plateau of at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least
about 25%, or at least about 30% at a concentration of 50 ng/ml using natural killer (NK) cells
from healthy donors. Techniques for measuring ADCC are known in the art and provided, for
example, in de Romeauf et al., British JournalofHaematology 140: 635-643 (2008). In some
embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody produces an ADCC plateau at about 35% at a
concentration of 50 ng/ml using NK cells from healthy donors.
[00143]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody can decrease NF-kappa-B activity. In
some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody can decrease SNAIL expression. In some
embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody can increase RKIP activity. In some embodiments, the
                                                -31  -

anti-CD20 antibody can increase PTEN activity. In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody
can increase sensitization of a cell to TRAIL-apoptosis.
[00144]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is Fc-gamma-RIIIA (CD16) optimized.
Antibodies capable of activating type III Fc receptors and having a particular glycan structure
have been described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,931,895, which is herein incorporated by
reference in its entirety. Thus, in some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is modified on Asn
297 (EU numbering) with N-glycosylations of the bi-antennary and/or oligomannoside type as
described in U.S. Patent No. 7,931,895. Methods of producing antibodies with strong affinity for
receptor CD16 of the effector cells of the immune system are provided, for example, in U.S.
Published Application No. 2005/0271652, which is herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety.
[00145]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody has high ADCC activity. Methods of
producing antibodies with high ADCC activity are provided, for example, in U.S. Patent No.
7,713,524, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

[00162]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
comprises a heavy chain comprising SEQ ID NOs: 4 and 5 and a light chain comprising SEQ ID
NOs: 9 and 10.
[00163]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
binds to the same epitope as an antibody comprising SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:5.
[00164]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is ublituximab.
[00165]     In some embodiments, the antibody is EMAB603 (see W02006/064121, which is
herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), produced by the clone R603-12D 11, deposited to
the Collection Nationale des Cultures de Microorganismes under the accession number CNCM I
3529.
[00166]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is produced in the rat hybridoma
YB2/0 cell line (cell YB2/3HL.P2.G11. 16Ag.20, registered at the American Type Culture
Collection under ATCC number CRL-1662).
[00167]     The precise chemical structure of an antibody capable of specifically binding CD20
and retaining the desired activity depends on a number of factors. As ionizable amino and
carboxyl groups are present in the molecule, a particular polypeptide can be obtained as an acidic
or basic salt, or in neutral form. All such preparations that retain their biological activity when
placed in suitable environmental conditions are included in the definition of anti-CD20
antibodies as used herein. Further, the primary amino acid sequence of the antibody can be
augmented by derivatization using sugar moieties (glycosylation) or by other supplementary
molecules such as lipids, phosphate, acetyl groups and the like. It can also be augmented by
conjugation with saccharides. Certain aspects of such augmentation are accomplished through
post-translational processing systems of the producing host; other such modifications can be
introduced in vitro. In any event, such modifications are included in the definition of an anti
CD20 antibody used herein so long as the desired properties of the anti-CD20 antibody are not
destroyed. It is expected that such modifications can quantitatively or qualitatively affect the
activity, either by enhancing or diminishing the activity of the polypeptide, in the various assays.
Further, individual amino acid residues in the chain can be modified by oxidation, reduction, or
other derivatization, and the polypeptide can be cleaved to obtain fragments that retain activity.
Such alterations that do not destroy the desired properties (e.g., binding specificity for CD20) do
not remove the polypeptide sequence from the definition of anti-CD20 antibodies of interest as
used herein.
                                                - 37 -

[00168]     The art provides substantial guidance regarding the preparation and use of polypeptide
variants. In preparing variants of an anti-CD20 binding molecule, e.g., an antibody or antigen
binding fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, one of skill in the art can readily determine
which modifications to the native protein's nucleotide or amino acid sequence will result in a
variant that is suitable for use as a therapeutically active component of a pharmaceutical
composition.
[00169]     It is possible to introduce mutations only in framework regions or only in CDR regions
of an antibody molecule. Introduced mutations can be silent or neutral missense mutations, i.e.,
have no, or little, effect on an antibody's ability to bind antigen. These types of mutations can be
useful to optimize codon usage, or improve a hybridoma's antibody production. Alternatively,
non-neutral missense mutations can alter an antibody's ability to bind antigen. The location of
most silent and neutral missense mutations is likely to be in the framework regions, while the
location of most non-neutral missense mutations is likely to be in CDR, though this is not an
absolute requirement. One of skill in the art would be able to design and test mutant molecules
with desired properties such as no alteration in antigen-binding activity or alteration in binding
activity (e.g., improvements in antigen-binding activity or change in antibody specificity).
Following mutagenesis, the encoded protein can routinely be expressed and the functional and/or
biological activity of the encoded protein, (e.g., ability to immunospecifically bind at least one
epitope of a CD20 polypeptide) can be determined using techniques described herein or by
routinely modifying techniques known in the art.
[00170]     In certain embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibodies comprise at least one optimized
complementarity-determining region (CDR). By "optimized CDR" is intended that the CDR has
been modified and optimized sequences selected based on the sustained or improved binding
affinity and/or anti-CD20 activity that is imparted to an anti-CD20 antibody comprising the
optimized CDR. "Anti-CD20 activity" can include, e.g., activity which modulates one or more of
the following activities associated with CD20, e.g., the ability to induce apoptosis of B-cells, the
ability to induce ADCC against B-cells (e.g., CLL cells), the ability to inhibit NF-kappaB
activity, the ability to inhibit Snail expression, the ability to de-repress RKIP, the ability to de
repress PTEN, the ability to sensitize a tumor cell to TRAIL-apoptosis or any other activity
associated with CD20. Such activities are described, for example, in Baritaki et al., International
Journalof Oncology 38: 1683-1694 (2011), which is herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety. The modifications can involve replacement of amino acid residues within the CDR such
                                                  - 38 -

that an anti-CD20 antibody retains specificity for the CD20 antigen and has improved binding
affinity and/or improved anti-CD20 activity.
[00171]     In certain anti-CD20 antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, at least a
fraction of one or more of the constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so
as to provide desired biochemical characteristics such as reduced effector functions, the ability to
non-covalently dimerize, increased ability to localize at the site of a tumor, reduced serum half
life, or increased serum half-life when compared with a whole, unaltered antibody of
approximately the same immunogenicity. For example, certain antibodies are domain deleted
antibodies which comprise a polypeptide chain similar to an immunoglobulin heavy chain, but
which lack at least a portion of one or more heavy chain domains. For instance, in certain
antibodies, one entire domain of the constant region of the modified antibody will be deleted, for
example, all or part of the CH2 domain will be deleted.
[00172]     In certain anti-CD20 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, the Fc portion
can be mutated to decrease effector function using techniques known in the art. For example,
modifications of the constant region can be used to modify disulfide linkages or oligosaccharide
moieties that allow for enhanced localization due to increased antigen specificity or antibody
flexibility. The resulting physiological profile, bioavailability and other biochemical effects of
the modifications can easily be measured and quantified using well know immunological
techniques without undue experimentation.
[00173]     In certain embodiments, an anti-CD20 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
will not elicit a deleterious immune response in the animal to be treated, e.g., in a human. In one
embodiment, anti-CD20 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can be modified to
reduce their immunogenicity using art-recognized techniques. For example, antibodies can be
humanized, primatized, deimmunized, or chimeric antibodies can be made. These types of
antibodies are derived from a non-human antibody, typically a murine or primate antibody, that
retains or substantially retains the antigen-binding properties of the parent antibody, but which is
less immunogenic in humans. This can be achieved by various methods, including (a) grafting
the entire non-human variable domains onto human constant regions to generate chimeric
antibodies; (b) grafting at least a part of one or more of the non-human complementarity
determining regions (CDRs) into a human framework and constant regions with or without
retention of critical framework residues; or (c) transplanting the entire non-human variable
domains, but "cloaking" them with a human-like section by replacement of surface residues.

incorporated by reference in their entirety.
[00174]    Modified forms of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can be made from
whole precursor or parent antibodies using techniques known in the art.
[00175]    Anti-CD20 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can be made or
manufactured using techniques that are known in the art. In certain embodiments, antibody
molecules or fragments thereof are "recombinantly produced," i.e., are produced using
recombinant DNA technology. Anti-CD20 antibodies or fragments thereof can be generated by
any suitable method known in the art including generation of polyclonal antibodies or
preparation of monoclonal antibodies, e.g., through hybridoma or phage display.
[00176]    A variety of host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express antibody
molecules. The host cell can be co-transfected with two expression vectors, the first vector
encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived
polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers which enable equal
expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector can be used
which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain is
advantageously placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain
(Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2197 (1980)). The
host cell can also be transfected with a single vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide
and a light chain derived polypeptide. The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can
comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.
[00177]    The expression vector or vectors can be transferred to a host cell by conventional
techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an
antibody. Thus, host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody, or a heavy or light
chain thereof, operably linked to a heterologous promoter are provided. In certain embodiments
for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains
can be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule.
[00178]    Host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest
can be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which can, when transformed
                                                - 40 -

or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express a CD20 antibody in situ.
These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., E. coli, B. subtilis)
transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression
vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces, Pichia) transformed
with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell
systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing
antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors
(e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with
recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences;
or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BLK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant
expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g.,
metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the
vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, or eukaryotic cells, e.g.,
for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecules, are used for the expression of a
recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary
cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter
element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking
et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio/Technology 8:2 (1990)). In some embodiments,
the anti-CD20 antibody is produced in a host cell that is not a CHO cell.
[00179]     Once an antibody has been recombinantly expressed, it can be purified by any method
known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by
chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after
Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any
other standard technique for the purification of proteins.
[00180]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is produced by a rat hybridoma cell
line. In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is produced in YB2/0 (ATCC CRL-1662)

or at any interval as determined by one of skill in the art. For example, a compound of formula A
and anti-CD20 antibody can be administered sequentially (in any order), simultaneously, or via
any combination of sequential and simultaneous administrations. A compound of formula A and
                                                - 41 -

pharmaceutical compositions.
[00182]     Administration of combination, whether simultaneous, sequential (in any order) or
both, can be performed according to any number of desired intervals of minutes (e.g., 0-60
minutes), hours (e.g., 0-24 hours), days (e.g., 0-7 days), and/or weeks (e.g., 0-52 weeks) as can
be decided and determined by one of skill in the art. The dosing can also vary over time, for
example, starting with a once weekly dose for a period of time (e.g., for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks)
followed by dosing once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once
every five weeks, or once every six weeks.
[00183]     The Compound of formula A and anti-CD20 antibodies can be formulated into
pharmaceutical compositions for administration to mammals, including humans. The

via an implanted reservoir. In some embodiments, the Compound of formula A is administered
orally. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular,
intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial
injection or infusion techniques.
[00185]     Parenteral formulations can be a single bolus dose, an infusion or a loading bolus dose
followed with a maintenance dose. These compositions can be administered at specific fixed or
variable intervals, e.g., once a day, or on an "as needed" basis. In some embodiments, the anti
CD20 antibody is administered intravenously (IV).
[00186]     Certain pharmaceutical compositions can be orally administered in an acceptable
dosage form including, e.g., capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. Certain
pharmaceutical compositions also can be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such
                                                   - 42 -

compositions can be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable
preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, and/or other conventional
solubilizing or dispersing agents.
[00187]     A specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a
variety of factors, including the particular therapeutic agents used, the patient's age, body weight,
general health, sex, and diet, and the time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination,
and the severity of the particular disease being treated. Judgment of such factors by medical
caregivers is within the ordinary skill in the art. The amount will also depend on the individual
patient to be treated, the route of administration, the type of formulation, the characteristics of the
compound used, the severity of the disease, and the desired effect. The amount used can be
determined by pharmacological and pharmacokinetic principles well known in the art.
[00188]     In some embodiments, the anti-CD20 antibody is administered at a dose of less than
187.5 mg/m 2 , 75 mg/m 2 , 37.5 mg/m 2 , 15 mg/m 2, 7.5 mg/m 2, 3.75 mg/m 2 . In some embodiments,
the dose administered can be 187.5 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 , 75 mg/m 2 to 37.5 mg/m2, 75 mg/m 2 to 15
mg/m 2 , 75 mg/m 2 to 7.5 mg/m2, or 75 mg/m 2 to 3.75 mg/m2.

                                       Biological Evaluation
               Combination of a Compound of Formula A and Anti-CD20 Antibody
Example 1: S-isomer of a compound of formula A and Ublituximab Combinations Deplete B
Cells from Whole Blood
[00238]     A flow cytometry assay was used to compare the ability of S-isomer of compound of
formula A , Ublituximab (Ubx), and combinations thereof to deplete B cells from human whole
blood (HWB). In this assay, 50 tl of HWB sample was treated with either S-isomer of a
compound of formula A (1000 nM), UBX (100 [tg/ml to 0.1 [tg/ml), or UBX in combination with
S-isomer of a compound of formula A at 1000 nM and incubated for 24 hrs at 37'C and 5% CO 2 .
20 tl of treated sample was taken in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and labeled with CD45 FITC and
CD19 PE or CD20 FITC antibody and incubated in the dark for 1 hour at RT. 1 ml of red blood
cell (RBC) lysing solution was added, and tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
The supernatant was aspirated, and 250 pl of PBS was added to the pellet. The tubes were
vortexed, and 5000 events were acquired on a Guava easyCyte TM flow cytometer and analyzed
with Incyte Software.
[00239]     Gated population of CD45-positive cells were further analyzed for CD 19. The number
of cells that were positive for CD45 and CD 19 was calculated, and the data was expressed as the
percentage of CD 19 positive cells in the population. CD20-positive populations were gated with
fluorescence positive minus unlabeled cells, and the data was expressed as the percentage of
                                                - 56 -

CD20-positive cells in the population. The loss of CD 19 / CD20 population from control was
calculated and expressed as % depletion with respect to control.
[00240]    The results are shown in Figure 1. S-isomer of a compound of formula A is not
cytotoxic to B-cells at concentrations up to 10 tiM. Therefore, a reduction in CD 19-positive or
CD20-positive HWB B-cells was not observed with 1 iM S-isomer of a compound of formula A.
The UBX anti-CD20 antibody resulted in only 20-30% depletion of B-cells at doses from 1 to
100,000 ng/ml, but it caused a dose-dependent reduction in CD20+ B-cells. Combination of 1000
nM S-isomer of a compound of formula A with 10 ng/ml UBX resulted in the potentiation of
CD 19+ cell depletion, and combination of 1000 nM S-isomer of a compound of formula A with
0.1-10 ng/ml concentrations UBX resulted in a modest additive effect on CD20+ cell depletion.
These results demonstrate that the combination of S-isomer of a compound of formula A (1000
nM) with UBX (10 ng/ml) displayed potentiation of CD 19-positive cell depletion and a modest
effect on CD20-positive cell depletion.
Example 2: S-isomer of a Compound of Formula A and UBX Combinations Effect LPS-Induced
B Cell Proliferation
[00241]    Flow cytometry was used to study the effect of S-isomer of a compound of formula A,
Ubx, and combinations thereof on LPS-induced proliferation of CD19 and CD20 cells in HWB.
In these experiments, 250 tl of diluted (1:3.5 with RPMI-HG Media) HWB sample was treated
with either S-isomer of a compound of formula A (10 [tM to 0.1 tM ) , UBX (100 [tg/ml to 0.1
ptg/ml) or UBX with S-isomer of a compound of formula A at 1000 nM for 15 minutes followed
by 20 ptg/ml LPS induction and incubated for 72 hrs at 37'C and 5% CO 2 . 20 ptl of treated
sample was taken in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and labeled with CD20 FITC and CD19 PE
antibody and incubated in the dark for 1 hour at RT. 1 ml of RBC lysing solution was added and
tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatant was aspirated, and 250 ptl of PBS
was added to the pellet. Tubes were vortexed, and 5000 events were acquired on a Guava
easyCyte T M flow cytometer and analyzed with Incyte Software.
[00242]    Gated population of lymphocytes positive cells were further analyzed for CD19 and
CD20. Cells positive for CD19 and/or CD20 were calculated, and data were expressed as the
percentage positive cells in the population. The loss of positive population from control with
LPS induction was calculated and expressed as % inhibition with respect to control.
                                                - 57 -

[00243]     The results are shown in Figures 2 and 3. S-isomer of a compound of formula A (1
piM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS induced CD 19+ B-cell proliferation using HWB
(~60%). Addition of 1 [tM S-isomer of a compound of formula A to different concentrations of
UBX did not increase the response beyond ~60% as a result of the minimal effect of UBX on
CD19+ cells. However, an additive effect of the combination on CD19+ cell proliferation was
noticed at the 100 ng/ml concentration of UBX.
[00244]     In contrast to its effect on CD 19+ cell proliferation, S-isomer of a compound of
formula A displayed ~40% inhibition of CD20+ cells at 1 M. An additive effect of the
combination of 1 [tM S-isomer of a compound of formula A with UBX was evident, especially
for the 0.1 ng/ml dose.
Example 3: S-isomer of a Compound Formula A and UBX Combinations Increase Apoptosis in
Cancer Cells
[00245]     In order to determine the effect of S-isomer of a compound of formula A, UBX, and
combinations thereof on apoptosis in cancer cells, an in situ caspase-3 kit (Millipore) was used.
Cells were plated in a 6 well plate at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/ml, treated with either S
isomer of a compound of formula A (1000 nM), UBX (100 jig/ml to 0.1 jig/ml), or UBX with S
isomer of a compound of formula A at 1000 nM, and incubated for 24 hrs at 37'C and 5% CO 2 .
The cells were then transferred to microfuge tubes to receive 10 ptl of freshly prepared FLICA T M
reagent and incubated for 1 hour at 37'C and 5% CO 2 away from light. After extensive washes
with wash buffer, test samples were adjusted to equalize the number of cells in PBS. 100 l of
each cell suspension was transferred to black 96-well plates in duplicates, and the fluorescence
was read at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm in a plate
reader. The fluorescence intensity for a DMSO control was subtracted from that of test
compounds. Data was expressed as a percent of the maximum response (100%) and plotted
accordingly.
[00246]     The results are shown in Figure 4. UBX displayed a limited ability to induce Caspase
3 activity in the cell lines tested. Caspase-3 activity was increase by 40-75% by incubating cell
lines with 1 iM S-isomer of a compound of formula A. A synergistic effect of the combination
was noticed at 100 ng/ml UBX concentration in Daudi cells while an additive effect was seen in
RPMI-8226, Raji, and U226B1 cell lines at higher concentrations (10 & 100 ng/ml) of UBX.

Example 4: S-isomer of a Compound of Formula A and UBX Combination Causes Cell Cycle
Arrest
[00247]     A cell cycle assay reagent (Millipore) was used to determine the effect of S-isomer of
a compound of formula A, UBX, and combinations thereof on the cell cycle in cancerous cells.
In these experiments, cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/ml,
treated with either S-isomer of a compound of formula A (10 iM to 0.1 iM ), UBX (100 jig/ml
to 0.1 pig/ml), or UBX with S-isomer of a compound of formula A at 1000 nM, and incubated for
72 hrs at 37'C and 5% CO 2 . The cells were transferred to microfuge tubes to receive 50 ptl of
cell cycle reagent and incubated for 30 minutes at RT away from light. Cells were then diluted
with 300-400 pl PBS, and a minimum of 10,000 events were acquired on a Guava* easyCyteTM
flow cytometer. The data was analyzed with Express Pro software and the percentage of the cell
population in different cell cycle stages with respect to control was presented in histograms.
[00248]      Figures 5-10 show the results obtained with U266B1, and Raji cells. In addition,
Tables 1-12 below provide the quantitative results obtained using U266B1, DB, Raji, and Daudi

[00249]    These results demonstrate that of cells contacted with S-isomer of a compound of
formula A, resulted in a dose-dependent G2/M arrest. In addition, treatment with UBX for 72
hours caused a modest G2/M arrest in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DB) and U266B1 cells,
while it increased the number of Sub GO cells in Raji and Daudi cells. Combination with 1 [iM S
isomer of a compound of formula A accentuated the UBX response across the cell-lines tested.
Example 5: S-isomer of a Compound Formula A and UBX Combinations Synergistically
Increase Apoptosis in Cancer Cells
[00250]    In order to determine the effect of S-isomer of a compound of formula A, UBX, and
combinations thereof on apoptosis in cancer cells, an in situ caspase-3 kit (Millipore) was used.
Cells were plated in a 6 well plate at a concentration of 0.5 x 106 cells/ml, treated with either S
isomer of a compound of formula A (200-5000 nM), UBX (10,000 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml), or UBX
with S-isomer of a compound of formula A (as indicated), and incubated for 24 hrs at 37'C and
5% CO 2 . The cells were then transferred to microfuge tubes to receive 10 ptl of freshly prepared
FLICA TM reagent and incubated for 1 hour at 37'C and 5% CO 2 away from light. After
extensive washes with wash buffer, test samples were adjusted to equalize the number of cells in
PBS. 100 1tl  of each cell suspension was transferred to black 96-well plates in duplicates, and the
fluorescence was read at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520
nm in a plate reader. The fluorescence intensity for a DMSO control was subtracted from that of
test compounds. Data was expressed as caspase-3 activity a combination index (C.I.) calculated.
                                                -  65  -

C.I.'s less than one indicate synergism, of one indicate additive effects and greater than one
indicate antagonism.
[00251]     The results are shown in Figure 11 and Tables 13-15 for DBCL cell line LYl. UBX
induced caspase-3 activity in LYl. Caspase-3 activity was synergistically increased in the
presence of UBX (all concentrations) and S-isomer of a compound of formula A (1000 nM).
[00252]     The results are shown in Figure 12 and Tables 16-18 for the Burkitt lymphoma cell
line Raji. UBX induced caspase-3 activity in Raji LYl. Caspase-3 activity was synergistically
increased in the presence of UBX (all concentrations) and S-isomer of a compound of formula A
(200 nM).
