SOCKET FUSION JIG
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
 [0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2015231503, the
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
 BACKGROUND
 [0002] Heat fusable plastic pipe has been used in industrial, commercial and residential
applications for a number of years. Methods of heat fusing plastic pipe include butt fusion,
socket fusion and electrofusion. Socket fusion jigs are generally used to fuse pipe after the pipe
has been installed. In other words, the socket fusion jig is typically used to fuse a coupling to an
already installed pipe. While there are a number of socket fusion jigs on the market right now,
there are disadvantages that exist with each. For example, those that exist currently do not allow
for installation in close quarters because the pipe must be spaced significantly apart so that the
jaws can unclamp far enough to clear the entire outer diameter of the pipe to be removed. Other
jigs require power drills or impact drivers to operate and thus require an external source of
power. Thus, there is a need for a socket fusion jig that can be utilized in close quarters, that
will not deform pipe and that can be used in tight spaces without an external source of power.
OBJECT
 [0003] It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above need, or
provide a useful alternative.
SUMMARY
 [0004] In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a socket fusion jig
comprising:
       a pipe support comprising a left pipe clamp jaw and a right pipe clamp jaw for engaging a
pipe therebetween;
       a coupling support comprising a left coupling clamp jaw and a right coupling clamp jaw
for engaging a coupling therebetween;

                                                    2
       a first slide, wherein the left and right pipe clamp jaws move along the first slide toward
and away from each other; and
       a second slide, wherein the left and right coupling clamp jaws move along the second slide
toward and away from each other.
[0005] In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a socket fusion jig comprising a
pipe support. The pipe support comprises a left pipe clamp jaw and a right pipe clamp jaw. The
socket fusion jig further comprises a coupling support and a first input link. The first input link
is rotatable about one of its axes. Rotation about the axis of the first input link causes the
coupling support to move laterally relative to the pipe support.
[0006] In other embodiments, the present disclosure provides a socket fusion jig comprising a
pipe support and a coupling support. The pipe support comprises a left pipe clamp jaw and a
right pipe clamp jaw. The coupling support comprises a left coupling clamp jaw and a right
coupling clamp jaw. The socket fusion jig further comprises a first input link that is rotatable
about one of its axes. Rotation about the axis of the first input link causes the coupling support
to move laterally relative to the pipe support.
[0007] In still other embodiments, the present disclosure provides a socket fusion jig comprising
a pipe support and a coupling support the pipe support comprises a left pipe clamp jaw and a
right pipe clamp jaw. The socket fusion jig further comprises a pipe clamp screw. Rotation of
the pipe clamp screw causes the left pipe clamp jaw and the right pipe clamp jaw to move in
opposite directions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0035] The current disclosure is directed to a socket fusion jig used for mechanically joining
heat fusible plastic pipe. The socket fusion jig described herein is a lightweight socket fusion jig
that is manually operated and requires no external source of power. The socket fusion jig is
adapted to be used in tight spaces in connection with installed pipe that is fixed in place.
[0036] Referring now to the drawings, socket fusion jig 2 is used to connect a pipe 4 to a
coupling 6. Pipe 4 has longitudinal center line 8, and coupling 6 has longitudinal center line 10.
Socket fusion jig 2 comprises a gear box 12, with a gear arrangement disposed therein. The gear
arrangement will be described in more detail herein below. Socket fusion jig 2 includes a pipe
saddle 14 and a coupling saddle 20. Pipe saddle 14 is a removable and replaceable pipe saddle
14, which comprises a pair of pipe saddle plates 15 and 16 respectively. Pipe saddle plates 15
and 16 have arcuate surfaces 17 and 18 respectively that collectively comprise the curved or
arcuate surface 19 of saddle 14. Surfaces 17 and 18 define an arc of less than 1800 and
preferably define an arc of about 1650 such that the ends of the pipe saddle 14 will be positioned
below longitudinal center line 8 of a pipe 4 positioned in saddle 14.
[0037] Coupling saddle 20 may comprise a pair of coupling saddle plates 21 and 22. Coupling
plates 21 and 22 have arcuate surfaces 23 and 24 which collectively define the curved, or
arcuate surface 25 of coupling saddle 20. Surfaces 23 and 24 may define an arc of less than
1800 and preferably about 165', such that the ends 46 thereof are positioned below the axis 10
of coupling 6. Pipe saddle 14 is removably connected to a pivot or jaw block 26 and coupling

                                                  5
saddle 20 is removably connected to pivot or jaw block 28. Because pipe saddle 14 and
coupling saddle 20 are removable, socket fusion jig 2 is adapted to join pipes to couplings over a
range of pipe diameters. Socket fusion jig 2 may be especially useful for joining couplings to
pipe ranging from about 63 millimeters to about 125 millimeters, and may be used to join a
coupling to pipe outside the ranges mentioned.
 [0038] A pair of oppositely rotating four bar linkages 32 are utilized to move pipe saddle 14 and
coupling saddle 20 laterally relative to one another. Oppositely rotating four bar linkages 32
comprise a first four bar linkage 34 for moving pipe saddle 14 and a second four bar linkage 36
for moving coupling saddle 20. A handle 38 is utilized to operate a gear arrangement housed in
gear box 12. The gear arrangement in gear box 12 is preferably a worm gear set which will be
described in more detail herein below. Rotation of handle 38 will cause synchronized
movement of first and second four bar linkages 34 and 36 respectively. Pipe 4 will be restrained
in pipe saddle 14. Pipe 4 is installed pipe, so that pipe saddle 14 when attached to pipe 4 is
fixed against movement. Rotation of handle 38 will therefore cause coupling saddle 20, along
with coupling 6 therein, to move linearly towards and away from pipe saddle 14 and pipe 4.
Longitudinal central axes 8 and 10 will stay in a co-linear relationship as coupling 6 is moved.
 [0039] A pipe restraint 40 is used to hold pipe 4 in pipe saddle 14. Likewise, a coupling
restraint 42 is used to hold coupling 6 in coupling saddle 20. Pipe and coupling restraints 40
and 42 may comprise roller chains which may be for example nickel-plated, lube-free roller
chains. Use of a lube-free roller chain prevents chain lubrication from contaminating a fusion
joint. Roller chains 40 and 42 are conformable to the shape of pipe 4 and coupling 6
respectively. The combination of pipe saddle 14 and chain 40 will engage the outer surface of
pipe 4 over about at least 2750 and preferably as much as about 325'. Likewise, the
combination of coupling saddle 20 and chain 42 will engage the outer surface of coupling 6 over
at least about 275' and preferably as much as about 325'. Because a significant amount of the
outer surfaces of the pipe 4 and coupling 6 are engaged during the joining process, deformation,
which is a concern with prior art socket fusion jigs, may be prevented.
 [0040] Surface 25 of coupling saddle 20 is a curved engagement surface with a radius of
curvature that matches the radius of curvature of the outer surface of coupling 6. Surface 25
preferably passes through an arc of at least about 1650. Ends 46 of coupling saddle 20 are thus
positioned below center line 10 of coupling 6. Surface 19 of pipe saddle 14 is a curved

                                                  6
engagement surface, and preferably has a radius of curvature that matches the radius of
curvature of the outer diameter of pipe 4. Curved engagement surface 19 has an arc of less than
 1800, and in one embodiment has an arc of at least about 165'. Ends 44 of pipe saddle 14 will
thus be positioned below the longitudinal central axis 8 of pipe 4. Curved surface 19 mates with
the outer surface of pipe 4, and curved surface 25 mates with the outer surface of coupling 6.
Roller chain 40 will conform to the shape of pipe 4 around about 130' to 160' of the outer
surface of pipe 4. Likewise, roller chain 42 will conform to the outer surface of coupling 6 and
will engage approximately 130' to 160' thereof. Curved surfaces 19 and 25 may be serrated
surfaces to aid in retaining pipe 4 and coupling 6 therein.
 [0041] Gear box 12 may comprise a face plate 50 attached to a gear box body 52 with screws,
other fasteners, or other means known in the art. FIG. 8 is a view looking at face plate 50 with
gear box body 52 removed. FIG. 10 is a cross-section taken through lines 10-10 of FIG. 9.
 Socket fusion jig 2 includes a worm gear drive 58 which may comprise a pair of worm gears 60.
Worm gears 60 may comprise a right or first worm gear 62 which will drive first four bar
linkage 34 and a second or left worm gear 64 which will drive second four bar linkage 36. First
worm gear 62 rotates about a longitudinal central axis 63 and second worm gear 64 rotates about
longitudinal central axis 65. Axes 63 and 65 are parallel and are coplanar. A worm 66 is
positioned between first and second worm gears 62 and 64.
 [0042] Rotation of handle 38 will rotate worm 66 which will rotate worm gear 62 and 64 about
their respective longitudinal central axis 63 and 65 in opposite directions. Thus, worm gears 62
and 64 may be referred to as oppositely rotating worm gears 62 and 64. Worm gear drive 58
may be configured to provide a mechanical advantage such that the operator can create a fusion
on large pipe sizes, up to at least 125 millimeters in diameter, with minimal effort. For example,
worm gears 62 and 64 and worm 66 may be configured such that a mechanical advantage of
approximately 40 to 1 may be achieved. In addition, worm drive 58 is designed so that it cannot
be back driven by any external pressure, and will hold pipe 4 and coupling 6 in place during the
joining operation.
 [0043] Handle 38 is connected to a shaft 70 in a manner known in the art, and for example may
have a square pin 71 connected thereto inserted into a square opening in shaft 70. Shaft 70 has
longitudinal central axis 69, and is pinned or otherwise fixed to worm 68 such that rotation of
handle 38 will cause rotation of worm 66, in turn causing opposite rotation of worm gears 62

                                                  7
and 64. A pair of shouldered bushings 72 are pressed into gear box body 52 and shaft 70 will
rotate therein. Longitudinal central axis 69, about which handle 70 rotates, is perpendicular to
axes 8 and 10 of pipe 4 and coupling 6, respectively.
[0044] Worm gears 62 and 64 are keyed to shafts 78 and 80 respectively with keys 81. Shafts
78 and 80 have longitudinal central axis 63 and 65 respectively. Shafts 78 and 80 are essentially
identical except the location of the key 81 may be different. As such, the details of shafts 78 and
80 will be explained with respect only to shaft 78. The features on shaft 80 will be identified on
the drawings with the numbers used for the features on shaft 78. Shafts 78 and 80 have square
ends 82 connected to the four bar linkages 34 and 36. Bushings 84 are pressed into gear box
plate 50 and gear box body 52, and shafts 78 and 80 rotate therein. Shaft 78 may have retaining
rings 86 disposed thereabout to hold key 81 in place.
[0045] In the embodiment shown shaft 78 is connected to an input link 92 of four bar linkage
34. Cap screws and flat washers or other fasteners known in the art may be utilized to hold
input link 92 to shafts 78 and 80. The details of four bar linkage 34 will be explained and it is
understood that the details of four bar linkage 36 are generally identical.
[0046] Input link 92 may comprise two separate links designated as 92A and 92B which act as a
single link 92 in four bar linkage 34. Input link 92 has first end 94 with a square opening 95
therein adapted to receive the ends of shaft 78 so that rotation of shaft 78 will cause the rotation
of input link 92 about longitudinal axis 63. Input link 92 has a second end 96 connected to first
pivot block 26. Input link 92 has a longitudinal center line 97. A pin 98 extends through first
pivot block 26. Pin 98 has reduced diameter portions 100 at both ends thereof, which define
shoulders 101. A pair of bushings 102, which may be shouldered bushings 102 are press fit into
pivot block 26. A cap screw 103 or other fastener may be used to connect second end 96 of
input link 92 to shaft 98. Shaft 98 may rotate relative to input link 92, and shaft 98 may rotate
in bushings 102 such that shaft 98 rotates relative to pivot block 26.
[0047] Four bar linkage 34 includes a follower link 104 which may be comprised of two
separate links 104A and 104B that act as one single follower link 104. Follower link 104 has
first end 106. A shaft 108 with reduced diameter portions 110 at each end thereof extend
through an opening at or near first end 106 of links 104A and 104B. Reduced diameter portions
110 define shoulder 111. Cap screws 112 are inserted into each end of shaft 108 to press

                                                  8
follower link 104 against shoulders 111. Bushings 114, which are oppositely facing shouldered
bushings are received about shaft 108 and pressed into gear box plate 50 and gear box body 52.
A pair of retaining rings 116 may be utilized to prevent movement of bushings 114 and engage
the shoulders on bushings 114. Shaft 108 rotates in bushings 114. The longitudinal center line
105 of follower link 104 is parallel or is substantially parallel to a longitudinal center line 97 of
input link 92.
[0048] A pin 124 has reduced diameter portions 125 that define shoulders 126. Reduced
diameter portions 125 of pins 124 extend through openings at or near the second ends 120 of
follower link 104. A cap screw or other fastener is inserted into shaft 124 to hold link 104
against shoulders 126. A pair of bushings 128 are pressed on or otherwise fixed in pivot block
26 and shaft 108 rotates in bushings 128.
[0049] Four bar linkage 34 as described herein comprises input link 92 and follower link 104.
The third link is defined by the portions of gear box 12 that extend between first end 106 of
follower link 104 and first ends 94 of input link 92. The fourth link comprises the portions of
pivot block 26 between upper ends 96 and 120 of input link 92 and follower link 104
respectively.
[0050] The identical numbers are utilized on second four bar linkage 36 except that the
designations C and D are utilized in place of A and B to allow for ease of identification. It is
evident that the operation of four bar linkages 34 and 36 are identical and that first four bar
linkage 34 moves pivot block 26 while second four bar linkage 36 moves pivot block 28.
[0051] A check plate 132 may be integrally formed with or connected to coupling saddle plate
21 which may be described as inner coupling saddle plate 21. Check plate 132 is used to
provide a stop for coupling 6. Coupling 6 when properly positioned during the joining operation
with pipe 4 will be pressed against check plate 132.
[0052] First pivot block 26 has a lug 134 extending therefrom that may be integrally formed
therewith. Lug 134 has an opening 136 therethrough. A knob 138 which may be referred to as
an adjustment knob 138 has an internal thread (not shown). A thrust bearing 142 is mounted at
an upper end of knob 138. Chain 40 is connected to an upper end 144 of a rod 146 which may
be an all thread rod 146. Pivot block 28 likewise has a lug 162. Lug 162 has an opening 150
therein. A second knob 138 which may be referred to as knob 138A for ease of reference has an

                                                  9
internal thread and thrust bearing 142 mounted at an upper end thereof. Chain 42 is connected
to an upper end 144 of an all thread rod 146 which may be referred to as an all thread rod 146A
for ease of reference.
 [0053] Pivot block 26 has a pair of teeth, or hooks 152 and pivot block 28 has teeth, or hooks
 154. In operation of socket fusion jig 2, chain 40 will be positioned on teeth 152 and chain 42
will be positioned on teeth 154.
 [0054] An automatic stab depth indicator 156 comprises a depth guide, or depth pin 156 with
markings or stab depth indications 158 thereon. Markings 158 are identified with the size of the
pipe 4 to be joined to a coupling 6. Pin 154 has a plurality of notches 160 associated with each
stab depth indication.
 [0055] A release pin 162 which may be spring loaded or otherwise biased toward notches 160,
hold depth pin 156 in place to automatically set a stab depth. When release pin 162 is raised, a
return spring 164 will force pin 156 to retract.
 [0056] The socket fusion jig 2 as described herein may be used in the process of fusing or
joining pipe 4 and coupling 6. Socket fusion jig 2 is generally to be used with a pipe 4 that is
installed and fixed against movement. Socket fusion jig 2 is a variable size jig in that it can be
used for a range of pipe sizes. As previously explained pipe saddle 14 and coupling saddle 20
are removable. Pipe saddle 14 and coupling saddle 20 are selected so that the radius of
curvature of the engagement surfaces 19 and 25 match the radius of the pipe 4 and coupling 6 to
be joined. Socket fusion jig 2 may be used with pipe sizes over a wide diameter range, and
preferably from about 63 millimeters to at least about 125 millimeters.
 [0057] Coupling 6 is first attached to socket fusion jig 2 by placing the coupling 6 in saddle 20.
Coupling 6 should be pressed against check plate 132 to ensure proper stab depth. Chain 42 is
positioned over coupling 6 and will conform to the shape thereof. Chain 42 is attached to the
chain hooks or teeth 154 on pivot block 28. Chain 42 is tightened by rotating clamp knob 138A.
As explained previously, curved surface 25 of saddle 20 is adapted to mate with the outer
surface of coupling 6 and therefore engage coupling 6 over approximately 1500 to 175' and
preferably at least about 165'. Chain 42 will engage the outer surface of coupling 6 over
approximately 130' to 1600 thereof. Thus, coupling 6 can be securely fixed in saddle 20 and
because the engagement of approximately 2800 to 3400 with coupling 6, socket fusion jig 2 will

                                                  10
prevent any deformation of coupling 6. Thus, socket fusion jig is a deformation free socket
fusion jig.
[0058] The proper stab depth for pipe 4 into coupling 6 may be set by utilizing stab depth pin
158. For example, if a 125 mm pipe is to be joined, pin 158 will have a 125 mm marked notch
thereon. Stab depth pin 156 will be pushed inwardly through pivot block toward pivot block 28.
The pin will be pushed in until the 125 mm notch is reached, which will be recognized by the
125 mm mark seen on pin 156 as it passes through pivot block 26.
[0059] Pin 156 is retained by two guide plates 166 and 168 respectively, one each positioned on
the sides of pivot block 26. Pin 156 is pushed into the selected depth which corresponds to a
selected marking on pin 158. Once stab depth indicator pin 158 is set, handle 38 is rotated to
bring saddles 14 and 20 together. Rotation of handle 38 will move saddle 20 linearly toward
saddle 14, so that longitudinal central axis 10 of coupling 6 stays in alignment with longitudinal
axis 8 of pipe 4. This insures the proper alignment of pipe 4 and coupling 6 during the joining
operation. Jaws 26 and 28 are brought together until stab depth indicator pin 156 touches stop
plate 169 on pivot block 28.
[0060] Once the proper stab depth has been set, pipe 4 is loaded into saddle 14. Chain 40 is
wrapped around pipe 4 and is attached to teeth 152 on pivot block 26. Clamp knob 138 is
tightened to retain pipe 4 in saddle 14. Prior to tightening chain 40 over pipe 4, pipe 4 is to be
pressed against the coupling with stab depth indicator pin 156 still engaging plate 168. Pipe 4 is
then clamped in place.
[0061] Once pipe 4 and coupling 6 are both properly clamped in jaw blocks 26 and 28
respectively, handle 38 is rotated so that four bar linkages 34 and 36 move simultaneously. Stab
depth pin 156 is released by moving the quick release latch 162 upwardly. Handle 38 is rotated
counter-clockwise from the view in FIG. 2 to move jaws to a fully open position. A heater 170,
which is shown in dashed lines in FIGS. 13 and 14 is inserted between coupling 6 and pipe 4.
Handle 38 is then rotated to bring jaw blocks 26 and 28 together, thus bringing saddles 14 and
20 together. Because pipe 4 is fixed against motion, the rotation of handle 38, which causes
synchronized movement of four bar linkages 34 and 36, moves saddle 20 and thus coupling 6
linearly directly toward pipe 4. As is apparent from the drawings, the longitudinal central axis
10 of coupling 6 and longitudinal central axis 8 of pipe 4 will stay in fixed co-linear

                                                  11
relationship. Handle 38 is rotated so that heater 130 is inserted into coupling 6 and disposed
about pipe 4. Heater 170 is allowed to soak for a proper amount of time.
[0062] Once pipe 4 and coupling 6 are heated, jaws 26 and 28 are opened quickly and heater
170 is removed. Jaws 26 and 28 are then moved together until stops 172 on pivot block 26 are
pressed against stop plate 169 on pivot block 28 to provide proper fusion and stab depth. Pipe 4
and coupling 6 are allowed to cool for a proper amount of time after which the pipe and
coupling are unclamped. Because handle 38 is positioned beneath saddles 14 and 20, ease of
installation and operation are greater than that with prior art socket fusion jigs.
[0063] An additional embodiment of a socket fusion jig identified as socket fusion jig 180 is
shown and described with reference to FIGS. 15-26. Socket fusion jig 180 comprises a pipe
support 184, which is a pipe jaw assembly in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 15-26. The
socket fusion jig 180 also comprises a coupling support 186, which is a coupling jaw assembly
in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 15-26.
[0064] Socket fusion jig 180 operates similarly to socket fusion jig 2. Thus, socket fusion jig
180 includes a gear box 12, first and second four bar linkages 34 and 36 for moving pipe support
184 and coupling support 186. Rotation of handle 38 causes synchronized rotation of four bar
linkages 34 and 36 and causes relative movement between pipe support 184, which may also be
referred to as a pipe jaw assembly, and coupling support 186, which may also be referred to as a
coupling jaw assembly.
[0065] Referring now to FIG. 17, the details of one embodiment of the of pipe jaw assembly
184 are described below. Pipe jaw assembly 184 comprises a pair of opposed pipe clamp jaws
190. The opposed pipe clamp jaws 190 may be referred to as first, or left pipe clamp jaw 192,
and second or right pipe clamp jaw 194. Pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194 may also be referred to
simply as pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194. A tightening mechanism 196 is used to move opposed
pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194 transversely toward and away from each other.
[0066] Left pipe clamp jaw 192 and right pipe clamp jaw 194 are substantially similar.
Therefore, the same numbers are used to identify the features on right pipe clamp jaw 194 as
those in the left pipe clamp jaw, but with the added subscript "a." The left pipe clamp jaw 192
comprises an inner surface 198, which is a generally V-shaped inner surface adapted to engage a
pipe positioned between clamping jaws 192 and 194. The left pipe clamp jaw 192 also

                                                  12
comprises an outer surface 200. Inner surface 198 is a serrated surface to provide for efficient
gripping engagement. Left pipe clamp jaw 192 has a clamp portion 202 and a base 204. V
shaped inner surface 198 is defined on clamp portion 202. An opening 206 is defined in base
204, which in the embodiment shown, is a hex-shaped opening. A passage 208 extends through
base 204 to allow tightening mechanism 196 to pass therethrough. Base 204 has opposed
channels 210 and 212 which define slots or grooves to receive a first slide 214. Left and right
pipe jaws 192 and 194 move transversely on a first slide 214 as further described herein.
[0067] Tightening mechanism 196 extends through left pipe clamp jaw 192 and right pipe
clamp jaw 194. Rotation of tightening mechanism 196 causes the pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194
to move inward and outward relative to one another along first slide 214. Tightening
mechanism 196 comprises a pipe clamp screw 216, a first or left hand drive nut 218, a second or
right hand drive nut 220, a left hand snap ring 224, a right hand snap ring 226, a left hand
adjustable handle screw 228, a right hand adjustable handle screw 230, a left pipe clamp jaw
handle 232 and a right pipe clamp jaw handle 234.
[0068] The pipe clamp screw 216 passes through hexagonal opening 206 and passage 208 in
base 204. A portion of the pipe clamp screw 216 extends outward past both the left hand and
right hand pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194. Pipe clamp screw 216 is symmetrical in that one side
has a left hand thread and the other a right hand thread.
[0069] First, or left hand drive nut 218 is positioned within hexagonal opening 206 in base 204
of the left pipe clamp jaw 192. Left hexagonal opening 206 contains a recess 236 which
receives the left hand snap ring 224. Left hand snap ring 224 is positioned outward relative to
the left hand drive nut 218 and thereby holds left hand drive nut 218 in place. Left hand
adjustable handle screw 228 threadedly connects left pipe clamp jaw handle 232 to pipe clamp
screw 216. The arrangement and connection of the right hand drive nut 220, right hand snap
ring 226, right hand adjustable screw 230 and right pipe clamp jaw handle 234 are similar to the
corresponding left hand components.
[0070] The initial positions of the left hand drive nut 218 and the right hand drive nut 220
determine the final, tightened positions of the pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194. The left and right
hand drive nuts 218 and 220 are positioned on the pipe clamp screw 216 so that the left and right

                                                   13
hand pipe jaws 192 and 194 will apply equal clamping force to a pipe when pipe jaws 192 and
 194 are moved together to clamp a pipe.
 [0071] Pipe clamp screw 216 has a non-threaded center portion 240, a right hand thread on the
left side 242 thereof, and a left hand thread on the right side 244 thereof. In the embodiment
described, the threads are buttress threads and are tapered on one side and square on the other.
The square threads provide for a greater clamping strength when the pipe jaws 192 and 194 are
clamped to a pipe, while the tapered side allows for an easier release. Thus, the square face of
the thread on the pipe clamp screw 216 will face inward relative to the jaws 192 and 194.
 [0072] As understood from the figures, rotation in the first direction pushes left and right drive
nuts 218 and 220 inward, which will press on pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194 and push them
inwardly towards one another. Rotation in the opposite direction will cause drive nuts 218 and
220 to push on left and right snap rings 224 and 226 and move pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194
outwardly relative to each other. Left pipe clamp jaw handle 232 and right pipe clamp jaw
handle 234 are used to rotate the pipe clamp screw.
 [0073] Thus, rotation of the pipe clamp screw 216 in a first direction causes left and right pipe
clamp jaws 192 and 194 to move together to clamp and hold a pipe like pipe 4 in the
embodiment of FIG. 15. For example, rotation of left pipe clamp jaw handle 232 to the right, or
clockwise in the view of FIG. 15, causes left and right pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194 to move
together. Rotation in a second or opposite direction will cause the pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194
to move transversely away from each other. The thread direction may be reversed. In some
embodiments, it is only necessary that the left and right thread directions be different, so that
rotation of the single screw 216 will move both of pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194.
 [0074] If pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194 do not clamp with relatively equal force, pipe clamp
jaws 192 and 194 can be adjusted by removing one of snap rings 224 and 226, and adjusting the
relative position of left and right drive nuts 218 and 220. For example, upon removal of snap
ring 224, left hand pipe clamp 192 may be freely moved toward non-threaded center 240 until it
clears left hand drive nut 216. The left hand drive nut, because it is a hex nut, can be rotated in
 1/6 rotation increments in either direction until the optimum clamping location is reached. The
hex shape of the drive nuts allows for fine adjustment of the positions of pipe clamp jaws 192
and 194.

                                                  14
 [0075] First slide 214 to which pipe jaw assembly 184 is attached comprises a slide, or slide bar
246 having a screw retaining block 248 connected thereto with a pair of dowel pins 250 or other
known mechanisms. Screw retaining block 248 is fixed to slide 246 with dowel pins 250 at or
near the center of the jaw slide bar 246. Screw retaining block 248 has a curved, or arcuate
recess 252 in which non-threaded center 240 rests and rotates. Collars 254 are positioned on
both sides of retaining block 248 to aid in holding the pipe clamp screw 216 in place. The left
and right pipe clamp jaws also attach to the clamp jaw slide bar 246.
 [0076] First slide 214 is a generally T-shaped slide with leg 256 and T-portion 258 with arms
260. Arms 260 are received in channels 210 and 212. An upper surface 262 of T-portion 258
has a recess 264 so as to reduce friction when pipe clamp jaws 192 and 194 slide thereover. The
width and thickness of legs 256 are such that during clamping, tilting of the pipe clamp jaws 192
and 194 is minimized or prevented. First slide 214 has a connecting block 264 extending
downwardly from T-portion 258. A pivot or jaw block 266 is connected thereto.
 [0077] First slide 214 attaches to the pivot block 266 with fasteners extending therethrough into
connecting block 264. A pin 268 also extends upwardly through pivot block 266 into first slide
214. Four bar linkage 34 connect in the same manner as described with reference to socket
fusion jig 2. In the embodiment of FIG. 15, the fourth link of four bar linkage 34 are the
portions of pivot block 266 between the upper ends 96 and 120 of input link 92 and follower
link 104.
 [0078] The details of coupling support or coupling jaw assembly 186 are similar to that
described with reference to pipe support 184. Coupling jaw assembly 186 comprises a pair of
opposed coupling clamp jaws 290, which may be referred to as first or left coupling clamp jaw
292 and right coupling clamp jaw 294. Jaws 292 and 294 may be referred to simply as coupling
jaws 292 and 294. A tightening mechanism 296 can be used to move coupling jaws 292 and
294 toward and away from each other.
 [0079] Left coupling jaw 292 and right coupling jaw 294 are substantially similar. Right
coupling clamp jaw 294 is a mirror image of left coupling clamp jaw 292, and the same numbers
will be used to identify the common features on right coupling jaw 294, with the subscript "a."
The left coupling clamp jaw 292 comprises an inner surface 298 which is a generally V-shaped
inner surface adapted to engage a coupling positioned between coupling jaws 292 and 294, and

                                                  15
has outer surface 300. Inner surface 298 may be a serrated surface to provide for efficient
gripping engagement. Left coupling jaw 292 is rigid and adapted to secure a coupling in place
while a pipe is joined thereto. Left coupling clamp jaw has a clamp portion 302 and a base 304.
V-shaped inner surface 298 is defined on clamp portion 302. An opening 306, which in the
embodiment shown is a hex-shaped opening, is defined in base 304. A passage 308 extends
through base 304 to allow tightening mechanism 296 to pass therethrough. Base 304 has
opposed channels 310 and 312 which define slots, or grooves to receive a second slide 314. Left
and right coupling jaws 292 and 294 can move transversely on a second slide 314 as further
described herein.
[0080] Tightening mechanism 296 extends through left coupling clamp jaw 292 and right
coupling clamp jaw 294. Rotation of tightening mechanism 296 will cause coupling clamp jaws
292 and 294 to move inward and outward relative to one another along second slide 314.
Tightening mechanism 296 comprises a coupling clamp screw 316, a first, or left hand drive nut
318, a second, or right hand drive nut 320, a left hand snap ring 324, a right hand snap ring 326,
a left hand adjustable handle screw 328, a right hand adjustable handle screw 330, a left
coupling clamp jaw handle 332 and a right hand coupling clamp jaw handle 334.
[0081] The coupling clamp screw 316 passes through hexagonal opening 306 and passage 308
in base 304. A portion of the coupling clamp screw 316 extends outward past both the left hand
and right hand coupling clamp jaws 292 and 294, respectively. Coupling clamp screw 316 is
symmetrical in that one side has a left hand thread and the other has a right hand thread.
[0082] First, or left hand drive nut 318 is positioned within the hexagonal opening 306 in base
304 of the left coupling jaw 292. Left hexagonal opening 306 contains a recess 336 which
receives the left hand snap ring 324. Left hand snap ring 324 is positioned outward relative to
the left hand drive nut 318 and holds left hand drive nut 318 in place. Left hand adjustable
handle screw 328 threadedly connects left coupling clamp jaw handle 332 to coupling clamp
screw 316. The arrangement and connection of the right hand drive nut 320, right hand snap
ring 326, right hand adjustable screw 330 and right hand coupling clamp jaw handle 334 can be
like that described with respect to the left hand components.
[0083] The initial positions of the left hand drive nut 318 and the right hand drive nut 320
determines the final, tightened positions of the coupling clamp jaws 292 and 294. The left and

                                                   16
right hand drive nuts 318 and 320 are positioned on the coupling clamp screw 316 so that the
left and right hand coupling jaws 292 and 294 will apply equal clamping force to a coupling
when coupling jaws 292 and 294 are moved together to clamp a coupling.
 [0084] Rotation of the coupling clamp screw 316 in a first direction, for example, rotation of left
coupling clamp jaw handle 332 to the right, or clockwise in the view of FIG. 15, causes left and
right coupling jaws 292 and 294 to move together to clamp and hold a coupling like coupling 6
in the embodiment of FIG. 1. Rotation in a second, or opposite direction causes the coupling
jaws 292 and 294 to move transversely away from each other. Thus, coupling clamp screw 316
has a non-threaded center portion 340, and has a right hand thread on the left side 342 thereof,
and a left hand thread on the right side 344 thereof. The thread direction can be reversed, since
it is only necessary that the left and right thread directions be different, so that rotation of the
single screw 316 will move both of coupling jaws 292 and 294. In the embodiment described,
the threads may be buttress threads, which as known in the art are tapered on one side and
square on the other. The square thread will provide for a greater clamping strength when the
coupling jaws 392 and 294 are clamped to a coupling, while the tapered side allows for an easier
release. Thus, the square face of the thread on the coupling clamp screw 316 faces inward
relative to the jaws 292 and 294. As is understood from the figures, rotation in the first direction
pushes left and right drive nuts 318 and 320 inward, which will press on coupling clamp jaws
292 and 294 and push them inwardly towards one another. Rotation in the opposite direction
causes drive nuts 318 and 320 to push on left and right snap rings 324 and 326 and move
coupling clamp jaws 292 and 294 outwardly relative to each other. Left coupling clamp jaw
handle 332 and right coupling clamp jaw handle 334, which may be referred to as coupling
clamp jaw handles 332 and 334, are used to rotate the coupling clamp screw.
 [0085] If coupling clamp jaws 292 and 294 do not clamp with relatively equal force, coupling
clamp jaws 292 and 294 can be adjusted by removing one of snap rings 324 and 326, and
adjusting the relative position of left and right drive nuts 318 and 320. For example, upon
removal of snap ring 324, left hand coupling jaw 292 may be freely moved toward non-threaded
center 340 until it clears left hand drive nut 316. Left hand drive nut, because it is a hex nut, can
be rotated in 1/6 rotation increments in either direction until the optimum clamping location is
reached. Because the drive nuts are hex shaped, fine tuning, or fine adjustment of the positions
of coupling jaws 292 and 294 is possible.

                                                 17
 [0086] Second slide 314 to which pipe jaw assembly 186 is connected comprise slide, or slide
bar 346 with a screw retaining block 348 connected thereto with a pair of dowel pins 350 or
other known means. Screw retaining block 348 are fixed to slide 346 with dowel pins 350 at or
near the center of the jaw slide bar 346. Screw retaining block 348 has a curved, or arcuate
recess 352 in which non-threaded center 340 rests and rotates. Collars 354 are connected to
non-threaded center 340 on both sides of retaining block 348 to aid in holding the pipe clamp
screw 316 in place. The left and right pipe clamp jaws attaches to the slide bar 346.
 [0087] Second slide 314 is a generally T-shaped slide with leg 356 and T-portion 358 with arms
360. Arms 360 are received in channels 310 and 312. An upper surface 362 of T-portion 358
has a recess 364 so as to reduce friction when pipe clamp jaws 292 and 294 are sliding
thereover. The width and thickness of legs 356 are such that during clamping tilting of the pipe
jaws 292 and 294 is prevented, or at least minimized. Second slide 314 has a connecting block
364 extending downwardly from T portion 358. A pivot or jaw block 366 is connected thereto.
 [0088] Second slide 314 attaches to the pivot block 366 with fasteners extending therethrough
into connecting block 364. A pin 368 extends upwardly through pivot block 366 into second
slide 314. Four bar linkage 34 are connected in the same manner as described with reference to
socket fusion jig 12. In the embodiment of FIG. 15, the fourth link of four bar linkage 36 are the
portions of pivot block 366 between the upper ends 96 and 120 of input link 94 and follower
link 104.
 [0089] The operation of fusion jig 180 is apparent from the drawings, and operates similarly to
fusion jig 2. A pipe 4 is fixed against movement. Pipe jaws 292 are opened wide enough to
allow insertion of pipe 4. Rotation of either of coupling clamp jaw handles 332 or 334 will
move the pipe jaws 292 and 294. Prior to placing the pipe between jaws 292 and 294, the
proper insertion depth is marked in a manner known in the art, using stab depth indicators and
known stab depth values. The proper stab depth is marked, and then either of coupling jaw
handles 332 or 334 is rotated to engage pipe 4. Likewise, either of the pipe clamp jaw handles
232 or 234 can be rotated to clamp coupling 6 between coupling jaws 192 and 194.
 [0090] A heater is placed between pipe 4 and coupling 6, and handle 38 is rotated. Pipe 4 and
coupling 6 will move laterally towards one another, with the horizontal axis of each being
substantially collinear as they move. Coupling 6 is positioned over the heater and pipe 4 is

                                                  18
inserted to the proper stab depth. Once heated, handle 38 can be rotated to move the pipe jaw
assembly 184 and coupling jaw assembly 186 apart, which moves the pipe and coupling apart.
The heater is removed, and the pipe 4 is inserted into coupling 6 to the proper depth by rotating
handle 38 to bring pipe support 184 and coupling support 186 together until the pipe is inserted
to the proper depth in the coupling. Because of the V shape of the pipe jaws and coupling jaws,
the pipe and coupling engage at four portions, or points around the circumference thereof. The
rotation of handle 38 about a vertical axis thus causes linear, lateral relative movement between
pipe support 184 and coupling support 186. The horizontal axis of the coupling and pipe being
joined can stay in line as the pipe and couplings are moved together, thus ensuring an efficient
and consistent joining operation.
 [0091] Turning to FIG. 19, a side perspective view of the fusion jig 180 shown in FIG. 15 is
provided. The fusion jig 180 comprises pipe jaw assembly 184, four bar linkages 34 and 36,
coupling jaw assembly 186, gearbox 12 and handle 38.
 [0092] Turning to FIG. 20, a section line along 20-20 shown in FIG. 19 is provided. FIG. 20
better illustrates the manner in which tightening mechanism 196 extends through the pipe jaw
assembly 184. As shown in FIG. 20, the tightening mechanism 196 extends through the

240 of the tightening mechanism 196 contacts the retaining block 248. The tightening
mechanism further extends through the passage 208a in the right hand pipe clamp jaw 194 and

illustrates that the base 204 of the pipe support 184 is slidably attached to the slide 214.
 [0095] Turning to FIG. 23, a side view of the socket jig 180 shown in FIG. 15 is provided. As
discussed, the socket jig 180 comprises pipe support 184, coupling jaw assembly 186, handle 38
and gear box 12.

                                                19
 [0096] Turning to FIG. 24, a section view along line 24-24 as shown in FIG. 23 is provided.
FIG. 24 illustrates one manner in which tightening mechanism 296 extends through the coupling
jaw assembly 186. As shown in FIG. 24, the tightening mechanism 296 extends through the
hexagonal opening 306 in the left hand coupling clamp jaw 292. The tightening mechanism
further extends through the passage 308 in the left hand coupling clamp jaw 292. The non
threaded center 340 of the tightening mechanism 296 contacts the retaining block 348. The
tightening mechanism further extends through the passage 308a in the right hand coupling
clamp jaw 294 and the hexagonal opening 306a in the right hand coupling clamp jaw 194.
 [0097] Turning to FIG. 25, a view of the coupling clamp in FIG. 15 is provided. As discussed,
the clamp can comprise a coupling clamp screw 316, collar 354, coupling jaw assembly 186,
pipe clamp screw 316, handle 38 and retaining block 348.
 [0098] Turning to FIG. 26, a view from the line 26-26 is provided. As discussed, the clamp
comprises hexagonal opening 306 in base 304 and the base 304 is slidably mounted onto second
slide 314.
 [0099] Thus, the apparatus and methods of the present invention achieve the ends and
advantages mentioned and those inherent therein. While certain preferred embodiments of the
invention have been illustrated and described for purposes of the present disclosure, numerous
changes in the arrangement and construction of parts and steps may be made by those skilled in
the art. Those changes are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
