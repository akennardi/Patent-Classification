                                          ABSTRACT
A method includes displaying a first application view. A first input is detected, and an
application view selection mode is entered for selecting one of concurrently open applications
for display in a corresponding application view. An initial group of open application icons in
a first predefined area and at least a portion of the first application view adjacent to the first
predefined area are concurrently displayed. The initial group of open application icons
corresponds to at least some of the concurrently open applications. A gesture is detected on a
respective open application icon in the first predefined area, and a respective application view
for a corresponding application is displayed without concurrently displaying an application
view for any other application in the concurrently open applications. The open application
icons in the first predefined area cease to be displayed, and the application view selection
mode is exited.

GESTURE BASED        GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE FOR MANAGING                 CONCURRENTLY      OPEN
SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS
The invention to be disclosed and claimed in this application was prematurely and without
Apple's authorization disclosed to the public when a prototype of Apple's iPhone 4 was
apparently stolen from an Apple engineer on March 25, 2010. The U.S. priority applications,
on which this application is based, were not filed before the apparent theft.
                                   RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]             Incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is PCT/US2010/050057
(published as WO 2011/126502), filed on 23 September 2010.
                                       TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001A]            This relates generally to portable electronic devices with touch-sensitive
surfaces, including but not limited to portable electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces
that are configured to have multiple open software applications.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0002]             The use of touch-sensitive surfaces as input devices for computers and other
electronic computing devices has increased significantly in recent years. Exemplary touch
sensitive surfaces include touch pads and touch screen displays. Such surfaces are widely
used to select, launch, and manage software applications.
[0003]             For portable electronic devices, existing methods for managing concurrently
open applications are cumbersome and inefficient. For example, portable devices with small
screens (e.g., smart phones and other pocket-sized devices) typically display a single
application at a time, even though multiple applications may be running on the device. With
such devices, a user may have difficulty seeing and managing the currently open applications.
This situation creates a significant cognitive burden on a user. In addition, existing methods
for managing currently open applications take longer than necessary, thereby wasting energy.
This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.
[0003A]            Reference to any prior art in the specification is not, and should not be taken
as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge in Australia or any other jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably
be expected to be understood and regarded as relevant by a person skilled in the art.

                                             SUMMARY
[00041             Accordingly, there is a need for computing devices with faster, more
efficient methods and interfaces for managing concurrently open applications. Such methods
and interfaces may complement or replace conventional methods for managing concurrently
open applications. Such methods and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and
produce a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices,
such methods and interfaces conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.
[0005]             The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces
for computing devices with touch-sensitive surfaces are reduced or eliminated by the
disclosed devices. In some embodiments, the device is portable (e.g., a notebook computer,
tablet computer, or handheld device). In some embodiments, the device has a touchpad. In
some embodiments, the device has a touch-sensitive display (also known as a "touch screen"
or "touch screen display"). In some embodiments, the device has a graphical user interface
(GUI), one or more processors, memory and one or more modules, programs or sets of
instructions stored in the memory for performing multiple functions. In some embodiments,
the user interacts with the GUI primarily through finger contacts and gestures on the touch
sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the functions may include image editing, drawing,
presenting, word processing, website creating, disk authoring, spreadsheet making, game
playing, telephoning, video conferencing, e-mailing, instant messaging, workout support,
digital photographing, digital videoing, web browsing, digital music playing, and/or digital
video playing. Executable instructions for performing these functions may be included in a
computer readable storage medium or other computer program product configured for
execution by one or more processors.

                             DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0057]           Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present
invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present
invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known
methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so
as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.
                                               25

   WO 2011/126502                                                          PCT/US2010/050057
 [00581         It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be
used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms.
These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first
contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a
first contact, without departing from the scope of the present invention. The first contact and
the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.
 [00591         The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the
purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the
invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular
forms a     "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term "and/or" as used herein
refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated
listed items.     It will be further understood that the terms "includes," "including,"
"comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the presence of
stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude
the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements,
components, and/or groups thereof.
 [00601         As used herein, the term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or
"in response to determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context.
Similarly, the phrase "if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may
be construed to mean "upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting
[the stated condition or event]" or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event],"
depending on the context.
 [00611         As used herein, the term "resolution" of a display refers to the number of
pixels (also called "pixel counts" or "pixel resolution") along each axis or in each dimension
of the display.      For example, a display may have a resolution of 320x480 pixels.
Furthermore, as used herein, the term "resolution" of a multifunction device refers to the
resolution of a display in the multifunction device. The term "resolution" does not imply
any limitations on the size of each pixel or the spacing of pixels. For example, compared to
a first display with a 1024x768-pixel resolution, a second display with a 320x480-pixel
resolution has a lower resolution. However, it should be noted that the physical size of a
display depends not only on the pixel resolution, but also on many other factors, including the
                                                 26

   WO 2011/126502                                                          PCT/US2010/050057
pixel size and the spacing of pixels.   Therefore, the first display may have the same, smaller,
or larger physical size, compared to the second display.
 [0062]         As used herein, the term "video resolution" of a display refers to the density of
pixels along each axis or in each dimension of the display. The video resolution is often
measured in a dots-per-inch (DPI) unit, which counts the number of pixels that can be placed
in a line within the span of one inch along a respective dimension of the display.
 [00631         Embodiments of computing devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described.           In some embodiments, the
computing device is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also
contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions.                  Exemplary
embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@ and
iPod Touch@ devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.            Other portable devices,
such as laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays
and/or touch pads), may also be used.           It should also be understood that, in some
embodiments, the device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer
with a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad).
 [0064]         In the discussion that follows, a computing device that includes a display and a
touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the computing
device may include one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a physical
keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick.
 [00651         The device supports a variety of applications, such as one or more of the
following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a
website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming
application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application,
an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management
application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing
application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
 [00661         The various applications that may be executed on the device may use at least
one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface.           One or
more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed
on the device may be adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application.    In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch
                                                27

   WO 2011/126502                                                       PCT/US2010/050057
sensitive surface) of the device may support the variety of applications with user interfaces
that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
 [0067]          The user interfaces may include one or more soft keyboard embodiments.
The soft keyboard embodiments may include standard (QWERTY) and/or non-standard
configurations of symbols on the displayed icons of the keyboard, such as those described in
U.S. Patent Applications 11/459,606, "Keyboards For Portable Electronic Devices," filed July
24, 2006, and 11/459,615, "Touch Screen Keyboards For Portable Electronic Devices," filed
July 24, 2006, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.
The keyboard embodiments may include a reduced number of icons (or soft keys) relative to
the number of keys in existing physical keyboards, such as that for a typewriter. This may
make it easier for users to select one or more icons in the keyboard, and thus, one or more
corresponding symbols.        The keyboard embodiments may be adaptive.          For example,
displayed icons may be modified in accordance with user actions, such as selecting one or
more icons and/or one or more corresponding symbols.         One or more applications on the
device may utilize common and/or different keyboard embodiments.           Thus, the keyboard
embodiment used may be tailored to at least some of the applications.    In some embodiments,
one or more keyboard embodiments may be tailored to a respective user. For example, one
or more keyboard embodiments may be tailored to a respective user based on a word usage
history (lexicography, slang, individual usage) of the respective user. Some of the keyboard
embodiments may be adjusted to reduce a probability of a user error when selecting one or
more icons, and thus one or more symbols, when using the soft keyboard embodiments.
 [00681          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays.   Figures 1A and IB are block diagrams illustrating portable multifunction
devices 100 with touch-sensitive displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments.
Touch-sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and may

   WO 2011/126502                                                        PCT/US2010/050057
 [00691        It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 may have more or fewer components than shown,
may combine two or more components, or may have a different configuration or arrangement
of the components.      The various components shown in Figures 1A and 1B may be
implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software,
including one or more signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
 [00701        Memory 102 may include high-speed random access memory and may also
include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash
memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access to memory 102
by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals interface 118, may
be controlled by memory controller 122.
 [00711        Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of
the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute
various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform
various functions for device 100 and to process data.
 [0072]        In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory
controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104.            In some other
embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
 [0073]        RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices
via the electromagnetic signals.    RF circuitry 108 may include well-known circuitry for
performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF transceiver,
one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC
chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108

Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), Instant
Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), and/or Short Message Service (SMS), or any other
suitable communication protocol, including communication protocols not yet developed as of
the filing date of this document.
 [0074]         Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100.       Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111.  Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible
sound waves.     Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone
 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing.       Audio data may be
retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals
interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g.,
212, Figure 2).     The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and
removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with
both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
 [0075]         I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as
touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118.        I/O
subsystem 106 may include display controller 156 and one or more input controllers 160 for
other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical
signals from/to other input or control devices 116. The other input control devices 116 may
include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches,
joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160
may be coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a
pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Figure 2) may include
an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or
more buttons may include a push button (e.g., 206, Figure 2). A quick press of the push
button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or begin a process that uses gestures on the
                                               30

touch screen to unlock the device, as described in U.S. Patent Application 11/322,549,
"Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an Unlock Image," filed December 23, 2005,
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A longer press of the push button
(e.g., 206) may turn power to device 100 on or off. The user may be able to customize a
functionality of one or more of the buttons. Touch screen 112 is used to implement virtual
or soft buttons and one or more soft keyboards.
 [00761         Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user.         Display controller 156 receives and/or sends
electrical signals from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the
user.   The visual output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination
thereof (collectively termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual
output may correspond to user-interface objects.
 [0077]         Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
 112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or
more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
 [00781         Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD
(light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology,
although other display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112
and display controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using
any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but
not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well
as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of
contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance
sensing technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch from Apple
Inc. of Cupertino, California.
 [00791         A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be
analogous to the multi-touch sensitive touchpads described in the following U.S. Patents:
                                                31

and/or U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from portable
device 100, whereas touch sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.
 [00801         A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be as
described in the following applications: (1) U.S. Patent Application No. 11/381,313,

"Multi-Functional Hand-Held Device," filed March 3, 2006. All of these applications are
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
 [0081]         Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
may make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a
stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work
primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based
input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments,
the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or
command for performing the actions desired by the user.
 [0082]         In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include
a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions.           In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is

separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the
touch screen.
 [00831         In some embodiments, device 100 may include a physical or virtual wheel
(e.g., a click wheel) as input control device 116.    A user may navigate among and interact
with one or more graphical objects (e.g., icons) displayed in touch screen 112 by rotating the
click wheel or by moving a point of contact with the click wheel (e.g., where the amount of
movement of the point of contact is measured by its angular displacement with respect to a
center point of the click wheel). The click wheel may also be used to select one or more of
the displayed icons.   For example, the user may press down on at least a portion of the click
wheel or an associated button. User commands and navigation commands provided by the
user via the click wheel may be processed by input controller 160 as well as one or more of
the modules and/or sets of instructions in memory 102. For a virtual click wheel, the click
wheel and click wheel controller may be part of touch screen 112 and display controller 156,
respectively.    For a virtual click wheel, the click wheel may be either an opaque or
semitransparent object that appears and disappears on the touch screen display in response to
user interaction with the device. In some embodiments, a virtual click wheel is displayed on
the touch screen of a portable multifunction device and operated by user contact with the
touch screen.
 [0084]         Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components.     Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more
power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure
detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting
diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation, management and
distribution of power in portable devices.
 [00851         Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164.           Figures 1A
and lB show an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem 106.
Optical sensor 164 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors.          Optical sensor 164 receives light from the
environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the light to data representing
an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera module), optical
sensor 164 may capture still images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the
                                               33

device, so that the touch screen display may be used as a viewfinder for still and/or video
image acquisition. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the front of the
device so that the user's image may be obtained for videoconferencing while the user views
the other video conference participants on the touch screen display. In some embodiments,
the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the user (e.g., by rotating the lens and
the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor 164 may be used along with
the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or video image acquisition.
 [00861         Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. Figures 1A
and lB show proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118.                Alternately,
proximity sensor 166 may be coupled to input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106.
Proximity sensor 166 may perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839,
"Proximity Detector In Handheld Device"; 11/240,788, "Proximity Detector In Handheld
Device"; 11/620,702, "Using Ambient Light Sensor To Augment Proximity Sensor Output";

and 11/638,251, "Methods And Systems For Automatic Configuration Of Peripherals,"
which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the
proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the multifunction device is
placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone call).
 [00871         Device 100 may also include one or more accelerometers 168. Figures 1A
and 1B show accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118.                   Alternately,

Accelerometer 168 may perform as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050190059,
"Acceleration-based Theft Detection System for Portable Electronic Devices," and U.S.
Patent Publication No. 20060017692, "Methods And Apparatuses For Operating A Portable
Device Based On An Accelerometer," both of which are which are incorporated by reference
herein in their entirety. In some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen
display in a portrait view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the
one or more accelerometers.       Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s)
 168, a magnetometer (not shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation
system) receiver (not shown) for obtaining information concerning the location and
orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) of device 100.

module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments memory 102 stores device/global internal state 157, as shown in Figures IA,
1B and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active application state,
indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state, indicating what
applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch screen display 112;
sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various sensors and input
control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's location and/or attitude.
[0089]          Operating system 126 (e.g.,        Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[0090]          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices
over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for
handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g.,
Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other
devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.).           In some
embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or
similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple
Inc.) devices.
[00911          Contact/motion module 130 may detect contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or
physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components
for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if
contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining if there is movement
of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting
one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g.,
detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact).        Contact/motion module 130 receives

velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or
direction) of the point of contact. These operations may be applied to single contacts (e.g.,
one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger
contacts).   In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156
detects contact on a touchpad.      In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and
controller 160 detects contact on a click wheel.
 [0092]         Contact/motion module 130 may detect a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns.   Thus, a gesture may
be detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap
gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off)
event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g.,
at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or
more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off)
event.
 [00931         Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the intensity of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the
term "graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without
limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital
images, videos, animations and the like.
 [0094]         In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics
to be used.    Each graphic may be assigned a corresponding code.        Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along
with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic property data, and then generates screen
image data to output to display controller 156.
 [0095]         Text input module 134, which may be a component of graphics module 132,
provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail
 140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).

   WO 2011/126502                                                        PCT/US2010/050057
 [001171         Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (i.e., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various
embodiments. For example, video player module 145 may be combined with music player
module 146 into a single module (e.g., video and music player module 152, Figure 1B). In
some embodiments, memory 102 may store a subset of the modules and data structures
identified above.      Furthermore, memory 102 may store additional modules and data
structures not described above.
 [00118]         In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined
set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a
touchpad. By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for
operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons,
dials, and the like) on device 100 may be reduced.
 [00119]         The predefined set of functions that may be performed exclusively through a
touch screen and/or a touchpad include navigation between user interfaces.            In some
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
or root menu from any user interface that may be displayed on device 100.              In such
embodiments, the touchpad may be referred to as a "menu button."                In some other
embodiments, the menu button may be a physical push button or other physical input control
device instead of a touchpad.
 [00120]         Figure IC is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event
handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in
Figures 1A and IB) or 370 (Figure 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system
 126) and a respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-15 1,
 155, 380-390).
 [00121]         Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
 136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174.
In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which
                                                42

   WO 2011/126502                                                         PCT/US2010/050057
indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch sensitive display 112 when the
application is active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is
used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is(are) currently active, and
application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191
to which to deliver event information.
 [00122]        In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go
back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions
taken by the user.
 [00123]        Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information
that peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from
touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
 [00124]        In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
 [001251        In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
 [001261        Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other
elements that a user can see on the display.
 [00127]        Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
                                                43

   WO 2011/126502                                                          PCT/US2010/050057
respective application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels
within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level
view in which a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are
recognized as proper inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the
initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
 [001281        Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events
of a touch-based gesture.    When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy,
hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (i.e., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch
or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
 [00129]        Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events.      In other embodiments,
even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
 [001301        Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180).   In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173.        In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module 182.
 [001311        In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such
as contact/motion module 130.

 [001321        In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180.
In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module,
such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater
 176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192.
Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective event
handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater
 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
 [001331        A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
 179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information. Event
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event
delivery instructions 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
 [00134]        Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch the event information may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some
embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g.,
from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
device attitude) of the device.
 [001351        Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or
sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
                                               45

   WO 2011/126502                                                          PCT/US2010/050057
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for example,
touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching.        In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact)
on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
 [001361         In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event
for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs
a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event.   For
example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch
sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event
comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is
associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a
respective event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine
which event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an
event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
 [00137]         In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
event type.
 [001381         When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it
disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event
recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub
events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.

   WO 2011/126502                                                          PCT/US2010/050057
 [001391        In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata
 183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery
system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers may interact with one another. In some embodiments, metadata 183
includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are
delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
 [00140]        In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
 [001411        In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an
event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
 [00142]        In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1.       For
example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.
 [001431        In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater
 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
                                               47

   WO 2011/126502                                                         PCT/US2010/050057
application 136-1 or application view 191.     In other embodiments, they are included in two
or more software modules.
 [00144]        It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling
of user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to
operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all of which are initiated on touch
screens, e.g., coordinating mouse movement and mouse button presses with or without single
or multiple keyboard presses or holds, user movements taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch
pads, pen stylus inputs, movement of the device, oral instructions, detected eye movements,
biometric inputs, and/or any combination thereof, which may be utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
 [00145]        Figure 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen
 112 in accordance with some embodiments.           The touch screen may display one or more
graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described
below, a user may select one or more of the graphics by making contact or touching the
graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one
or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure).     In some embodiments, selection of
one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics.
In some embodiments, the contact may include a gesture, such as one or more taps, one or
more swipes (from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a
finger (from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with
device 100. In some embodiments, inadvertent contact with a graphic may not select the
graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon may not select
the corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a tap.
 [001461        Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively,
in some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on
touch screen 112.
 [00147]        In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204,
push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack 212, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 may be used to turn the power on/off
                                                 48

on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for a
predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the button
before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate an
unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also may accept verbal input for
activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113.
 [001481        Figure 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300
need not be portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop
computer, a tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational
device (such as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or
industrial controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's)
310, one or more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or
more communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components.            Communication
buses 320 may include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
communications between system components.           Device 300 includes input/output (I/O)
interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display.           I/O
interface 330 also may include a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
touchpad 355. Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM,
SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include
non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory
370 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310.
In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous
to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100 (Figure 1), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional
programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100.    For example, memory 370 of device 300 may store drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386, disk
authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (Figure 1) may not store these modules.
 [00149]        Each of the above identified elements in Figure 3 may be stored in one or
more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified modules
corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above

identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments.               In some
embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above.    Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[001501         Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") that
may be implemented on portable multifunction device 100.
[00151]         Figures 4A and 4B illustrate exemplary user interfaces for a menu of
applications on portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments.
Similar user interfaces may be implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user
interface 400A includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
    .   Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
        Wi-Fi signals;
    .   Time 404;

                or voicemail messages;
            o E-mail client 140, which may include an indicator 410 of the number of
                unread e-mails;
            o Browser 147; and
            o Music player 146; and

[00152]         In some embodiments, user interface 400B includes the following elements, or
a subset or superset thereof:
    .   402, 404, 405, 406, 141, 148, 144, 143, 149-3, 149-2, 149-1, 149-4, 410, 414, 138,

    .   Map 154;
    .   Notes 153;
    .   Settings 412, which provides access to settings for device 100 and its various
        applications 136, as described further below;
    *   Video and music player module 152, also referred to as iPod (trademark of Apple
        Inc.) module 152; and

        module 155.
[00153]         Figure 4C illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
Figure 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Figure 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Although many of the
examples which follow will be given with reference to inputs on touch screen display 112
(where the touch sensitive surface and the display are combined), in some embodiments, the
device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from the display, as shown
in Figure 4C. In some embodiments the touch sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure 4C) has
a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Figure 4C) that corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Figure
4C) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these embodiments, the device detects
                                               51

   WO 2011/126502                                                         PCT/US2010/050057
contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Figure 4C) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations
that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g., in Figure 4C 460 corresponds to
468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and
movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure
4C) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Figure
4C) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display.
It should be understood that similar methods may be used for other user interfaces described
herein.
 [00154]         Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") and
associated processes that may be implemented on a multifunction device with a display and a
touch-sensitive surface, such as device 300 or portable multifunction device 100.
 [001551         Figures    5A-5HH     illustrate  exemplary    user interfaces   for  managing
concurrently open applications in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in
these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the processes in
Figures 6A-6C, 7, 8A-8C, 9, 10, and 11 A-1 lB.
 [00156]         As used in the specification and claims, the term "open application" refers to a
software application with retained state information (e.g., as part of device/global internal
state 157 and/or application internal state 192). An open application is any one of the
following types of applications:
     .   an active application, which is currently displayed on display 112 (or a corresponding
         application view is currently displayed on the display);
     .   a background application (or background process), which is not currently displayed
         on display 112, but one or more application processes (e.g., instructions) for the
         corresponding application are being processed by one or more processors 120 (i.e.,
         running);
     .   a suspended application, which is not currently running, and the application is stored
         in a volatile memory (e.g., DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM, or other volatile random
         access solid state memory device of memory 102); and
     .   a hibernated application, which is not running, and the application is stored in a non
         volatile memory (e.g., one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
                                                  52

   WO 2011/126502                                                           PCT/US2010/050057
         devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices of
         memory 102).
 [00157]         As used herein, the term "closed application" refers to software applications
without retained state information (e.g., state information for closed applications is not stored
in a memory of the device). Accordingly, closing an application includes stopping and/or
removing application processes for the application and removing state information for the
application from the memory of the device. Generally, opening a second application while
in a first application does not close the first application. When the second application is
displayed and the first application ceases to be displayed, the first application, which was an
active application when displayed, may become a background application, suspended
application, or hibernated application, but the first application remains an open application
while its state information is retained by the device.
 [001581         Figures 5A-5D illustrate exemplary user interfaces for selecting one of the
concurrently open applications and displaying a corresponding application view.
 [00159]         Figure 5A illustrates an exemplary user interface ("home screen" 5001)
displaying a plurality of application icons 5002 (e.g., 5002-21 through 5002-3 8) on touch
screen 112 of a portable electronic device (e.g., portable multifunction device 100). In
Figure 5A, finger gesture 505 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on touch screen 112 at a
location that corresponds to map application icon 5002-27. (Note that the application icons
5002 on the home page displayed in Figure 5A may or may not correspond to open
application icons, whereas the application icons 5002 in Figures 5C-5Z correspond to open
application icons.)
 [001601         In Figure 5B, in response to detecting the finger gesture, the map application
is launched and map application view 5004-1 is displayed on touch screen 112. In this
example, the map application view includes a portion of a map and user interface objects,
such as a search input field, a search icon, and a directions icon. Also in Figure 5B, input
507 (e.g., a click or double-click on home button 204) is detected.
 [001611         Figure 5C illustrates that, in response to detecting input 507, a portion of map
application view 5004-1 and application icon area 5006 are concurrently displayed. In some
embodiments, in response to detecting input 507, the device enters into an application
selection mode for selecting one of the concurrently open applications, and the portion of
map application view 5004-1 and application icon area 5006 are concurrently displayed as
                                                  53

part of the application selection mode. Application icon area 5006 includes an initial group
of open application icons that correspond to at least some of the concurrently open
applications.   In this example, the multifunction device has multiple applications that are
concurrently open, although they are not simultaneously displayed. Also in this example,
application icon area 5006 includes application icons for a web browser (Safari), a music
application (iPod), a finance application (Stocks), and a multimedia store application (iTunes).
 [001621        In some embodiments, the concurrent display of the map application view and
the application icon area may include an animation.      For example, the map application view
can slide up such that a portion of the map application view moves off the display and a
portion of the map application view remains on the display. The application icon area can
slide in simultaneously from the bottom of the screen such that the animation gives a visual
appearance that the map application view and the application icon area are connected.
 [001631        In Figure 5C, finger gesture 509 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on touch
screen 112 at a location that corresponds to web browser application icon 5002-37.
 [00164]        Figure 5D illustrates that, in response to detecting the finger gesture at a
location that corresponds to the web browser application icon, web browser application view
5 004-2 is displayed on touch screen 112.
 [00165]        Figures 5E-5F illustrate scrolling of the application icon area. In Figure 5E,
contact 511 (e.g., a finger contact) is detected on touch screen 112 at a location 511-A that
corresponds to application icon area 5006.      In Figures 5E-5F, contact 511 moves across the
touch screen 112 to a different location (e.g., 511-B), and application icons in application
icon area 5006 are scrolled in accordance with the movement of contact 511.
 [00166]        Figures 5G-51 illustrate exemplary user interfaces for closing one of the
concurrently open applications. In Figure 5G, finger gesture 513 (e.g., a press-and-hold
gesture) is detected on touch screen 112 at a location that corresponds to music application
icon 5002-38, while the device is in an application selection mode.      Figure 5H illustrates that
in response to detecting the finger gesture, the multifunction device enters into an application
closure mode. In the application closure mode, the music application icon is visually
distinguished from the rest of the application icons displayed on touch screen 112.      In this
example, the music application icon is animated (e.g., jiggled), and the rest of the displayed
application icons are dimmed. In addition, an indicia of an application closure (e.g., a close
application icon, such as "-" icon 5012-1) is displayed adjacent to the music application icon.

 [001671         In Figure 5H, finger gesture 515 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on touch
screen 112 at a location that corresponds to the visually distinguished application icon (e.g.,
the music application icon 5002-38).      Figure 51 illustrates that, in response to detecting the
gesture, the visually distinguished application icon (e.g., 5002-38) is removed from the
application icon area. Also in response to the gesture, the multifunction device closes a
corresponding application (e.g., a music application). After the visually distinguished
application icon (e.g., 5002-38) is removed, the multifunction device displays a new set of
application icons without visual distinction (e.g., the application icons are no longer dimmed).
The new set of application icons includes application icons that were included in the initial
set of application icons except for the closed application icon (e.g., 5002-37, 5002-26, and
5002-32).     An additional application icon (e.g., 5002-35) is added to the new set of
application icons. Also, after removing the visually distinguished application icon, the
multifunction device exits the application closure mode, and returns to the application
selection mode.     In some embodiments, a finger gesture (e.g., a tap gesture) at a location that
corresponds to close-application icon 5012-1 removes the visually distinguished application
icon.
 [001681         Figures 5J-5K illustrate exemplary user interfaces including a music
application view. In Figure 5J, music application view 5004-3 (e.g., iPod application view)
is displayed. Music application view 5004-3 includes music controls (e.g., play/pause, fast
forward/next track, and rewind/previous track, and/or a scrubber bar).        Figure 5J also
illustrates that an input 517 is detected (e.g., a single or double click on home button 204).
 [001691         In Figure 5K, a portion of music application view 5004-3 and application icon
area 5006 are concurrently displayed. In this example, it is noted that the music application
icon (e.g., 5002-38) is not displayed in the application icon area while the music application
view (e.g., 5004-3) is displayed, regardless of how recent the corresponding music
application is used, or whether the corresponding music application is playing music.
 [00170]         Figure 5L illustrates an exemplary user interface including music control icons
in the predefined area (e.g., music control icons 5106 (e.g., pause, previous track, and next
track icons) in application icon area 5006-1).     It is noted that music control icons 5106 and
application icons are displayed on separate rows in (enlarged) predefined area 5006-1.         In
some embodiments, while the application icons are scrolled, music control icons 5106 remain
on the display. In Figure 5L, left-to-right swipe gesture 537 is detected on touch screen 112.

 [001711        Figure 5M illustrates an exemplary user interface including settings icons in
the predefined area.    In some embodiments, the settings icons are displayed in response to
detecting left-to-right swipe gesture 537.     In Figure 5M, settings icons (e.g., rotate lock icon
5102-1, Wi-Fi icon 5102-2, and Bluetooth icon 5102-3) are displayed in application icon area
5006-1.    Each settings icon, when activated (e.g., by a finger gesture), changes a
corresponding setting (e.g., Wi-Fi icon 5102-2, when activated, turns on or off a Wi-Fi
connection).    In some embodiments, one or more application icons can be concurrently
displayed with settings icons in application icon area 5006 (not shown).
 [00172]        Figure 5N illustrates a rotation of the multifunction device 100.     In response
to detecting a rotation of the multifunction device 100, application icons 5002 are rotated and
rearranged.   In some embodiments, the number of application icons displayed in a landscape
mode (e.g., five, six, etc.) is different from the number of application icons displayed in a
portrait mode (e.g., three, four, etc.). In some embodiments, the application icons displayed
in the landscape mode includes application icons displayed in the portrait mode (e.g., after a
rotation of the device as shown in Figure 5L from the portrait mode to a landscape mode, the
device can display at least Stocks, Maps, iTunes, and Game Center icons (not shown)).          In
other embodiments, the application icons displayed in the landscape mode do not include
application icons displayed in the portrait mode (e.g., Figures 5M-5N).
 [00173]        Figure 50 illustrates an alternative user interface for selecting an open
application.   When the device enters an application selection mode (e.g., by input 507 in
Figure 5B), instead of displaying application icons (e.g., as shown in Figure 5C), images of
open applications (e.g., 5008-10, 5008-11, and 5008-13) can be displayed in predefined area
5006.
 [00174]        Figures 5P-5Y illustrate exemplary user interfaces including user interface
objects corresponding to open applications, arranged in a grid. The user interface objects are
typically user selectable (or user activatable).
 [00175]        Figures 5P and 5Q illustrate scrolling open application icons arranged in a grid.
In Figure 5P, open application icons 5002 (e.g., 5002-1 through 5002-9) are displayed in a
three-by-three grid. In some embodiments, application icons 5002 can be the same as
application icons illustrated in Figures 5A-5K (e.g., map application icons 5002-6 and 5002
27 can be identical).   In other embodiments, application icons 5002 displayed in a grid can
                                                  56

be different from application icons displayed elsewhere (e.g., within an application icon area
5006 or on home screen 5001).
 [001761        Figure 5P also illustrates that gesture 519 (e.g., a swipe gesture) is detected on
touch screen 112. Figure 5Q illustrates that, in response to detecting gesture 519, open
application icons 5002 displayed on touch screen 112 in Figure 5P are scrolled off the display,
and a different set of open application icons 5002 (e.g., 5002-10 through 5002-18) are
displayed on touch screen 112.
 [001771        Figures 5R-5T illustrate exemplary user interfaces involving images of open
applications (or corresponding application views). In Figure 5R, images 5008 (e.g., 5008-10
through 5008-18) of open applications or application views (e.g., live thumbnails) are
displayed in a grid. In some embodiments, the images of open applications are updated
when the corresponding applications change corresponding application views (e.g., a browser
displays new content on a webpage, a movie player plays movies, etc.).
 [001781        In Figure 5S, open application icons (e.g., 5002-35, 5002-36, and 5002-37) are
displayed, at least partially overlapping the images of corresponding open applications (e.g.,
5008-10, 5008-11, and 5008-12).      In some embodiments, open application icons 5002 are
displayed adjacent to the images 5008 of the corresponding open applications without overlap.
In some embodiments, open application icons 5002 are displayed entirely overlapping the
images 5008 of corresponding open applications.
 [00179]        Figure 5T illustrates that at least a subset of the images 5008 includes status
indicia for corresponding applications.    In this example, map application image 5008-6
includes compass icon 5010-1, which indicates that certain features (e.g., a GPS tracking
function) are activated in a corresponding map application. In some embodiments, open
application icons (e.g., 5002) can include status indicia.
 [00180]        Figures 5U-5V illustrate exemplary user interfaces including an application
closure mode. In Figure 5U, one of the images (e.g., 5008-12) is displayed with a jiggling
animation. In addition, image 5008-12 includes close-application icon 5012-2.          Image
5008-12, when selected (e.g., by a finger tap gesture), removes image 5008-12 from the
displayed set of images, and closes a corresponding application (e.g., a web browser
application).   Afterwards, the rest of the images (e.g., 5008-10, 5008-11, 5008-13 through
5008-18) and a new image (e.g., 5008-19) are displayed, as shown in Figure 5V. The close

application icon operates in a manner analogous to the application closure mode as described
above with reference to Figures 5G-51.
 [00181]         Figures 5W-5X illustrate exemplary user interfaces including concurrent
display of the open application icons and search icon 5004. In Figure 5W, contact 521 is
detected on touch screen 112 at a location corresponding to search icon 5104. Figures 5X
illustrates that, in response to detecting contact 521 at the location corresponding to search
icon 5104, keyboard 5014 is displayed on touch screen 112.        In some embodiments, search
icon 5104 and keyboard 5014 are concurrently displayed on touch screen 112 with at least a
subset of open application icons 5002 (e.g., application icons 5002 in Figure 5X).      In some
embodiments, the concurrently displayed application icons correspond to applications that
match the search term(s). In some embodiments, search icon 5104 and keyboard 5014 are
concurrently displayed with a list of application (e.g., applications that match the search
term(s)).
 [00182]         Figure 5Y illustrates a rotation of the multifunction device 100.  In response
to detecting a rotation of the multifunction device 100, open application icons 5002 are
rotated and rearranged.     In some embodiments, the number of application icons displayed in
a landscape mode (e.g., two-by-four, two-by-five, etc.) is different from the number of
application icons displayed in a portrait mode (e.g., three-by-three, four-by-three, four-by
two, etc.).
 [00183]         Figures 5Z-5AA illustrate a gesture for displaying user selected information.
In Figure 5Z, gesture 523 (e.g., a swipe down gesture) is detected on touch screen 112 from a
top edge of the display. Figure 5AA illustrates that, in response to detecting gesture 523, an
exemplary user interface including user selected information is displayed. The user selected
information user interface includes, for example, user selectable icon (e.g., done icon 5020),
user selected information (e.g., local weather 5016), and recent electronic notifications (e.g.,
recent email 5018-1 and upcoming events 5018-2).
 [00184]         Figures 5BB-5CC illustrates an exemplary user interface including three
dimensional stack of images of open applications.       In Figure 5BB, images of open
applications are displayed in a three-dimensional stack extending backwards on the display.
For example, an image of an open application that was used most recently (e.g., 5008-10) is
displayed up front, an image of an open application that was used second most recently (e.g.,
5008-11) is displayed right behind the most recently used application (e.g., 5008-10), and so

on. In some embodiments, the images can be scrolled by a swipe gesture, and a
corresponding application can be selected by a tap gesture. In Figure 5BB, gesture 533 (e.g.,
a tap gesture) is detected at a location that corresponds to a respective image of an open
application (e.g., a mail application). In response, a mail application view is displayed, as
shown in Figure 5CC.
 [00185]        Figures 5CC-5HH illustrate exemplary user interfaces for selecting one of the
concurrently open applications. Figure 5CC illustrates mail application view 5004-4 for an
email application (e.g., Mail). In Figure 5CC, mail application view 5004-4 includes email
text, including link 5020-1 to a webpage. Gesture 525 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on
touch screen 112 at a location that corresponds to link 5020-1.
 [00186]        In Figure 5DD, in response to detecting gesture 525 at the location that
corresponds to link 5020-1, the corresponding web page is displayed in web browser
application view 5004-5. Figure 5DD also illustrates that input 527 (e.g., a single or double
click on home button 204) is detected.
 [00187]        Figure 5EE illustrates that, in response to detecting input 527, a portion of
home screen 5001, web browser application view 5008-12, and a portion of mail application
view 5008-10 are displayed. Figure 5EE also illustrates that tap gesture 535 can be detected
at a location that corresponds to image 5008-10 of mail application.      In response to detecting
tap gesture 535, mail application view 5004-4 (as shown in Figure 5CC) will be displayed
without concurrently displaying any other application view.       Figure 5EE also illustrates that
swipe gesture 529 can be detected on touch screen at a location that corresponds to mail
application view 5008-10, and in Figure 5FF, in response to detecting swipe gesture 529,
application views (e.g., 5008-10 and 5008-12) are scrolled, and a portion of map application
view 5008-6 is displayed.
 [00188]        In Figure 5FF, when gesture 531 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected at a location
that corresponds to map application view 5008-6, in response, a map application view is
displayed, as shown in Figure 5GG.
 [00189]        In Figure 5FF, when gesture 533 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected at a location
that corresponds to home screen 5001, in response, home screen 5001 is displayed, as shown
in Figure 5HH.
 [00190]        Figures 6A-6C are flow diagrams illustrating method 600 of selecting one of
concurrently open applications in accordance with some embodiments.               Method 600 is
                                                 59

   WO 2011/126502                                                         PCT/US2010/050057
performed at a multifunction device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction
device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some
embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in
method 600 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
 [00191]        As described below, method 600 provides an intuitive way to select one of
concurrently open applications. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
selecting one of concurrently open application, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to select one of
concurrently open applications faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.
 [00192]        The device displays (602) a first application view (e.g., map application view
5004-1 in Figure 5B) on a touch-sensitive display that corresponds to a first application in a
plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., the device may have multiple open
applications, such as Safari, iPod, Stocks, and iTunes).         The first application view is
displayed without concurrently displaying an application view for any other application in the
plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., in Figure 5B, map application view 5004-1
is displayed without concurrently displaying an application view for any other application).
In other words, in a normal operation mode, just a single application view is displayed, which
corresponds to one of the plurality of concurrently open applications.          The other open
applications (e.g., the other open applications, such as Safari, iPod, Stocks, and iTunes) may
be running in the background or be in a suspended or hibernated operating state.
 [001931        The device detects (604) a first input (e.g., input 507 in Figure 5B). In some
embodiments, the first input is a single tap on a home button (e.g., 204).             In some
embodiments, the first input is a double tap on the home button (e.g., 204). In some
embodiments, the first input is a gesture on the touch-sensitive display, such as a three-finger
pinch gesture or a swipe gesture.
 [00194]        In response to detecting the first input (606), the device performs the
following actions. The device enters (608) an application view selection mode for selecting
one of the concurrently open applications for display in a corresponding application view.
The device displays (610) in a first predefined area (e.g., a strip in a predefined location on
the touch-sensitive display) an initial group of open application icons that correspond to at
                                               60

  WO 2011/126502                                                            PCT/US2010/050057
least some of the plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., application icons 5002 in
application icon area 5006 in Figure 5C). In some embodiments, the device maintains the
display of the first predefined area without further input (e.g., press-and-hold on home button
204 or on touch screen 112) until the application view selection mode is exited. In some
embodiments, the area displays the open application icons as a scrollable strip with a linear
array of open application icons (e.g., application icon area 5006 is scrollable as shown in
Figures 5E-5F).      The device concurrently displays (612) at least a portion of the first
application view adjacent to the first predefined area (e.g., in Figure 5C, at least a portion of
map application view 5004-1 and application icon area 5006 are concurrently displayed).
The concurrent display provides several benefits.           For example, it provides context by
maintaining the first application view while an open application icon is being selected. In
addition, it is easy to get back to the first application (and cease the display of the application
icon area) by, for example, tapping on the first application view.
 [00195]         In some embodiments, at least a subset of the open application icons include
(624 in Figure 6B) status indicia for corresponding applications.          For example, an audio
application icon includes a "now recording" indicia (e.g., a red dot) displayed on or proximate
to the audio application icon. In another example, a map application icon includes a "GPS
active" indicia (e.g., a compass image) displayed on or proximate to the map application icon
(e.g., see an analogous example in Figure 5S where image 5008-6 includes a compass icon
5010-1).
 [00196]         In some embodiments, the initial group of open application icons includes
(626) an audio application icon when a corresponding audio application is in use. For
example, when a music player application is playing music, the initial group of open
application icons always includes a corresponding music player application icon (e.g., iPod
application icon 5002-38 in Figure 5C).       Displaying the audio application icon as part of the
initial group of open application icons facilitates rapid selection and display of the
corresponding audio application. For example, there is no need to scroll the open application
icons in the predefined area to display the audio application icon.
 [00197]         In some embodiments, open application icons are displayed (628) in the first
predefined area in a sequence and the sequence is determined in accordance with a usage
history for the corresponding open applications. For example, assume multimedia store
application iTunes is used first, then finance application Stocks, then music application iPod,
                                                  61

  WO 2011/126502                                                           PCT/US2010/050057
web browser application Safari, and finally a map application is the last application used
prior to entering the application view selection mode.        Then, in some embodiments, the
initial group of open application icons will be iTunes, Stocks, iPod, and Safari. In addition,
the sequence of open application icons will be Safari, iPod, Stocks, and iTunes (as shown in
Figure 5C).    In some embodiments, selecting an open application icon corresponding to one
of the initial group of open applications does not change the sequence in which the initial
group of open application icons is displayed. For example, selecting the iTunes application
icon in Figure 5C and re-entering the application view selection mode does not change the
sequence of open application icons, Safari, iPod, Stocks, and iTunes.        This has a benefit of
providing a previously presented sequence (which is familiar to the user) of open application
icons, thereby avoiding the need for the user to learn a new arrangement of open application
icons. This reduces the cognitive burden on a user and produces a more efficient human
machine interface.
 [00198]        In some embodiments, the device displays scrollable pages of icons (e.g.,
application launch icons and/or folder icons), a scrollable list of icons, or a scrollable array of
icons in a predefined area of the display (e.g., application icons 5002-21 through 5002-34 are
displayed on a scrollable page of icons in Figure 5A).        The device concurrently displays
stationary icons (e.g., frequently used or favorite application launch icons and/or folder icons
selected by a user) in another, distinct predefined area of the display (e.g., a dock area) (e.g.,
application icons 5002-35 through 5002-38 are stationary icons in the dock area).          In some
embodiments, the device can also enter the application view selection mode from this display
in response to detecting an input (e.g., in response to detecting a double tap on the home
button).   In some embodiments, in response to detecting the input, the stationary icons in the
dock area are replaced by the initial group of open application icons that correspond to at
least some of the plurality of concurrently open applications.     In other words, the dock area
in normal operation mode is replaced by the first predefined area with open application icons
in the application view selection mode.     In some embodiments, in response to detecting the
input, the application icons on the scrollable pages and the dock area (e.g., application icons
5002-21 through 5002-38) slide up, and at least a subset of the application icons and a
predefined area including open application icons are concurrently displayed, in a manner
analogous to the concurrent display of application view 5004-1 and predefined area 5006 in
Figure 5C.

 [00199]        In some embodiments, the device displays (630) settings icons in the first
predefined area while in the application view selection mode (e.g., settings icons 5102 in
Figure 5M). Exemplary setting icons include: a rotation lock icon; communication mode
icons, such as an airplane mode icon, a Wi-Fi icon, and/or Bluetooth icon; and audio controls,
such as play/pause, fast forward, reverse, stop, volume controls, and/or track controls.
 [00200]        In some embodiments, when settings icons for an open application are
displayed in the first predefined area, the corresponding open application icon is not
displayed (632) in the first predefined area. For example, when music player controls are
displayed in the first predefined area, the corresponding music player application icon is not
displayed (e.g., in Figure 5L, when music player controls 5106 are displayed in application
icon area 5006-1, the corresponding music player application icon (e.g., iPod) is not
displayed in application icon area 5006-1).
 [002011        In some embodiments, the device concurrently displays (634) audio control
icons and open application icons other than a corresponding audio application icon in
respective rows in the first predefined area (e.g., audio control icons 5106 and other
application icons in respective rows in application icon area 5006-1 in Figure 5L).
 [00202]        In some embodiments, the at least a portion of the first application view is
displayed (636) in a second predefined area that is larger than and adjacent to the first
predefined area. For example, in Figure 5C, the area where a portion of map application
view 5004-1 is displayed is larger than and adjacent to application icon area 5006.
 [002031        In some embodiments, a first set of open application icons includes the initial
group of open application icons, and the first set of open application icons is displayed in a
first orientation. The device detects a rotation of the multifunction device from the first
orientation to a second orientation, and displays a second set of open application icons in the
second orientation (e.g., Figure 5N).     The initial group of open application icons and the
second set of open application icons have different numbers of open application icons (e.g.,
in Figure 5N, the second set of open application icons has six open application icons, whereas
the initial group of applications in Figure 5C has four open application icons). In some
embodiments, displaying the second set of open application icons in the second orientation
includes ceasing to display the first set of open application icons in the first orientation. In
some embodiments, displaying the second set of open application icons in the second
orientation includes rearranging the first set of open application icons in the first orientation.

 [002041         The device detects (614 in Figure 6A) a gesture (e.g., a tap gesture) on a
respective open application icon in the first predefined area (e.g., gesture 509 on application
icon 5002-37 in Figure 5C).       In response to detecting the gesture on the respective open
application icon (616), the device performs the following actions. The device displays (618)
a respective application view on the touch-sensitive display for a corresponding application in
the plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., browser application view 5004-2 in
Figure 5D).     The respective application view is displayed without concurrently displaying an
application view for any other application in the plurality of concurrently open applications
(e.g., in Figure 5D, browser application view 5004-2 is displayed without concurrently
displaying any other application views). The device ceases (620) to display open application
icons in the first predefined area (e.g., application icon area 5006 and application icons 5002
in application icon area 5006 are no longer displayed in Figure 5D). The device exits (622)
the application view selection mode (and enters a normal operation mode for the respective
application).
 [00205]         In some embodiments, while in the application view selection mode, the
device performs (640 in Figure 6C) the following actions. The device detects a gesture (e.g.,
a tap gesture) on the at least a portion of the first application view. In response to detecting
the gesture on the portion of the first application view, the device displays the first
application view on the touch-sensitive display without concurrently displaying an
application view for any other application in the plurality of concurrently open applications,
and exits the application view selection mode (and enters a normal operation mode for the
first application).  For example, in Figure 5C, when a gesture is detected on touch screen 112
at a location corresponding to map application view 5004-1, the device displays map
application view 5004-1 without concurrently displaying application icon area 5006 or an
application view for any other application, as shown in Figure 5B.
 [002061         In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first input, the device slides
(638) the first application view such that part of the first application view moves off the
display and a portion of the first application view remains on the display (e.g., in Figure 5C, a
portion of map application view 5004-1 moves off the display and a portion of map
application view 5004-1 remains on the display).
 [002071         In some embodiments, while in the application view selection mode, the
device detects (642) a scroll gesture (e.g., a swipe gesture) in the first predefined area, and in
                                                 64

  WO 2011/126502                                                              PCT/US2010/050057
response to detecting the scroll gesture, scrolls the plurality of concurrently open application
icons in the first predefined area in accordance with the scroll gesture (e.g., Figures 5E-5F).
 [00208]         In some embodiments, while displaying the initial group of open application
icons in the application view selection mode, the device performs (644) one of the following
actions.    When a first scroll gesture in a first direction (e.g., a right-to-left swipe gesture) is
detected in the first predefined area, the device scrolls to display other open application icons
in the plurality of concurrently open application icons in the first predefined area (e.g.,
Figures 5E-5F).       When a second scroll gesture in a second direction opposite the first
direction (e.g., a left-to-right swipe gesture) is detected in the first predefined area, the device
scrolls to display settings icons in the first predefined area (e.g., Figures 5L-5M).        In some
embodiments, when the second scroll gesture in a second direction different from the first
direction (e.g., a top-to-bottom swipe gesture, a bottom-to-top swipe gesture, or a diagonal
swipe gesture) is detected in the first predefined area, the device scrolls to display settings
icons in the first predefined area.
 [00209]         In some embodiments, while in the application view selection mode, the
device detects (646) a swipe down gesture that starts from a top edge of the display (e.g.,
gesture 523 in Figure 5Z). In response to detecting the swipe down gesture, the device
displays a user selectable icon (e.g., done icon 5020 in Figure 5AA), and displays at least one
of: a list of recent electronic notifications, (e.g., recent e-mails 5018-1 and/or upcoming events
5018-2) and user selected information (e.g., local weather information 5016, stock price (not
shown), news headings (not shown), etc.).
 [00210]         In some embodiments, while in the application view selection mode, the
device performs the following actions.         The device detects (648) a gesture at a location
corresponding to an open application icon in the first predefined area (e.g., press-and-hold
gesture 513 on open application icon 5002-38 in Figure 5G).             In response to detecting the
gesture at the location corresponding to the open application icon, the device displays a close
application icon for closing a corresponding application (e.g., an "X" icon or       "-" icon 5012-1
on or proximate to the open application icon).          The device detects a gesture at a location
corresponding to the close-application icon (e.g., a tap gesture on close-application icon
5012-1).     In response to detecting the gesture at the location corresponding to the close
application icon, the device closes the corresponding application. In other words, the device
performs quitting/ending of the corresponding application so that the corresponding

application ceases to be an open application.         Alternatively, a tap gesture on the open
application icon including the close-application icon (e.g., gesture 515 on open application
icon 5002-38 in Figure 5H) has the same effect.
 [00211]        In some embodiments, in response to detecting the gesture at the location
corresponding to the open application icon, the device jiggles (650) the open application icon
at the location. In some embodiments, in response to detecting the gesture at the location
corresponding to the open application icon, the device visually distinguishes the open
application icon by dimming other open application icons (e.g., Figure 5H).
 [00212]        As described above, method 600 is used to select a single application for
display among multiple, concurrently open applications. An analogous method may also be
used to select a single view for display among multiple, concurrently open views in a single
application (e.g., selecting one web page for display among multiple, concurrently open web
pages in a browser application).
 [002131        Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 600
(e.g., Figures 6A-6B and 5A-5HH) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the
methods described below.        For example, methods 700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with
reference to method 600.     For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
 [00214]        Figure 7 is a flow diagram illustrating method 700 of selecting one of
concurrently open applications in accordance with some embodiments.              Method 700 is
performed at a multifunction device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction
device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some
embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in
method 700 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
 [00215]        As described below, method 700 provides an intuitive way to select one of
concurrently open applications. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
selecting one of concurrently open application, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to select one of
concurrently open applications faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.

 [002161        The device displays (702) a first application view on a touch-sensitive display
that corresponds to a first application in a plurality of concurrently open applications.   The
first application view is displayed without concurrently displaying an application view for
any other application in the plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., map application
view 5004-1 in Figure 5B).
 [002171        The device detects (704) a first input (e.g., input 507 in Figure 5B).        In
response to detecting the first input (706), the device enters (708) an application view
selection mode for selecting one of the concurrently open applications for display in a
corresponding application view, and displays (710) in a predefined area images of open
application that correspond to at least some of the plurality of concurrently open applications
(e.g., in Figure 5BB, images 5008 that correspond to at least some of the plurality of
concurrently open applications are displayed).         The images of open applications are
displayed in a three-dimensional stack extending backwards on the display (e.g., three
dimensional stack of images 5008 in Figure 5BB).
 [002181        In some embodiments, the images of open applications include open
application icons (e.g., see an analogous example of images 5008 including open application
icons 5002 in Figure 5S). Alternatively, the device can display in the predefined area, open
application icons that correspond to at least some of the plurality of concurrently open
applications, in a three-dimensional stack.
 [00219]        In some embodiments, the images of open applications in the three
dimensional stack are ordered (712) based at least in part on recency of use of corresponding
open applications (e.g., an image of an open application that corresponds to the most recently
used open application is displayed at the front of the stack, while progressively less recently
used applications are displayed progressively further back in the stack).
 [00220]        The device detects (714) a gesture (e.g., 533 in Figure 5BB) on a respective
image of an open application in the three-dimensional stack. In response to detecting the
gesture on the respective image of the open application (716), the device performs the
following actions.     The device displays (718) a respective application view (e.g., mail
application view 5004-4 in Figure 5CC) on the touch-sensitive display for a corresponding
application in the plurality of concurrently open applications.     The respective application
view is displayed without concurrently displaying an application view for any other
application in the plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., mail application view

5004-4 in Figure 5CC). The device ceases (720) to display the three-dimensional stack of
open application icons, and exits (722) the application view selection mode.
 [00221]        Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 700
(e.g., Figure 7 and 5A-5HH) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below. For example, methods 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 may include one or more
of the characteristics of the various methods described above with reference to method 700.
For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
 [00222]        Figures 8A-8C are flow diagrams illustrating method 800 of selecting one of
concurrently open applications in accordance with some embodiments.               Method 800 is
performed at a multifunction device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction
device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some
embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in
method 800 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
 [002231        As described below, method 800 provides an intuitive way to select one of
concurrently open applications. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
selecting one of concurrently open application, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to select one of
concurrently open applications faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.
 [00224]        The device displays (802) a first application view at a first size (e.g., the first
size of the application view occupies all or substantially all (e.g., at least 80% or 90%) of the
touch sensitive display) on a touch-sensitive display (e.g., map application view 5004-1 in
Figure 5B occupies at least 80% of touch screen 112).                The first application view
corresponds (804) to a first application in a plurality of concurrently open applications, and
the first application view is displayed (806) without concurrently displaying at the first size
an application view for any other application in the plurality of concurrently open
applications.
 [00225]        The device detects (808) a first input (e.g., input 507 in Figure 5B).          In
response to detecting the first input (810), the device enters (812) an application view
selection mode for selecting one of the concurrently open applications for display in a
corresponding application view, and displays (814) in a predefined area images of open

applications (e.g., images of open application 5008 in Figure 5Q). Typically, the images of
open applications are user selectable, and the images of open applications, when selected
(e.g., by a gesture), initiate certain processes associated with them (e.g., displaying a
corresponding application view).
 [002261         In some embodiments, the images of open applications in the predefined area
are displayed (826 in Figure 8B) in a single scrollable row or column (e.g., images of open
applications 5008 in Figure 50).      In some embodiments, the images of open applications in
the predefined area are displayed (828) in a grid (e.g., images of open applications 5008 in a
grid in Figure 5Q).    The grid includes at least two rows of images of open applications.
 [002271         In some embodiments, the device concurrently displays (830) the predefined
area and a search icon (e.g., search icon 5104 in Figure 5V).         In some embodiments, the
device detects (832) a gesture (e.g., 521 in Figure 5V) at a location that corresponds to the
search icon, and in response to detecting the gesture at the location that corresponds to the
search icon, the device displays a search input user interface (e.g., the user interface in Figure
5W, including keyboard 5014), receives one or more search terms in the search input user
interface, performs a search using the one or more search terms, and displays results of the
search.
 [00228]         Each image (e.g., live thumbnails) is displayed (834) at a second size that is
smaller than the first size. For example, each image 5008 in Figure 5Q is smaller than map
application view 5004-1 in Figure 5B. In some embodiments, the images are updated to
display reduced-size images of corresponding           applications (or current views in the
corresponding application).
 [00229]         The images and corresponding open application icons correspond (844) to at
least some of the plurality of concurrently open applications.       For example, in Figure 5R,
image 5008-10 and application icon 5002-36 correspond to a mail application. Therefore, in
some embodiments, removing image 5008-10 and application icon 5002-36 closes the
corresponding mail application in device 100.
 [002301         In some embodiments, a grid of reduced-scale images of open applications
and/or open application icons are displayed in a predefined area within a search user interface
(e.g., as a linear array or as an array with at least two rows) (e.g., application icons 5002 in
Figure 5W).

   WO 2011/126502                                                       PCT/US2010/050057
 [002311        The device detects (816 in Figure 8A) a gesture on a respective image of an
open application in the predefined area (e.g., a gesture on image 5008-10, not shown). In
response to detecting the gesture on the respective image (818), the device performs the
following actions. The device displays (820) a respective application view at the first size
on the touch-sensitive display for a corresponding application in the plurality of concurrently
open applications.     The respective application view is displayed without concurrently
displaying at the first size an application view for any other application in the plurality of
concurrently open applications (e.g., mail application view 5004-4 in Figure 5BB).         The
device ceases (822) to display the images and corresponding open application icons in the
predefined area, and exits (824) the application view selection mode.
 [00232]        In some embodiments, displaying in the predefined area images of open
applications includes (836 in Figure 8C) concurrently displaying a corresponding open
application icon with each image (e.g., in Figure 5S, application icons 5002-36, 5002-37, and
5002-38 are concurrently displayed with images 5008-10, 5008-11, and 5008-12).             The
images and corresponding open application icons correspond to at least some of the plurality
of concurrently open applications.      In response to detecting the gesture on the respective
image, the device ceases to display the images and corresponding open application icons in
the predefined area. The concurrent display of images and application icons provide several
benefits.   In particular, a user can easily identify the application to which a respective
reduced image corresponds to. Without the concurrent display of application icons, it can be
difficult to distinguish multiple images with similar background. Therefore, providing the
concurrent display of application icons with the images reduces the cognitive burden on a
user and makes a better human-machine interface.
 [002331        In some embodiments, a respective open application icon in the predefined
area is displayed (838) adjacent to the image of the corresponding open application (not
shown). In some embodiments, a respective open application icon in the predefined area is
displayed (840) at least partially overlapping the image of the corresponding open application
(e.g., application icons 5002 in Figure 5R).        In some embodiments, a respective open
application icon in the predefined area is displayed (842) entirely overlapping the image of
the corresponding open application (not shown).

(e.g., Figures 8A-8C and 5A-5HH) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the

 [002361        As described below, method 900 provides an intuitive way to select one of
concurrently open applications. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
selecting one of concurrently open application, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to select one of
concurrently open applications faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.
 [00237]        The device displays (902) a first application view at a first size (e.g., the first
size of the application view occupies more than 50% of the touch sensitive display) on a
touch-sensitive display. The first application view corresponds (904) to a first application in
a plurality of concurrently open applications. The first application view is displayed (906)
without concurrently displaying at the first size an application view for any other application
in the plurality of concurrently open applications.        For example, in Figure 5B, map
application view 5004-1 is displayed without concurrently displaying an application view for
any other application.
 [002381        The device concurrently displays (908) in a predefined area, images of open
applications (e.g., Figure 50). Each image is displayed (910) at a second size that is smaller
than the first size (e.g., live thumbnails). The images correspond (912) to at least some of
the plurality of concurrently open applications.        In some embodiments, concurrently
displaying in the predefined area images of open applications includes (914) concurrently
displaying a corresponding open application icon with each image.              The images and
corresponding open application icons correspond to at least some of the plurality of
concurrently open applications.

 [002391        The device detects (916) a gesture on a respective image of an open
application in the predefined area. In response to detecting the gesture on the respective
image, the device displays (918) a respective application view at the first size on the touch
sensitive display for a corresponding application in the plurality of concurrently open
applications (e.g., a gesture on image 5008-10 of an email application initiates the display of
mail application view 5004-4, as shown in 5CC).            The respective application view is
displayed without concurrently displaying at the first size an application view for any other
application in the plurality of concurrently open applications (e.g., mail application view
5004-4 in 5CC).
 [00240]        Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 900
(e.g., Figure 9 and 5A-5HH) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below.     For example, methods 1000 and 1100 may include one or more of the
characteristics of the various methods described above with reference to method 900.        For
brevity, these details are not repeated below.
 [002411        Figure 10 is a flow diagram illustrating method 1000 of selecting one of
concurrently open applications in accordance with some embodiments.           Method 1000 is
performed at a multifunction device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction
device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some
embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in
method 1000 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
 [00242]        As described below, method 1000 provides an intuitive way to select one of
concurrently open applications. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
selecting one of concurrently open application, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to select one of
concurrently open applications faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.
 [00243]        While in an application view selection mode for selecting one of a plurality of
concurrently open applications for display in a corresponding application view (1002), the
device performs the following actions.

   WO 2011/126502                                                             PCT/US2010/050057
 [002441         The device displays (1004) in a predefined area, an initial group of open
application icons that correspond to at least some of the plurality of concurrently open
applications (e.g., application icons 5002 in Figure 5C).
 [00245]         The device detects (1006) a gesture in the predefined area. In response to
detecting the gesture in the predefined area (1008), the device performs one of the following
actions.
 [002461         When the gesture is a first scroll gesture in a first direction (e.g., a right-to-left
swipe gesture), the device scrolls (1010) to display other open application icons in the
plurality of concurrently open application icons in the predefined area (e.g., application icons
in Figure 5E-5F).
 [00247]         When the gesture is a second scroll gesture in a second direction opposite the
first direction (e.g., a left-to-right swipe gesture), the device scrolls (1012) to display settings
icons in the predefined area (e.g., settings icons 5102 in Figures 5L-5M).                   In some
embodiments, when the gesture is a second scroll gesture in a second direction different from
the first direction (e.g., a top-to-bottom swipe gesture), the device scrolls to display settings
icons in the predefined area.
 [00248]         When the gesture is a first gesture (e.g., a tap gesture) on a respective open
application icon (1014), the device displays (1016) a respective application view on the
touch-sensitive display for a corresponding application in the plurality of concurrently open
applications, ceases (1020) to display open application icons in the predefined area, and exits
(1022) the application view selection mode (and enters a normal operation mode for the
respective application).     In some embodiments, the respective application view is displayed
(1018) without concurrently displaying an application view for any other application in the
plurality of concurrently open applications.
 [00249]         In some embodiments, when the gesture is a first gesture (e.g., a tap gesture)
on a respective settings icon, the device changes a corresponding setting, ceases to display
open application icons in the predefined area, and exits the application view selection mode
(and enters a normal operation mode for the respective application).
 [002501         In some embodiments, in response to detecting the gesture in the predefined
area, when the gesture is a second gesture (e.g., tap-and-hold gesture 513 in Figure 5G) that is
distinct from the first gesture, on a respective open application icon, the device displays

(1024) a close-application icon for closing a corresponding application (e.g., an "X" icon or
"-" icon 5002-38 in Figure 5H on or proximate to the open application icon).
 [00251]         Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 1000
(e.g., Figure 10 and 5A-5HH) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below. For example, method 1100 may include one or more of the characteristics
of the various methods described above with reference to method 1000.          For brevity, these
details are not repeated below.
 [00252]         Figures 11 A-I lB are flow diagrams illustrating method 1100 of selecting one
of concurrently open applications in accordance with some embodiments.          Method 1100 is
performed at a multifunction device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction
device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some
embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in
method 1100 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
 [002531         As described below, method 1100 provides an intuitive way to select one of
concurrently open applications. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
selecting one of concurrently open application, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to select one of
concurrently open applications faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.
 [00254]         The device displays (1102) a first application view at a first size in a first
application (e.g., in Figure 5CC, mail application view 5004-4 in a mail application).        The
first application view includes a user selectable object (e.g., link 5020-1) associated with a
second application (e.g., a web browser application) that is distinct from the first application.
 [002551         The device detects (1104) a first gesture at a location that corresponds to the
user selectable object (e.g., gesture 525 in Figure 5CC). In response to detecting the first
gesture (1106), the device ceases (1108) to display the first application view, and displays
(1110) a second application view in the second application (e.g., browser application view
5004-5 in Figure 5DD).        In some embodiments, the second application view replaces the
first application view (e.g., in Figures 5CC-5DD, browser application view 5004-5 replaces
mail application view 5004-4).

   WO 2011/126502                                                            PCT/US2010/050057
 [002561         While in the second application, the device detects (1112) an input (e.g., input
527 in Figure 5DD).       In response to detecting the input (1114), the device performs the
following actions.    The device enters (1116) an application view selection mode for selecting
one of a plurality of concurrently open applications for display in a corresponding application
view. The device displays (1118) images of open applications in a first predefined area (e.g.,
images 5008-12 and 5008-10 in Figure 5EE). The images of open applications correspond
to at least some of the plurality of concurrently open applications. In some embodiments,
the images are displayed as a scrollable linear strip of images (e.g., images 5008 are
scrollable as shown in Figures 5EE-5FF).           Each image is displayed at a second size that is
smaller than the first size (e.g., live thumbnails).      The images include an image of the first
application view and an image of a view in the second application (e.g., image 5008-12 of a
browser application view and image 5008-10 of a mail application view). The device
displays (1120) in a second predefined area that is distinct from the first predefined area, a
portion of a view with application icons for launching applications (e.g., a home screen or
springboard with application icons) (e.g., a portion of "home screen" 5001).
 [00257]         In some embodiments, the device displays images of open applications that are
logically connected. For example, assume that in a mail application (e.g., Figure 5CC), a
web browser application is opened (e.g., Figure 5DD).          Also assume that in the web browser
application, an electronic book application is opened (not shown). Then, the device displays
images of a subset of the mail application, the web browser application, and the electronic
book application, regardless of any other concurrently open applications.
 [00258]         While in the application view selection mode, the device detects (1122) a
second gesture (e.g., a tap gesture).     In response to detecting the second gesture (1124), the
device performs one of the following actions.
 [002591         When the second gesture is at a location corresponding to the image of the
first application view (1126) (e.g., gesture 535 in Figure 5EE), the device displays (1128) the
first application view at the first size in the first application (e.g., map application view 5004
4 in Figure 5CC), ceases (1130) to display the images in the first predefined area, and exits
(1132) the application view selection mode (and enters a normal operation mode for the
respective application).
 [002601         When the second gesture is at a location corresponding to the second
predefined area (1134) (e.g., gesture 533 in Figure 5FF), the device displays (1136) the view
                                                   75

   WO 2011/126502                                                          PCT/US2010/050057
with application icons for launching applications (in other words, displaying the view with
application launch items in its entirety, rather than displaying just a portion of this view) (e.g.,
home screen 5001 as shown in Figure 5HH), ceases (1138) to display the images in the first
predefined area, and exits (1140) the application view selection mode (and enters a normal
operation mode for launching applications from the view with application icons).
 [002611        In some embodiments, when the second gesture is at a location corresponding
to an image of a respective application in the first predefined area (1142), the device displays
(1144) a respective application view on the touch-sensitive display for a corresponding
application in the plurality of concurrently open applications, ceases (1148) to display the
images in the first predefined area, and exits (1150) the application view selection mode (and
enters a normal operation mode for the respective application).      For example, in response to
detecting gesture 531 at a location corresponding to image 5008-6 of a map application, map
application view is displayed on the display (e.g., Figure 5GG).
 [00262]        In some embodiments, the respective application view is displayed (1146)
without concurrently displaying an application view for any other application in the plurality
of concurrently open applications (e.g., Figure 5GG).
 [002631        The operations in the information processing methods described above may be
implemented by running one or more functional modules in information processing apparatus
such as general purpose processors or application specific               chips. These modules,
combinations of these modules, and/or their combination with general hardware (e.g., as
described above with respect to Figures 1A, lB and 3) are all included within the scope of
protection of the invention.
 [00264]        The operations described above with reference to Figures 6A-6C, 7, 8A-8C, 9,
 10, and 11 A-11 B may be implemented by components depicted in Figures lA-iC.                 For
example, detection operation 604, application view selection mode entering operation 608,
and exiting operation 622-may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180,
and event handler 190.     Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1.    A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the
event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact
at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface (or whether rotation of the device)
corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user
                                                 76

interface, or rotation of the device from one orientation to another.        When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize
or call data updater 176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to update the application
internal state 192.   In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI
updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a
person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the
components depicted in Figures 1A-IC.
 [00265]        The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with
reference to specific embodiments.      However, the illustrative discussions above are not
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many
modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments
were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its
practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention
