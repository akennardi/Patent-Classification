                                         Technical Field
[0001]           The present invention relates to a device and a system for vascular access, for
example, a device and a system for vascular access for hemodialysis. The present invention
also relates to a guiding portion for use in vascular access.
                                           Background
[00021           A patient with end-stage renal disease would be required to undergo
hemodialysis as often as three times a week for up to four hours each time. Hemodialysis is a
procedure to clean the patient's blood and remove extra fluid in the form of urine, a process
carried out by our kidneys. Hemodialysis requires vascular access to the patient whereby
needles are penetrated into the patient body so as to establish blood flow between the patient
and a dialysis machine to carry out hemodialysis.
[00031           Hemodialysis may be performed in the hospital, a dialysis centre or at home.
In the hospital and dialysis centre, vascular access is performed by trained medical
professionals, such as nurses or doctors. Generally, in the hospital and dialysis centre setting,
medical professionals rotate the cannulation of the blood vessel, most commonly an
arteriovenous fistula, between 5-7 sites that are spaced 2-3cm apart to distribute the trauma
experienced by the arteriovenous fistula from repeated needling evenly across the vessel.
This is known as "rope ladder" technique. However, this technique is not ideal as patients
generally do not have that long an arteriovenous fistula to accommodate 5-7 rotation sites and
the rotation sequence may not be followed strictly due to workflow challenges, leading to
complications such as aneurysms, stenosis and thrombosis. In fact, as much as one third of
dialysis cost goes towards managing vascular access and complications each year (Source:
Mary Stuart, Startup 2011). The "buttonhole" technique is an alternative needling technique
where cannulation of the arteriovenous fistula is performed consistently at the same location
of the vessel wall, and via the same punctured track between the vessel and the skin. This
technique has been shown to minimize pain and to disrupt the biological mechanism that

causes stenosis known as neo intimal hyperplasia. The buttonhole technique has also been
shown to extend arteriovenous fistula lifespan and reduce complication rate in clinical studies
(Source: M.M van Loon et al., 2009). Despite its advantages, the buttonhole technique is only
available for limited number of patients as this technique is difficult to execute and is usually
performed blind relying heavily on experience and skill. Further, before a patient can adopt
buttonhole cannulation, a scarred tracked between the arteriovenous fistula and the skin needs
to be created by blind and repeated needling through the exact trajectory across the
subcutaneous tissue between the skin and the arteriovenous fistula, by the same medical
professional over 10 -      20 dialysis sessions. This further heightens the barrier and the skills
for buttonhole technique to be widely adopted.
[0004]           In the home environment as well, the patient or his or her family member
usually lacks the experience and skill to carry the needling technique without which the risk
of trauma to the patient's blood vessel would be increased due to repeated needle punctures
from unsuccessful vascular access. This often compromises the safety of the patient during
dialysis, lowers the lifespan of a healthy arteriovenous fistula and increase costs of the
hemodialysis treatments required to treat resulting vascular access complications. The lack of
medical expertise or vascular access skills at home is also a decisive hurdle for home
hemodialysis technologies from being adopted.
[0005]           As such, there is a need for a device and a system to lower the skill variability
in administrating of needles into the patient's arteriovenous fistula using the buttonhole
technique by either the medical professional or the patient himself. An invention that can
achieve that would help prolong the lifespan of the arteriovenous fistula, alleviate the risk of
the patient, and reduce cost of hemodialysis treatments that goes to repairing and/or treating
vascular access complications resulted by needling.

art, is not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter was known or that the
information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of

                                          Description
[0013]          Embodiments described below in context of the devices and systems are
analogously valid for the respective methods, and vice versa. Furthermore, it will be
understood that the embodiments described below may be combined, for example, a part of
one embodiment may be combined with a part of another embodiment.
[0014]          Figs. IA to 1G illustrate a vascular access device 102 which is able to
penetrate through a tissue layer (shown later in Figs. 2A to 2C) but automatically losses
column strength after piercing through the tissue layer, and gradually conforms to its
surrounding tissue trajectory.
[00151          Fig. 1A shows a side view of the vascular access device 102 in accordance
with an embodiment. The vascular access device 102 may include a needle 100 having a tip
portion 112; and a shield 114 arranged around and at least substantially along a longitudinal
axis (X-X) of the needle 100, wherein the shield 114 is substantially rigid so as to provide
strength to the tip portion 112 to penetrate the tissue layer as the tip portion 112 extends out
                                                8

       WO 2014/017986                                                          PCT/SG2013/000311
 from the shield 114 and the needle 100 gradually loses column strength or conforms to the
 surrounding tissue beneath the tissue layer as the distance between the tip portion 112 and the
 shield 114 increases. In this regard, the inherent property of the needle 100 does not change
 between the position where the needle 100 is housed within the shield 114 and the position
 when the needle 100 is out of the shield 114. The change in state of the needle 100 or the loss
 in column strength is a result of the needle 100 moving out from the shield 114, thereby
 losing the rigidity which is provided by the shield 114.
 [0016]           The needle 100 is substantially elongated and may be of approximately the
 same length as the shield 114 or may be slightly shorter than the length of the shield 114,
 depending on the user design and requirements. Further, the needle 100 may be sized in
 diameter so as to fit appropriately within the interior of the shield 114. If the diameter of the
 needle 100 is sized very close to or larger than the diameter of the shield 114, there may be
 some resistance or difficulty in sliding or moving the needle 100 relative to the shield 114.
 Therefore, the diameter of the needle 100 may be appropriately chosen so as to provide an
 ease of the needle 100 sliding within and out of the shield 114.
 [0017]          In the example shown in Fig. 1A, surrounding the flexible needle shaft 100 is
 the rigid translatable tubular support sheath or shield 114 of an inner diameter slightly larger
 than an outer diameter of the flexible needle shaft 100. An 18G needle 100 has an edge to
 edge width (or outer diameter) of about 1.270mm and an 14G needle 100 has an edge to edge
 width of about 2.108mm.
 [0018]          Further, the tip portion 112 may include a substantially sharp portion
 configured to allow ease of the penetration of the tissue layer. The sharper the tip portion 112,
 the easier the needle 100 may be allowed to be pierced through the tissue layer. If the tip
 portion 112 is too blunt, there may be some difficulty in piercing through the tissue layer and
 may cause some pain to the user.
 [0019]          The outer diameter of the needle 100 may be in a range of between 1.270mm
 (18G) to 2.108mm (14G) and the length of the needle 100 required to interact with the
 guiding portion (shown later in Fig. 5A) may be in a range of between about 3mm to 12mm.
 Also, the thickness of the material forming the shield 114 may be in the range of between
 about 0.1mm to 0.3mm. These values may be consistent with the wall thickness of the 26G
 and 13G rigid needle 100. Typically, the thicker the material used to form the shield 114, the
 more rigid is the shield 114. This rigidity of the shield 114 is also dependent on the material
 used to form the shield 114. The thickness and material of the shield 114 may be dependent
-on user-and-design requirements.---

  [0020]           Figs. 1B to 1D show respective side views of the vascular access device 102 in
 various stages of use from a initial starting position in Fig. lB to an intermediate position
 which allows piercing of a skin layer in Fig. 1C and to a use position where the needle 100 is
 fully extended within the blood vessel (not shown) in Fig. ID.
  [00211          In more details, Fig. lB shows a side view of the vascular access device 102
 with an actuating portion 116, where the needle 100 is fully encapsulated within the shield
  114 in a sterile chamber in accordance with an embodiment. Fig. 1C shows a side view of the
 needle 100 which pierces a seal 118 (shown in Fig. 1B) positioned at a distal end of the shield
  114 while the sheath 114 moves towards the actuating portion 116 in accordance with an
 embodiment. Fig. 1D shows a side view of the needle 100 with substantially no column
 strength when the rigid support sheath 114 is fully retracted within the actuating portion 116
 in accordance with an embodiment.
 [00221           Like in Fig. 1A, the vascular access device 102 in Figs. lB to 1D may include
 a needle 100 having a tip portion 112; and a shield 114 arranged around and at least
 substantially along a longitudinal axis (X-X) of the needle 100, wherein the shield 114 is
 substantially rigid so as to provide strength to the tip portion 112 to penetrate a tissue layer
 (not shown) as the tip portion 112 extends out from the shield 114 and the needle 100
 gradually loses column strength or conforms to the surrounding tissue beneath the tissue layer
 as the distance between the tip portion 112 and the shield 114 increases.
 [0023]           However, unlike Fig. 1A, the vascular access device 102 in Figs. lB to 1D
 may additionally include the actuating portion 116 coupled to a portion of the needle 100. In
 Figs. 1B to 1D, the actuating portion 116 is shown to be coupled to one end of the needle
 100, opposite to the tip portion 112. However, the actuating portion 116 may be coupled to at
 any suitable portion along the needle 100, for example at both sides or just at one side of the
 needle 100. Also, the actuating portion 116 may be coupled at one point or at a plurality of
 points along the needle 100 depending on user and design requirements. Further, the shape of
 the actuating portion 116 may vary depending on user and design requirement.
 [0024]           Further, the shield 114 is substantially rigid so as to provide strength to the tip
 portion 112 to first penetrate a skin layer (not shown) and then the tissue layer (i.e.
 subcutaneous tissue layer) (not shown) beneath the skin layer to access a blood vessel (not
 shown) below the tissue layer when the actuating portion 116 is first actuated and to
 gradually lose column strength as the shield 114 retracts into the actuating portion 116 and as
 the needle 100 enters and travels along the blood vessel, so as to prevent the needle 100 from
-penetrating a further-tissue layer beneath the blood vessel.

 [00251          The shield 114 is configured to be slidable relative to the tip portion 112. As
an example in Fig. IC, the shield 114 may be slidable relative to the tip portion 112 when a
force (as shown by the arrow) is applied onto the actuating portion 116. A further force may
be applied on the shield 114 so that the respective forces on the actuating portion 116 and the
shield 114 may allow the shield 114 to slide into the actuating portion 116. Also, as an
example, there may be alignment tracks within the actuating portion 116 for ease of sliding
the shield 114 into the actuating portion 116 and to limit the extent in which the shield 114 is
able to slide into the actuating portion 116. As an example, the direction of the force on the
actuating portion 116 may be as shown in the arrow in Figs. 1C and ID. The shield 114 may
also be slidable relative to the tip portion 112 without any force applied onto the actuating
portion 116.
[00261          In an alternative embodiment, the shield 114 may also be slidable by means of
a press button or activation means (not shown) positioned at any suitable location on the
actuating device 116. The press button may operate together with a spring positioned within
the actuating portion 116 such that the spring may be compressed as the shield 114 slides into
the actuating portion 116 and to release the shield 114 back to an original default position
covering the needle 100 as soon as the user has completed use of the vascular access device
102. In this case, the vascular access device 102 is placed near to the skin layer 104 such that
the tip portion 112 of the needle 100 is forced into the skin layer 104 when the outer shield
114 retracts within the actuating device 116.
[0027]          As shown in Fig. 1B, the shield 114 may further include a sealing portion 118
arranged covering an open end of the shield 14 and adjacent to the tip portion 112 of the
needle 100 so as to seal the needle 100 therein a sterile chamber within the shield 114. The
tip portion or a distal end 112 of the needle 100 may include a plurality of ports or openings
120 to increase flow rate of fluid flowing into the blood vessel. The higher the number of
ports 120, the higher the flow rate of fluid into the blood vessel. The size of each of the ports
120 may also influence the flow rate of fluid into the blood vessel. The ports 120 may be
positioned at fixed intervals at the tip portion 112 or may be positioned randomly along the
length of the tip portion 112. The ports 120 may also be positioned along the entire length of
the needle 100. The number, the size and the position of the ports 112 may vary depending on
user and design requirements.
[0028]          The needle 100 may further include a flexible portion 122, the flexible portion
122 may be coupled directly or indirectly to the tip portion 112. The length of the tip portion

 122 may vary depending on user and design requirements. The length of the tip portion 112
 may be in a range of about 2mm to 6mm and the length of the flexible portion 122 may be in
 a range of about 4mm to about 20mm. Further, the diameter of the flexible portion 122 may
be substantially consistent with the diameter of the tip portion 112 or may vary depending on
user and design requirements. Also, the cross-sectional of the flexible portion 122 and the tip
portion 112 may be substantially circular. But any other cross-sectional shapes of the flexible
portion 122 and the tip portion 112 are also possible. Further, the tip portion 112 and the
flexible portion 122 may be formed as one integrated portion or may be formed from separate
portions and coupled together by any suitable couplings. More details on the material of the
respective tip portion 112 and flexible portion 122 may be disclosed in the description
relating to Figs. IF and 1G.
[0029]          Fig. 1E shows a side view of an alternative embodiment of a vascular access
device 102 with the needle 100 constructed by laser cut flexible metallic tubing 124 in
accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 1E, the needle 100 is shown to be a combination of a
laser cut metal needle portion 126 which provides flexibility and porousness of the tip portion
 112 (or distal section) to increase flow of the fluid into the blood vessel and a polymer or
shrink tube coating 124 along a remaining section of the laser cut needle 126. The portion of
the needle 100 which is not covered by the polymer or shrink tube coating 124 may be
termed the tip portion 112 of the needle 100 while the portion of the needle 100 which is
covered by the polymer or shrink tube coating 124 may be termed the flexible portion 122 of
the needle. The polymer or shrink tube coating 124 is configured to fit snugly onto the laser
cut metal needle 126 to prevent any sliding of the polymer or shrink tube coating 124 relative
to the laser cut metal needle 126. The shield 114 retracts into the actuating portion 116 to a
certain extent such that the needle 100 is shown to lose some column strength.
[0030]          Fig. 1F shows a needle 100 with different material configurations to construct
the needle shaft 100 according to an embodiment.
[0031]          The flexible needle shaft 100 may include a single material or a combination
of materials with varying flexibility in order to achieve this desired flexibility. Material
configurations may include, but are not limited to a combination of metal and polymer in
various permutations. In one embodiment, the flexible portion (or proximal shaft) 122 of the
flexible needle 100 is fabricated from polymer and the tip portion (or the distal needle tip)
112 of the flexible needle 100 is fabricated from metal. In another embodiment, the flexible
portion (or proximal shaft) 122 of the flexible needle 100 is fabricated from metal and the tip
portion (or the distal needle tip) 112 of the flexible needle 100 is fabricated from polymer. In

yet another embodiment, the flexible portion 122 of the flexible needle 100 is fabricated from
a combination of polymer and metal positioned or coupled in an alternating manner and the
tip portion 112 of the flexible needle 100 is fabricated from metal. For example, the flexible
portion 122 and the tip portion 112 may also include shape-memory alloys, either alone or in
combination with polymer and metal in any suitable configurations. The flexible needle 100
may also be formed of all metal or all polymers.
[00321           Fig. 1G shows a needle 100 configured with different material flexibility along
its longitudinal axis in accordance with an embodiment.
[00331           In one embodiment, the flexible needle 100 with the metal tip portion (or
distal metal tip) 112 may be constructed with the flexible portion 122 or proximal segment of
the needle shaft 100 having polymer with differing flexibility along the longitudinal axis of
the needle shaft 100. In another embodiment, the flexible needle 100 can be constructed with
a polymer needle tip or tip portion 112 coupled with a laser-cut metal proximal shaft or
flexible portion 122. Similarly, the proximal metal shaft or flexible portion 122 can be
configured to have differing flexibility along the longitudinal axis of the needle 100.
Conceivably, the proximal shaft or the flexible portion 122 of the flexible needle 100 may
also be constructed with alternatively segments of laser-cut metal and flexible polymers to
achieve the desired flexibility and push-strength.
[00341           The polymer to metal interface may be bonded by use of bio-adhesives that
may be UV or time cured (such as Dymax or Loctite), heat treatment, chemical bonding,
mechanical interlocking mechanism or a combination of adhesives or heat with sandblasted
metal surfaces. Bonding materials should be inert and unreactive to body fluids and range of
medical fluids with which the bonding materials may come in contact. In some embodiments,
flexible needle shaft 100 may be coated with lubricious material with low coefficient of
friction to allow a smoother navigation through the buttonhole. Such coating includes, but not
limited to Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyurethane (PU), polyethylene (PE) and high
density polyethylene.
[0035]           Figs. 2A to 2C illustrate the principle of the vascular access device 102,
applied in obtaining access to a blood vessel 108, and how this device 102 may enable safer
vascular access.

 side view of the vascular access needle 100 unable to penetrate a subsequent layer of tissue
 128 without column strength in accordance with an embodiment.
 [00371         In Fig. 2A, the support sheath 114 prevents the flexible needle shaft 100 from
buckling when the needle tip or tip portion 112 has not travelled beyond a distal opening 130
of the support sheath 114. This enables the flexible access needle 100 to have column
strength to penetrate the first layer of tissue or subcutaneous tissue layer 106. In Fig. 2B,
upon the tip portion 112 of the flexible access needle 100 travelling beyond the distal opening
 130 of the support sheath 114, the protruded section or tip portion 112 of the flexible needle
shaft 100 loses side support from the rigid sheath 114, thereby losing column strength.
Subsequently, as seen in Fig. 2C, further pushing of the tip portion 112 of the needle 100 to a
second layer of tissue 128 causes the flexible needle shaft 100 to buckle, thereby losing force
transmission ability and penetrative force. The direction of force onto the actuating portion
 116 is as shown in the arrows in Figs. 2B and 2C. The device 102 will work as long as the tip
portion 112 is sharp and has enough force transmission to penetrate the first layer of tissue or
subcutaneous tissue layer 106.
[0038]          Figs. 3A to 3F show how the vascular access needle 100 interacts with a
vascular access cuff 132. Fig. 3A shows a side cross-sectional view of a fistula or blood
vessel 108 (an abnormal connection or passageway between two epithelium-lined organs or
vessels that normally do not connect) with the vascular access cuff 132 implanted
extraluminally in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 3A, the vascular access cuff 132 is
shown to include 2 subsurface ports 136 branching from the cuff 132 that encompasses a
blood vessel 108, such as a fistula or vascular graft. Although Fig. 3A shows 2 subsurface
ports 136, there may be more than 2 subsurface ports 136 depending on user and design
requirements. Each port 136 creates a "bump" on the skin layer 104.
[0039]         Fig. 3B shows a side cross-sectional view of the fistula or blood vessel 108
with the vascular access needle 100 penetrating a skin layer 104 and entering a port 136 of
the vascular access cuff 132 in accordance with an embodiment and Fig. 3C shows a side
cross-sectional view of the fistula or blood vessel 108 with the vascular access needle 100
entering a support tunnel 138 of the vascular access cuff 132 in accordance with an
embodiment.
[0040]         A patient identifies the "bump" and pierces the vascular access needle 100
through the skin layer 104 directed at the subsurface port 136. The flexible access needle 100,
upon penetrating the skin layer 104, pierces through a port membrane 140 and enters a funnel
chamber 142. Regardless of the angle the needle 100 enters a funnel chamber 142 of the port
                                                14

 136, the funnel chamber 142 will guide the flexible needle 100 through the support tunnel
 138 where the flexible access needle 100 regains support and column strength as shown in
 Fig. 3B and Fig. 3C.
 [0041]         Fig. 3D shows a side cross-sectional view of the fistula or blood vessel 108
 with the vascular access needle 100 penetrating a first wall of the vessel 108 to gain vascular
 access in accordance with an embodiment. Identical to the rigid support sheath 114 in the
vascular access needle 100, the support tunnel 138 has an inner diameter slightly larger than
the outer diameter of the flexible needle shaft 100 (between 1.270mm for 18G needle to
2.108mm for 14G needle) to provide the flexible access needle force transmission and
penetration strength to pierce through the first wall of the blood vessel 108 when the needle
 100 leaves a distal end 144 of the support tunnel 138 as shown in Fig. 3D.
 [0042]         Fig. 3E shows a side cross-sectional view of the fistula or blood vessel 108
with the vascular access needle 100 losing column strength and not traumatizing the adjacent
wall 146 of the vessel 108 in accordance with an embodiment. Upon flexible access needle
 100 gaining intraluminal access to the blood vessel 108, the needle 100 loses column strength
due to the absence of the rigid sheath support 114 or the support tunnel 138. This allows the
flexible access needle 100 to thread in an intra-luminal fashion instead of piercing through an
opposite wall 146 of the vessel 108. The user could alternate between subsurface access ports
 136 to allow time for the punctured site of the blood vessel 108 to heal.
 [0043]         Fig. 3F shows a side cross-sectional view of the fistula or blood vessel 108
with the vascular access needle 100 being extracted out of the vascular access cuff 132 in
accordance with an embodiment.
[0044]          Figs. 4A to 4B characterize the flexibility of the needle shaft 100 required for
the vascular access device 102 (shown in Fig. 1A) to work optimally with the funnel or
channel portion (shown later in Fig. 4B or 5A) and in obtaining access to the arteriovenous
fistula or blood vessel 108. Fig. 4A shows a definition of bending radius ratio and relation
with bending radius (r) and an outer diameter (OD) of a needle 100 in accordance with an
embodiment.
 [0045]         Fig. 4A shows a flexible needle shaft 100 of a vascular access device (not
shown) relative to a skin layer 104. A portion of the needle shaft 100 is shown to be
positioned at an angle relative to the skin layer 104. The angle at which the needle shaft 100
penetrates the skin layer 104 relative to a plane of the skin layer 104 is termed the angle of
entry, 0, of the flexible needle shaft 100. The angle of entry, 0 may range between more than
0' and less than 90'.

      WO 2014/017986                                                           PCT/SG2013/000311
 [0046]          Further, the degree of flexibility of the flexible needle shaft 100 of the
 vascular access device 104 is defined by the bending radius ratio. The bending radius ratio
 may be defined as a ratio of the bending radius (r) of the flexible needle shaft 100 to the outer
 diameter (OD) of the flexible needle shaft 100. The bending radius (r) is measured from a
 point of the origin of curvature (o) to a centre of the outer diameter (OD) of the flexible
 needle shaft 100. The outer diameter (OD) of the flexible needle shaft 100 may be taken to be
 the thickness of the needle shaft 100 or a cross-sectional of the needle shaft 100 in a direction
perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the needle shaft.
 [0047]          For the needle shaft 100 to have a sufficient flexibility, the bending radius (r)
may be in the range of 4.8mm to 56mm and the outer diameter (OD) of the needle 100 may
be in the range of 1.270mm (18G) to 2.108mm (14G). For example, the outer diameter (OD)
of the needle 100 shall be smaller than the diameter of a blood vessel 108 shown beneath the
skin layer 104 so as to allow the needle 100 to travel with ease along the blood vessel 108.
 [0048]         Fig. 4B shows respective cross-sectional view of an entry of a needle 100
through an implanted biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206 at about 250 and about 65'
relative to the plane of the skin layer 104 in accordance with an embodiment. As an example
shown in Fig. 4B, the flexible needle shaft 100 of the vascular access device 102 may be
configured to have flexibility of at least 4 times bending radius ratio (upper limit - most
flexible), but not more than 44 times bending radius ratio (lower limit - least flexible). As an
example, 4 times bending radius ratio indicates that in the most extreme scenario, where
vascular access is done in the most unreasonable manner permissable, the needle shaft 100
need not be more flexible than this to enter, hence setting the upper limit. In this regard, 44
times bending radius ratio applies to the scenario in which vascular access is gained in the
most optimal case, whereby the needle shaft 100 has to possess at least this flexibility in
order to work in this system. As a comparison, a stiff needle shaft 100 which has a bending
radius ratio greater than 44 (infinite in this case) may not work.
 [0049]         This flexibility range is optimized to work for the vascular access angle made
by either an implanted funnel or channel portion 206 or a buttonhole track (not shown) (or its
equivalent) at the angle of entry, 0 between about 250 to about 650. In this regard, the
bending radius ratio and the angle of entry may not be confined to the example provided and
may vary according to user and design requirements. More details of the implanted funnel or
channel portion 206 and the buttonhole track will be described in the description relating to
Figs. 5A to 5P, Figs. 6A to 6L. Figs. 7A to 7B, Figs. 8A to 8P.
 [0050]         Figs. 5A to 5P illustrate an alternative embodiment where the vascular access

 cuff 132 as shown in Figs. 3A to 3F can be substituted with a guiding portion or
biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206 (illustrated as a helical-screw track in this
instance) that may serve as a guide during needle insertion.
 [00511           In this regard, the substitution of the vascular access cuff 132 as shown in Figs.
3A to 3F with the funnel or channel portion 206 removes the requirement for implantation of
a foreign body indefinitely while retaining the concept of a single-track creation for needle
insertion.
 [00521           The funnel or channel portion 206 may be defined as a structure that may
include a larger inner diameter at the top (entry point or inlet) 162 and a smaller inner
diameter at the bottom (exit point or outlet) 164 to guide the needle 100 towards a desired
same point of entry of a blood vessel.             Funnel construction may be preferred to be
biodegradable and resorbable. Materials may include, but may not be limited to: polylactides,
polyglycolide, polycaprolactone, random copolymers of polyglycolide and polylactide,
random copolymer of lactide and caprolactone.            The funnel or channel 206 may also be
constructed from a blend of the above-mentioned materials. In some embodiments,
biodegradable additives may be used to modify funnel properties such as strength, flexibility
and degradation rate. Additives may include, but not limited to: alkyl citrates such as triethyl
citrate (TEC), triacetin and polyethylene gycol (PEG). Materials for the non-biodegradable
funnel or channel portion 206 may include, but not limited to: thermoplastic elastomer such
as silicone rubber and nylon block copolymers. The funnel or channel portion 206 may
include pore patterns of any shape, size and pattern that may encourage altered rate of fibrosis
on the inner lumen surface. In some embodiments, exterior and interior surfaces of the funnel
or channel portion 206 may be modified to have a rough finish so as to promote an altered
rate of fibrosis.
[00531            The funnel or channel portion 206 interacts as an accessory to a general needle
to support track formation in the tissue subcutaneous layer. The purpose of the funnel or
channel portion 206 may be to guide the needle through a tunnel, leading to the opening of a
blood vessel, such as a fistula or a vascular graft. The port or entry point proximal to the skin
has an inner diameter of between about 1.270mm to about 2.108mm for the entry of needles
 14G to 18G. The shape of the funnel or channel portion 206 may include an inverted taper to
provide sufficient guidance of the needle 100 towards the blood vessel, with features such as,
but not limited to a unidirectional valve at the end of the taper, gel filled cavity in the tapered
funnel and a dog-bone shaped saddle support.

delivery device 166 that inserts a biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206, and a close-up
view of an implanted funnel or channel portion 206 in accordance with an embodiment. In
Fig. 6A, the vascular access device 102; and the implanted funnel or the channel portion 206
may form the vascular access system 168.
[0055]          The vascular access device 102 in Fig. 5A is similar to that shown in Fig. lB.
Like in Fig. IB, the vascular access device 102 in Fig. 5A may include a needle 100 having a
tip portion 112; and a shield 114 arranged around and at least substantially along a
longitudinal axis (not shown) of the needle 100, wherein the shield 114 is substantially rigid
so as to provide strength to the tip portion 112 to penetrate a tissue layer (not shown) as the
tip portion 112 extends out from the shield 114 and the needle 100 gradually loses column
strength as the distance between the tip portion 112 and the shield 114 increases. The
vascular access device 102 may additionally include an actuating portion 116 coupled to a
portion of the needle 100.
[0056]          The delivery device 166 is similar to the vascular access device 102 in that the
delivery device 166 includes a delivery actuating portion 170 and a delivery needle 172
coupled to the delivery actuating portion 170. However, the delivery needle 172 is relatively
rigid compared to the flexible needle 100 of the vascular access device 102. The funnel or
channel portion 206 to be inserted into the patient is to be initially housed within a handle
248 of the delivery device 166.
[00571          In Fig. 5A, the biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206 includes two
helical-screw tracks 174 (dark line), 176 (light line), one in the clockwise direction and the
other in the anticlockwise direction. These two helical-screw tracks 174, 176 may be inserted
with the delivery device 166 prior to vascular needle access. Depending on the mechanism of
the funnel delivery device 166, each helical-screw 174, 176 may be inserted sequentially or at
the same time. In the event that the biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206 does not
include more than 1 part, the entire funnel or channel portion 206 may be delivered in a
single instance by the funnel delivery device 166.
[0058]          In Fig. 5A, the implementation of two anti-directional helical-screws 174, 176
may serve as a track or funnel that guides future needle insertions. The length of the funnel or
channel portion 206 to be used may be predetermined in accordance with the distance the
intended blood vessel is from the surface of the skin layer. As an example, the length of the
funnel or channel portion 206 may range between about 3mm to about 12mm. The funnel or
channel portion 206 is expected to be absorbed over time (e.g. about 1 - 6 months), leaving a
scarred tissue track 188 as shown in Fig. 5N that serves as a track for future needle insertions.

 [0059]          Figs. 5B to 5G illustrates how the funnel or channel portion 206, which
 includes two helical-screws 174, 176, is inserted with the delivery device 166.
 [00601          Fig. 5B shows a cross-sectional side view of the delivery device 166 that
 inserts the biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206 in accordance with an embodiment.
The delivery device 166 with the funnel or channel portion 206 pre-stored within the delivery
device 166 is first brought near to a skin layer 104 of a patient. The respective layers of the
patient as shown in Fig. 5B are the outer skin layer 104, a subcutaneous tissue layer or first
tissue layer 106 below the skin layer 104, a blood vessel 108 below the subcutaneous tissue
layer 106 and a second tissue layer 128 below the blood vessel 108.
 [0061]         Fig. 5C shows a cross-sectional side view of the delivery needle 172 of the
delivery device 166 positioned at an optimal angle of needle insertion in accordance with an
embodiment. In Fig. 5C, the funnel delivery device 166 is first inserted at the desired angle
such that the delivery needle 172 penetrates the skin layer 104 and the subcutaneous tissue
layer 106. In Fig. 5C, the angle is shown to be about 250 but this angle can be adjusted
according to user and design requirements.
[00621          Fig. 5D shows a deployment of a clockwise helical-screw 174 while an
anticlockwise helical-screw 176 is still within the delivery device 166 in accordance with an
embodiment. In Fig. 5D, an outer delivery sheath 178 of the delivery needle 172 that
previously held onto the ends of the helical-screws 174, 176 then ejects the helical-screws
 174, 176 (one after the other for example). The outer delivery sheath 178 may be activated by
means of a force onto the delivery actuating portion 170 of the delivery device 166 by a push
button. However, any other suitable means of activating the outer delivery sheath 178 may
also be possible depending on user and design requirements. The outer delivery sheath 178
may be of a relatively rigid material such that any force exerted on the outer delivery sheath
178 may be translated onto the helical-screws 174, 176.
[0063]          Fig. 5E shows a deployment of the anticlockwise helical-screw 176 with the
clockwise helical-screw 174 as a guide in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 5E, the
clockwise helical-screw 174 is delivered with the anticlockwise helical-screw 176 as a guide.
The external diameter of the clockwise helical-screw 174 may be slightly smaller/bigger than
the internal diameter of the anticlockwise helical-screw 176 to ensure a good fit. However,
the external diameter of the clockwise helical-screw 174 may also be comparable with the
external diameter of the anticlockwise helical-screw 176.
[0064]          Fig. 5F shows a cross-linking of the clockwise helical-screw 174 and the
anticlockwise-helical-screw     176,--forming- a helical-screw track- or channel -portion 206 in

 accordance with an embodiment. The helical-screw track or channel portion 206 is
 configured to be placed at an angle above the blood vessel 108 and configured to receive and
 guide a vascular access needle (not shown) to reach the same location of the blood vessel 108
repeatedly and consistently.
 [0065]         Fig. 5G shows a retraction of the delivery device 166 leaving behind the
helical-screw track or channel portion 206 in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 5G, the
funnel delivery device 166 is retracted, leaving behind the funnel or channel portion 206 (that
includes both the biodegradable clockwise and anticlockwise helical-screws 174, 176 in this
embodiment). The funnel or channel portion 206 forms a resultant scarring track between the
blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104 positioned over the blood vessel 108.
[0066]          Fig. 5H to Fig. 5M illustrate how the funnel or channel portion 206 serves as a
guide for the vascular access needle 100 as disclosed in Fig. lB to access the blood vessel
 108 through the same path each and every time during dialysis till the funnel or channel
portion 206 is completely resorbed. The funnel or channel portion 206 is biodegradable and
may be resorbed by the body with time (e.g. 1 - 6 months). During this time, the funnel or
channel portion 206 may serve as a guide for subsequent repeated insertions.
[0067]          Fig. 5H shows a cross-sectional side view of an implanted helical-screw track
or channel portion 206 and the vascular access device 102 in accordance with an embodiment.
In Fig. 5H, the bioresorbable funnel or channel portion 206 has been successfully implanted
and the flexible access needle 100 is used to access the vessel 108.
[0068]          Fig. 51 illustrates cannulation at an incorrect angle of approach by an untrained
operator but the vascular access device 102 will have the desired push force needed to
penetrate the skin layer 104 in accordance with an embodiment. The funnel or channel
portion 206 is arranged at an angle of about 250 relative to the plane of the skin layer 104
while the vascular access device 102 is arranged at an angle of about 50' relative to the same
plane. There is a mismatch between the angle of the funnel or channel portion 206 and the
vascular access device 102. Nevertheless, despite the mismatch in angles, the flexible access
needle 100 in Fig. 51, exhibits sufficient push force to penetrate the skin 104 due to the rigid
support sheath 114 that surrounds the flexible access needle 100. The cannulation angle need
not be the same as the angle in which the funnel or channel portion 206 is implanted, as long
as the tip portion 112 of the needle 100 of the vascular access device 102 is within the
opening mouth of the bioresorbable funnel or channel portion 206.
[00691          Fig. 5J illustrates a needle 100 of the vascular access device 102 which loses
push force and conforms to the helical-screw track or channel portion 206 in accordance with
                                                 20

        WO 2014/017986                                                          PCT/SG2013/000311
   an embodiment. In Fig. 5J, the flexible access needle 100 of the vascular access device 102
   loses its push force as the needle tip (in other words the tip portion 112) of the needle 100
   advances away from the rigid sheath 114 and conforms safely to the bioresorbable funnel or
   channel portion 206. Despite cannulating at a wrong angle, the bioresorbable funnel or
   channel portion 206 directs the needle 100 back to the desired trajectory to access the vessel
   108 at a consistent puncture site.
   [00701          Fig. 5K illustrates a constriction at a distal end 182 of the helical-screw track
  or channel portion 206 which causes the needle 100 to regain push force needed to penetrate
  an anterior vein wall (AVF) wall 184 in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 5K, as the
  flexible access needle 100 advances to the surface of the blood vessel 108 to be penetrated,
  the flexible needle 100 regains its push force due to the support of the customized narrowed
  end of the bioresorbable funnel or channel portion 206 and hence is able to penetrate through
  the vessel 108.
  100711           Fig. 5L illustrates the needle 100 of the vascular access device 102 which
  loses push force once in the blood vessel or AVF vessel 108, allowing-the needle 100 to
  conform to the shape of the vessel 108, preventing infiltration in accordance with an
  embodiment. In Fig. 5L, after puncturing into the vessel 108, the flexible access needle 100
  then loses its push force once again and conforms safely to the orientation of the vessel 108,
  preventing infiltration on the opposite wall 186.
  [0072]          Fig. 5M shows a 3-dimensional cross-sectional side view of the Buttonhole
  track 188 after the helical-screw track dissolves after 1 to 6 months in accordance with an
  embodiment.
  [00731          After some time, between about 1 to about 6 months, the bioresorbable funnel
  or channel portion 206 as shown in Fig. 5L may have been resorbed, leaving behind a
  resultant scarred track 188 as illustrated in Fig. 5M. Scarring of the track 188 ensues due to
  repeated vascular access needle insertions. The biodegradable funnel or channel portion 206
  as shown in Fig. 5L may also serve as a scaffold for scarring to form.
  [0074]          Fig. 5N shows a cross-sectional side view of the track 188 formed by tissue
  scarring after the helical-screw track 206 as shown in Fig. 5L is resorbed and a vascular
  access needle 100 used for the purpose of dialysis in accordance with an embodiment.
  [00751           In Fig. 5N, the biodegradable funnel (not shown) has been resorbed and what
  remains is the track 188 formed by scarred tissues. The track 188 will then serve as a guide
  for future needle insertions. The flexible access needle 100 can similarly be used with the
- scarred track.-

 [00761         Fig. 50 shows a cross-sectional side view of the flexible needle 100 accessing
 the AVF 184 through the matured buttonhole 188 in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig.
 50, the scarred tissue track 188 serves as a guide for the vascular access needle 100 to access
the vessel 108 through the same path each and every time during dialysis.
 [0077]         Fig.    5P shows a cross-sectional side view of the flexible needle 100
conforming to the contour of the AVF wall 184 without infiltration in accordance with an

the vessel 108 without infiltration of the opposite wall 186.
 [0078]         In this regard, in Figs 5B to 5P, a method to obtain access to a blood vessel
 108 underneath a skin layer 104 may be disclosed. The method includes placing a channel
portion 206 (or guiding portion) between the blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104; and
configuring the channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) to receive and guide a needle 100 to
reach the same location of the blood vessel 108 repeatedly and consistently. The guiding
portion channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) may be resorbed over time. Also in Figs. 5A
to 5P, a method to create vascular access track underneath a skin layer 104 may be provided.
The method may include placing a channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) between the
blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104; configuring the channel portion 206 (or guiding
portion) to receive and guide a needle 100; and forming a resultant scarred track between the
blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104 as the channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) is
resorbed over time. Further, placing the channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) between the
blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104 may include inserting a delivery device 166 pre
loaded with the channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) into the skin layer 104; releasing the
channel portion 206 (or guiding portion) between the blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104;
and retracting the delivery device 166.
 [0079]         Figs 6A to 6L illustrate preferred embodiments of the funnel delivery device
 166 and various methods of optimizing funnel deployment.
 [00801         Fig. 6A and Fig. 6B describe embodiments through which the funnel delivery
device 166 is able to determine the depth of tissue beneath the skin 104 and above the blood
vessel 108 and then hence deploys the funnel or channel portion 206 of the right size. Fig.
6A shows a cross-sectional side view of a delivery needle 172 of the funnel delivery device
 166 with ruler marking on the delivery needle 172 in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig.
6A, the delivery needle 172 with ruler markings is first inserted into the blood vessel 108
through the skin layer 104 and the first subcutaneous layer 106. The visible ruler markings
may be engraved, inked, or made via other means either externally or internally to the

 delivery needle 172. The markings can also be made to become more visible and obvious
 after flashback of the blood is obtained. Alternatively, tissue depth may be measured
 electronically through electronic sensors and reported to the user via a digital screen. The
tissue depth sensors may include impedance sensors (detecting difference in impendence
between air, skin, veins and blood), proximity sensors (detecting length of needle between the
handle and above the skin), or heat sensors (detecting difference in temperature of air, skin
and blood) or a combination thereof.
 [00811          Fig. 6B shows a cross-sectional side view of the funnel delivery device 166
with the funnel or channel portion 206 of a selected size loaded into the funnel delivery
device 166 in accordance with an embodiment. To deploy a customized-sized funnel or
channel portion 206 according to the tissue depth detected, as exemplified by Fig. 613, the
funnel or channel portion 206 of the right length is loaded on the delivery device 166 with the
tip of the funnel or channel portion 206 being held onto by a catch 190 on the delivery device
 166. Such a funnel or channel portion 206 of the right length may be chosen, then loaded
onto the delivery device 166 after the depth of tissue has been determined via a cartridge,
pellet, or other means. It may also be accomplished by having a funnel or channel portion 206
of a much longer length that is pre-loaded into the delivery device 166 and then cut at the
right length via a built-in mechanism within the delivery device 166 after the depth of tissue
or first subcutaneous layer 106 has been determined.
 [0082]          Figs. 6C to 6F describe the mode of funnel deployment for funnels that
possess shape memory properties (meaning ability to remember previous memory shape) and
hence self-expandability. In more details, Fig. 6C shows a cross-sectional side view of the
funnel delivery device 166, with the funnel or channel portion 206 of the selected size loaded
in the funnel delivery device 166, in position for funnel delivery in accordance with an
embodiment, Fig.       6D shows a cross-sectional side view of a sheath 178 of the funnel
delivery device 166 being retracted so as to deploy the funnel or channel portion 206 with
shape memory in accordance with an embodiment, Fig. 6E shows a cross-sectional side view
of the funnel or channel portion 206 being deployed successfully in accordance with an
embodiment. The funnel or channel portion 206 includes a frusto-conical portion 192 and a
tubular portion 194. Essentially the funnel or channel portion 206 includes a porous sidewall
with a plurality of holes.
 [00831          Fig. 6F shows a cross-sectional side view of the funnel delivery device 166

 [0084]         In Figs. 6B to 6F, the packaged funnel or channel portion 206 is housed within
the delivery sheath 178 and deployment is achieved upon retraction of the delivery sheath
 178. The funnel or channel portion 206 is packaged in a configuration where the funnel or
channel portion 206 expands in both the radial and longitudinal direction upon release of the
delivery sheath 178. A successful deployment of the funnel or channel portion 206 may be
defined by: first expanding radially so as to achieve an inner lumen that is large enough to
accommodate a 14-gauge to 18-gauge vascular access needle; second by expanding
longitudinally so as to fit or anchor itself to the vessel 108 in particular by means of push
forces in the downward direction, and thirdly expanding longitudinally creating an upward
push force to create a bump 204 beneath the skin 104 to serve as a visual and tactile marker
to help operators locate the cannulation entry spot for further vascular access.
[0085]          Fig.  6G shows an alternative funnel delivery device 166 for a funnel or
channel portion 206 that does not possess shape memory in accordance with an embodiment.
[00861          This mode of funnel deployment for funnels that do not possess shape memory
property may be achieved by means of an expandable actuating member such as a balloon
196. The delivery device 166 may include a delivery needle 172 to gain vascular access, a
balloon system 198 that includes a balloon 196 and a pressure line 200, a mechanism (for
example a simple sheath) that houses the packaged funnel or channel portion 206 around the
balloon 196 and a pump 202. Some examples of types of pumps include a saline pump with
pressure gauge/dial. Balloon inflates to indicate pressure as user turns the dial. Similar to the
way a stent is deployed. The action of the pump 202 may be similar that of a syringe.
[0087]          Figs. 6H to 6L describe further steps provided to deploy the funnel 206
successfully using the funnel delivery device 166.

 178 that contains the funnel or channel portion 206 is retracted as shown in Fig. 61. The
packed funnel or channel portion 206 and balloon 196 expand upon being released from the
delivery sheath 178.

the balloon 196 is inflated via the pressure line (not shown), hence expanding the packaged

longitudinally creating an upward push force to create a bump 204 beneath the skin 104 to
serve as a visual and tactile marker to help operators locate the cannulation entry spot for
further vascular access. The balloon 196 is then subsequently deflated as shown in Fig. 6K
and then the entire delivery device 166 is retracted as shown in Fig. 6L.
[00911          Fig. 7A and Fig. 7B illustrate a further embodiment of the guiding portion 110
that provides further features such as non-invasive vessel anchoring and anti-infection
properties.
[0092]          Fig. 7A shows a 3-dimensional view of a further embodiment of a guiding
portion 110 that includes a channel portion or funnel 206 including an inlet 208 and an outlet
210, wherein the channel portion 206 is configured to be resorbed over time. The guiding
portion 110 further includes a unidirectional valve 212 positioned adjacent to the outlet 210
of the channel portion 206. The guiding portion 110 also includes an anchor portion 214
positioned adjacent to the outlet 210 of the channel portion 206 and configured to
substantially anchor the channel portion 206 onto the blood vessel 108.
[00931          In more details, the funnel or channel portion 206 includes the unidirectional
valve 212 at a tapered end or the outlet of the funnel 206 and a dog-bone liked saddle or the
anchor portion 214 distal to the tapered end of the funnel 206 in accordance with an
embodiment. Fig. 7A further includes an option of the funnel or channel portion 206 being
configured or injectable with anti-bacteria or anti-microbial gel.
[0094]          The unidirectional valve 212 at the tapered end of the funnel 206 prevents
                                                25

 backflow of the blood into the funnel 206 when the needle (not shown) of the vascular access
 device (not shown) is withdrawn. Further, the unidirectional valve 212 provides pressure
 focused at the needled penetrated location of the vessel 108 when compression from the skin
layer 104 is applied, resulting in a significantly more effective and focused hemostasis.
Applying both stoppage of backflow and focused hemostasis in combination, the funnel or
channel portion 206 may eliminate or greatly reduce the build up on scabs outside the blood
vessel 108 and within the funnel or channel portion 206. The absence of scabs as a nidus for
bacteria, such as staphylococcus, and other microorganisms will significantly reduce the risk
of infection for the patient. The unidirectional valve 212 may be constructed with leaflets in
the shape of a duckbill and made of elastomeric components, which allows the entry of the
needle (not shown) into the blood vessel 108. Upon withdrawal of the needle, the elastomeric
lips will purse together to prevent blood in the blood vessel 108 from entering the funnel 206.
[00951            Fig. 7B shows a 3-dimensional view of the further alternative of a guiding
portion 110 that includes a funnel 206 injected with gel with healing or anti-microbial
properties and a dog-bone-like saddle 214 that functions to limit the lateral movement of a
blood vessel 108 away from the funnel 206 in accordance with an embodiment.
[00961            Injecting the funnel or channel portion 206 with gel, with healing or anti
microbial properties may act as an additional measure against infection. Further, the dog
bone shaped feature 214 may function as a non-invasive saddle to limit the lateral movement
of the blood vessel 108 away from the funnel 206. With a curvature radius of about 2mm to
about 5mm, the saddle 214 may allow the funnel 206 to sit snugly on the blood vessel 108 to
improve the needling accuracy for penetration into the blood vessel 108.
[0097]            Figs. 8A to 8F show a further embodiment that removes the need for
implantation by inducing a scarred tissue track directly, such as through tissue ablation or
tissue removal technologies. To achieve this, a tissue scarring needle or tissue scarring
vascular access needle 220 is coupled with an ablation and/or tissue removal electrode 218 as
shown in Fig. 8A. Such electrodes 218 may be an ablation coil wounded around the tissue
scarring needle 220 that may be inserted together with the tissue scarring needle 220 during
the first insertion procedure. Ablation electrodes 218 may adopt different ablation modalities,
including but not limited to radiofrequency, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU),
microwave, cryothermic systems, laser or other modalities as disclosed in the art. For tissue
removal, electrodes could adopt modalities as histotripsy and energized saline jets. This
system is an alternative embodiment that removes the need for implantation by creating a
buttonhole (BH) track (it is the scarred tissue track that is formed) directly through tissue
                                                26

 ablation.
 [0098]         Fig. 8A also shows a 3-dimensional view of a vascular access device 102 in
addition to the tissue scarring device 216 used for ablation purposes. The vascular access
device 102 is similar to that shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. 5A. The vascular access device 102
may include a needle 100 having a tip portion 112; and a shield 114 arranged around and at
least substantially along a longitudinal axis (not shown) of the needle 100, wherein the shield
 114 is substantially rigid so as to provide strength to the tip portion 112 to penetrate a tissue
layer (not shown) as the tip portion 112 extends out from the shield 114 and the needle 100
gradually loses column strength as the distance between the tip portion 112 and the shield
 114 increases. The vascular access device 102 may additionally include an actuating portion
 116 coupled to a portion of the needle 100. The tissue scarring device 216 may include the
tissue scarring needle 220, with the ablation electrode 218 wound around the tissue scarring
needle 220. The tissue scarring needle 220 may be coupled to a holder 222 and an indicator
224 may be positioned on the holder 222 to indicate if the tissue scarring device 216 is being
activated or not. The length of the tissue scarring needle 220 may be between about 4mm to
about 20mm while the length of the ablation electrode 218 may be between about 3mm to
about 12mm. The diameter of the tissue scarring needle 220 may be in the range of 1.270mm
(18G) to 2.108mm (14G). In Fig. 8A, both the vascular access needle 100 and the tissue
scarring device 220 are shown. The tissue scarring needle 220 may include a material
selected from a group consisting of metals and polymers. The holder 222 may be of the
particular shape as shown in Fig. 8A but may also be of any other suitable shapes which
allow ease of use and for acceptable grip by the patient.
[0099]          In Figs. 8B to 8F, a method to obtain access to a blood vessel 108 underneath
a skin layer 104 may be disclosed. The method may include inserting the tissue scarring
device 216 through the skin layer 104 to reach the blood vessel 108; and forming a resultant
scarred track between the blood vessel 108 and the skin layer 104 as the tissue scarring
device 216 is retracted. The tissue scarring device 216 may include an ablation coil 218 or a
combination of a tissue scarring needle 220 and the ablation coil 218.
[00100]         Fig. 8B shows a cross-sectional side view of the tissue scarring device 216
including the tissue scarring needle 220 coupled with the ablation coil 218 being inserted into
a vessel 108 (when in use) in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 8B, the tissue scarring
needle 220 coupled with the ablation coil 218 is inserted through the skin layer 104, the
subcutaneous tissue layer 106 to the vessel 108 to gain vascular access. The tissue scarring
needle 220 may be positioned at any suitable angle depending on the user. However, it would

  be preferred to positioned the tissue scarring needle 220 at an angle relative to the plane of
  the skin layer 104 which allows ease of penetration of the tissue scarring needle 220, for
  example between about 250 to 650.
  [00101]         Fig. 8C shows a cross-sectional side view of the ablation coil 218 being
  activated and thus emitting energy suitable for local ablation of tissue in accordance with an
  embodiment. In Fig. 8C, after complete insertion of the tissue scarring needle 220, the
  ablation coil 218 is activated through the means of a switch (not shown) on the coupled hand
 held tissue scarring device 216. The ablation coil 218 may be activated for a sufficient
 amount of time to allow the local ablation of the tissue 106. The tissue scarring device 216
 may be preferably held at a fixed position to prevent excessive ablation of the tissue 106 and
 creating an opening which is sized so as to accommodate the subsequent insertion of the
 vascular access needle.
  [00102]         Fig. 8D shows a side cross-sectional view of local ablation of tissue 106 as a
 result of the emission of the ablation coil 218 in accordance with an embodiment. In Fig. 8D,
 when the ablation coil 218 is activated, the ablation coil 218 emits energy suitable for local
 ablation of the subcutaneous tissue layer 106. Tissues surrounding the tissue scarring needle
 220 that are above the blood vessel are then scarred and form a track that serves as a guide
 for future needle insertions.
  [00103]         Fig. 8E shows a cross-sectional side view of the ablation coil 218 being
 deactivated and retracted and a track 188 formed due to local ablation of tissue in accordance
 with an embodiment. In Fig. 8E, after the procedure is complete, the tissue scarring needle
 220 coupled with the ablation coil 218 is retracted, leaving behind a scarred tissue track 188
 in the subcutaneous tissue layer 106.
  [00104]         Fig. 8F shows a cross-sectional side view of a needle 100 of a vascular access
 device 102 without column strength being inserted into the vessel 108 through the track 188
 formed by scarred tissue for the purpose of dialysis in accordance with an embodiment.
  [00105]         In Fig. 8F, the scarred tissue track 188 serves as a guide for the vascular
 access needle 100 to access the blood vessel 108 through the same path each and every time
 during dialysis.
  [00106]         In a further embodiment, the modalities of ablation are controlled by the
 power of a generator, and may be activated by a connected foot pedal. In track formation,
 positioning of the tissue scarring needle 220 is necessary before ablation. To ensure that the
 tissue scarring needle 220 as shown earlier in Figs. 8A to 8E is positioned properly before
--performing ablation;-various -safety-features- may-be incorporated- to -guide or -confirm-to the

user the position.
 [00107]        Upon first insertion of the tissue scarring needle 220, flashback is to be
inspected to ensure entry into the vein or blood vessel 108. Flashback may be inspected using
an indication chamber in which the user will observe for possible colour change or height
indications of flashback, or the tissue scarring device 216 may incorporate a sensor system
that determines flashback and provide the user with feedback visually via a display screen or
audibly via an audio output. Such a sensor system may make use of electronics, mechanical
set-ups, biomolecules, biomarkers, or a combination thereof.
[00108]         Fig. 8G to Fig. 8L and Fig. 8M to Fig. 8P illustrate embodiments of the tissue
scarring device or ablation device 216 customized with safety features specifically for
creation of the buttonhole track without causing collateral damage to the target blood vessel.
[001091         Fig. 8G shows a 3-dimensional perspective view of a tissue scarring device
216 used for ablation purposes with safety features through a serial ballooning system 226 in
accordance with an embodiment.
[00110]         The tissue scarring device 216 includes a tissue scarring needle 220, and
electrodes 228 wounded around the tissue scarring needle 220. Further, the serial ballooning
system 226 is positioned nearer the tip portion or distal section 230 of the tissue scarring
needle 220. The ballooning system 226 includes balloons 242, 244, 246 of varying diameters,
with the balloon 242 with the smallest outer diameter positioned nearer to the tip portion 230
of the tissue scarring needle 220 and the balloon 246 with the larger outer diameter
positioned furthest from the tip portion 230 of the tissue scarring needle 220. Three balloons
242, 244, 246 may be shown in Fig. 8G, but the number of balloons may vary depending on
user and design requirements.
[00111]         One end of the tissue scarring needle 220 may be adapted for penetrating into
the skin layer 104 and the opposite end may be coupled to a hand-held portion or holder 222.
A chamber 232 may be positioned on the hand-held portion 222 to observe the flashback.
Further, a syringe 234 for balloon inflation may be coupled to the hand-held portion 222 and
the syringe 234 may be activated by a trigger 236.
[001121         Further, the hand-held portion 222 may be connected to a generator 238 and a
foot operated switch 240 may be used to activate the generator 238. However, there may be
any other suitable means for activating the generator 238.
[00113]         Fig. 8H to Fig. 8L illustrates use of the serial ballooning system 226 including
a trigger 236 and syringe 234 for balloon inflation. In more details, Fig. 9H shows a cross
sectional view of a tissue scarring needle 220 of the tissue scarring device 216 during a first

accordance with an embodiment, Fig. 8J shows a cross-sectional view of a further inflation
of the second distal balloon 244 from the needle tip 230 of the tissue scarring device 216, the
inflation of the second distal balloon 244 is to increase the distance of the electrodes 228
from the vein in accordance with an embodiment, Fig. 8K shows a cross-sectional view of a
yet further inflation of the largest balloon or third balloon 246 and upon successful inflation,
the foot pedal switch 240 as shown in Fig. 8A is then enabled in accordance with an
embodiment, Fig. 8L shows a cross-sectional view of successful activation of the ablation
coil or electrodes 228 to emit energy suitable for ablation, hence scarring and forming a
resultant scarred tissue track 188 in a subcutaneous layer 106 in accordance with an
embodiment;
[00114]         In this regard, upon inspection of flashback, the balloons 242, 244, 246 of
increasing diameters, consecutively placed along the needle tip 230, are inflated in the
sequence from the distal end of the needle 220 to the proximal ablation electrodes 228. This
may be a means to create a safe distance from the vessel wall. Upon successful ballooning,
ablation electrodes 228 may be activated upon the stepping of the foot pedal switch 240
which may be coupled- to the generator 238.
[00115]         Figs. 8M to 8P illustrate the second embodiment where the system may use
impedance detectors 196 between the electrodes 228. This alternative embodiment utilizes an
impedance sensor in a closed-loop system coupled with the ablation electrodes 228.
[001161         Fig. 8M shows a cross-sectional view of a tissue scarring device 216 for
ablation purposes with safety features through an impedance detection method in accordance
with an embodiment. In Fig. 8M, different segments A, B and C between the electrodes 228
may represent the impedance detectors 196. Segment A is positioned nearest to the tip
portion of the tissue scarring needle 220, followed by segment B and then segment C being
furthest away from the tip portion 230 of the tissue scarring needle 220. Impedance detection
at the coil of electrodes 228 proximal to the tip portion 230 of the tissue scarring needle 220
may be executed. Depending on extent of entry of the tissue scarring needle 220 into the
vessel (not shown), each electrode band (segment A, B or C) will be surrounded by either
tissue or blood, and will hence register different voltage/current output since resistivity of
tissue and blood is different. These values are calculated by a back-end architecture that
includes a generator 238 and a processor (not shown).

    [00117]          Based on detection of differential resistivity of blood (p = 65-150 Q cm) and
    tissue samples (p   = 200-5,000 Q cm), blood impedance detectors 196 sensing the location of
    electrodes outside the bloodstream will actuate the activation of a particular segment of
    electrodes 228. The blood impedance detectors 196 are housed in electrode bands (segment A,
    B or C) along the shaft of the tissue scarring needle 220 and can detect difference in
    resistivity (depending on contact with either tissue or blood) via voltage/current outputs.
    [00118]         For segments detected to be within the bloodstream, the electrodes 228 in a
   defined vicinity of that segment cannot be activated despite the activation of the generator
   238 by a foot operated switch 240.

   tissue scarring device 216 during a first insertion, indicating flashback upon blood vessel
   entry in accordance with an embodiment, Fig. 80 shows a cross-sectional view of the tissue
   scarring needle 220 of a tissue scarring device 216 where only segment A of the ablation
   electrodes 228 has entered the blood vessel 108, but not segments B or C in accordance with
   an embodiment, Fig. 8P shows a cross-sectional view of successful activation of the ablation
   coil 228 in segments B and C only to emit energy suitable for ablation, hence scarring and
   forming a scarred tissue track 188 in the subcutaneous layer 106 in accordance with an
   embodiment.
   [00120]          Fig.   9 shows a side view of a backend vascular access needle dispenser
   system 148 that ensures patient performs hand hygiene, follow by skin disinfection before
   proceeding with needling using a vascular access needle 100 as shown in Fig. 1B and a cuff
   system 132 as shown in Fig. 3A in accordance with an embodiment.
   [00121]          Fig. 9 illustrates how the vascular access needle dispenser system 148 works
   and how the needle dispenser 158 mandates users to comply with hand wash and surface
   disinfection protocols before the vascular access needle 100 can be dispensed. To begin, in
   step 1, the patient must wash his/her hands with the sanitizer dispensed from the hand wash
   compartment 150, before an alcohol swap 154 can be dispensed from the alcohol swap
   dispenser 152 in step 2. The hand wash compartment 150 may have a sensor 156 for sensing
   the presence of a body, e.g. hand, so that sanitizer may be dispensed. The alcohol swap 154
   including a gauze 160 with alcohol wrapped within is expected to be used to sanitize the skin
   where the vascular access needle 100 will puncture. Only by tapping the sensor (not shown)
   on the alcohol swap wrapper 154 onto the vascular access needle dispenser 158, can the
   vascular access dispenser 158 dispense the vascular access needle 100 in step 3. By

this patient-operated procedure is performed with little or no chance of infection due to
noncompliance of hygiene protocol.
[00122]         The applications of the disclosed invention discussed above are not limited to
certain treatments or regions of the body, but may include any number of other treatments and
areas of the body. Modification of the above-described methods and devices for carrying out
the invention, and variations of aspects of the invention that are obvious to those of skill in the
arts are intended to be within the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, various combinations of
aspects between examples are also contemplated and are considered to be within the scope of
this disclosure as well.
