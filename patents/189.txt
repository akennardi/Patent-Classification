intracellular phosphorylated tyrosine domains (YDxV-p) recruit Nck through its interaction with the
SH2 domain. Nck in turn recruits cytoskeleton regulators through its SH3 domains to promote actin
polymerization. Slit2 binds Robo2 to increase Robo2 intracellular domain interaction with SH3
domains of Nck, which would prevent binding of Nck to cytoskeletal regulators and result in an
inhibition of nephrin-induced actin polymerization. Balanced actin polymerization is maintained during
podocte development for a normal foot process structure. In the absence of Slit2-Robo2 signaling (e.g.,
when Robo2 is knocked out), the inhibitory effects of Robo2 on nephrin induced polymerization is lost.
The SH3 domains of Nck are able to interact with downstream cytoskeletal regulators to increase actin
polymerization, which may explain the altered podocyte foot process structure in Robo2 mutant mice.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0062]         Robo2 has been previously shown to be the cell surface receptor for the repulsive guidance
cue Slit and to be involved in axon guidance and neuronal migration in the nervous system. Nephrin is a
podocyte slit-diaphragm protein that functions in the kidney glomerular filtration barrier. We
demonstrate herein that Robo2 is expressed at the basal surface of podocytes, such as mouse podocytes,
and co-localizes with nephrin. Biochemical studies indicate that Robo2 forms a complex with nephrin
in the kidney through adaptor protein Nck. In contrast to the role of nephrin that promotes actin
polymerization, we show herein that Slit2-Robo2 signaling inhibits nephrin-induced actin
polymerization. For example, the amount of F-actin associated with nephrin is increased in Robo2
knockout mice that develop an altered podocyte foot process structure and microalbuminuria. Genetic
interaction studies further reveal that loss of Robo2 alleviates the abnormal podocyte phenotype in
nephrin null mice. The results provided herein show that Robo2 signaling acts as a negative regulator on
nephrin to influence podocyte foot process architecture.
[0063]        In addition, it has been shown that a patient having vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has a
chromosome translocation that disrupts the ROBO2 gene and produces dominant negative ROBO2
fusion proteins that abrogate the SLIT2-ROBO2 signaling pathway. Normally, VUR is a disease
characterized by the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and kidney and VUR
patients can present with reflux nephropathy, a condition that manifests with severe proteinuria. It has
been shown that dominant negative ROB 02 fusion proteins produced by a VUR patient blocks the
SLIT2-ROBO2 signaling pathway and protects the patient from reflux nephropathy and proteinuria,
thus confirming and further supporting the inventors results in animal models of the therapeutic value of
targeting the SLIT2-ROBO2 signaling pathway for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.

 [0064]        In the normal kidney, the trilaminar glomerular capillary wall, composed of fenestrated
endothelial cells, basement membrane and podocytes, restricts the permeability to plasma proteins.
Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that extend primary and secondary processes to cover the
outer surface of the glomerular basement membrane. The actin-rich interdigitating secondary processes,
or foot processes, from neighboring podocytes create filtration slits bridged by a semi-porous
slit-diaphragm that forms the final barrier to protein permeation. Whereas genetic mutations of
podocyte slit-diaphragm proteins such as nephrin and others are associated with hereditary forms of
proteinuric kidney disease (Tryggvason et al., 2006), it has become evident that the proteins that make
up and associate with the slit-diaphragm are more than a simple structural barrier. These proteins form a
balanced signaling network that can influence podocyte foot process structure and function through
interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton (Faul et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2006).
 [0065]        Roundabout (Robo) family proteins, Robol, Robo2, Robo3 and Robo4 are cell surface
receptors for the secreted ligand Slit (Dickson and Gilestro, 2006). Slit 1, Slit2, and Slit3 were originally
found as repulsive guidance cues for axon pathfinding and migrating neurons during nervous system
development (Guan and Rao, 2003). The transmembrane protein Robo contains five Ig motifs and three
fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats in its extracellular domain (Dickson and Gilestro, 2006). While both
immunoglobulin (Ig) motifs 1 and 2 interact with Slit, the first Ig I motif of Robo is the primary binding
site for Slit (Dickson and Gilestro, 2006). The intracellular domain of Robo has four cytoplasmic
conserved (CC) sequences named CCO, CC1, CC2, and CC3 (Bashaw et al., 2000; Kidd et al., 1998;
Morlot et al., 2007; Zallen et al., 1998). CCO and CC1 contain tyrosine, while CC2 and CC3 are
proline-rich stretches. The repulsive activity of Slit-Robo signaling inhibits actin polymerization (Guan
and Rao, 2003) or induces F-actin depolymerization (Piper et al., 2006).
 [0066]        Slit-Robo signaling also plays crucial roles during early kidney induction and ureteric bud
outgrowth. Mouse mutants that lack Slit2 or Robo2 develop supernumerary ureteric buds, which lead to
a broad-spectrum of urinary tract phenotype including duplex kidneys, abnormal ureterovesical
junctions and hydronephrosis (Grieshammer et al., 2004; Lu et al. 2007). Disruption of ROBO2 in
humans causes congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tracts (CAKUT), and point mutations
of ROBO2 have been identified in patients with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (Lu et al., 2007). Our
recent study demonstrates that Robo2 is crucial for the formation of a normal ureteral orifice and for the
maintenance of an effective anti-reflux mechanism (Wang et al., 2011).
 [0067]        Herein we demonstrate that Robo2 is a novel podocyte protein expressed at the basal
surface of glomerular podocytes in the kidney and is co-localized with nephrin and podocin. Robo2
interacts directly with adaptor protein Nck SH3 domains and forms a complex with nephrin. Whereas
Robo2 knockout mice develop altered podocyte foot processes, the loss of Robo2 alleviates the foot
process structural abnormalities that are seen in nephrin null mice. These results described herein
indicate that Robo2 signaling acts as a negative regulator on nephrin signaling to influence podocyte
foot process architecture. In addition, as demonstrated herein, it has been discovered that the dominant

agent," and "ROBO2 antagonist agent" refer to a molecule or agent that significantly blocks, inhibits,
reduces, or interferes with ROBO2 (mammalian, such as human, ROBO2) biological activity in vitro, in

described herein, a ROB 02 inhibitor (e.g., an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) binds
(physically interacts with) ROBO2, targets downstream ROBO2 signaling, and/or inhibits (reduces)
ROB 02 synthesis, production or release. In some embodiments of these aspects and all such aspects

specifically reduces or eliminates expression (i.e., transcription or translation) of one or more ROB02
isoforms.
[0076]        As used herein, a ROB02 inhibitor or antagonist has the ability to reduce the activity
and/or expression of ROBO2 in a cell (e.g., podocytes) by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least
20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at
least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95 %,
at least 98%, at least 99%, or more, relative to the activity or expression level in the absence of the
ROB02 inhibitor.
[0077]        Accordingly, in some embodiments of the compositions and methods described herein, the
ROBO2 inhibitor inhibits ROB02 mediated signal transduction. In some embodiments of the

adaptor protein Nck and/or complex formation with nephrin, SLIT2-ROBO-2 mediated inhibition of
nephrin-mediated actin polymerization, and/or elicitation of a cellular response to ROBO2.
[0078]        In some embodiments of the compositions and methods described herein, the binding sites
of the ROBO2 inhibitors, such as an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, are directed against
a ROBO2 ligand interaction site, such as a SLIT2 ligand interaction site. In some embodiments of the
compositions and methods described herein, the binding sites of the ROB 02 inhibitor, such as an
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, are directed against a ROB02 adaptor interaction site
such as an Nck interaction site or the NCK intracellular binding domain comprising the four
intracellular proline rich motifs of ROBO2. In some embodiments of the compositions and methods
described herein, the binding sites of the ROB02 inhibitors are directed against a site on a target in the
proximity of the ligand interaction site, in order to provide steric hindrance for the interaction of the
receptor (e.g., ROBO2) with its ligand (e.g., SLIT2). By binding to a ROBO2 ligand interaction site, a
ROBO2 inhibitor described herein can reduce or inhibit the activity or expression of ROBO2, and
downstream ROB02 signaling consequences (e.g., ROB02 interaction with the adaptor protein Nck
and/or complex formation with nephrin, SLIT2-ROBO-2 mediated inhibition of nephrin-mediated actin
polymerization, and/or elicitation of a cellular response to ROBO2). For example, in some
embodiments of the compositions and methods described herein, the binding sites of the ROB 02
inhibitors block or target at least the IgI, and preferably both the IgI and Ig2 sites, on ROBO2, i.e.,
ROBO2(46-145) and ROBO2(151-237) respectively of SEQ ID NO: 1, and ROBO2(30-129) and
ROBO2(135-221) respectively of SEQ ID NO: 3, for example. In some embodiments of the
compositions and methods described herein, the binding sites of the ROB 02 inhibitors block or target
the ROBO2 intracellular domain comprising the Nck intracellular binding domain, i.e.,

described herein, the binding sites of the ROB02 inhibitors block or target the ROB02 Nck
intracellular binding domain comprising the four intracellular proline rich motifs of ROBO2. This can

have a similar three dimensional structure as part of that of ROB02 and which bind to SLIT2 and/or to
Nck under physiological conditions in vitro or in vivo, wherein the binding at least partially inhibits a
ROBO2 biological activity, such as SLIT2-ROBO2 mediated inhibition of nephrin-mediated actin
polymerization, and/or elicitation of a cellular response to ROBO2. Suitable ROBO2 structural analogs
can be designed and synthesized through molecular modeling of ROBO2-SLIT2 binding, for example.
The ROB02 structural analogs can be monomers, dimers, or higher order multimers in any desired
combination of the same or different structures to obtain improved affinities and biological effects.
[0093]        In some embodiments of the compositions and methods described herein, a ROBO2
inhibitor or antagonist comprises at least one soluble ROB02 receptor or fusion polypeptide thereof,
such as, for example, a ROBO2 inhibitory polypeptide. In some such embodiments, the ROBO2
inhibitory polypeptide is a dominant negative ROBO2 fusion protein. In some embodiments of the
compositions and methods described herein, the ROBO2 inhibitory polypeptide comprises the ROBO2
extracellular domain, for example, the IgISLIT binding domain of ROB 02 or both the IgI and Ig2
SLIT binding domains of ROBO2, with no intracellular ROBO2 domains.
[0094]        ROB 02 inhibitors or antagonists for use in the compositions and methods described herein
can be identified or characterized using methods known in the art, such as protein-protein binding
assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays, and cell-based assays, which are well known in
the art, including, but not limited to, those described herein in the Examples.
[0095]        For example, to identify a molecule that inhibits interaction between ROBO2 and its ligand,
e.g., SLIT2, binding assays can be used. For example, ROB02 or SLIT is immobilized on a microtiter
plate by covalent or non-covalent attachment. The assay is performed by adding the non-immobilized
component (ligand or receptor), which can be labeled by a detectable label, to the immobilized
component, in the presence or absence of a test agent. When the reaction is complete, the non-reacted
components are removed and binding complexes are detected. If formation of binding complexes is
inhibited by the presence of the test agent, the test agent can be deemed a candidate antagonist that
inhibits binding between ROBO2 and SLIT2, for example. Cell-based or membrane-based assays can
also be used to identify ROBO2 inhibitors. In other embodiments, by detecting and/or measuring levels
of ROBO2 gene expression, ROBO2 inhibitor molecules that inhibit ROBO2 gene expression can be
tested. ROBO2 gene expression can be detected and/or measured by a variety of methods, such as real
time RT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ("ELISA"), Northern blotting, or flow cytometry,
and as known to one of ordinary skill in the art.
[0096]        Such identified ROB02 inhibitors can further be tested using in vivo animal models of
chronic kidney disease, such as glomerular and interstitial injury models (e.g., animal models of lupus
nephritis, including mice of the NZB, (NZB x NZW) Fl hybrid (termed NZB/W), and congenic
derivatives thereof, MRL/lpr and BXSB strains), animal models of aging (e.g., aged Sprague Dawley
rats and aged C57BL/6 mice); spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR); Buffalo/mna rats, which are a
model of human idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; Munich Wistar Fr6mter (MWF) rats, which are a

genetic model related to a congenital deficit in nephron number being predisposed to the development
of hypertension and salt sensitivity in adulthood; primary podocyte-specific genetic FSGS models;
HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) transgenic mouse models; animal models of Alport syndrome,
which comprise mutations of the       3, a4, or a5 chains of type IV collagen (COL4A3, COL4A4, and
COL4A5); immune-induced models, such as the Thy-I nephritis model, which is an experimental rat
model of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), anti-glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) models; and non-immune induced models.
[0097]        As used herein, in regard to a ROB02 inhibitor, "selectively binds" or "specifically binds"
or "specific for" refers to the ability of a ROBO2 inhibitor as described herein, such as, for example, a
ROBO2 antagonist antibody or ROBO2 antigen-binding fragment thereof, to bind to a target, i.e.,
ROBO2, with a KD      10- 5 M (10000 nM) or less, e.g., 10-6 M or less, 10-7 M or less, 10-8 M or less, 10- 9 M
or less, 10-O M or less, 10-" M or less, or 10-2 M or less. For example, if a ROBO2 inhibitor/antagonist
described herein binds to ROBO2 with a       KD  Of 10-5 M or lower, but not to a related molecule, such as,
for example, other ROBO family members, then the agent is said to specifically bind ROBO2. Specific
binding can be influenced by, for example, the affinity and avidity of, for example, the ROBO2
inhibitor/antagonist antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof and the concentration of polypeptide
agent. The person of ordinary skill in the art can determine appropriate conditions under which the
polypeptide agents described herein selectively bind the targets using any suitable methods, such as
titration of a polypeptide agent in a suitable cell binding assay.
[0098]        In regard to the methods of treating chronic kidney disease by inhibiting ROBO2 activity,
the term "chronic kidney disease" or CKD refers to renal diseases that slowly and progressively worsen
over time due to the progressive loss of nephrons and consequent loss of renal function. In the early
stages, there may be no symptoms. The loss of function usually takes months or years to occur. It may
be so slow that symptoms do not appear until kidney function is less than one-tenth of normal. The final
stage of chronic kidney disease is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). At this stage, the kidneys are
no longer able to remove enough wastes and excess fluids from the body. The patient needs dialysis or
a kidney transplant. Diabetes, which leads to diabetic nephropathy, and high blood pressure are the two
most common causes of chronic kidney disease and account for most cases. Other diseases and
conditions that can damage the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease, include: autoimmune
disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma); birth defects of the kidneys (such as
polycystic kidney disease); certain toxic chemicals; glomerulonephritis; injury or trauma; kidney stones
and infection; problems with the arteries leading to or inside the kidneys; some pain medications and
other drugs (such as cancer drugs); reflux nephropathy (in which the kidneys are damaged by the
backward flow of urine into the kidneys); etc. As used herein, "proteinuria" refers to the presence of an
excess of serum proteins in the urine. Proteinuria can, in some embodiments, be indicative of kidney
disease, but, by itself, is not conclusive.

[0099]        Accordingly, in some embodiments of these aspects and all such aspects described herein,
the subject having or at risk for a chronic kidney disease has diabetic nephropathy.
[00100]       By "reduce" or "inhibit" in terms of the chronic kidney disease and proteinuria treatment
methods described herein is meant the ability to cause an overall decrease preferably of 20% or greater,
30% or greater, 40% or greater, 45% or greater, more preferably of 50% or greater, of 55% or greater, of
60 % or greater, of 65% or greater, of 70% or greater, and most preferably of 75% or greater, 80% or
greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, or 95% or greater, for a given parameter or symptom of a
chronic kidney disease. Reduce or inhibit can refer to, for example, symptoms of the disorder being
treated, for example, high blood pressure, protein in the urine, etc.
[00101]       High blood pressure is almost always present during all stages of chronic kidney disease. A
nervous system exam may show signs of nerve damage. The health care provider may hear abnormal
heart or lung sounds when listening with a stethoscope. The early symptoms of chronic kidney disease
are also symptoms of other illnesses. These symptoms can be the only signs of kidney disease until the
condition is more advanced. Symptoms of chronic kidney disease can include: appetite loss; general ill
feeling and fatigue; headaches; itching (pruritus) and dry skin; nausea; weight loss without trying to
lose weight; etc. Other symptoms that can develop, especially when kidney function has gotten worse,
include: abnormally dark or light skin; bone pain; brain and nervous system symptoms; drowsiness and
confusion; problems concentrating or thinking; numbness in the hands, feet, or other areas; muscle
twitching or cramps; breath odor; easy bruising, bleeding, or blood in the stool; excessive thirst;
frequent hiccups; low level of sexual interest and impotence; stopping of menstrual periods
(amenorrhea); shortness of breath; sleep problems, such as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and
obstructive sleep apnea; swelling of the feet and hands (edema); vomiting, typically in the morning.
[00102]       Accordingly, in some embodiments of the methods described herein, an effective amount
of a composition comprising a ROBO2 inhibitor described herein is administered to a subject in order to
alleviate a symptom of chronic kidney disease. As used herein, "alleviating a symptom chronic kidney
disease" is ameliorating any condition or symptom associated with the chronic kidney disease.
Alternatively, alleviating a symptom of a chronic kidney disease can involve reducing one or more
symptoms of the chronic kidney disease in the subject relative to an untreated control suffering from
chronic kidney disease or relative to the subject prior to the treatment. As compared with an equivalent
untreated control, or the subject prior to the treatment with the ROBO2 inhibitor, such reduction or
degree of prevention is at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at
least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%,
at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or more, as measured by any standard
technique. Desirably, the chronic kidney disease is significantly reduced or undetectable, as detected by
any standard method known in the art, in which case the chronic kidney disease is considered to have
been treated. A patient who is being treated for a chronic kidney disease is one who a medical
practitioner has diagnosed as having such a condition. Diagnosis can be by any suitable means known to
                                                     - 24 -

one of ordinary skill in the art. Diagnosis and monitoring can involve, for example, detecting the level
of specific proteins or molecules in a urine, blood, or serum sample, such as, for example, albumin,
calcium, cholesterol, complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium,
sodium, or any combination thereof; assays to detect, for example, creatinine clearance; creatinine
levels; BUN (blood urea nitrogen); through the use of specific techniques or procedures, such as an
abdominal CT scan, abdominal MRI, abdominal ultrasound, kidney biopsy, kidney scan, kidney
ultrasound; via detection of changes in results of assays or tests for erythropoietin, PTH; bone density
test, or Vitamin D; or any combination of such detection methods and assays.
[00103]       The terms "subject" and "individual" as used in regard to any of the methods described
herein are used interchangeably herein, and refer to an animal, for example a human, recipient of the
ROBO2 inhibitors described herein. For treatment of disease states which are specific for a specific
animal such as a human subject, the term "subject" refers to that specific animal. The terms "non-human
animals" and "non-human mammals" are used interchangeably herein, and include mammals such as
rats, mice, rabbits, sheep, cats, dogs, cows, pigs, and non-human primates. The term "subject" also
encompasses any vertebrate including but not limited to mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fish.
However, advantageously, the subject is a mammal such as a human, or other mammals such as a
domesticated mammal, e.g. dog, cat, horse, and the like.
[00104]       In some embodiments of these methods and all such methods described herein, the method
further comprises administering to the subject an additional therapeutic agent, in addition to the
ROBO2 inhibitor. Such an additional therapeutic agent can be co-administered with the ROBO2
inhibitor. As used herein, the phrase "co-administering" or to "co-administer" means the administration
of a ROBO2 inhibitor described herein and another compound, e.g., a therapeutic agent, separately,
simultaneously, and/or sequentially over a period of time as determined by a qualified care giver.
[00105]       In some such embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or a mineralocorticoid receptor
(MR) antagonist.
[00106]       ACE inhibitors for use with the ROBO2 inhibitors described herein include, but are not
limited to, benazepril (marketed in the U.S. as LOTENSIN Tm ), captopril (marketed in the U.S. as

[00108]       As used herein, in regard to any of the compositions and methods comprising ROBO-2
inhibitors or combination treatments thereof described herein, the terms "treat," "treatment," "treating,"
or "amelioration" refer to therapeutic treatments, wherein the object is to reverse, alleviate, ameliorate,
inhibit, slow down or stop the progression or severity of a condition associated with, a disease or
disorder. The term "treating" includes reducing or alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of
a condition, disease or disorder associated with a chronic kidney disease, such as, but not limited to,
diabetic nephropathy. Treatment is generally "effective" if one or more symptoms or clinical markers
are reduced. Alternatively, treatment is "effective" if the progression of a disease is reduced or halted.
That is, "treatment" includes not just the improvement of symptoms or markers, but also a cessation of
at least slowing of progress or worsening of symptoms that would be expected in absence of treatment.
Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of one or more
symptom(s), diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or
slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether
partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. The term "treatment" of a disease also includes
providing relief from the symptoms or side-effects of the disease (including palliative treatment).
[00109]       The term "effective amount" as used herein refers to the amount of a ROBO-2 inhibitor
described herein, needed to alleviate at least one or more symptom of the disease or disorder being
treated, and relates to a sufficient amount of pharmacological composition to provide the desired effect.
The term "therapeutically effective amount" therefore refers to an amount of the ROBO-2 inhibitor
described herein, using the methods as disclosed herein, that is sufficient to provide a particular effect
                                                    - 26 -

when administered to a typical subject. An effective amount as used herein would also include an
amount sufficient to delay the development of a symptom of the disease, alter the course of a symptom
disease (for example but not limited to, slow the progression of a symptom of the disease), or reverse a
symptom of the disease. Thus, it is not possible to specify the exact "effective amount". However, for
any given case, an appropriate "effective amount" can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art
using only routine experimentation.
[00110]       Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the
dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the
population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of
administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and
can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50.       Compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic
indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays.
Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range
that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the ROB 0-2 inhibitor described herein, which achieves
a half-maximal inhibition of measured function or activity) as determined in cell culture, or in an
appropriate animal model. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid
chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The
dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the
treatment. Depending on the type and severity of the chronic kidney disease, about 1 gg/kg to 100
mg/kg (e.g., 0.1-20 mg/kg) of a ROBO2 inhibitor described herein is an initial candidate dosage range
for administration to the subject, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by
continuous infusion.
Modes of Administration
[00111]       The ROB 02 inhibitors or combination treatments thereof described herein can be
administered to a subject in need thereof by any appropriate route which results in an effective treatment
in the subject. As used herein, the terms "administering," and "introducing" are used interchangeably
and refer to the placement of a ROBO-2 inhibitor into a subject by a method or route which results in at
least partial localization of such agents at a desired site, such that a desired effect(s) is produced.
[00112]       In some embodiments, the ROBO2 inhibitor is administered to a subject having a chronic
kidney disease by any mode of administration that delivers the agent systemically or to a desired surface
or target, and can include, but is not limited to, injection, infusion, instillation, and inhalation
administration. To the extent that polypeptide agents can be protected from inactivation in the gut, oral
administration forms are also contemplated. "Injection" includes, without limitation, intravenous,
intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac,
intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, sub capsular,
subarachnoid, intraspinal, intracerebro spinal, and intrasternal injection and infusion. In some

embodiments, the ROBO-2 inhibitors for use in the methods described herein are administered by
intravenous infusion or injection.
[00113]       The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein,
refer to modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection. The
phrases "systemic administration," "administered systemically", "peripheral administration" and
"administered peripherally" as used herein refer to the administration of the ROBO-2 inhibitor, other
than directly into a target site, tissue, or organ, such as a tumor site, such that it enters the subject's
circulatory system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes.
[00114]       For the clinical use of the methods described herein, administration of the ROB 0-2
inhibitors described herein, can include formulation into pharmaceutical compositions or
pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration, e.g., intravenous; mucosal, e.g., intranasal;
ocular, or other mode of administration. In some embodiments, the ROB 0-2 inhibitors described herein
can be administered along with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier compound, material, or
composition which results in an effective treatment in the subject. Thus, a pharmaceutical formulation
for use in the methods described herein can contain a ROBO-2 inhibitor, as described herein, in
combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients.
[00115]       The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compounds, materials,
compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for
use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation,
allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable
material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent, media,
encapsulating material, manufacturing aid (e.g., lubricant, talc magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, or
steric acid), or solvent encapsulating material, involved in maintaining the stability, solubility, or
activity of, a ROBO-2 inhibitor. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with
the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials
which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose
and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose and
cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) excipients, such as cocoa butter and
suppository waxes; (8) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn
oil and soybean oil; (9) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (10) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol,
mannitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG); (11) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (12) agar;
(13) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (14) alginic acid; (15)

Release agents, coating agents, preservatives, and antioxidants can also be present in the formulation.
The terms such as "excipient", "carrier", "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or the like are used
interchangeably herein.
[00116]      The ROBO-2 inhibitors described herein can be specially formulated for administration of
the compound to a subject in solid, liquid or gel form, including those adapted for the following: (1)
parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural
injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; (2) topical
application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray applied to the skin;
(3) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; (4) ocularly; (5)
transdermally; (6) transmucosally; or (79) nasally. Additionally, a ROBO-2 inhibitor can be implanted
into a patient or injected using a drug delivery system. See, for example, Urquhart, et al., Ann. Rev.
Pharmacol. Toxicol. 24: 199-236 (1984); Lewis, ed. "Controlled Release of Pesticides and
Pharmaceuticals" (Plenum Press, New York, 1981); U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919; and U.S. Pat. No. 35
3,270,960.
[00117]      Further embodiments of the formulations and modes of administration of the compositions
comprising the ROB 0-2 inhibitors described herein, that can be used in the methods described herein
are described below.
[00118]      Parenteral Dosage Forms. Parenteral dosage forms of the ROBO-2 inhibitors can also be
administered to a subject with a chronic kidney condition by various routes, including, but not limited to,
subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Since
administration of parenteral dosage forms typically bypasses the patient's natural defenses against
contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to
administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to,
solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, controlled-release parenteral dosage
forms, and emulsions.
[00119]      Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the disclosure are
well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, without limitation: sterile water; water for
injection USP; saline solution; glucose solution; aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to, sodium
chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose Injection, dextrose and sodium chloride injection, and
lactated Ringer's injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol,
polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn
oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate,
[00120]      In some embodiments, compositions comprising an effective amount of a ROB 02 inhibitor
are formulated to be suitable for oral administration, for example as discrete dosage forms, such as, but
not limited to, tablets (including without limitation scored or coated tablets), pills, caplets, capsules,

chewable tablets, powder packets, cachets, troches, wafers, aerosol sprays, or liquids, such as but not
limited to, syrups, elixirs, solutions or suspensions in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an
oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil emulsion. Such compositions contain a predetermined amount
of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the disclosed compounds, and may be prepared by methods of
pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,
18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton, Pa. (1990).
[00121]       Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous
solid oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical excipients are used. If desired, tablets
can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. These dosage forms can be prepared by
any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are
prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient(s) with liquid carriers, finely
divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary. In
some embodiments, oral dosage forms are not used for the antibiotic agent.
[00122]       Typical oral dosage forms of the compositions comprising an effective amount of a
ROB02 inhibitor are prepared by combining the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the ROBO2
inhibitor in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical
compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of the
composition desired for administration. For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol
dosage forms include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents,
preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms
(e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not limited to, starches, sugars,
microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating
agents.
[00123]       Binders suitable for use in the pharmaceutical formulations described herein include, but
are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such
as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and
its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch,
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures
thereof.
[00124]       Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical formulations described herein
include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline
cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized
starch, and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions described herein is
typically present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition,
[00125]       Disintegrants are used in the oral pharmaceutical formulations described herein to provide
tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. A sufficient amount of disintegrant

that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) should
be used to form solid oral dosage forms of the ROBO2 inhibitors described herein. The amount of
disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation, and is readily discernible to those of
ordinary skill in the art. Disintegrants that can be used to form oral pharmaceutical formulations include,
but are not limited to, agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose
sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other
starches, pre-gelatinized starch, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof.
[00126]       Lubricants that can be used to form oral pharmaceutical formulations of the ROBO2
inhibitors described herein, include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate,
mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic
acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower
oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and
mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel (AEROSIL* 200,
manufactured by W. R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed
by Degussa Co. of Piano, Tex.), CAB -0-SIL* (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of
Boston, Mass.), and mixtures thereof. If used at all, lubricants are typically used in an amount of less
than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are
incorporated.
[00127]       In other embodiments, lactose-free pharmaceutical formulations and dosage forms are
provided, wherein such compositions preferably contain little, if any, lactose or other mono- or
di-saccharides. As used herein, the term "lactose- free" means that the amount of lactose present, if any,
is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient. Lactose-free
compositions of the disclosure can comprise excipients which are well known in the art and are listed in
the USP (XXI )/NF (XVI), which is incorporated herein by reference.
[00128]       The oral formulations of the ROBO2 inhibitors further encompass, in some embodiments,
anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising the ROBO2 inhibitors described
herein as active ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example,
the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating
long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations
over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles & Practice, 379-80 (2nd ed., Marcel
Dekker, NY, N.Y.: 1995). Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms described herein
can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low
humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least
one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if
substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is
expected. Anhydrous compositions are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure
to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging

include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e.g., vials) with
or without desiccants, blister packs, and strip packs.
[00129]       Aerosol formulations. A ROBO-2 inhibitor can be packaged in a pressurized aerosol
container together with suitable propellants, for example, hydrocarbon propellants like propane, butane,
or isobutane with conventional adjuvants. A ROBO-2 inhibitor can also be administered in a
non-pressurized form such as in a nebulizer or atomizer. A ROBO-2 inhibitor can also be administered
directly to the airways in the form of a dry powder, for example, by use of an inhaler.
[00130]       Suitable powder compositions include, by way of illustration, powdered preparations of a
ROBO-2 inhibitor, thoroughly intermixed with lactose, or other inert powders acceptable for
intrabronchial administration. The powder compositions can be administered via an aerosol dispenser
or encased in a breakable capsule which can be inserted by the subject into a device that punctures the
capsule and blows the powder out in a steady stream suitable for inhalation. The compositions can
include propellants, surfactants, and co-solvents and can be filled into conventional aerosol containers
that are closed by a suitable metering valve.
[00131]       Aerosols for the delivery to the respiratory tract are known in the art. See for example,

[00132]       The formulations of the ROB 0-2 inhibitors described herein further encompass anhydrous
pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising the disclosed compounds as active
ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of
water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term

conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active
ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact
with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected.
Anhydrous compositions are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water
such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but
are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e.g., vials) with or without
desiccants, blister packs, and strip packs.
[00133]      Controlled and Delayed Release Dosage Forms. In some embodiments of the aspects
described herein, a ROBO-2 inhibitor can be administered to a subject by controlled- or delayed-release
means. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is
characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a
minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include: 1) extended activity
of the drug; 2) reduced dosage frequency; 3) increased patient compliance; 4) usage of less total drug; 5)
reduction in local or systemic side effects; 6) minimization of drug accumulation; 7) reduction in blood
level fluctuations; 8) improvement in efficacy of treatment; 9) reduction of potentiation or loss of drug
activity; and 10) improvement in speed of control of diseases or conditions. (Kim, Cherng-ju,
Controlled Release Dosage Form Design, 2 (Technomic Publishing, Lancaster, Pa.: 2000)).
Controlled-release formulations can be used to control a compound of formula (I)'s onset of action,
duration of action, plasma levels within the therapeutic window, and peak blood levels. In particular,
controlled- or extended-release dosage forms or formulations can be used to ensure that the maximum
effectiveness of a compound of formula (I) is achieved while minimizing potential adverse effects and
safety concerns, which can occur both from under-dosing a drug (i.e., going below the minimum
therapeutic levels) as well as exceeding the toxicity level for the drug.
[00134]      A variety of known controlled- or extended-release dosage forms, formulations, and
devices can be adapted for use with the ROB 0-2 inhibitors described herein. Examples include, but are
not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123;
4,008,719; 5674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591 ,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; 5,733,566;
and 6,365,185 BI, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. These dosage
forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for
example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes,
osmotic systems (such as OROS@ (Alza Corporation, Mountain View, Calif. USA)), multilayer
coatings, microparticles, liposomes, or microspheres or a combination thereof to provide the desired
release profile in varying proportions. Additionally, ion exchange materials can be used to prepare
immobilized, adsorbed salt forms of the disclosed compounds and thus effect controlled delivery of the
drug. Examples of specific anion exchangers include, but are not limited to, DUOLITE@ A568 and
DUOLITE@ AP143 (Rohm&Haas, Spring House, Pa. USA).

[00135]        In some embodiments of the methods described herein, a ROB 0-2 inhibitor for use in the
methods described herein is administered to a subject by sustained release or in pulses. Pulse therapy is
not a form of discontinuous administration of the same amount of a composition over time, but
comprises administration of the same dose of the composition at a reduced frequency or administration
of reduced doses. Sustained release or pulse administrations are particularly preferred when the disorder
occurs continuously in the subject, for example where the subject has chronic kidney disease. Each
pulse dose can be reduced and the total amount of a ROBO-2 inhibitor described herein administered
over the course of treatment to the subject or patient is minimized.
[00136]        The interval between pulses, when necessary, can be determined by one of ordinary skill in
the art. Often, the interval between pulses can be calculated by administering another dose of the
composition when the composition or the active component of the composition is no longer detectable
in the subject prior to delivery of the next pulse. Intervals can also be calculated from the in vivo
half-life of the composition. Intervals can be calculated as greater than the in vivo half-life, or 2, 3, 4, 5
and even 10 times greater the composition half-life. Various methods and apparatus for pulsing
compositions by infusion or other forms of delivery to the patient are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,747,825; 4,723,958; 4,948,592; 4,965,251 and 5,403,590.
[00137]        In some embodiments, sustained-release preparations comprising the ROBO-2 inhibitor
can be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices
of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the inhibitor, in which matrices are in the form of shaped
articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,
hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S.
Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and y ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable
ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT
(injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and
poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.
[00138]        The formulations comprising the ROB 0-2 inhibitors to be used for in vivo administration
are preferably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through, for example, sterile filtration
membranes, and other methods known to one of skill in the art.
[00139]        Also provided herein, in some aspects, are assays, methods, and systems for determining
whether an individual has a chronic kidney disease or a pre-disposition for a chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria based on expression profiles or sequence information of ROBO2 as a biomarker indicative
of chronic kidney disease or a pre-disposition for a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. As
demonstrated herein, ROBO2 is useful as a biomarker to identify a subject having chronic kidney
disease or at high risk for chronic kidney disease or proteinuria or to monitor the effects of treatment on
the progression of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.
[00140]        As used herein, a "biomarker" refers to an organic biomolecule which is differentially
present in a sample taken from a subject of one phenotypic status (e.g., having a disease) as compared
                                                    - 34 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                    PCT/US2013/020280
with another phenotypic status (e.g., not having the disease). A biomarker is differentially present
between different phenotypic statuses if the mean or median expression level of the biomarker in the
different groups is calculated to be statistically significant. Common tests for statistical significance
include, among others, t-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney and odds ratio.
Biomarkers, alone or in combination, provide measures of relative risk that a-subject belongs to one
phenotypic status or another. As such, they are useful as markers for disease (diagnostics), therapeutic
effectiveness of a drug (theranostics) and of drug toxicity.
[00141]       ROBO2 expression for use in the assays described herein can be detected by any suitable
method, including detection or protein levels or detection of mRNA expression levels. ROBO2
polypeptide can be detected in any form that may be found in a biological sample obtained from a
subject, or in any form that may result from manipulation of the biological sample (e.g., as a result of
sample processing). Modified forms of ROBO2 can include modified proteins that are a product of
allelic variants, splice variants, post-translational modification (e.g., glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage
(e.g., fragments of a parent protein), glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, oxidation, methylation,
cysteinylation, sulphonation, acetylation, and the like), oligomerization, de-oligomerization (to
separate monomers from a multimeric form of the protein), denaturation, and the like.
[00142]       The assays described herein can be designed to detect all forms or particular forms of
ROBO2. Where desired, differentiation between different forms of ROBO2, e.g., different isoforms,
can be accomplished by use of detection methods dependent upon physical characteristics that differ
between the forms, e.g., different molecular weight, different molecular size, presence/absence of
different epitopes, and the like.
[00143]       Accordingly, provided herein, in some aspects, are assays for the diagnosis of a subject at
having chronic kidney disease or at risk for chronic kidney disease or proteinuria, the assay comprising:
measuring the level of ROBO2 protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample obtained from the subject,
wherein if the level of the ROBO2 in the biological sample from the subject is at the same level or
greater than (e.g., greater than by a statistically significant amount) a threshold reference level for
ROBO2, the subject likely is at risk for chronic kidney disease or proteinuria or has chronic kidney
disease. For example, an increase in the level of ROB02 by more than about 10%, or more than about
20%, or more than about 30%, or more than about 40%, or more than about 50%, or more than about
60%, or more, as compared to a reference threshold level of ROBO2. In some embodiments, the
increase in the level of ROBO2 is at least one standard deviation greater than, or at least two standard
deviations, or more, greater than a median or mean ROBO2 reference threshold level. Such median or
mean ROBO2 reference levels can be obtained, for example, from five or more samples obtained from
subjects not having chronic kidney disease or proteinuria, or from five or more samples obtained from
the same subject at different timepoints.
[00144]       In some embodiments of these assays, the amount of ROBO2 measured in a biological
sample is compared to a reference threshold level, or a reference biological sample, such as biological
                                                      - 35 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                    PCT/US2013/020280
sample obtained from an age-matched normal control (e.g., an age-matched subject not having a risk of
chronic kidney disease or proteinuria), or a healthy subject, e.g., a healthy individual.
[00145]       In some embodiments, the assays, systems and kits as disclosed herein are also useful for
monitoring a course of treatment being administered to a subject. For example, one can measure the
level of ROBO2 in a biological sample in the subject at a first timepoint (e.g., ti) and compare with the
ROBO2 biomarker reference threshold level, and if the measured level for ROBO2 is the same or
higher than the reference threshold level, the subject can be administered an appropriate therapeutic
treatment or regimen to delay or reduce the occurrence of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria, e.g., for
example, increase exercise, reduce heart pressure, adjust diet etc. as disclosed in the methods herein,
and then the level of the panel of ROB02 biomarker protein can be measured at a second (e.g., t2) and
subsequent timepoints (e.g., t3, t4, t5, t5 ... etc.), and compared to levels of tROBO2 at one or more
time points (e.g., at ti or any subsequent timepoint) or the reference threshold levels of ROBO2 to
determine if the therapeutic treatment or medical treatment or regimen for the treatment to reduce the
risk of, delay, or reduce the occurrence of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria is effective. In some
such embodiments, the assays, systems and kits as disclosed herein can be used to monitor a therapeutic
treatment in a symptomatic subject (e.g., a subject known to have chronic kidney disease or proteinuria),
where an effective treatment can be a decrease in ROBO2 in the subject, or alternatively the assays,
systems and kits as disclosed herein can be used to monitor the effect of prophylactic treatment in an
asymptomatic subject (e.g., to prevent chronic kidney disease or proteinuria occurring in a subject ), for
example, where the subject has been identified to be at risk of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria
according to the methods as disclosed herein, or others known in the art, or due to hereditary reasons,
for example.
[00146]       The term "sample" as used herein generally refers to any material containing nucleic acid,
either DNA or RNA, or amino acids. Generally, such material will be in the form of a blood sample,
stool sample, tissue sample, cells, bacteria, histology section, or buccal swab. Samples can be prepared,
for example samples can be fresh, fixed, frozen, or embedded in paraffin. The term "biological sample"
as used herein refers to a cell or population of cells or a quantity of tissue or fluid from a subject. Most
often, the sample has been removed from a subject, but the term "biological sample" can also refer to
cells or tissue analyzed in vivo, i.e. without removal from the subject. Often, a "biological sample" will
contain cells from the animal, but the term can also refer to non-cellular biological material, such as
non-cellular fractions of blood, saliva, or urine, that can be used to measure gene expression levels.
Biological samples include, but are not limited to, tissue biopsies, scrapes, whole blood, plasma, serum,
urine, saliva, cell culture, or cerebrospinal fluid. Biological samples also include tissue biopsies, cell
culture. A biological sample or tissue sample can refers to a sample of tissue or fluid isolated from an
individual, including but not limited to, for example, urine, blood, plasma, serum, kidney biopsy, stool,
sputum, spinal fluid, pleural fluid, nipple aspirates, lymph fluid, the external sections of the skin,
respiratory, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tears, saliva, milk, cells (including but not limited to

blood cells), tumors, organs, and also samples of an in vitro cell culture constituent. In some
embodiments, where a urine sample is obtained, the urine sample is centrifuged to pellet any kidney
cells, on which the assays and methods described herein can be performed. In some embodiments, the
sample is from a kidney biopsy, such as a core needle biopsy of a kidney or portion thereof, such as a
podocyte sample. In addition, fine needle aspirate samples are used. In some embodiments, the
biological samples can be prepared, for example biological samples can be fresh, fixed, frozen, or
embedded in paraffin. The sample can be obtained by removing a sample of cells from a subject, but can
also be accomplished by using previously isolated cells (e.g. isolated by another person), or by
performing the methods described herein in vivo.
[00147]      The term "expression" as used herein refers to interchangeably to the expression of a
polypeptide or protein or expression of a polynucleotide or expression of a gene. Expression also refers
to the expression of pre-translational modified and post-translationally modified proteins, as well as
expression of pre-mRNA molecules, alternatively spliced and mature mRNA molecules. Expression of
a polynucleotide can be determined, for example, by measuring the production of RNA transcript
molecules, for example messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels. Expression of a protein or
polypeptide can be determined, for example, by immunoassay using an antibody(ies) that bind with the
polypeptide. The term "encode" as it is applied to polynucleotides refers to a polynucleotide which is
said to "encode" a polypeptide or protein if, in its native state or when manipulated by methods well
known to those skilled in the art, it can be transcribed to produce the RNA which can be translated into
an amino acid sequence to generate the polypeptide and/or a fragment thereof. The antisense strand is
the complement of such a nucleic acid, and the encoding sequence can be deduced therefrom. The term
"endogenously expressed" or "endogenous expression" refers to the expression of a gene product at
normal levels and under normal regulation for that cell type.
[00148]      Detection methods that can be used with the assays, methods, and systems described herein
to measure levels of ROBO2 protein or nucleic acid in a sample or biological sample include optical
methods, electrochemical methods (voltametry and amperometry techniques), atomic force microscopy,
and radio frequency methods, e.g., multipolar resonance spectroscopy. Optical methods include
microscopy, both confocal and non-confocal, detection of fluorescence, luminescence,
chemiluminescence, absorbance, reflectance, transmittance, and birefringence or refractive index (e.g.,
surface plasmon resonance, ellipsometry, a resonant mirror method, a grating coupler waveguide
method or interferometry).
[00149]      In those embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein in which the
level of ROBO2 protein is determined, such as, for example, the level of a protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 or
SEQ ID NO: 3, one can use any proteomic approach commonly known to persons of ordinary skill in
the art to measure the level of biomarker proteins in a biological sample. The measurement can be either
quantitative or qualitative, so long as the measurement is capable of determining or indicating whether

the level of ROBO2 protein in the biological sample is the same as, or above or below a reference
threshold value for ROBO2 protein.
[00150]        The measured level of ROBO2 protein can, in some embodiments, be a primary
measurement of the level of ROB 02 protein measuring the quantity of ROB 02 protein itself, such as by
detecting the number of ROB02 protein molecules in the sample) or it can be, in some embodiments, a
secondary measurement of ROB 02 protein (a measurement from which the quantity of ROB 02 protein
can be but not necessarily deduced, such as a measure of functional activity or a measure of nucleic acid,
such as mRNA, encoding ROBO2 protein). Qualitative data can also be derived or obtained from
primary measurements.
[00151]        In some embodiments of the assays and methods described herein, ROB02 protein levels
can be measured using an affinity-based measurement technology. "Affinity" as relates to an antibody
is a term well understood in the art and means the extent, or strength, of binding of antibody to the
binding partner, such as a biomarker as described herein (or epitope thereof). Affinity can be measured
and/or expressed in a number of ways known in the art, including, but not limited to, equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD or Kd), apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD' or Kd'), and IC 50
(amount needed to effect 50% inhibition in a competition assay; used interchangeably herein with
"I50"). It is understood that, for purposes of this invention, an affinity is an average affinity for a given
population of antibodies which bind to an epitope.
[00152]        Affinity-based measurement technology utilizes a molecule that specifically binds to the
biomarker protein being measured (an "affinity reagent," such as an antibody or aptamer), although
other technologies, such as spectroscopy-based technologies (e.g., matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight, MALDI-TOF spectroscopy) or assays measuring bioactivity (e.g., assays
measuring mitogenicity of growth factors) can also be used. Affinity-based technologies for use with
the assays and methods described herein can include antibody-based assays (immunoassays) and assays
utilizing aptamers (nucleic acid molecules which specifically bind to other molecules), such as ELONA.
Additionally, assays utilizing both antibodies and aptamers are also contemplated (e.g., a sandwich
format assay utilizing an antibody for capture and an aptamer for detection). A wide variety of
affinity-based assays are also known in the art.
[00153]        Affinity-based assays typically utilize at least one epitope derived from the biomarker
protein, i.e., ROB02, and many affinity-based assay formats utilize more than one epitope (e.g., two or
more epitopes are involved in "sandwich" format assays; at least one epitope is used to capture the
biomarker protein, and at least one different epitope is used to detect the marker).
[00154]        Affinity-based assays can be in competition or direct reaction formats, utilize
sandwich-type formats, and can further be heterogeneous (e.g., utilize solid supports) or homogenous
(e.g., take place in a single phase) and/or utilize immunoprecipitation. Many assays involve the use of
labeled affinity reagent (e.g., antibody, polypeptide, or aptamer); the labels can be, for example,
enzymatic, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, radioactive, or dye molecules. Assays which amplify the

signals from the probe are also known; examples of which are assays which utilize biotin and avidin,
and enzyme-labeled and mediated immunoassays, such as ELISA and ELONA assays. For example, the
biomarker concentrations from biological fluid samples may be measured by LUMINEX@ assay or
ELISA. Either of the biomarker or reagent specific for the biomarker can be attached to a surface and
levels can be measured directly or indirectly.
[00155]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels can be measured using an immunoassay affinity-based measurement technology.
[00156]      Immunoassay technologies can include any immunoassay technology which can
quantitatively or qualitatively measure the level of ROB02 protein in a biological sample. Suitable
immunoassay technologies include, but are not limited to radioimmunoassay, ELISA (enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assay), "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoradiometric assays, immunodiffusion
assays, in situ immunoassays (using colloidal gold, enzyme or radioisotope labels, for example),
western blot analysis, immunoprecipitations, immunofluorescence assays, immunoelectrophoresis
assays, fluoroimmunoassay (FiA), immunoradiometric assay (IRMA), immunoenzymometric assay
(IEMA), immunoluminescence assay and immunofluorescence assay (Madersbacher S, Berger P.
Antibodies and immunoassays. Methods 2000;21:41-50), chemiluminescent assay, immuno-PCR, and
western blot assay. Likewise, aptamer-based assays which can quantitatively or qualitatively measure
the level of a biomarker in a biological sample can be used in the assays, methods, and systems
described herein. Generally, aptamers can be substituted for antibodies in nearly all formats of
immunoassay, although aptamers allow additional assay formats (such as amplification of bound
aptamers using nucleic acid amplification technology such as PCR (U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202) or
isothermal amplification with composite primers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,251,639 and 6,692,918).
[00157]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, where
ROBO2 protein levels are measured using an immunoassay affinity-based measurement technology,
the immunoassay is performed by measuring the extent of the protein/antibody interaction of the
biomarker/antibody interaction. Any known method of immunoassay can be used.
[00158]      In some embodiments, a binding partner, e.g., an antibody or a ligand binding to the
ROBO2 protein in the binding assay, is preferably a labeled specific binding partner, but not necessarily
an antibody. The binding partner is usually labeled itself, but alternatively it can be detected by a
secondary reaction in which a signal is generated, e.g. from another labeled substance.
[00159]      Thus, the antibody which specifically binds to ROBO2 protein can be used in the assays,
methods, and systems described herein to determine the presence and/or amount of ROB 02 protein n a
biological sample, which can be used to detect the increased or decreased concentration of ROBO2
protein present in a diagnostic sample. Such antibodies can be raised by any of the methods well known
in the immunodiagnostics field. The antibodies can be anti-ROBO2 protein antibodies to any
biologically relevant state of the protein. Thus, for example, they could be raised against the
                                                    - 39 -

unglycosylated form of ROB 02 protein, which exists in the body in a glycosylated form, or against a
peptide carrying a relevant epitope of ROBO2 protein.
[00160]      In some embodiments of these assays, method, and systems, an amplified assay form can
be used, whereby an enhanced "signal" is produced from a relatively low level of protein to be detected.
One particular form of an amplified immunoassay is enhanced chemiluminescent assay. For example,
the antibody is labeled with horseradish peroxidase, which participates in a chemiluminescent reaction
with luminol, a peroxide substrate and a compound which enhances the intensity and duration of the
emitted light, typically 4-iodophenol or 4-hydroxycinnamic acid.
[00161]      In some embodiments of these assays, method, and systems, an amplified immunoassay
can be used comprising immuno-PCR. In this technique, the antibody is covalently linked to a molecule
of arbitrary DNA comprising PCR primers, whereby the DNA with the antibody attached to it is
amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. See E. R. Hendrickson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 23:
522-529 (1995).
[00162]      Accordingly, in all embodiments of the assays, method, and systems described herein, the
level of ROBO2 protein can be determined using a protein-binding agent, also referred to herein as
"protein-binding entity" or an "affinity reagent" can be used, in particular, antibodies. For instance, the
affinity reagents, in particular, antibodies such as anti-biomarker antibodies can be used in an
immunoassay, particularly in an ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay). In embodiments
where the level of a biomarker protein can be measured in a biological sample using methods
commonly known in the art, and including, for example but not limited to isoform-specific chemical or
enzymatic cleavage of isoform proteins, immunobloting, immunohistochemical analysis, ELISA, and
mass spectrometry.
[00163]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)." ELISA is a
technique for detecting and measuring the concentration of an antigen using a labeled (e.g. enzyme
linked) form of the antibody. There are different forms of ELISA, which are well known to those
skilled in the art. The standard techniques known in the art for ELISA are described in "Methods in
Immunodiagnosis", 2nd Edition, Rose and Bigazzi, eds. John Wiley & Sons, 1980; Campbell et al.,
"Methods and Immunology", W. A. Benjamin, Inc., 1964; and Oellerich, M. 1984, J. Clin. Chem. Clin.
Biochem., 22:895-904.
[00164]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using a sandwich assay ELISA. In a "sandwich ELISA", an antibody (e.g.
anti-enzyme) is linked to a solid phase (i.e. a microtiter plate) and exposed to a biological sample
containing antigen (e.g. enzyme). The solid phase is then washed to remove unbound antigen. A labeled
antibody (e.g. enzyme linked) is then bound to the bound-antigen (if present) forming an
antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich. Accordingly, using this method, a first antibody to ROBO2
protein is bound to the solid phase such as a well of a plastics microtiter plate, and incubated with the
                                                    - 40 -

sample and with a labeled second antibody specific to ROB02 protein to be assayed. Examples of
enzymes that can be linked to the antibody are alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, luciferase,
urease, and B-galactosidase. The enzyme linked antibody reacts with a substrate to generate a colored
reaction product that can be measured.
[00165]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using an antibody capture assay or competitive ELISA. In a "competitive
ELISA", antibody is incubated with a sample containing antigen (i.e. enzyme). The antigen-antibody
mixture is then contacted with a solid phase (e.g. a microtiter plate) that is coated with antigen (i.e.,
enzyme). The more antigen present in the sample, the less free antibody that will be available to bind to
the solid phase. A labeled (e.g., enzyme linked) secondary antibody is then added to the solid phase to
determine the amount of primary antibody bound to the solid phase. Accordingly, in some such
embodiments, a biological test sample is allowed to bind to a solid phase, and the anti-ROBO2 protein
antibody (e.g., antibodies that specifically bind ROBO2 protein ) can be added and allowed to bind.
After washing away unbound material, the amount of antibody bound to the solid phase is determined
using a labeled second antibody, anti- to the first.
[00166]      In some embodiments of these assays, method, and systems, a label is preferably an
enzyme. The substrate for the enzyme can be, for example, color-forming, fluorescent or
chemiluminescent.
[00167]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using immunohistochemistry. In an "immunohistochemistry assay" a
section of tissue is tested for specific proteins by exposing the tissue to antibodies that are specific for
the protein that is being assayed. The antibodies are then visualized by any of a number of methods to
determine the presence and amount of the protein present. Examples of methods used to visualize
antibodies are, for example, through enzymes linked to the antibodies (e.g., luciferase, alkaline
phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, or beta-galactosidase), or chemical methods (e.g., DAB/Substrate
chromagen). The sample is then analyzed microscopically, most preferably by light microscopy of a
sample stained with a stain that is detected in the visible spectrum, using any of a variety of such
staining methods and reagents known to those skilled in the art.
[00168]      In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using radioimmunoassays. A radioimmunoassay is a technique for
detecting and measuring the concentration of an antigen, i.e., ROB02, using a labeled (e.g..
radioactively or fluorescently labeled) form of the antigen. Examples of radioactive labels for antigens
include 3H, 14C, and 1251. The concentration of ROBO2 in a biological sample is measured by having
the ROBO2 in the biological sample compete with the labeled (e.g. radioactively) ROBO2 for binding
to an antibody to ROBO2. To ensure competitive binding between the labeled ROBO2 and the
unlabeled ROBO2, the labeled ROBO2 is present in a concentration sufficient to saturate the binding
                                                     - 41 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                 PCT/US2013/020280
sites of the antibody. The higher the concentration of ROBO2 in the sample, the lower the concentration
of labeled ROB02 that will bind to the antibody.
[00169]       In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). IRMA is an immunoassay in
which the antibody reagent is radioactively labeled. An IRMA requires the production of a multivalent
antigen conjugate, by techniques such as conjugation to a protein e.g., rabbit serum albumin (RSA). The
multivalent antigen conjugate must have at least 2 antigen residues per molecule and the antigen
residues must be of sufficient distance apart to allow binding by at least two antibodies to the antigen.
For example, in an IRMA the multivalent antigen conjugate can be attached to a solid surface such as a
plastic sphere. Unlabeled "sample" antigen and antibody to antigen which is radioactively labeled are
added to a test tube containing the multivalent antigen conjugate coated sphere. The antigen in the
sample competes with the multivalent antigen conjugate for antigen antibody binding sites. After an
appropriate incubation period, the unbound reactants are removed by washing and the amount of
radioactivity on the solid phase is determined. The amount of bound radioactive antibody is inversely
proportional to the concentration of antigen in the sample.
[00170]       Other techniques can be used to detect the level of ROBO2 protein in a biological sample
can be performed according to a practitioner's preference, and based upon the present disclosure and the
type of biological sample (i.e. plasma, urine, tissue sample etc.). One such technique is Western
blotting (Towbin et at., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 76:4350 (1979)), wherein a suitably treated sample is run
on an SDS-PAGE gel before being transferred to a solid support, such as a nitrocellulose filter.
Detectably labeled anti-ROBO2 antibodies or protein binding molecules can then be used to assess the
level of ROBO2 protein, where the intensity of the signal from the detectable label corresponds to the
amount of ROB02 protein. Levels of the amount of ROB02 protein present can also be quantified, for
example by densitometry.
[00171]       In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using mass spectrometry such as MALDI/TOF (time-of-flight),
SELDI/TOF, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS),
capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, or tandem mass
spectrometry (e.g., MS/MS, MS/MS/MS, ESI-MS/MS, etc.). See for example, U.S. Patent Application
Nos: 20030199001, 20030134304, 20030077616, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by
reference.
[00172]       In some such embodiments, these methodologies can be combined with the machines,
computer systems and media to produce an automated system for determining the level of ROB 02
protein in a biological sample and analysis to produce a printable report which identifies, for example,
the level of ROBO2 protein in a biological sample. In some instances, the measurement of the level of
ROBO2 is done remotely from the determination and comparison modules.

[00173]      Mass spectrometry methods are well known in the art and have been used to quantify
and/or identify biomolecules, such as proteins (see, e.g., Li et al. (2000) Tibtech 18:151-160; Rowley et
al. (2000) Methods 20: 383-397; and Kuster and Mann (1998) Curr. Opin. Structural Biol. 8: 393-400).
Further, mass spectrometric techniques have been developed that permit at least partial de novo
sequencing of isolated proteins. Chait et al., Science 262:89-92 (1993); Keough et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA. 96:7131-6 (1999); reviewed in Bergman, EXS 88:133-44 (2000).
[00174]      In certain embodiments, a gas phase ion spectrophotometer is used. In other embodiments,
laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the sample. Modern laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry ("LDI-MS") can be practiced in two main variations: matrix
assisted laser desorption/ionization ("MALDI") mass spectrometry and surface-enhanced laser
desorption/ionization ("SELDI"). In MALDI, the analyte is mixed with a solution containing a matrix,
and a drop of the liquid is placed on the surface of a substrate. The matrix solution then co-crystallizes
with the biological molecules. The substrate is inserted into the mass spectrometer. Laser energy is
directed to the substrate surface where it desorbs and ionizes the biological molecules without
significantly fragmenting them. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,937 (Hillenkamp et al.), and U.S. Pat. No.
5,045,694 (Beavis & Chait) which are incorporated herein by reference.
[00175]      In SELDI, the substrate surface is modified so that it is an active participant in the
desorption process. In one variant, the surface is derivatized with adsorbent and/or capture reagents that
selectively bind the protein of interest. In another variant, the surface is derivatized with energy
absorbing molecules that are not desorbed when struck with the laser. In another variant, the surface is
derivatized with molecules that bind the protein of interest and that contain a photolytic bond that is
broken upon application of the laser. In each of these methods, the derivatizing agent generally is
localized to a specific location on the substrate surface where the sample is applied. See, e.g., U.S. Pat.
No. 5,719,060 and WO 98/59361 which are incorporated herein by reference. The two methods can be
combined by, for example, using a SELDI affinity surface to capture an analyte and adding
matrix-containing liquid to the captured analyte to provide the energy absorbing material.

Instrumental Analysis, 3rd edition., Skoog, Saunders College Publishing, Philadelphia, 1985; and

1995), pp. 1071-1094.
[00177]      Detection of the level of ROBO2 protein will typically depend on the detection of signal
intensity. This, in turn, can reflect the quantity and character of a polypeptide bound to the substrate.
For example, in certain embodiments, the signal strength of peak values from spectra of a first sample
and a second sample can be compared (e.g., visually, by computer analysis etc.), to determine the
relative amounts of particular biomolecules. Software programs such as the Biomarker Wizard
program (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Fremont, Calif.) can be used to aid in analyzing mass spectra.

[00178]        In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using gel electrophoresis techniques, in particular SDS-PAGE (Sodium
Dodecylsulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Elektrophoresis), especially two dimensional PAGE (2D-PAGE),
preferably two dimensional SDS-PAGE (2D-SDS-PAGE).              According to a particular example, the
assay is based on 2D-PAGE, in particular, using immobilized pH gradients (IPGs) with a pH range
preferably over pH 4-9.
[00179]        In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using gel electrophoresis techniques, in particular, the above mentioned
techniques combined with other protein separation methods, particularly methods known to those
skilled in the art, in particular, chromatography and/or size exclusion.
[00180]        In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using resonance techniques, in particular, plasma surface resonance.
[00181]        In some embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, ROBO2
protein levels are measured using a protein biochip. A biochip generally comprises a solid substrate
having a substantially planar surface, to which a capture reagent (e.g., an adsorbent or affinity reagent)
is attached. Frequently, the surface of a biochip comprises a plurality of addressable locations having
bound capture reagent bound. The biochip may also include bound capture reagent that serves as a
control. Protein biochips are biochips adapted for the capture of polypeptides. Many protein biochips
are described in the art. These include, for example, protein biochips produced by Ciphergen
Biosystems, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), Zyomyx (Hayward, Calif.), Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.), Biacore
(Uppsala, Sweden) and Procognia (Berkshire, UK). Examples of such protein biochips are described in
the following patents or published patent applications: U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,047 (Hutchens &Yip); U.S.
Pat. No. 6,537,749 (Kuimelis and Wagner); U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,209 (Wagner et al.); PCT International
Publication No. WO 00156934 (Englert et al.); PCT International Publication No. WO 031048768
(Boutell et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,242,828 (Bergstrom et al.).
[00182]        The reference threshold levels or values of ROBO2 protein levels used for comparison with
the level of ROBO2 protein from a subject can vary, depending on the aspect or embodiment described
herein being practiced, as will be understood throughout this specification, and below. A reference
threshold value can be based on an individual sample value, such as for example, a value obtained from
a biological sample from the subject being tested, but at an earlier point in time (e.g., at a first timepoint
(t1), e.g., a first biomarker level measured, or at a second timepoint (t2), e.g.,). A reference threshold
value can also be based on a pool of samples, for example, value(s) obtained from samples from a pool
of subjects being tested. For example, in some embodiments, reference threshold values for ROBO2
protein are based on measured the 50% value (e.g., median) of ROB02 protein measured in subjects
known to have chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. For example, subjects in the top 50% (e.g., at or
above the median level) for ROBO2 protein can be selected to be at risk of having chronic kidney
disease or proteinuria. Reference value(s) can also be based on a pool of samples including or excluding
                                                     - 44 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                 PCT/US2013/020280
the sample(s) to be tested. The reference value can be based on a large number of samples, such as from
population of healthy subjects of the chronological age-matched group, or from subjects who do not
have or do not have a risk of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. In some embodiments, the reference
value can be at least one, more typically at least two, standard deviations above the mean or median of
any of these assays or a predetermined mean or median.
[00183]       For assessing the risk of a subject likely to experience or have chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria by the assays, methods, and systems as disclosed herein, a "reference threshold value" is
typically a predetermined reference threshold level, such as the median urine, serum or blood ROB 02
protein obtained from a population of healthy subjects that are in the chronological age group matched
with the chronological age of the tested subject. As indicated earlier, in some situations, the reference
samples can also be gender matched, and/or matched based on ethnicity. In some embodiments, the
reference threshold value for ROB02 protein is the median level for that biomarker in a type of
biological sample, e.g., urine, blood, serum, in a panel subjects for the same ethnicity, e.g., Caucasian,
Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Asian-Indian, Pakistani, Middle Eastern and/or Pacific Islander.
[00184]       For assessing the risk of a subject likely to experience or have chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria by the assays, methods, and systems as disclosed herein, the reference threshold level for
ROBO2 protein can be a predetermined level, such as an average or median of levels obtained from a
population of healthy subjects that are in the chronological age group matched with the chronological
age of the tested subject. Alternately, the reference threshold level for ROBO2 protein can be a
historical reference level for the particular subject that was obtained from a sample derived from the
same subject, but at an earlier point in time, and/or when the subject did not have a risk of chronic
kidney disease or proteinuria. In some instances, the reference threshold level for ROBO2 protein can
be a historical reference level of ROBO2 protein for a particular group of subjects whom have all had
chronic kidney disease or proteinuria, due to, for example, diabetes.
[00185]       In some embodiments, healthy subjects are selected as the control subjects. In some
embodiments, controls are age-matched controls. Healthy subject can be used to obtain a reference
threshold level ROBO2 protein in, for example, a urine or serum sample. A "healthy" subject or sample
from a "healthy" subject or individual as used herein is the same as those commonly understood to one
skilled in the art. For example, one may use methods commonly known to evaluate kidney function, as
described herein, to select control subjects as healthy subjects for diagnosis and treatment methods
described herein. In some embodiments, subjects in good health with no signs or symptom suggesting
chronic kidney disease can be recruited as healthy control subjects. The subjects are evaluated based on
extensive evaluations consisted of medical history, family history, physical and renal examinations by
clinicians, laboratory tests. Examples of analyses of chronic kidney disease and/or proteinuria include,
but are not limited to detecting the level of specific proteins or molecules in a urine, blood, or serum
sample, such as, for example, albumin, calcium, cholesterol, complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes,
magnesium, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, or any combination thereof; assays to detect, for
                                                     - 45 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                   PCT/US2013/020280
example, creatinine clearance; creatinine levels; BUN (blood urea nitrogen); through the use of specific
techniques or procedures, such as an abdominal CT scan, abdominal MRI, abdominal ultrasound,
kidney biopsy, kidney scan, kidney ultrasound; via detection of changes in results of assays or tests for
erythropoietin, PTH; bone density test, or Vitamin D; or any combination of such detection methods
and assays.
[00186]      Age-matched populations (from which reference values can be obtained) are ideally the
same chronological age as the subject or individual being tested, but approximately age-matched
populations are also acceptable. Approximately age-matched populations may be within 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
years of the chronological age of the individual tested, or can be groups of different chronological ages
which encompass the chronological age of the individual being tested.
[00187]      A subject that is compared to its "chronological age matched group" is generally referring
to comparing the subject with a chronological age-matched within a range of 5 to 20 years.
Approximately age-matched populations can be in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 15, or 20 year increments
(e.g. a "5 year increment" group can serve as the source for reference values for a 62 year old subject
might include 58-62 year old individuals, 59-63 year old individuals, 60-64 year old individuals, 61-65
year old individuals, or 62-66 year old individuals). In a broader definition, where there are larger gaps
between different chronological age groups, for example, when there are few different chronological
age groups available for reference values, and the gaps between different chronological age groups
exceed the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 15, or 20 year increments described herein, then the "chronological
age matched group" can refer to the age group that is in closer match to the chronological age of the
subject (e.g. when references values available for an older age group (e.g., 80-90 years) and a younger
age group (e.g., 20-30 years), a chronological age matched group for a 51 year old can use the younger
age group (20-30 years), which is closer to the chronological age of the test subject, as the reference
level.
[00188]      Other factors to be considered while selecting control subjects include, but not limited to,
species, gender, ethnicity, and so on. Hence, in some embodiments, a reference level can be a
predetermined reference level, such as an average or median of levels obtained from a population of
healthy control subjects that are gender-matched with the gender of the tested subject. In some
embodiments, a reference level can be a predetermined reference level, such as an average or median of
levels obtained from a population of healthy control subjects that are ethnicity-matched with the
ethnicity of the tested subject ( e.g., Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Asian-Indian, Pakistani,
Middle Eastern and Pacific Islander). In other embodiments, both chronological age and gender of the
population of healthy subjects are matched with the chronological age and gender of the tested subject,
respectively. In other embodiments, both chronological age and ethnicity of the population of healthy
subjects are matched with the chronological age and ethnicity of the tested subject, respectively. In
other embodiments, chronological age, gender, and ethnicity of the population of healthy control

    WO 2013/103811                                                                  PCT/US2013/020280
subjects are all matched with the chronological age, gender, and ethnicity of the tested subject,
respectively.
[00189]       The process of comparing a level of ROBO2 protein in a biological sample from a subject
and a reference threshold level for ROBO2 protein can be carried out in any convenient manner
appropriate and known to one of skill in the art. Generally, values of ROBO2 protein levels determined
using the assays, methods, and systems described herein can be quantitative values (e.g., quantitative
values of concentration, such as milligrams of ROBO2 protein per liter (e.g., mg/L) of sample, or an
absolute amount). Alternatively, values of ROBO2 protein levels can be qualitative depending on the
measurement techniques, and thus the mode of comparing a value from a subject and a reference value
can vary depending on the measurement technology employed. For example, the comparison can be
made by inspecting the numerical data, by inspecting representations of the data (e.g., inspecting
graphical representations such as bar or line graphs), and using standard deviations of, for example, at
least one, or at least two standard deviations. In one example, when a qualitative assay is used to
measure ROB 02 protein levels, the levels can be compared by visually comparing the intensity of the
colored reaction product, or by comparing data from densitometric or spectrometric measurements of
the colored reaction product (e.g., comparing numerical data or graphical data, such as bar charts,
derived from the measuring device).
[00190]       As described herein, ROBO2 protein levels can be measured quantitatively (absolute
values) or qualitatively (relative values). In some embodiments, quantitative values of ROBO2 protein
levels in the biological samples can indicate a given level (or grade) of risk of chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria.
[00191]       In some embodiments, the comparison is performed to determine the magnitude of the
difference between the values from a subject and reference values (e.g., comparing the "fold" or
percentage difference between the measured ROBO2 protein levels obtained from a subject and the
reference threshold ROBO2 protein value). A fold difference can be determined by measuring the
absolute concentration of the ROB02 protein levels, and comparing that to the absolute value to the
reference threshold ROB02 protein level, or a fold difference can be measured by the relative
difference between a reference value and a sample value, where neither value is a measure of absolute
concentration, and/or where both values are measured simultaneously. For example, an ELISA
measures the absolute content or concentration of a protein from which a fold change is determined in
comparison to the absolute concentration of the same protein in the reference. As another example, an
antibody array measures the relative concentration from which a fold change is determined.
Accordingly, the magnitude of the difference between the measured value and the reference value that
suggests or indicates a particular diagnosis will depend on the method being practiced.
[00192]       As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, when replicate measurements are taken for
measurement of ROBO2 protein levels, the measured values from subjects can be compared with the
reference threshold ROBO2 protein levels, and take into account the replicate measurements. The
                                                     - 47 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                 PCT/US2013/020280
replicate measurements can be taken into account by using either the mean or median of the measured
values.
[00193]       In some embodiments, the process of comparing can be manual or it can, preferably, be
automated. For example, an assay device (such as a luminometer for measuring chemiluminescent
signals) can include circuitry and software enabling it to compare a value from a subject with a
reference value for ROBO2 protein. Alternately, a separate device (e.g., a digital computer) can be used
to compare the measured ROBO2 protein levels from subject(s) and the reference threshold levels for
ROBO2 protein. Automated devices for comparison can include stored reference values for the ROB 02
protein, or can compare the measured ROBO2 protein levels from subject(s) with reference threshold
levels for ROBO2 protein that are derived from contemporaneously measured reference samples
[00194]       In some embodiments, a subject tested for ROBO2 protein levels is assigned into one of
two or more groups (statuses) based on the results of the assays, methods, and systems described herein.
The diagnostic assays, methods, and systems described herein can be used to classify between a number
of different states.
[00195]       Accordingly, in some embodiments, determining whether a subject has a high risk of
having chronic kidney disease or proteinuria (status: low-risk v. high risk) is performed using the
diagnostic assays, methods, and systems described herein . Biomarker amounts or patterns of ROBO2
protein determined as being characteristic of various risk states, e.g., high, medium or low, are
identified. The risk of developing chronic kidney disease or proteinuria is determined by measuring
ROB02 protein alone or in combination with other known biomarkers, and then either submitting them
to a classification algorithm or comparing them with a reference amount (e.g., a cut off reference
amount as disclosed herein) that is associated with the particular risk level.
[00196]       In some embodiments, provided herein are diagnostic assays, methods, and systems for
determining the severity or stage or risk of having a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria in a subject.
Each stage of chronic kidney disease, for example, has a characteristic amount of ROB02 protein or
relative amounts of ROBO2 protein. The stage of a disease is determined by measuring ROB 02 protein,
alone or in combination with other biomarkers, and then either submitting them to a classification
algorithm or comparing them with a reference amount and/or pattern of biomarkers that is associated
with the particular stage, e.g., how soon the subject will likely develop chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria. For example, one can classify between likely to have chronic kidney disease or proteinuria
within a year (e.g., a poor prognosis) or a subject likely to have chronic kidney disease or proteinuria in
the next 5 years.
[00197]       Additional embodiments of the diagnostic assays, methods, and systems relate to the
communication of results or diagnoses or both to technicians, physicians or patients, for example. In
certain embodiments, computers are used to communicate assay results or diagnoses or both to
interested parties, e.g., physicians and their patients. In some embodiments, the assays are performed or
the assay results analyzed in a country or jurisdiction which differs from the country or jurisdiction to
                                                     - 48 -

which the results or diagnoses are communicated, for example. In some embodiments, a risk of having
chronic kidney disease or proteinuria based on levels of ROB 02 protein in a biological sample from the
subject is communicated to the subject after the levels or prognosis are obtained. The prognosis or
diagnosis can be communicated to the subject by the subject's treating physician. Alternatively, the
prognosis or diagnosis can be sent to the subject by email or communicated to the subject by phone. A
computer can be used to communicate the prognosis or diagnosis by email or phone, or via the internet
using a secure gateway patient log-in service. In certain embodiments, the message containing results of
the prognosis or diagnostic test can be generated and delivered automatically to the subject using a
combination of computer hardware and software which will be familiar to artisans skilled in
telecommunications. In certain embodiments of the assays, methods, and systems described herein, all
or some of the method steps, including the assaying of samples, diagnosing of diseases, and
communicating of assay results or diagnoses, can be carried out in diverse (e.g., foreign) jurisdictions.
[00198]      In some embodiments of the diagnostic assays, methods, and systems of qualifying or
assessing a risk of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria described herein, the assays, methods, or
systems further comprise managing subject treatment based on the determination of the risk of having a
chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. Such management includes the actions of the physician or
clinician subsequent to determining the subjects risk of having chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.
For example, if a physician makes a diagnosis of the subject at risk of chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria, then a certain regimen of treatment can follow. A suitable regimen of treatment can include,
without limitation, a supervised exercise program; control of blood pressure, sugar intake, and/or lipid
levels; and drug therapies. In some embodiments, a diagnosis of a risk of having chronic kidney disease
or proteinuria can be followed by further testing to determine whether a patient is suffering from a
chronic kidney disease, or whether the patient is suffering from a related disease. Also, if the diagnostic
test gives an inconclusive result on the risk of a major adverse event status, further tests may be called
for. In some embodiments of the diagnostic assays, methods, and systems of qualifying or assessing a
risk of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria described herein, if a physician makes a diagnosis of the
subject not being at risk of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria, then no treatment is provided.
[00199]      The assay and ROBO2 detection methods described herein can be automated using robotics
and computer directed systems. A biological sample, such as a urine, plasma, or blood sample, can be
injected into a system, such as a microfluidic device entirely run by a robotic station from sample input
to output of the result.
[00200]      Accordingly, also provided herein, in some aspects are systems (and computer readable
medium for causing computer systems) to perform a method for determining whether an individual has
a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria or a pre-disposition for a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria
based on expression profiles or sequence information.
[00201]      In some aspects, provided herein are systems for assessing if a subject has or is at increased
risk for chronic kidney disease or proteinuria, the systems comprising: (a) a determination module

configured to receive a at least one biological sample and perform at least one analysis on said
biological sample to measure a level of ROBO2 in the biological sample or determine the expression
ratio of ROB02 relative to a pre-determined or threshold reference level and to output said measured
level or expression ratio; (b) a storage device configured to store data output information from the
determination module; (c) a comparison module adapted to receive input from the storage device and
compare the data stored on the storage device with at least one reference threshold ROB02 level,
wherein if the measured ROB02 protein level is at least the same or higher than the reference threshold
level, the comparison module provides information to an output module that the biological sample is
associated with a subject that deviates from the reference threshold biomarker level; and (d) an output
module for displaying the information to the user.
[00202]      In all aspects of the invention, methods to determine the levels of ROB02 protein can be
performed using an automated machine or system. Such machines and systems generate a report, such
as displaying a report on a visible screen or a printable report which indicates the levels of ROB02
protein and/or report an increase or the same as a reference threshold level for ROBO2 protein, and/or if
the subject from which the sample was obtained is at risk of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.
[00203]      Accordingly, some embodiments described herein also provide for a machine, computer
systems and computer readable media for performing the steps of (i) determining the levels of ROB 02
protein, and (ii) indicating or reporting whether a subject is at risk of having chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria.
[00204]      Embodiments of these aspects are described through functional modules, which are defined
by computer executable instructions recorded on computer readable media and which cause a computer
to perform method steps when executed. The modules have been segregated by function for the sake of
clarity. However, it should be understood that the modules need not correspond to discreet blocks of
code and the described functions can be carried out by the execution of various code portions stored on
various media and executed at various times. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the modules can
perform other functions, thus the modules are not limited to having any particular functions or set of
functions.

[00206]       Computer-readable data embodied on one or more computer-readable media, or computer
readable medium, can define instructions, for example, as part of one or more programs, that, as a result
of being executed by a computer, instruct the computer to perform one or more of the functions
described herein (e.g., in relation to a system, or computer readable medium), and/or various
embodiments, variations and combinations thereof. Such instructions can be written in any of a
plurality of programming languages, for example, Java, J#, Visual Basic, C, C#, C++, Fortran, Pascal,
Eiffel, Basic, COBOL assembly language, and the like, or any of a variety of combinations thereof. The
computer-readable media on which such instructions are embodied can reside on one or more of the
components of either of the system, or computer readable medium described herein, can be distributed
across one or more of such components, and can be in transition there between.
[00207]       The computer-readable media can be transportable such that the instructions stored thereon
can be loaded onto any computer resource to implement the aspects of the present invention discussed
herein. In addition, it should be appreciated that the instructions stored on the computer readable media,
or the computer-readable medium, described above, are not limited to instructions embodied as part of
an application program running on a host computer. Rather, the instructions can be embodied as any
type of computer code (e.g., software or microcode) that can be employed to program a computer to
implement aspects of the present invention. The computer executable instructions can be written in a
suitable computer language or combination of several languages. Basic computational biology methods
are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are described in, for example, Setubal and Meidanis et

[00213]       In some embodiments of this aspect and all other aspects of the present invention a variety
of software programs and formats can be used to store the biomarker protein level information on the
storage device. Any number of data processor structuring formats (e.g., text file or database) can be
employed to obtain or create a medium having recorded thereon the sequence information or expression
level information.
[00214]       The ROBO2 expression information or information related to ROBO2 expression
information determined in the determination module can be read by the storage device. As used herein
the "storage device" is intended to include any suitable computing or processing apparatus or other
device configured or adapted for storing data or information. Examples of electronic apparatus suitable
for use with the present invention include stand-alone computing apparatus, data telecommunications
networks, including local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), cloud storage systems,
Internet, Intranet, and Extranet, and local and distributed computer processing systems. Storage
devices also include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media, such as floppy discs, hard disc
storage media, magnetic tape, optical storage media such as CD-ROM, DVD, electronic storage media
such as RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM and the like, cloud storage systems, general hard disks and
hybrids of these categories such as magnetic/optical storage media. The storage device is adapted or
configured for having recorded thereon sequence information or expression level information. Such
information may be provided in digital form that can be transmitted and read electronically, e.g., via the
Internet, via a cloud system, on diskette, via USB (universal serial bus), or via any other suitable mode
of communication.
[00215]       As used herein, "expression level information" refers to any nucleotide and/or amino acid
expression level information, including but not limited to full-length nucleotide and/or amino acid
sequences, partial nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, or mutated sequences. Moreover,
information "related to" the expression level information includes detection of the presence or absence
of a sequence (e.g., presence or absence of an amino acid sequence, nucleotide sequence, or post
translational modification), determination of the concentration of a sequence in the sample (e.g., amino

acid sequence levels, or nucleotide (RNA or DNA) expression levels, or level of post translational
modification), and the like.
[00216]      As used herein, "stored" refers to a process for encoding information on the storage device.
Those skilled in the art can readily adopt any of the presently known methods for recording information
on known media to generate manufactures comprising the sequence information or expression level
information.
[00217]      A variety of software programs and formats can be used to store the sequence information
or expression level information on the storage device. Any number of data processor structuring
formats (e.g., text file or database) can be employed to obtain or create a medium having recorded
thereon the sequence information or expression level information.
[00218]      By providing sequence information or expression level information in computer-readable
form, one can use the sequence information or expression level information in readable form in the
comparison module to compare a specific sequence or expression profile with the reference data within
the storage device. For example, search programs can be used to identify fragments or regions of the
sequences that match a particular sequence (reference data, e.g., sequence information obtained from a
control sample) or direct comparison of the determined expression level can be compared to the
reference data expression level (e.g., expression level information obtained from a control sample). The
comparison made in computer-readable form provides a computer readable comparison result which
can be processed by a variety of means. Content based on the comparison result can be retrieved from
the comparison module to indicate a specific disease or disorder, such as chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria.
[00219]      In some embodiments, the reference data stored in the storage device to be read by the
comparison module is ROBO2 sequence or expression information data obtained from a control
biological sample of the same type as the biological sample to be tested. Alternatively, the reference
data are a database, e.g., a part of the entire genome sequence of an organism, or a protein family of
sequences, or an expression level profile (RNA, protein or peptide). In some embodiments, the
reference data are sequence information or expression level profiles that are indicative of a specific
disease or disorder, such as chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.
[00220]      In some embodiments, the reference data are electronically or digitally recorded and
annotated from databases including, but not limited to GenBank (NCBI) protein and DNA databases
such as genome, ESTs, SNPS, Traces, Celara, Ventor Reads, Watson reads, HGTS, and the like; Swiss
Institute of Bioinformatics databases, such as ENZYME, PROSITE, SWISS-2DPAGE, Swiss-Prot and
TrEMBL databases; the Melanie software package or the ExPASy WWW server, and the like; the
SWISS-MODEL, Swiss-Shop and other network-based computational tools; the Comprehensive
Microbial Resource database (available from The Institute of Genomic Research). The resulting
information can be stored in a relational data base that may be employed to determine homologies
between the reference data or genes or proteins within and among genomes.

[00221]       By providing the levels of ROBO2 in readable form in the comparison module, it can be
used to compare with the reference threshold levels of ROB 02 within the storage device. The
comparison made in computer-readable form provides computer readable content which can be
processed by a variety of means.
[00222]       The "comparison module" can use a variety of available software programs and formats for
the comparison operative to compare ROB02 sequence or expression level information determined in
the determination module to reference ROBO2 sequence or expression level data. In some
embodiments, the comparison module is configured to use pattern recognition techniques to compare
ROBO2 sequence or expression level data from one or more entries to one or more reference data
patterns. The comparison module can be configured using existing commercially-available or
freely-available software for comparing patterns, and can be optimized for particular data comparisons
that are conducted. The comparison module provides computer readable information related to the
sequence information that can include, for example, detection of the presence or absence of a sequence
(e.g., detection of a mutation or deletion (protein or DNA), information regarding distinct alleles,
detection of post-translational modification, or omission or repetition of sequences); determination of
the concentration of a sequence in the sample (e.g., amino acid sequence/protein expression levels, or
nucleotide (RNA or DNA) expression levels, or levels of post-translational modification), or
determination of an expression profile.
[00223]       In some embodiments, the comparison module permits the comparison of levels of ROB 02
from the output data of the determination module with reference threshold level data for each ROBO2.
[00224]       In some embodiments, the comparison module performs comparisons with
mass-spectometry spectra, for example comparisons of peptide fragment sequence information can be
carried out using spectra processed in MATLB with script called "Qcealign" (see for example
W02007/022248, herein incorporated by reference) and "Qpeaks" (Spectrum Square Associates,
Ithaca, NY), or Ciphergen Peaks 2. 1r software. The processed spectra can then be aligned using
alignment algorithms that align sample data to the control data using minimum entropy algorithm by
taking baseline corrected data (see for example WIPO Publication W02007/022248, herein
incorporated by reference). The comparison result can be further processed by calculating ratios.
Protein expression profiles can be discerned.
[00225]       Any available comparison software can be used, including but not limited to, the Ciphergen
Express (CE) and Biomarker Patterns Software (BPS) package, Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., CA, USA.
Comparative analysis can be done with protein chip system software (e.g. The Proteinchip suite for
Bio-Rad Laboratories).
[00226]       The comparison module, or any other module described herein, can include an operating
system (e.g., UNIX) on which runs a relational database management system, a World Wide Web
application, and a World Wide Web server. World Wide Web application includes the executable code
necessary for generation of database language statements (e.g., Structured Query Language (SQL)

statements). Generally, the executables will include embedded SQL statements. In addition, the World
Wide Web application can include a configuration file which contains pointers and addresses to the
various software entities that comprise the server as well as the various external and internal databases
which must be accessed to service user requests. The Configuration file also directs requests for server
resources to the appropriate hardware--as can be necessary should the server be distributed over two or
more separate computers. In some embodiments, the World Wide Web server supports a TCP/IP
protocol. Local networks such as this are sometimes referred to as "Intranets." An advantage of such
Intranets is that they allow easy communication with public domain databases residing on the World
Wide Web (e.g., the GenBank or Swiss Pro World Wide Web site). Thus, in some preferred
embodiments, users can directly access data (via Hypertext links for example) residing on Internet
databases using a HTML interface provided by Web browsers and Web servers.
[00227]       In some embodiments, the comparison module compares gene expression profiles. For
example, detection of gene expression profiles can be determined using Affymetrix Microarray Suite
software version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) (available from Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California) to analyze the
relative abundance of a gene or genes on the basis of the intensity of the signal from probe sets, and the
MAS 5.0 data files can be transferred into a database and analyzed with Microsoft Excel and
GeneSpring 6.0 software (available from Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California). The detection
algorithm of MAS 5.0 software can be used to obtain a comprehensive overview of how many
transcripts are detected in given samples and allows a comparative analysis of 2 or more microarray
data sets.
[00228]       In some embodiments, the comparison module compares protein expression profiles. Any
available comparison software can be used, including but not limited to, the Ciphergen Express (CE)
and Biomarker Patterns Software (BPS) package (available from Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Freemont,
California). Comparative analysis can be done with protein chip system software (e.g., The Proteinchip
Suite (available from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California). Algorithms for identifying
expression profiles can include the use of optimization algorithms such as the mean variance algorithm
(e.g. JMP Genomics algorithm available from JMP Software Cary, North Carolina).
[00229]       The comparison module provides computer readable comparison result that can be
processed in computer readable form by predefined criteria, or criteria defined by a user, to provide a
content based in part on the comparison result that can be stored and output as requested by a user using
a display module. The display module enables display of a content based in part on the comparison
result for the user, wherein the content is a signal indicative of a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.
Such signal, can be for example, a display of content indicative of the presence or absence of a chronic
kidney disease or proteinuria on a computer monitor, a printed page of content indicating the presence
or absence of a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria from a printer, or a light or sound indicative of the
presence or absence of a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.

[00230]       The content based on the comparison result can include an expression profile of one or
more proteins, or an expression profile of one or more genes. In some embodiments, the content based
on the comparison result is merely a signal indicative of the presence or absence of a chronic kidney
disease or proteinuria based on ROBO2 protein levels.
[00231]       In some embodiments, the content based on the comparison result is displayed a on a
computer monitor. In one embodiment of the invention, the content based on the comparison result is
displayed through printable media. In one embodiment of the invention, the content based on the
comparison result is displayed as an indicator light or sound. The display module can be any suitable
device configured to receive from a computer and display computer readable information to a user.
Non-limiting examples include, for example, general-purpose computers such as those based on Intel
PENTIUM-type processor, Apple computer and tablet devices, Motorola PowerPC, Sun UltraSPARC,
Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC processors, any of a variety of processors available from Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD) of Sunnyvale, California, or any other type of processor, visual display devices such as
tablet devices, smartphone mobile devices, flat panel displays, cathode ray tubes and the like, as well as
computer printers of various types.
[00232]       In some embodiments, a World Wide Web browser is used for providing a user interface
for display of the content based on the comparison result. It should be understood that other modules of
the invention can be adapted to have a web browser interface. Through the Web browser, a user may
construct requests for retrieving data from the comparison module. Thus, the user will typically point
and click to user interface elements such as buttons, pull down menus, scroll bars and the like
conventionally employed in graphical user interfaces. The requests so formulated with the user's Web
browser are transmitted to a Web application which formats them to produce a query that can be
employed to extract the pertinent information related to the sequence information, e.g., display of an
indication of the presence or absence of mutation or deletion (DNA or protein); display of expression
levels of an amino acid sequence (protein); display of nucleotide (RNA or DNA) expression levels;
display of expression, SNP, or mutation profiles, or haplotypes, or display of information based thereon.
In one embodiment, the sequence information of the reference sample data is also displayed.
[00233]       In some embodiments, the display module displays the comparison result and whether the
comparison result is indicative of a disease, e.g., whether the expression profile of ROBO2 is indicative
of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria.
[00234]       In some embodiments, the content based on the comparison result that is displayed is a
signal (e.g. positive or negative signal) indicative of the presence or absence of a chronic kidney disease
or proteinuria, thus only a positive or negative indication can be displayed.
[00235]       Thus, provided herein are systems (and computer readable medium for causing computer
systems) to perform assays and methods for determining whether an individual has a chronic kidney
disease or proteinuria or a pre-disposition, for a chronic kidney disease or proteinuria based on
expression profiles or sequence information.

computer readable medium, are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention.
[00237]       The modules of the system or used in the computer readable medium, can assume
numerous configurations. For example, function can be provided on a single machine or distributed
over multiple machines.
Robo2 is a Podocyte Protein Localized to the Basal Cell Surface of Mouse Podocyte
[00238]       During kidney development, Robo2 mRNA is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme
surrounding the arborizing ureteric bud and later in the proximal end of the S-shaped body (Piper et al.,
2000), the location of primordial podocytes. To investigate whether Robo2 is also involved in podocyte
maturation, in addition to its role in early kidney induction, we performed in situ hybridization and
found Robo2 mRNA was expressed in the capillary loop stage of developing glomeruli of mouse
embryos at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) (FIGS. 5A and 5B). Robo2 protein became detectable by
immunofluorescence staining in the developing glomerulus around E14.5 and reached peak expression
at E16.5 (FIGS. 5C-5E). Although the expression decreased after E17.5 during development (FIG. 5F),
specific Robo2 expression was maintained in glomeruli after birth and was detectable in adult mice at 5
weeks of age (FIGS. 5G, 5H, 5L-5M).
[00239]       To determine the cellular localization of Robo2 in the developing glomerulus, we
performed dual-label immunohistochemistry with glomerular cell type specific markers. We found that
Robo2 protein was co-localized with nephrin (FIGS. 1A-1C) and podocin (FIGS. 1D-1F), two
podocyte slit-diaphragm associated proteins. Robo2 was also co-expressed in the glomeruli with the
nephrin-interacting adaptor protein Nck (FIGS. 1G, 11) and with WT1, a constituent of podocyte nuclei
(FIGS. 5H-5K). Dual-labeling with antibodies against nidogen, a basement membrane marker (FIGS.
1J-1L and 1P) and Pecaml, an endothelial cell marker (FIGS. 1M-10, 5M) showed that Robo2 was
localized adjacent to the external surface of the glomerular basement membrane and absent from
endothelial cells. High-resolution confocal microscopy further demonstrated that subcellular Robo2
was most abundant on the basal surface of podocytes (FIG. 1Q). Immunogold electron microscopy of
postnatal mouse kidneys with an antibody against the cytoplasmic domain established that Robo2 was
localized to podocyte foot processes close to the cytoplasmic face of the slit-diaphragms (FIG. 1R).
These results demonstrate that Robo2 is a podocyte protein and its basal subcellular localization in the
foot processes indicates that it plays a role in regulating podocyte foot process structure.
Robo2 Intracellular Domain Interacts Directly with SH3 Domains of Adaptor Protein Nck
[00240]       Nephrin extracellular domain engagement leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of its
intracellular domain by Src kinases and recruitment of the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Nck,
which in turn induces actin polymerization (Jones et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2006). Nck bears one SH2
                                                    - 58 -

    WO 2013/103811                                                                PCT/US2013/020280
domain in the C-terminus and three SH3 domains near the N-terminus. Actin polymerization is
mediated by the SH3 domains of Nck (Rivera et al., 2004), which can recruit various cytoskeleton
regulators including N-WASP and Pak (Jones et al., 2006). Previous studies have shown that the SH3
domains of the Drosophila Nck homolog Dreadlock (Dock) also directly interact with the intracellular
domain of Robo to inhibit actin polymerization (Fan et al., 2003; Yang and Bashaw, 2006).
[00241]       We tested whether mammalian Nck can also interact directly with Robo2 in the podocyte to
regulate the F-actin cytoskeleton. To answer this question, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to examine
if Robo2 interacted with Nck. Since two mammalian Ncks (i.e. Nckl, Nck2) share similar structure and
function in kidney development (Jones et al., 2006), we used Nckl in this study and observed that the
intracellular domain of Robo2 directly interacted with Nckl (FIGS. 2A-2C). Binding site mapping in
Robo2 for Nckl showed that the sequence from amino acid 1085 to 1301, which contains 4 proline-rich
motifs, was crucial for the interaction (FIGS. 2A and 2C). Absence of this proline-rich region
prevented its interaction with Nckl (FIG. 2A). Binding site mapping in Nckl for Robo2 showed that
the first two SH3 domains were required for its interaction with Robo2 because deleting either or both
of them abrogated the interaction (FIG. 2B). Thus Robo2 and Nckl interaction was mediated by two
well-characterized protein domains, the SH3 domains and proline-rich motifs (FIG. 2C). CD2AP,
another podocyte adaptor protein, also bears three SH3 domains in its N-terminus (Shih et al., 2001),
but we did not detect any interaction between CD2AP and Robo2 in either the yeast two-hybrid or
co-precipitation assays. These observations indicate that the binding between Robo2 and Nckl in the
podocyte is a specific interaction.
Full-Length Robo2 Forms a Complex with Nephrin through Nck
[00242]       We confirmed the interaction between Robo2 and Nck by pull down and co-precipitation
assays. His- and myc-tagged human full-length Robo2 (His-myc-Robo2) or his- and myc-tagged
human Robo2 with a deletion of the Nckl binding domain (His-myc-Robo2-ANBD) were expressed in
HEK cells. Transfected HEK cells were stimulated with Slit2 conditioned medium (prepared from Slit2
stably transfected cells) to activate Robo2 and increase Nck binding (Fan et al., 2003). Nck was pulled
down with His-mycRobo2 from the HEK cell lysates using Ni-NTA beads but not with
His-myc-Robo2-ANBD (FIG. 2D). Since the SH2 domain of Nck interacts with phosphotyrosines in
the nephrin cytoplasmic domain (NCD) (Jones et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2006), we examined whether
Robo2 formed a complex with nephrin through Nck using a co-precipitation assay. To establish proof of
principle, we co-expressed Robo2 and nephrin in HEK cells with Fyn kinase to increase nephrin
phosphorylation (Verma et al., 2006). Pull-down of His-myc-Robo2 from the HEK cell lysates with
Ni-NTA beads co-precipitated Nck and nephrin when Fyn was expressed (FIG. 2E). In the reverse
order, pulling down His-myc-nephrin co-precipitated Nck and Robo2 when Fyn kinase was expressed
(FIG. 2F). Furthermore, the precipitates prepared with the anti-Nck antibody contained both Robo2 and
nephrin when Fyn was over-expressed (FIG. 6A). These data indicate that nephrin, Nck, and Robo2
form a complex in vitro. To validate these findings in vivo, we immunoprecipitated Robo2 from

newborn mouse kidney lysates and found that Nck and nephrin were co-precipitated (FIG. 2G).
Conversely, the precipitates prepared with the anti-nephrin antibody also contained Nck and Robo2
(FIG. 2H). Since nephrin is uniquely expressed in podocytes, and Nck and Robo2 are also localized in
these cells in the kidney, these results indicate that nephrin, Nck, and Robo2 are able to form a complex
in podocytes.
[00243]       To determine the role of Slit2 in the formation of the Robo2-Nck-nephrin protein complex,
His-myc-Robo2, nephrin, and Fyn were co-expressed in HEK cells that were stimulated with Slit2
conditioned medium or control conditioned medium without Slit2 prior to co-precipitation (FIG. 21).
We observed that Slit2 stimulation increased Robo2 binding to Nck and complex formation with
nephrin. Both ratios of Nckl versus Robo2 and nephrin versus Robo2 were increased after Slit2
stimulation (FIG. 2J). Consistent with this finding, we observed that Slit2 was strongly expressed in
newborn mouse glomeruli (FIGS. 6B, 6C).
Slit2-Robo2 Signaling Inhibits Nephrin-Induced Actin Polymerization
[00244]       Since Slit binds Robo to recruit Dock and srGAPs to inhibit actin polymerization (Fan et al.,
2003), we wished to test whether Robo2 also recruits Nck to inhibit actin polymerization in mammalian
cells, an opposite role to nephrin that promotes actin polymerization. To address this question, we
studied actin polymerization by analyzing F-actin tails in cells expressing the CD16/7-NCD chimeric
protein as previously described (Jones et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2006). This model utilizes the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human immunoglobulin Fc receptors CD 16 and CD7
fused to the nephrin cytoplasmic domain (NCD). CD 16/7-HA, in which NCD was replaced by an HA
tag, was used as a negative control. These chimeric proteins were co-expressed with Robo2 in HEK
cells and clustered by treatment with anti-CD16 antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated to
rhodamine. We first examined if clustering of the nephrin cytoplasmic domain could recruit Robo2. We
observed that engagement of CD16/7-NCD brought Robo2 into the clusters since most of the Robo2
co-localized with the CD16/7-NCD clusters (FIGS. 6D-6F). However, no colocalization of the Robo2
was observed either with the CD 16/7-HA control (FIG. 6D') or with the Robo2-ANBD construct (FIG.
6E'), in which the Robo2 Nck binding domain (NBD) was deleted. Interestingly, in the absence of Slit2,
colocalization of CD16/7-NCD and Robo2 was significantly reduced (FIG. 6F'). These data provide
further evidence that the nephrin cytoplasmic domain is able to complex with the Robo2 intracellular
domain in the presence of Slit2 and validates the model to determine if the formation of a
Robo2-Nck-nephrin complex affects actin polymerization.
[00245]       HEK cells expressing CD16/7-NCD and Robo2 were stimulated with Slit2 or control
conditioned medium without Slit2 while clustered by the anti-CD 16 antibody. Actin polymerization
was evaluated by quantifying the number of HEK cells with visible F-actin tails (Rivera et al., 2004).
We observed that -80% of the CD16/7-NCD clustered cells formed F-actin tails that could be revealed
by phalloidin staining as previously reported (Jones et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2006). Upon Slit2
stimulation, however, the number of cells with F-actin tails was significantly reduced to approximately
                                                     - 60 -

     WO 2013/103811                                                                     PCT/US2013/020280
40% (FIGS. 3A and 3C). Only a few cells were observed to contain shorter F-actin tails when the
control CD 16/7-HA proteins were clustered (FIGS. 3B and 3C). To further investigate whether this
inhibition of actin polymerization required Nck, we repeated this assay using Robo2 without Nck
binding domain (Robo2-ANBD) to determine if blocking of Nck binding to Robo2 would prevent Slit2
Robo2 inhibition on nephrin-induced actin polymerization. CD 1 6/7-NCD was co-expressed with either
full-length Robo2 (FIG. 7A) or Robo2-ANBD (FIG. 7B) in HEK cells. We observed that deletion of
Nck binding domain in Robo2 significantly compromised Slit2- Robo2 inhibition on nephrin-induced
actin polymerization (FIG. 7C).
[00246]      Previous study has shown that nephrin is linked to the F-actin cytoskeleton (Yuan et al.,
2002). To determine if Slit2-Robo2 signaling could inhibit F-actin associated to nephrin, we
immunoprecipitated CD 16/7-NCD and CD16/7-HA with anti-CD16 antibody and examined the
amount of F-actin in the precipitates by Western blot. We observed that the abundance of F-actin
associated with nephrin was significantly reduced upon Slit2 stimulation (FIGS. 3D and 3E).
Conversely, in vivo immunoprecipitation assay showed that F-actin associated with nephrin
immunoprecipitated by an anti-nephrin antibody from Robo2 newborn null mouse kidneys was
significantly increased compared with that from wild type or Robo2 heterozygous mouse kidneys
(FIGS. 3F and 3G). Taken together, these results indicate that Slit2-Robo2 signaling inhibits
nephrin-induced actin polymerization.
Loss of Robo2 in Podocytes Causes Altered Foot Process Structure in Mice
[00247]      We and others have previously shown that almost all Robo2 homozygous null mice in
mixed genetic background die shortly after birth due to a severe CAKUT phenotype (Grieshammer et
al., 2004; Lu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). After breeding mice with a Robo2del5 mutant allele for five
generations onto C57BL/6 genetic background, mating of Robo2de5 '* heterozygous parents revealed
three Robo 2 del5'de5 homozygous null mice that survived to 3 weeks (among a total of 160 mice analyzed
at weaning). To determine if Robo2 was required for podocyte foot process formation during
development, we examined the ultrastructure of glomeruli in Robo2 null mice at birth and 3 weeks of
age. Although the podocyte body, foot processes and slit-diaphragm were formed at birth, transmission
electron microscopy showed focal foot process effacement in newborn Robo 2 de15           de
                                                                                             5
                                                                                               homozygous null
mice (FIGS. 8A-8F). By scanning electron microscopy, we observed irregular interdigitating foot
processes in Robo 2 de5 /de  5
                               homozygous null mice at birth and 3 weeks of age (FIGS. 4A-4H). These
findings indicate that Robo2 is required for normal podocyte foot process patterning during kidney
development.
[00248]      To examine the role of Robo2 in the maintenance of foot process structure in mature
glomeruli, we generated podocyte specific Robo2 knockout mice by crossing conditional Robo2flxflo
mice with Robo2del5 '*;     gNphs 2 -Cre/+heterozygous mice carrying a podocin-Cre transgene. Twenty
podocyte specific Robo2 mutant mice with Robo 2 del5/flox;            2

mice were analyzed up to one year of age. Podocyte specific Robo2 knockout mice were viable and

fertile. However, they displayed unusually broad podocyte foot processes and focal segmental foot
process effacement at one month (FIGS. 41-4M ). At 6 weeks of age the mutant mice developed
significant microalbuminuria, which was detected by both ELISA and Western blot analyses (FIGS.
4N and 40). In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed foot process patterning defects in
Robo2 podocyte specific knockout mice. Instead of orderly zipper-like interdigitating secondary foot
processes in the wild-type, Robo2 podocyte specific knockout mice displayed irregular and
disorganized foot process interdigitation patterning at one month (FIGS. 8G-8J). These defects became
more obvious over time. At seven months of age, overtly disorganized, shorter, and meandering foot
processes were observed in Robo2 podocyte specific knockout mice (FIGS. 8K-8N), which were
similar to the phenotype of three-week old Robo2 null mice. Although Robo2 podocyte specific
knockout mice displayed normal podocyte number, matrix deposition was significantly increased in
glomeruli (FIGS. 80-8T, Tables 1 and 2). These morphological changes indicate that Robo2 plays a
role in regulating and maintain glomerular podocyte foot process structure.
Loss of Robo2 Alleviates the Podocyte StructuralDefect in Nephrin Null Mice
[00249]      Nephrin homozygous mice develop a characteristic phenotype with dilation of the
Bowman's space, abnormally broad foot processes, absence of glomerular slit-diaphragms, and
significant proteinuria (Done et al., 2008; Hamano et al., 2002). Since Robo2 formed a complex with
nephrin, and Slit2-Robo2 signaling inhibited nephrin-induced actin polymerization, we wondered if
loss of Robo2 would modify the podocyte phenotype in nephrin null mice. To test this hypothesis of a
possible genetic interaction between Robo2 and nephrin, we generated both germline Robo2-'-;Nphs1-'
and podocyte-specific Robo 2fl       ;flx;TgNphs2 -Cre/+;Nphs]-'-double Robo2-nephrin knockout mice. Like
Nphs1-'-single homozygote, both Robo2-'-;Nphs1'-(4/4, 100%) and Robo2floxflox; TgNphs 2 -Cre/+ ;Nphs1-l
(3/3, 100%) double knockout mice died within 10 hours after birth. Histological analysis, however,
revealed that the morphology of glomeruli in the Robo2-'-;Nphs1-'- double homozygous mice appeared
relatively normal compared with the phenotype in Nphs1-'- single nephrin homozygous mice, which had
a dilated Bowman's space (FIGS. 8U-8X). The number of glomeruli with dilated Bowman's space was
significantly reduced in Robo2-'-;Nphs1'- double homozygous mice (2/55, 3.6%) compared with
nephrin single null mice (31/122, 25.4%) (FIGS. 8Y and Table 3). In addition, analysis of glomerular
ultrastructure by scanning electron microscopy showed that the interdigitating podocyte foot process
structure was observed in only 1 (6.67%) of 15 glomeruli from nephrin single homozygous mice (FIGS.
4P and 4Q) compared with 100% in Robo2'- single homozygotes (FIGS. 4T and 4U) and wild-type
controls (FIG. 4V and 4W). Remarkably, the interdigitating pattern of the podocyte foot processes was
restored in 12 (75%) of 16 glomeruli from Robo2-'-;Nphs1 double homozygous newborn mouse
kidneys (FIGS. 4R and 4S, Table 4), indicating that a concomitant loss of Robo2 and nephrin
alleviated the podocyte foot process structural phenotype in these mice. These findings indicate that the
Robo2-Nck-nephrin physical interactions described above have a substantial effect on podocyte foot
process morphology in vivo when the levels of expression of Robo2 and nephrin are genetically altered.

[00250]       Podocytes exhibit a remarkable degree of plasticity. During development they differentiate
from simple cuboidal epithelial cells into the elaborate process-bearing cells that we recognize as
mature podocytes (Reeves et al., 1978). This plasticity is retained after maturation. It is seen most
graphically as reversible foot process effacement following experimental surface charge neutralization
with protamine sulfate and restoration with heparin (Seiler et al., 1975) and during relapse and
remission of proteinuria in children with minimal change disease (Nachman et al., 2008). More subtle
changes in foot processes probably occur under physiological conditions in response to positive and
negative signals in the form of hemodynamic, hormonal or paracrine stimuli. Given the abundance of
F-actin in the foot processes, it is likely, without wishing to be bound or limited by theory, that such
stimuli bring about those subtle changes in response to positive and negative signals transduced to the
F-actin cytoskeleton. Too much and unbalanced positive signals may lead to disease phenotype. Indeed,
although a physiological ligand has yet to be identified, it is clear that clustering and phosphorylation of
nephrin induces actin polymerization by recruiting Nck, a mechanism that can be involved in the
proteinuria induced in rats by a nephritogenic monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of
nephrin (Topham et al., 1999) and in cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome that develop anti-nephrin
alloantibodies after renal transplantation (Patrakka et al., 2002).
[00251]       Our studies described herein reveal another level of negative regulation of podocyte actin
polymerization in which Robo2, when bound by Slit, inhibits nephrin-induced actin polymerization.
We propose, without wishing to be bound or limited by theory, that Slit-Robo2 signaling can inhibit
nephrin-induced actin polymerization to maintain normal podocyte foot process structure as follows:
Under physiological conditions (e.g. during foot process development), nephrin engagement leads to
phosphorylation of the intracellular Y1191/1208/1232 to which the Nck SH2 domain binds (Jones et al.,
2006; Verma et al., 2006). Nck in turn recruits cytoskeleton regulators such as N-WASP through its
SH3 domains to promote actin polymerization for podocyte foot-process extension or spreading (FIG.
8Z). Local secretion and binding of Slit increases the interaction of Robo2 with Nck through its proline
rich region and the first two SH3 domains of Nck. Sequestering the first two SH3 domains of Nck by
Robo2 would inhibit nephrin-Nck mediated actin polymerization and decrease F-actin associated with
nephrin to maintain a dynamic and balanced F-actin cytoskeleton and normal podocyte foot process
structure (FIG. 8Z). In addition to direct inhibition of nephrin induced actin polymerization through
Nck, Slit-Robo2 signaling can inactivate actin polymerization through other pathways, such as
recruiting Ena, Abl, srGAPs to negatively regulate F-actin cytoskeleton as previously reported (Bashaw
et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2001). In the absence of Slit2-Robo2 signaling (e.g., when Robo2 is knocked
out), the inhibitory effects of Robo2 on nephrin induced polymerization is lost. The SH3 domains of
Nck are able to interact with downstream cytoskeletal regulators to increase actin polymerization (FIG.
8Z), which can explain the altered podocyte foot process structure identified in Robo2 mutant mice. Our
results described herein thus support a mechanism whereby Slit-Robo signaling can regulate podocyte
plasticity by negatively regulating F-actin cytoskeleton, which is similar to the role of Slit-Robo
                                                     - 63 -

signaling in axon growth cone pathfinding (Guan and Rao, 2003). The pathological finding of increased
matrix deposition in the Robo2 mutant mouse glomeruli likely represents a secondary response.
[00252]       Although it is clear from our studies described herein that Robo2 localizes to the basal
surface of podocytes and forms a complex with other established foot process slit-diaphragm proteins
through its intracellular domain, it remains uncertain if it actually forms part of the slit-diaphragm itself.
Interestingly, the extracellular domain of Robo2 resembles that of nephrin, which has eight
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like motifs and one fibronectin domain whereas Robo2 has five Ig-like motifs and
three fibronectin domains (FIG. 8Z) (Tryggvason et al., 2006). We have tested the interaction between
the intracellular domain of Robo2 and the cytoplasmic domain of nephrin in the yeast two-hybrid assay.
Our biochemical data (FIGS. 2E and 2F) also did not support a direct interaction between these two
receptors in vitro. However, it is possible that the extracellular domain of Robo2 can associate with the
extracellular domain of nephrin in vivo on the cell membranes of adjacent foot processes through a
trans-interaction in the slit-diaphragm.
[00253]       We found that Robo2 homozygous null and podocyte specific knockout mice developed an
altered foot process interdigitating pattern, a phenotype that is different from that of the nephrin null
mice (Hamano et al., 2002; Done, 2008). This is not surprising since nephrin and Robo2 play opposite
roles in regulating podocyte F-actin cytoskeleton. While nephrin signaling induces localized actin
polymerization, Slit2-Robo2 signaling acts as a negative regulator on actin polymerization to maintain
podocyte foot process plasticity and dynamics. It is noteworthy that a similar foot process organization
defect is observed in mice in which the actin-depolymerizing factor Cofilin-1, another negative
regulator of the F-actin cytoskeleton in podocytes, is knocked out (Garg et al., 2010). This indicates that
the absence of either an actin polymerization promoting factor such as nephrin signaling or an
inhibitory factor such as Robo2 signaling will affect the normal structure of podocytes. Thus the
balance between positive and negative F-actin cytoskeleton regulators in podocytes is important to
maintain normal foot process structure. Regaining this balance by knocking out both positive (nephrin)
and negative (Robo2) signals can explain the restoration of podocyte foot process interdigitation and
milder glomerular phenotype in the Robo2-nephrin double knockout mice. Our studies described herein
demonstrate the dual roles of nephrin as an essential component of the slit-diaphragm to control
glomerular permselectivity on the one hand (Tryggvason et al., 2006) and as a regulator of foot process
morphology through its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (Jones et al., 2006; Verma et al., 2006)
on the other. While Robo2 signaling clearly counters the positive signaling effects of nephrin on the
foot processes, it remains to be determined if it also influences slit-diaphragm integrity.
[00254]       Accordingly, as described herein, we have identified Robo2 as a new component of the
podocyte intercellular junction in the kidney. We have demonstrated interactions between Robo2 and
nephrin using biochemical, functional, and genetic techniques and have shown that Slit2-Robo2
signaling inhibits nephrin-induced actin dynamics. Our results indicate that Robo2 signaling acts as a
negative regulator on nephrin to modulate podocyte foot process architecture. This study extends our

                                               EXAMPLES
Tissue in Situ Hybridization, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunogold Electron Microscopy
[00265]      In situ hybridization analysis was performed with digoxigenin-labeled Robo2 riboprobes as
previously described (Grieshammer et al., 2004). Immunohistochemistry was performed on mouse
embryonic kidney tissues fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and in adult mouse kidney tissues fixed in
methanol. For immunogold electron microscopy, wild-type mouse kidneys were dissected and fixed in
paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (PLP). Ultrathin sections of the mouse kidney were prepared and
incubated with goat anti-Robo2 antibody (DAKO Corporation) and a secondary antibody coupled to 10
nm colloidal gold (Ted Pella).

crosslinking of CD 16/7 fusion proteins and the actin polymerization assay were performed as
previously described (Jones et al., 2006; Rivera et al., 2004; Verma et al., 2006).
Knockout Mouse study, Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Kidney Glomerular
Analysis
[00267]      Mouse protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at Boston University Medical Center (#14388). The generation and genotyping of Robo2fl"
conditional allele, Robo2del5 (also called Robo2 interchangeably in this paper) germline mutant allele,
and Robo2* wild-type allele were described previously (Lu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). To generate
Robo2-nephrin double knockout mice, Robo2'-mice were crossed with Nphs]'-mice that were
generated previously (Hamano et al., 2002). For transmission electron microscopy, kidneys were fixed,
incubated in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate, dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded
in Epon, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Ultrathin kidney sections were
examined using a JEM-10 11 electron microscope. For scanning electron microscopy, kidneys were
prepared following the standard protocol. For kidney pathological studies, kidneys were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained using standard Periodic acid-Schiff
(PAS) or eosin hematoxylin (H&E) methods. For quantification of podocyte number, WT1 was used as
a podocyte nuclear marker and immunoperoxidase staining was performed on kidney sections
following the standard protocol. WT1 positive podocyte nuclei in each glomerular cross section were
counted. For proteinuria analysis, "spot" urine specimens from 6 weeks old mice were examined using
a murine albuminuria ELISA quantitation kit (Exocell) according to manufacturer's instruction and
urine dipstick (Multistix, Bayer, IN) as a screening method.
Tissue In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry
[00268]      In situ hybridization analysis was performed with digoxigenin-labeled Robo2 riboprobes as
previously described (Grieshammer et al., 2004). The Robo2 cDNA was linearized with NotI and
probes were generated using the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science).
Hybridization was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde fixed OCT embedded mouse embryonic kidney
frozen sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed on mouse embryonic kidney tissues fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde followed by 30% sucrose cryoprotection (Mugford et al., 2008) and in adult mouse
kidney tissues fixed in methanol. Mouse kidneys embedded in OCT compound were frozen and
sectioned using Cryostat at 8-10 p m. Sections were stained with primary antibodies and followed by an
appropriate FITC or Cy3 conjugated secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used in this study
include the ones against ROBO2 (R&D System, Abnova, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), nephrin (custom
synthesized) (Topham et al., 1999), Nck (Upstate/Millipore), podocin (Sigma), nidogen (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), Pecaml (BD Biosciences), WT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SLIT2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), PDGFR beta (Cell Signaling), Synaptopodin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Images

objective.
Immunogold Electron Microscopy
[00269]       Wild-type mouse kidneys were dissected and fixed in paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate
(PLP) at 4'C overnight. The tissue was washed in 1x PBS and dehydrated in graded ethanol and
embedded in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Ultrathin sections of the mouse kidney
were prepared and transferred to Formvar-coated gold grids, and blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin and 5% normal goat serum in 1x PBS. The sections were then incubated with goat anti-Robo2
antibody with a 1:50 dilution in DAKO (DAKO Corporation) at 4'C overnight. Non-immune serum
was used as a control. After three washes with 1x PBS, sections were incubated with a IgG secondary
antibody coupled to 10 nm colloidal gold (Ted Pella) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were
finally post-fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and contrasted with uranyl acetate. Sections were examined
with a JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 80kV, and images were
acquired using an AMT digital imaging system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA.)
and imported into Adobe Photoshop. Subcellular localization of Robo2 stained with gold particles in
glomeruli was recognized on digital electron micrographs in comparison with control micrographs
stained with non-immune serum.
Yeast Two-Hybrid Assay
[00270]       The DUPLEX-Am yeast two-hybrid system (OriGene Tech, Rockville, MD) was used to
characterize Robo2 and Nckl interaction. The cDNAs encoding the intracellular domain of human
Robo2 and its truncated forms were cloned into the pJG4-5 vector at EcoRIIXhoI sites, fusing them to
the transcription activation domain of B42. The cDNAs of human Nckl and its truncated forms were
cloned into the pEG202 vector at EcoRI/XhoI to fuse them to the DNA binding domain of LexA. The
lacZ gene in the construct pSH18-34 and the LEU2 gene in the EGY48 strain yeast genome were used
as reporter genes. The pEG202, pSH18-34, and pJG4-5 constructs were co-transformed into yeast
EGY48 cells. The interaction was considered positive if the yeast cells turned blue in the presence of
X-gal and grew in the absence of leucine.
Cell Culture, DNA Constructs, Transfection, Co-Precipitation, and Western Blot Analyses
[00271]       HEK (293T) cells were transfected at 60% confluency using calcium phosphate
transfection. To make C-terminal his- and myc- tagged fusion proteins, full-length human nephrin and
Robo2 were cloned into pSecTag B vector (Invitrogen) at Hind III/EcoRl and EcoRlXhol restriction
sites respectively. Robo2-ANBD was obtained by deleting the Nck binding domain (FIG. 2C) using
QUIKCHANGE site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Non-tagged Robo2 and Nckl were cloned into pCS2 vector (Addgene) at EcoRlXhol sites, nephrin at
HindIIIIEcoRl sites. Human Fyn and myc- tagged Slit2 constructs have been reported previously (Li et
al., 2008; Wong et al., 2001). CD16/7-NCD and CD16/7-HA constructs were also reported previously
(Verma et al., 2006). To detect Robo2 and Nckl interaction, C-terminal His- and myc-tagged human

Robo2 or Robo2-ANBD was expressed in HEK cells. Forty-eight hour post-transfection, cells were
lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mM NaH 2PO 4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 0.5% TX100, 1x protease
inhibitor [pH 8.0]). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4'C; supernatants were incubated with
Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at 4'C for 2 hours to precipitate His-Robo2, NTA resin without Ni was used as
a control. The resin was washed three times with washing buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 20
mM Imidazole, 0.5% TX100 [pH 8.0]) and heated at 95'C for 10 min. The precipitates were resolved on
SDS-PAGE gels and blotted with rabbit anti-myc, rabbit monoclonal anti-Nckl (Cell Signaling)
antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution. To examine the triple interaction among Robo2, Nckl, and nephrin,
His-myc-Robo2 or His-myc-Robo2-ANBD were co-expressed in HEK cells with human nephrin and
human Fyn. His-myc-Robo2 was precipitated with Ni-NTA beads as described above. To confirm the
triple interaction, His-myc-nephrin was co-expressed with Robo2, and Fyn in HEK cells and
His-myc-nephrin was pulled-down by Ni-NTA beads. Precipitates were blotted with rabbit polyclonal
anti-myc, rabbit monoclonal anti-Nckl, rabbit polyclonal anti-nephrin, mouse monoclonal anti-Robo2
(R&D systems), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies at a 1:1000
dilution. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, kidneys from newborn mice were
homogenized in the RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 1 mlvi Na 3VO 4 , 1 mlvi NaF, 1x protease inhibitor) on ice. Samples were
centrifuged for 10 min at 4'C and the supernatant was incubated with 1 pg mouse monoclonal
anti-Robo2 antibody (R&D Systems) for 1 hour at 4'C. The control goat IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was used as a control. Samples were then mixed with 30 p l of protein A/G Plus agarose
bead slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and further incubated for 12 hours at 4'C. Beads were then
washed three times in the RIPA buffer and proteins were eluted in 1x protein loading buffer by heating
at 95'C for 10 min. Precipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and blotted with mouse anti-Robo2,
rabbit anti-nephrin, and rabbit anti-Nckl antibodies as described above. Actin was blotted with
anti-beta-actin mouse antibody from Sigma. Intensity of the bands was measured using ImageJ. For
proteinuria detection, mice spot urines were collected and diluted with 1x protein loading buffer at
1:100 dilution. Urine proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and purified albumin was used as
a control (MP Biomedicals). Gels were blotted with rabbit anti-albumin polyclonal antibody (MP
Biomedicals).

previously (Jones et al., 2006; Rivera et al., 2004; Verma et al., 2006). Briefly, CD16/7-NCD or
CD 16/7-HA was co-expressed in HEK cells with Robo2. After 24 hours, cells were transferred and
seeded on glass coverslips coated with polylysine for another 24 hours. Cells were then incubated with
1 pg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-CD16 (Beckman Coulter) for 30 min at 37'C, washed once with
DMEM, incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) diluted in Slit2

paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS. F-actin was stained using FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer's instruction. The newly formed F-actin bundles stick to the clustered
nephrin (CD 16/7-NCD) and look like comet tails (i.e. actin tails in the main text) under fluorescence
microscope. In this experiment, we only analyzed the F-actin bundles formed by clustering of
CD16/7-NCD and attached to the clusters. The cells with F-actin tails were counted and compared to
the total CD16/7-NCD transfected cells. The quantification formula is: Percentage % = (number of
transfected cells with F-actin tails / total number of cells transfected) x 100. Images were obtained using
a LSM510 confocal microscope with a 60x oil immersion objective.

allele and TgNphs2-Cre transgene were used as controls. To generate Robo2-nephrin double knockout mice,
Robo2'-heterozygous mice were crossed with Nphs1*'- heterozygous mice that were generated
previously (Hamano et al., 2002). After the generation of Robo2*';Nphsf1'-double heterozygous mice,
the cross of double heterozygous mice was performed to generate Robo2-'-;Nphs1 double homozygous
mice as well as Nphs1-'- single homozygous, Robo2'- single homozygous, and Robo2*'*;Nphs1'*
wild-type controls. Mouse protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at Boston University Medical Center (#14388).
[00274]        Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy
[00275]        For transmission electron microscopy, kidneys were dissected from Robo2 homozygous
null mice and podocyte specific knockout mice, fixed in PLP at 4 0 C overnight, and then incubated in
2% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate for 6 hours. After washing in 1x PBS, fixed kidneys
were dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in Epon, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate. Ultrathin kidney sections were prepared and examined using a JEM-10 11 electron
microscope. Wild-type littermates were used as controls. For scanning electron microscopy, kidney
samples from Robo2 homozygous null mice, podocyte specific knockout mice, nephrin homozygous
null mice, and Robo2-nephrin double homozygous mice were prepared following the protocol
described previously (Friedman and Ellisman, 1981) with minor modifications. Briefly, the kidney was
perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde solution in 0. 1M cacodylate buffer

(Karnovsky's fixative, Electron Microscopy Sciences), and subsequently fixed in the Karnovsky's
fixative for 24 hrs followed by postfixation in 2% osmium tetraoxide solution (Electron Microscopy
Sciences). Kidney samples were cryofractured, dehydrated and dried using hexamethyldisilazane
(Electron Microscopy Sciences). Kidney samples were imaged using an Amray 1000A and Jeol 6340F
scanning electron microscopes. Three glomeruli from each animal were examined to provide
representative images.
Mice Kidney Pathology Studies, Quantification of Podocyte Number, and ProteinuriaAnalysis
[00276]        For kidney pathological studies, kidneys were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight, and then treated with a graded ethanol series for paraffin embedding. The kidney paraffin
blocks were sectioned at 4 gm using a MT-920 microtome (MICROM) and stained using standard
Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or eosin hematoxylin (H&E) methods. The glomeruli were examined and
assessed for matrix deposition, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and dilatations of the Bowman's space
using an Olympus BHT light microscope equipped with a SPOT digital camera system. For
quantification of podocyte number, WT1 was used as a podocyte nuclear marker and
immunoperoxidase staining was performed on kidney sections following the protocol described
previously (Sanden et al., 2003). Briefly, paraffin embedded kidney sections from 4 one-year old
Robo 2 del/flox;TgNphs 2 -Cre+ podocyte-specific knockout mice and 4 age-matched wild-type control mice
were sectioned at 4 gm and stained with WT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after microwave
antigen retrieval. Biotinylated secondary antibody and Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) were
used to detect WT1 signal. WT1 positive podocyte nuclei in each glomerular cross section were counted
in total 165 glomeruli from four mutant mice and 166 glomeruli from four control mice. For proteinuria
analysis, "spot" urine specimens from 6 weeks old mice were examined using a sensitive murine
albuminuria ELISA quantitation kit (Exocell) according to manufacturer's instruction and urine
dipstick (Multistix from Bayer, IN) as a screening method. Urine albumin was normalized with
creatinine to provide an albumin/creatinine ratio. Creatinine in urine was determined using the
creatinine detection kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instruction. Urine albumin was also
examined by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-albumin antibody (MP Biomedicals). The data
from mutants and controls were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Student t-test, and Chi-square test.
