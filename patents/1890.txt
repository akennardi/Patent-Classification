WAIVIT is a new technology application which will allow people through their device to connect with
each other to share messaging, voice, pictures and videos without having to know someone's email
or telephone number.
This is currently impossible unless the device user has the phone number or email of the user to be
able to make contact through the device.
By waving your device at another device that has the WAIVIT Application will prompt the
opportunity to connect to the user, also WAIVIT can be sent on silent wave with the same result.
For example once connected on WAIVIT the video you capture will appear on the other accepted
WAIVIT Users device - picture two yachts sailing parallel too each other, you receive the vision of
yourself through the application from the other device, additional to this is voice messaging and
pictures.
No current technology application allows this kind of connectivity.
WAIVIT is about removing the barriers between connecting people by forming social communities
within the WAIVIT Application Group.
