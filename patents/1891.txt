ABSTRACT
A floor structure for a truck body of a truck has at least two modules 10. Each
module has a number of spaced apart cross members 12 joined to one or more
longitudinal connecting members 14 and optionally side members 16.            The
modules are connectable to each other and mountable to be supported by a
chassis of the truck. The cross members and/or side members can have a C or U
channel cross section. Each module can have end members 18. Plates 20 can
be used to form floor plates on the modules. Modules can be connected together
by module connecting means 30.            The modules provide repeatability of
construction and efficiency in building a strong vehicle floor. Fixed or openable
handrails 50 can be mounted to the outer sides of the modules. Tie-down bars
60 can be mounted to an underside of one or more modules. A front module can
mount a headboard 40 via mounting/connecting means 42. Ancillary equipment,

A FLOOR STRUCTURE FOR A TRUCK BODY OF A TRUCK
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates to a floor structure for a truck body of a
truck, and a method of assembling a floor structure for a truck body of a truck.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]       There are many types of truck bodies which can be mounted to the
chassis of a truck. Examples of tuck body types include flat bed body, tipper
body, box body, curtain-sider body, temperature-controlled body etc. A truck body
is either fixedly or moveably attached to the chassis of the truck, depending on
the truck body type.
[0003]       A truck body has a floor structure which primarily carries the payload
placed on the truck body. The floor structure has a number of cross members and
longitudinal members welded to each other and to the chassis of the truck. A flat
plate, for example a checker plate, is mounted on the floor structure to provide a
platform in order to place load on the truck body. A truck body optionally has a
side structure extending from the floor and a roof structure.
[0004]       As the floor structure has to carry the payload, it is supported by the
chassis.
[0005]       After receiving customer's specifications for a truck body, the cross
members and the longitudinal members of the floor structure are cut to required
size. The members are placed in position relative to the truck chassis prior to
welding. The welding regions are often located on the underside of the floor
structure. Welding the floor structure is difficult because of lack of flexibility and
difficulty to reach the welding regions. This often results in poor quality welding
and time consuming way of manufacturing floors of truck bodies.

                                             2
[0006]       Welding     of  auxiliaries  such    as   tie-down    bars,    handrails and
headboards, and ancillaries such as toolbox and water tanks, is even more
problematic as this needs to be done after the floor structure is welded.
Furthermore, it is difficult to get uniformity in installation of ancillaries because it is
difficult to maintain the exact spacing and location on a floor structure which is
welded to the chassis.
[0007]       The cross members and longitudinal members are generally standard
available structural members such as C-channel section, I-channel section or box
tubes. With the standard off-the-shelf structural members there is often a
compromise between the strength of the welds and weight of the structure.
[0008]       These difficulties are even greater when constructing truck bodies
according to customer specifications, which is often the case. The speed of
production is slowed, and consequently the number of truck bodies that can be
created, using the same resources, is reduced.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]       It is desirable of the present invention to overcome at least one
problem of the prior art truck bodies.
[0010]       It is further desirable of the present invention to reduce time of
assembling a truck body, particularly of a tuck body made to customer
specifications.
[0011]       It is further desirable of the present invention to reduce the time of
installing a truck body.
[0012]       It is further desirable of the present invention to reduce difficulty of
welding the members of a truck body.

                                            3
[0013]      It is further desirable of the present invention to provide a robust truck
body.
[0014]     With the aforementioned difficulties in mind, an aspect of the present
invention provides a floor structure for a truck body of a truck, the floor structure
including at least two modules, wherein each module includes a plurality of
spaced apart cross members joined to longitudinal connecting member(s), the
modules being connectable to each other and mountable to be supported by a
chassis of the truck.
[0015]     The modules can be stocked to create longer or shorter floor
structures. For example two modules may be connected for creating a short floor
structure, and three or more modules can be connected for creating a longer floor
structure.
[0016]      Importantly, modular floor structure enables welding of the members of
a module off-site that is away from the truck chassis e.g. in a factory premises.
Welding off-site is easier than welding on truck chassis because the welding
assembly can be rotated as per the welder's convenience.
[0017]     The floor structure may be fixedly attached e.g. welded to the chassis
in order to create a flat bed body.         Alternatively, the floor structure may be
hingedly mounted on a chassis to create a tipper body.
[0018]     The      at  least   two   modules    may    be   interchangeable.   Having
interchangeable modules i.e. which can be used one instead of the other, helps in
reducing the stock of modules to create floor structures.
[0019]      Preferably, the at least two modules are identical in construction.
[0020]     At least one of the modules may be substantially square, and wherein
each side of the square module is about 2.5 metres. The inventor has found that

                                          4
2.5 metre squares are ideal sizes as 2.5 metre width is the maximum permissible
truck body width in Australia, and the truck bodies can be created in multiples of
2.5 metres e.g. 5 metre, 7.5 metre, etc. which are also near the standard truck
body lengths.
[0021]      The floor structure may include a module connecting means for
connecting the connecting member(s) of the first module to the connecting
member(s) of the second module. Preferably, the connecting member(s) include
a connecting member attachment means to enable fastening of the connecting
member to the module connecting means. The connection member attachment
means may be provided on both ends of the connecting member(s) which adds to
the interchangability of the module.    Particularly, any one of the two ends of a
module may be used as a front end of the module and the other may be used as
a rear end of the module. Further preferably, the connecting member attachment
means includes a plurality of spaced apart apertures.
[0022]      A headboard mounting means or a back plate mounting means may be
fastenable to the attachment means of the connecting member(s). So, the
attachment means of the connecting member(s) of a module may be used for: (1)
connecting the module to another module, via a module connecting means, if the
attachment means is proximate to the another module, (2) mounting a headboard
if the attachment means is at the front end of the floor structure, (3) mounting the
back plate if the attachment means is at the rear end of the floor structure.
[0023]      At least one of said modules may further include two side members
located on either side of the module, and wherein the ends of the cross members
positioned on a side are retainable in the side member located on the same side.
Each side member may have a base portion, a top portion and a side portion
extending between the base portion and the top portion, wherein the top portion
includes a retainer portion projecting towards the base portion, and wherein the
ends of the cross members include a protrusion which is retainable by the
retainer portion. Alternatively, the ends of the cross-members may have a recess

                                              5
to receive the retainer portion. Further alternatively, the retainer portion may be a
recess in the side member in which the protrusion of the end of the cross member
is retained. Retention of the ends of the cross-members in the side members is
useful.
[0024]      The retainer increases the number of welding locations between the
side members and the cross members in order to increase the strength.
Furthermore, as some of the welds are not exposed, as the retainer portion hides
the weld portions, they are less prone to damage.
[0025]      The retainer portions of the two side members located on opposite
sides of the module may provide a recess for locating a floor plate to be mounted
on the cross members of the module. Locating of the floor plate is made easy by
the recess.
[0026]      The side members of at least one of said modules may include
auxiliary attachment means for mounting auxiliaries such as hand rails and tie
down bars. Preferably, the auxiliary attachment means includes a plurality of
spaced apart apertures. Further preferably, the auxiliary attachment means are
provided on the top portion and the base of the side members, which are
horizontal relative to the floor structure, such that the side portion does not have
any apertures in order to reduce, in use, the likelihood of entangling items in the
side portion of the floor structure.
[0027]      The connecting member(s) and/or the cross members of at least one
of said modules may include ancillary attachment means for mounting ancillaries
such as a ladder assembly, a tool box, a wheel chock, a water tank, a mudguard,
a rear plate and a headboard. The ancillary attachment means may include a
plurality of spaced apart apertures. Preferably, the ancillary attachment means
are provided on the side portions i.e. the portions extending between the base
portion and the top portion of the cross-members and connecting members which
are vertical relative to the floor structure.

                                           6
[0028]      The ladder assembly may be moveable between an operative position
in which a user can step on the ladder to get to an elevated position, and a
stowed position in which the ladder does not exceed the lateral proportions of the
floor structure.
[0029]      The floor structure may include a positioning means for positioning a
first module relative to the second module. Preferably, the positioning means
includes one or more positioning pin(s) protruding from an end of the first module
and one or more corresponding recess(es) in the corresponding end of the
second module. Positioning means helps locate a first module relative to a
second module in order to assist in fastening the module connecting means to the
connecting member attachment means of the two modules.
[0030]      A further aspect of the present invention provides a method of
assembling the floor structure of a truck body of a truck, wherein the floor
structure having at least two modules, each module includes a plurality of spaced
apart cross members joined to longitudinal connecting member(s), including the
step of: connecting at least two modules to each other, and mounting the
modules such that the modules are supported by a chassis of the truck.
[0031]      The method may include the steps of: positioning the first module
relative to the second module using a positioning means, and fastening a
connection means to the connecting member of a first module and the connecting
member of a second module. In order to connect one module to another, the
module connecting       means may be fastened to the connecting             member
attachment means of the first module, then the second module is positioned
relative to the first module using the positioning means, and subsequently the
module connecting means is fastened to the connecting member attachment
means of the second module.
[0032]      The method may include the steps of: attaching a headboard at a front
end of the floor structure and/or a rear plate member(s) to the rear end of the floor

                                         7
structure using respective connecting member attachment means provided on the
connecting member(s) of the modules.
[0033]     The method may include the steps of: installing auxiliaries such as
hand rails and tie-down bars on the sides and/or the rear of the floor structure
using auxiliary attachment means provided on side members of the modules and
the cross members of the module.
[0034]     The method may include the steps of: installing ancillaries such as a
ladder assembly, a tool box, a wheel chock, a water tank, a mudguard, a rear
plate and a headboard, using the ancillary attachment means provided on cross
members and connecting member(s) of the modules.
[0035]     Additional aspects, advantages and features of the present invention
would be made apparent from the drawings and the detailed description of the
preferred embodiments.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0062]     Referring to figures 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2 and 2A, the module 10
includes a plurality of cross members 12 joined to two connecting members 14.
The connecting members 14 are perpendicular to the cross members 12. The
connecting members 14 are joined to the cross members 12 by welding.
[0063]     Cross members:
[0064]     The cross members 12 are spaced apart substantially equidistantly
from each other. The cross members are parallel to each other.              In this
embodiment, there are seven cross members 12.             Each cross member 12
includes a middle portion and two end portions 12.1.       The middle portion of a
cross member 12 is shaped like a C-channel. The end portions 12.1 of a cross
member 12 includes a flat portion and a protrusion 12.2 which protrudes above
middle portion of the cross member 12, see figure 1D.

                                           11
[0065]       In the middle portion of the cross member 12, there are provided
ancillary attachment means 26. These ancillary attachment means 26 on the
cross member include a plurality of apertures on the side portion of the C-shaped
middle portion of the connecting member 12 i.e. the portion of the connecting
member 12 which is vertical relative to the floor structure 100. These apertures 26
are provided in nine groups of four apertures, wherein the groups are spaced
substantially equidistantly from each other.
[0066]      Connecting members:
[0067]      The two connecting members 14, of module 10, are also spaced apart.
The connecting members 14 are parallel to each other. The distance between
the connecting members 14 is such that they can be mounted on and/or
supported by the chassis of a truck (not shown).        Each connecting member 14 is
shaped like a C-channel. The connecting members 14 have two end portions and
a middle portion.      At each end portion of a connecting member 14 there is
provided a connecting member attachment means 15. Connecting member
attachment means 15 includes six apertures provided in two rows of three
apertures.
[0068]      The middle portion of the connecting member 14 also includes spaced
apart apertures which are the ancillary attachment means 26. There are seven
apertures in the ancillary attachment means 26 of a connecting member 14. The
connecting member attachment means 15 and the ancillary attachment means 26
of a connecting member 14 are provided on the side portion of the C-shaped
connecting member 12 i.e. the portion of the connecting member 12 vertical
relative to the floor structure 100.
[0069]      Side members:
[0070]      At each side, left side and right side, of the module 10 there is provided
a side member 16. A side member 16 connects the left/right side open ends of

                                           12
the cross members 14. The side member 16 has a base portion 16.1, a side
portion 16. 2, a top portion 16.3 and a retainer portion 16.4. The base portion
16.1 and the top portion 16.3 are parallel to each other. The side portion 16.2
extends between the base portion 16.1 and the top portion 16. 3 at an outer edge
of the base portion 16.1 and the top portion 16. 3. The base portion 16.1, the side
portion 16. 2 and the top portion 16. 3 form a C-shaped channel. The retainer
portion 16.4 extends from the top portion 16. 3 towards the bottom portion 16.1.
[0071]      Each side member 16 has auxiliary attachment means 24. Auxiliary
attachment means include a plurality of spaced apart apertures on the base
portion 16.1 and/or the top portion 16. 3.       These are the portions that are
horizontal relative to the floor structure 100. There are no apertures on the side
portion 16.2.
[0072]      The sectional shape of the side member 16 is complementary to the
shape of the end 12.1 of the cross-member 12. The cross member 12 can be slid
into position relative to the side member 16. Alternatively, the cross member 12
can be tilted such that the end 12.1 is inserted in the side member 16 and then
tilted back to be in a position in the side member 16 such that the outer edges of
the end 12.1 of the cross-member 12 are adjacent to and surrounded by the
portions of the side member 16.
[0073]      Once the cross member 12 is in position relative to the side member
16, the edges of the end 12.1 including the protrusion 12.2 are welded to the side
member 16. The weld is made at the four edges corresponding to the base
portion 16.1, the side portion 16.2, the top portion 16.3 and the retainer portion
16. 4 of the side member 16. As the end 12.1 of the cross member 12 is retained
in the side member 16, the likelihood of damage/failure of the welded joint is
reduced. This is a stronger and more robust weld than that of a C-channel welded
to an I-channel.

                                         13
[0074]     The side member of the left and right sides are identical in
construction. This feature adds to the interchangability of the modules 10, as any
side of a module 10 can be used as a left side or a right side.
[0075]     End members:
[0076]     At each end, the front end and the rear end, of the module 10 there is
provided an end member 18. The end members 18 connect the front and rear
open ends of the side members 16. Like the cross-members 12, the end
members 18 are supported by the connecting members 12 and are welded to the
side members 16.
[0077]     Each end member 18 has a middle portion and two end portions. The
middle portion of the end member 18 has the same cross-sectional shape as that
of the side member 16. The end portions of the end member 18 resemble the
end portions of the cross-members 12 which can be inserted into the side
members 16 and welded to the side members 16.
[0078]     On the middle portion of each end member 18 there is an auxiliary
attachment means 24. Auxiliary attachment means 24 on the end members 18
include a plurality of spaced apart apertures on the base portion, top portion as
well as the side portion of the end member 18.
[0079]     Positioning:
[0080]     Each end member 18 includes positioning apertures 21 on the side
portion thereof i.e. the portion vertical relative to the floor structure 100. The
positioning apertures 21 of an end member 18 align with those of other end
member 18.     Positioning pins 22 are inserted in the positioning apertures 21 of
one of the two end members 18, preferably the front end member 18. The
positioning apertures 21 of the other end member 18, preferably the rear end
member 18, are kept open.        This feature adds to the interchangability of the

                                          14
modules 10, as any end of a module 10 can be used as a front or a rear end.
The positioning apertures 21 and the positioning pins 22 form the positioning
means.
[0081]       Positioning pins 22 are dowel pins which can be fitted to the
positioning apertures 21 for example by welding. A positioning pin 22 protrudes
from the module 10. The protruding portion of the positioning pin 22 narrows
towards the front end.
[0082]       Each positioning pin 22 has a conical front end, cylindrical mid-portion,
and a rear end larger than the front end and the mid-portion.        The rear end is
cylindrical.    The conical front end is provided for easy insertion into the
corresponding positioning aperture 21.       The cylindrical mid-portion has an
engagement with and protrudes from the positioning aperture 21. The rear end
rests against the side portion of the end member 18 so that the positioning pin 22
does not drop out of the end member 18.
[0083]       When fitted on an end member 18, the protruding mid-portion of the
positioning pin 22 engages with the positioning aperture 21 of the corresponding
module 10.
[0084]       Construction of members:
[0085]       Each of the cross members 12, the connecting members 14, the side
members 16 and the end members 18 are pieces of sheet metal that are cut in
shape and then bent.         The cutting is done by laser cutting method. The
development shape as well as all the apertures (ancillary or auxiliary apertures)
are laser cut in one step.
[0086]       Floor plate:

                                            15
[0087]      The retainer portions 16.4 of the two side members 16 and those of the
two end members 18 together with the top portions of the cross members 12 form
a recess for a floor plate 20 to be positioned on the cross members 12. The floor
plate 20 is readily positioned once placed on the cross members 12 as the edges
of the floor plate 20 butt against the retainer portions 16.4 of the left and right side
members 16 and those of the front and rear end members 18.
[0088]      The edges of the floor plate 20 are welded to the retainer portions 16.4
of the two side members 16 and those of the two end members 18.
[0089]      In this embodiment, there are two checker plates 20 installed adjacent
to each other on a module 10. The floor plate 20 can be any readily available
checker plate cut to size. As the size of the pre-fabricated module 10 is known,
the size of the floor plate 20 would also be known. So, floor plates 20 suitable to
be installed on a module 10 can be stocked to reduce assembly time after
receiving customer's specifications.
[0090]      Modules:
[0091]      Referring to figure 3, there are seen three modules 10, four module
connecting means 30 and a headboard 40. Each module connecting means 30 is
shaped as C-channel. The module connecting means 30 has apertures 32 which
correspond with two of the connecting member attachment means 15 of the
connecting member 18. The apertures of the of a module connecting means 30
are provided on the side portion of the module connecting means 30 i.e. the
portion which is vertical relative to the floor structure 100.
[0092]      The headboard 40 has two headboard connecting means 42 also
shaped as C-channels and having apertures which correspond with one of the
connecting member attachment means 15 of the connecting member 18.

                                          16
[0093]     To attach a first module 10 to a second module 10, two module
connecting means 30 are fastened to the two connecting members 14 of the first
module 10, then the second module 10 is positioned relative to the first module
10 by inserting the positioning pins 22 of the second module 10 into the
positioning apertures 21 of the first module 10, then the two module connecting
means 30 are fastened to the two connecting members 14 of the second module
10.
[0094]      Likewise, the third module 10 can be attached to the second module
10.
[0095]     Attaching multiple modules 10 together forms the floor structure 100 of
the truck body. The floor structure 100 may be assembled on the chassis of the
truck or assembled off site and then placed on the chassis of the truck. The floor
structure 100 may be welded to the chassis of the truck.
[0096]      Each of the three modules 10 is identical in construction such that any
module can be installed at the front, middle and rear of the floor structure. The
modules 10 are interchangeable. The interchangability of the modules 10 is a
result of the modules 10 being connectable to each other without loosing
structural rigidity. Width of each module 10 is identical which further improves
interchangability.
[0097]      Each module 10 is substantially square.      The side of the square is
about 2.5 metre. The width of the module may be slightly less than 2.5 metre,
preferably 2.490 metres.
[0098]      Headboard:
[0099]     At a front end of the floor structure 100, a headboard 40 is attached to
the floor structure 100 by fastening the two headboard connecting means 42 to
the two connecting members of the front module 10. Additionally, the headboard

                                          17
40 may be fastened to the auxiliary attachment means 24 provided on the front
end member 18 of the front module 10.
[00100]     Referring to figure 4, a headboard assembly 40 includes a headboard
frame 44, headboard connecting means 42 fastened to the headboard frame 44
by means of fasteners 90, and mesh 46 which may optionally be attached to the
headboard frame 44.
[00101]     Handrails:
[00102]     Referring to figures 5A, 5B, 6 and 6A, two types of hand rails 50, 52
are provided. The hand rails 50 are fixed type which includes two vertical posts
joined by a multiplicity of horizontal members. The openable handrails 52 include
two posts and a door being hingedly attached to one post and latchable at the
other post.    The post of openable handrail 52 having latching means has an
attachment means for it to be secured to the post of a subsequent handrail 50.
The distance between the two posts of the fixed type handrail 50 is equal to the
distance between the two posts of the openable type handrail 52. This is the
distance of the auxiliary apertures 24 are pre-cut in the side members 16 of the
modules 10 as well as the auxiliary apertures 24 of the end members 18 of the
modules 10.
[00103]     Therefore, when assembling the handrails 50, 52 the user can decide
the location(s) where the fixed type handrails 50 and the openable type handrails
52 are installed on the floor structure 100. In other words, the fixed type handrails
50 and the openable type handrails 52 are interchangeable.
[00104]     Tie-down bars:
[00105]     Referring to figures 7 and 8, tie-down bars 60 with side marker light 62
are installed on the underside of the side members 16. In the prior art, the tie
down bars were welded to the side members attached to the chassis, being at an

                                           18
awkward welding position, the ease of weld was low and the time required for
installing was high. Whereas, the proposed tie down bars 60 are welded to a U
bend member off-site, therefore the ease of weld is much higher. The U-bend
member is inserted over the base portion 16.1 of the side member 16, and
fasteners 90 are employed to secure the tie-down bar 60 to the side member 16
through auxiliary apertures 24. Therefore, the time required to install the tie-down
bar 60, after receiving customer's specifications, is reduced.
[00106]     The same fasteners 90 used for attaching the tie-down bar 60 to the
module 10, may be used to attach a side marker light 62 to the underside of the
tie-down bar 60. Multiple tie-down bars are installed at desired locations using the
pre-cut auxiliary apertures 24.
[00107]     Rear attachments:
[00108]     Referring to figures 9A, 9B, 9C and 10, rear light plates 64 for installing
rear lights, back plate 68 for installing vehicle registration number plate and rear
tie-down bars 66 are installed on an end member 18 of a module 10 at the rear of
the floor structure 100.
[00109]     The rear light plates 64 and rear tie-down bars 66 are fastened to the
auxiliary apertures 24 provided on the end member 18 using fasteners 90.
[00110]     The protruding channels of the back plate 68 are fastened to the
connecting members 18 via the connecting member attachment means 15.
[00111]     Note: Firstly, the auxiliary apertures 24 on the front end member 18 of
the front module 10 are used to securely fasten the headboard, whereas the
auxiliary apertures 24 of the rear end member 18 of the read module 10 are used
to securely fasten the rear attachments 64, 66, 68.         Secondly, the connecting
member attachment means 15 may be used to fasten the module connecting
means 30, the headboard connecting means 42, or the rear back plate 68.

                                             19
Thereby, any module 10 can be installed at the front or the rear of the floor
structure 100, and any end of the module 10 can be used as the front end or the
rear end.
[00112]     Ancillaries:
[00113]     Referring to figures 11 to 18, ancillaries such as mudguard assembly
70, water tank 72, tool box 74 and ladder assembly 80 are attached to a desired
location on the underside of the floor structure 100 by means of fasteners 90
using the ancillary apertures 26 provided on the cross members 12 and the
connecting members 14 of the modules 10 of the floor structure 100. By providing
attachment plates having apertures matching to the groups of ancillary apertures
26, to the ancillaries 70, 72, 74, 80, it is easy to simply fasten them at any desired
location.
[00114]     Furthermore, if the user has to change location of an already installed
ancillary, then the user has to simply unfasten the ancillary, change location and
refasten the ancillary at the new location. This is possible because ancillary
apertures 24 on a cross member 12 have the same pattern as those on another
cross member 12, and ancillary apertures 24 on a connecting member 14 have
the same pattern as those on another connecting member 14.
[00115]     Moreover, as the mudguards 70 can be located at many different
locations on the underside of the floor structure 100, the same floor structure 100
can be used for trucks having one rear wheel or multiple rear wheels on a side of
the truck.
[00116]     Ladder assembly:
[00117]     Referring to figures 17A and 17B, the ladder assembly 80 includes a
ladder 82 pivotable and slideable relative to an openable enclosure 84, the
openable enclosure 84 having two sides, a floor, a back and a door which may be

                                          20
latched to the enclosure 84, two rack members 86 fixedly attached to the floor of
the enclosure 84, and two pinion members 88 attached to the ladder 82 which
engage with the two rack members.
[00118]      In the closed position, seen in figure 17A, the ladder 82 is completely
inside the enclosure 84 and the door of the enclosure 84 is shut. To bring the
ladder 82 to the operable position where a person can climb it, as seen in figure
17B, the door of the enclosure 84 is opened, then the ladder 82 is pulled
outwards. This pulling action results in a combined sliding motion and a pivoting
motion. The ladder 82 moves out as a protrusion from the ladder 82 slides in the
horizontal slot 89, and the pinions 88 cause rotation as they are forced to rotate
relative to the fixed rack 86.
[00119]     A stop is provided to prevent the ladder 82 from rotating beyond a
point where its steps are horizontal.     The ladder 82 in the open configuration,
seen in figure 17B, is completely outside the enclosure 84 and its steps are
horizontal.
[00120]      Fire extinguisher holder:
[00121]      Referring to figures 19 and 20, a fire extinguisher holder 48 may be
attached to the headboard frame 44 by means of fasteners 90.                The fire
extinguished holder 48 is located on a side of the headboard opposite to the
where the floor structure 100 is located relative to the head board 40.
[00122]     Complete assembly:
[00123]      Referring to figures 21 and 22, there is seen a floor structure 100
formed by attaching multiple modules together, and all other auxiliary and
ancillary components are fitted on to the floor structure 100.

                                          21
[00124]     The end result may appear to be like a truck body that is created on
site by welding the sections to the chassis, as described in the background
section prior art. However, as the welds of a module 10 are made separately in a
factory controlled environment, the ease of welding is much greater and the time
required is a lot less than conventional truck platforms.        Furthermore, as the
ancillaries and auxiliaries are bolted on to the floor structure 100, their location is
easily changed relative to the floor structure 100, and they are easy to remove or
replace. Importantly, the time taken to assemble the floor structure 100 and install
the ancillaries and auxiliaries, according to the present invention, after receiving
customer specifications, is substantially less.
ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[00125]     The number of modules 10 assembled to form a floor structure 100
can be varied depending on the required length of the floor structure 100 of the
truck body. The modules 10 can be provided in varying lengths to provide even
more variations in the length of floor structure 100 the truck body. For example,
some modules 10 may be 1.25 metre in length and some other modules 10 may
be 2.5 metres in length or longer.
[00126]     The width of the modules 10 would need to be constant in order to
create a standard rectangular truck bodies. As per Australian laws, the maximum
width of the truck body is 2.5 metres. The width of each module may be 2.5
metres or slightly less such as 2.49 metres.
[00127]     For certain special applications, for example truck bodies for carrying
oversize items, modules 10 having different widths may be provided in order to
provide support over a larger area. One of the modules, where the oversized item
will need support may be greater than 2.5 metres.
[00128]     Although the current invention has been described comprehensively, in
considerable details to cover the possible aspects and embodiments, those

                                       22
skilled in the art would recognize that other versions of the invention are also
possible.
