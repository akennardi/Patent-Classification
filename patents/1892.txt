                                                       ABSTRACT
               A material that includes at least one layer made of an auxetic structure and
               articles of footwear having soles comprising the materials. When the material is
               under tension, it expands in both the direction under tension and in the
               directional orthogonal to the direction under tension. The articles of footwear
               have soles that have at least one layer made of a material that has a pattern of
               geometrical patterns with polygonal apertures. The geometrical patterns have
               hinged polygons that rotate with respect to each other when the sole is under
               lateral or longitudinal tension, thus increasing the lateral and longitudinal
               dimensions of the sole.

                [0001]             The disclosure of the complete specification of Australian Patent
Application No. 2014321752 as originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                               BACKGROUND
                [0002]             Articles of footwear typically have at least two major components, an
upper that provides the enclosure for receiving the wearer's foot, and a sole secured to
the upper that is the primary contact to the ground or playing surface. The footwear
may also use some type of fastening system, for example, laces or straps or a
combination of both, to secure the footwear around the wearer's foot. The sole may
comprise three layers - an inner sole, a midsole and an outer sole. The outer sole is
the primary contact to the ground or the playing surface. It generally carries a tread
pattern and/or cleats or spikes or other protuberances that provide the wearer of the
footwear with improved traction suitable to the particular athletic, work or recreational
activity, or to a particular ground surface.
                                                             SUMMARY
                [0003]             As used herein, the term "auxetic structure" generally refers to a
structure that, when it is placed under tension in a first direction, increases its
dimensions in a direction that is orthogonal to the first direction. For example, if the
structure can be described as having a length, a width and a thickness, then when the
structure is under tension longitudinally, it increases in width. In certain of the
embodiments, the auxetic structures are bi-directional such that they increase in length
and width when stretched longitudinally and in width and length when stretched
laterally, but do not increase in thickness. Such auxetic structures are characterized by

                                                              -2
having a negative Poisson's ratio. Also, although such structures will generally have at
least a monotonic relationship between the applied tension and the increase in the
dimension orthogonal to the direction of the tension, that relationship need not be
proportional or linear, and in general need only increase in response to increased
tension.
                [0004]             The article of footwear includes an upper and a sole. The sole may
include an inner sole, a midsole and an outer sole. The sole includes at least one layer
made of an auxetic structure. This layer can be referred to as an "auxetic layer." When
the person wearing the footwear engages in an activity, such as running, turning,
leaping or accelerating, that puts the auxetic layer under increased longitudinal or lateral
tension, the auxetic layer increases its length and width and thus provides improved
traction, as well as absorbing some of the impact with the playing surface. Although the
descriptions below only discuss a limited number of types of footwear, embodiments
can be adapted for many sport and recreational activities, including tennis and other
racquet sports, walking, jogging, running, hiking, handball, training, running or walking
on a treadmill, as well as team sports such as basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, field
hockey and soccer.
                [0005]              In one aspect, an article of footwear includes an upper and a sole
structure. The sole structure includes an outsole, where the sole structure has a first
direction that is tangential to an outer surface of the outsole and the sole structure has a
second direction that is orthogonal to the first direction, where the second direction is
also tangential to the outer surface of the outsole. The sole structure further includes a
plurality of apertures arranged in geometric patterns. Tensioning the sole structure in
the first direction causes the outsole to expand in both the first direction and the second
direction.
                [0006]              In another aspect, a sole structure for an article of footwear includes an
outsole having a structure comprised of a pattern of hexagonal patterns. The outsole
defines a plane. The hexagonal patterns comprise polygonal apertures surrounded by
triangular portions joined to each other by joints that function as hinges allowing the

triangular portions to rotate with respect to each other. When the outsole is under
tension in a first direction, the outsole expands in both the first direction and in a second
direction that is orthogonal to the first direction and is in the plane of the sole structure.
                [0007]              In another aspect, an article of footwear includes an upper and a sole
structure, where the sole structure comprises an outsole, the outsole being
characterized by having polygonal portions surrounding polygonal apertures. The
polygonal portions are hingedly joined to adjoining polygonal portions such that a
plurality of the polygonal portions rotate with respect to each other when the sole
structure is under tension. When a portion of the outsole is under longitudinal tension it
expands in both the longitudinal direction and the lateral direction and when the portion
of the outsole is under lateral tension it expands in both the lateral direction and the
longitudinal direction.
                [0008]              In another aspect, an article of footwear includes an outsole that
includes a pattern of polygonal apertures formed by triangular portions surrounding the
polygonal apertures. The polygonal apertures have a center. The triangular portions
are joined at their vertices such that they function as hinges thereby allowing the
triangles to rotate with respect to each other. The outsole is characterized by having a
lateral direction, a longitudinal direction and a vertical direction. When a portion of the
outsole is under lateral tension, it expands in both the lateral direction and the
longitudinal direction, and when a portion of the outsole is under longitudinal tension it
expands in both the longitudinal direction and the lateral direction. When a portion of
the outsole is under vertical compression, the triangular portions are forced towards the
center of the polygonal apertures.
                [0009]              In another aspect, an auxetic structure includes a pattern of polygonal
apertures characterized by having at least three reentrant sides and having a center.
The auxetic structure has a longitudinal direction and a lateral direction and a thickness.
Under longitudinal tension the auxetic structure expands in both the longitudinal
direction and the lateral direction. Under lateral tension the auxetic structure expands in

both the lateral and longitudinal directions. Under vertical compression the polygonal
apertures collapse towards their centers.
                [0010]              In another aspect, a sheet of material has a longitudinal direction, a
lateral direction and a vertical direction. The sheet of material also include a pattern of
hexagonal structures having apertures surrounded by triangular portions, where each
triangular portion is joined to an adjoining triangular portion by a flexible joint such that
the triangular portions can rotate with respect to each other. When the sheet of material
is under tension in the longitudinal direction it expands in both the longitudinal direction
and the lateral direction.
                [0011]              In another aspect, a composite auxetic material includes a first layer of
relatively hard material comprising a pattern of polygonal apertures surrounded by
polygonal portions, where each polygonal portion is joined to an adjoining polygonal
feature by a flexible joint such that the polygonal portions may rotate with respect to
each other when the first layer is under tension. The material further includes a second
layer of relatively resilient material attached to the first layer, where the second layer
has the same pattern of polygonal apertures as the first layer and wherein the pattern of
polygonal apertures in the second layer is aligned with the pattern of polygonal
apertures in the first layer. When the composite auxetic material is under tension in a
first direction, it expands in both the first direction and in a second direction that is
orthogonal to the first direction.

polygonal features to rotate as the sole is placed under tension. This action allows the
portion of the sole under tension to expand both in the direction under tension and in the
direction in the plane of the sole that is orthogonal to the direction under tension. Thus,
these apertures and polygonal features form an auxetic structure for outsole 120, which
is described in further detail below.
                [0067]             As shown in FIG. 2, outsole 120 comprises an approximately flat
surface that includes a plurality of apertures 131, also referred to simply as apertures
131 hereafter. As an example, an enlarged view first aperture 139 of apertures 131 is
shown schematically within FIG. 2. First aperture 139 is further depicted as having a
first portion 141, a second portion 142, and a third portion 143. Each of these portions
is joined together at a central portion 144. Similarly, in some embodiments, each of the
remaining apertures in apertures 131 may include three portions that are joined
together, and extend outwardly from, a central portion.
                [0068]             Generally, each aperture in plurality of apertures 131 may have any
kind of geometry. In some embodiments, an aperture may have a polygonal geometry,
including a convex and/or concave polygonal geometry. In such cases, an aperture
may be characterized as comprising a particular number of vertices and edges (or
sides). In an exemplary embodiment, apertures 131 may be characterized as having
six sides and six vertices. For example, aperture 139 is shown as having first side 151,
second side 152, third side 153, fourth side 154, fifth side 155 and sixth side 156.
Additionally, aperture 139 is shown as having a first vertex 161, second vertex 162, third
vertex 163, fourth vertex 164, fifth vertex 165 and sixth vertex 166.
                [0069]              In one embodiment, the shape of aperture 139 (and correspondingly of
one or more of apertures 131) may be characterized as a regular polygon, which is both
cyclic and equilateral. In some embodiments, the geometry of aperture 139 can be
characterized as triangles with sides that, instead of being straight, have an inwardly
pointing vertex at the midpoint of the side. The reentrant angle formed at these
inwardly-pointing vertices can range from 1800 (when the side is perfectly straight) to,
for example, 120* or less.

               [0070]              Other geometries are also possible, including a variety of polygonal
and/or curved geometries. Exemplary polygonal shapes that may be used with one or
more of apertures 131 include, but are not limited to: regular polygonal shapes (e.g.,
triangular, rectangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, etc.) as well as irregular polygonal
shapes or non-polygonal shapes. Other geometries could be described as being
quadrilateral, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, octagonal or other polygonal shapes
with reentrant sides.
               [0071]              In the exemplary embodiment, the vertices of an aperture (e.g.,
aperture 139) may correspond to interior angles that are less than 180 degrees or
interior angles that are greater than 180 degrees. For example, with respect to aperture
139, first vertex 161, third vertex 163 and fifth vertex 165 may correspond to interior
angles that are less than 180 degrees. In this particular example, each of first vertex
161, third vertex 163 and fifth vertex 165 has an interior angle Al that is less than 180
degrees. In other words, aperture 139 may have a locally convex geometry at each of
these vertices (relative to the outer side of aperture 139). In contrast, second vertex
162, fourth vertex 164 and sixth vertex 166 may correspond to interior angles that are
greater than 180 degrees. In other words, aperture 139 may have a locally concave
geometry at each of these vertices (relative to the outer side of aperture 139). In this
particular example, each of second vertex 162, fourth vertex 164 and sixth vertex 166
may correspond to interior angles that are greater than 180 degrees.
               [0072]              Although the embodiments depict apertures having approximately
polygonal geometries, including approximately point-like vertices at which adjoining
sides or edges connect, in other embodiments some or all of an aperture could be non
polygonal. In particular, in some cases, the outer edges or sides of some or all of an
aperture may not be joined at vertices, but may be continuously curved. Moreover,
some embodiments can include apertures having a geometry that includes both straight
edges connected via vertices as well as curved or non-linear edges without any points
or vertices.

               [0073]              In some embodiments, apertures 131 may be arranged in a regular
pattern on outsole 120. In some embodiments, apertures 131 may be arranged such
that each vertex of an aperture is disposed near the vertex of another aperture (e.g., an
adjacent or nearby aperture). More specifically, in some cases, apertures 131 may be
arranged such that every vertex that has an interior angle less than 180 degrees is
disposed near a vertex that has an interior angle greater than 180 degrees. As one
example, first vertex 161 of aperture 139 is disposed near, or adjacent to, a vertex 191
of another aperture 190. Here, vertex 191 is seen to have an interior angle that is
greater than 180 degrees, while first vertex 161 has an interior angle that is less than
180 degrees. Similarly, second vertex 162 of aperture 139 is disposed near, or
adjacent to, a vertex 193 of another aperture 192. Here, vertex 193 is seen to have an
interior angle that is less than 180 degrees, while second vertex 162 has an interior
angle that is greater than 180 degrees.
               [0074]              The configuration resulting from the above arrangement may be seen
to divide sole structure 120 into smaller geometric portions, whose boundaries are
defined by the edges of apertures 131. In some embodiments, these geometric
portions may be comprised of polygonal portions. For example, in the exemplary
embodiment, apertures 131 are arranged in a manner that defines a plurality of
polygonal portions 200, also referred to hereafter simply as polygonal portions 200.
               [0075]              Generally, the geometry of polygonal portions 200 may be defined by
the geometry of apertures 131 as well as their arrangement on outsole 120. In the
exemplary configuration, apertures 131 are shaped and arranged to define a plurality of
approximately triangular portions, with boundaries defined by edges of adjacent
apertures. Of course, in other embodiments polygonal portions could have any other
shape, including rectangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, as well as possibly other kinds of
regular and irregular polygonal shapes. Furthermore, it will be understood that in other
embodiments, apertures may be arranged on an outsole to define geometric portions
that are not necessarily polygonal (e.g., comprised of approximately straight edges
joined at vertices). The shapes of geometric portions in other embodiments could vary

                                                            - 13
and could include various rounded, curved, contoured, wavy, nonlinear as well as any
other kinds of shapes or shape characteristics.
               [0076]              As seen in FIG. 2, polygonal portions 200 may be arranged in regular
geometric patterns around each aperture. For example, aperture 139 is seen to be
associated with first polygonal portion 201, second polygonal portion 202, third
polygonal portion 203, fourth polygonal portion 204, fifth polygonal portion 205 and sixth
polygonal portion 206. Moreover, the approximately even arrangement of these
polygonal portions around aperture 139 forms an approximately hexagonal shape that
surrounds aperture 139.
               [0077]              In some embodiments, the various vertices of an aperture may function
as a hinge. In particular, in some embodiments, adjacent portions of material, including
one or more geometric portions (e.g., polygonal portions), may rotate about a hinge
portion associated with a vertex of the aperture. As one example, each vertex of
aperture 139 is associated with a corresponding hinge portion, which joins adjacent
polygonal portions in a rotatable manner.
               [0078]              In the exemplary embodiment, aperture 139 includes hinge portion 210
(see FIG. 3), which is associated with vertex 161. Hinge portion 210 is comprised of a
relatively small portion of material adjoining first polygonal portion 201 and sixth
polygonal portion 206. As discussed in further detail below, first polygonal portion 201
and sixth polygonal portion 206 may rotate with respect to one another at hinge portion
210. In a similar manner, each of the remaining vertices of aperture 139 are associated
with similar hinge portions that join adjacent polygonal portions in a rotatable manner.
               [0079]              FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic sequence of configurations for a portion
of outsole 120 under a tensioning force applied along a single axis or direction.
Specifically, FIG. 3 is intended to illustrate how the geometric arrangements of
apertures 131 and polygonal portions 200 provide auxetic properties to outsole 120,
thereby allowing portions of outsole 120 to expand in both the direction of applied
tension and a direction perpendicular to the direction of applied tension.

H:\ej\lnterove\NRPortb\DCC\EJL\15808935_1.doc-1/11/2017
                                                             - 14
                [0080]             As shown in FIG. 3, a portion 230 of outsole 200 proceeds through
various intermediate configurations as a result of an applied tension in a single linear
direction (for example, the longitudinal direction). In particular, the four intermediate
configurations may be associated with increasing levels of tension that is applied along
a single direction.
                [0081]             Due to the specific geometric configuration for polygonal portions 200
and their attachment via hinge portions, this linear tension is transformed into rotation of
adjacent polygonal portions 200. For example, first polygonal portion 201 and sixth
polygonal portion 206 are rotated at hinge portion 210. All of the remaining polygonal
portions 200 are likewise rotated as apertures 131 expand. Thus, the relative spacing
between adjacent polygonal portions 200 increases. For example, as seen clearly in
FIG. 3, the relative spacing between first polygonal portion 201 and sixth polygonal
portion 206 (and thus the size of first portion 141 of aperture 131) increases with
increased tension.
                [0082]             As the increase in relative spacing occurs in all directions (due to the
symmetry of the original geometric pattern of apertures), this results the expansion of
portion 230 along a first direction as well as along a second direction orthogonal to the
first direction. For example, in the exemplary embodiment, in the initial or non
tensioned configuration (seen on the left in FIG. 3), portion 230 initially has an initial size
D1 along a first linear direction (e.g., the longitudinal direction) and an initial size D2 a
second linear direction that is orthogonal to the first direction (e.g., the lateral direction).
In the fully expanded configuration (seen on the right in FIG. 3), portion 230 has an
increased size D3 in the first direction and an increased size D4 in the second direction.
Thus, it is clear that the expansion of portion 230 is not limited to expansion in the
tensioning direction. Moreover, in some embodiments, the amount of expansion (e.g.,
the ratio of the final size to the initial size) may be approximately similar between the
first direction and the second direction. In other words, in some cases, portion 230 may
expand by the same relative amount in, for example, both the longitudinal direction and

the lateral direction. In contrast, some other kinds of structures and/or materials may
contract in directions orthogonal to the direction of applied tension.
                [0083]              In the exemplary embodiments shown in the figures, an auxetic
structure, including an outsole comprised of an auxetic structure may be tensioned in
the longitudinal direction or the lateral direction. However, the arrangement discussed
here for auxetic structures comprised of apertures surrounded by geometric portions
provides a structure that can expand along any first direction along which tension is
applied, as well as along a second direction that is orthogonal to the first direction.
Moreover, it should be understood that the directions of expansion, namely the first
direction and the second direction, may generally be tangential to a surface of the
auxetic structure. In particular, the auxetic structures discussed here may generally not
expand substantially in a vertical direction that is associated with a thickness of the
auxetic structure.
                [0084]             FIG. 4 is a top view of the side of outsole 320 that is not in contact with
the ground. FIG. 5 is a bottom view of the outsole of FIG. 4. Thus FIG. 5 is a view of
the side of outsole 320 that is in direct contact with the ground. Outsole 320 has a heel
region 331, a midfoot or instep region 332 and a forefoot region 333. In some
embodiments, outsole 320 may be comprised of an auxetic structure. As shown in
these figures, outsole 320 bears a pattern of apertures 321 formed by a pattern of
triangular portions 322 that are joined at each of their vertices 323 to the vertices of
adjoining triangles. The combination of six triangles 322 (depicted in dashed lines in the
blow-out in FIG. 5) around each of the apertures 321 forms hexagonal patterns 324
(depicted in dash-dot lines in FIG. 5) as shown in FIG. 5.
                [0085]             As shown in FIG. 5, the hexagonal patterns vary in size and shape
over the length and width of the outsole. For example, the size of the hexagonal
patterns is largest in the center 334 of the heel region 331 and smallest at the instep
region 337. For example, the distance from one vertex of an aperture to an adjoining
vertex of that aperture may be twice as great in the center of the heel region than at the
instep region of the sole. At the heel, in an exemplary embodiment, the reentrant angle

H:\ejl\lnteove\NRPortb\DCC\EJL\15808935_1.doc-1/11/2017
                                                            - 16
for the side of the triangle that is generally oriented laterally is quite shallow at about
150* to 170*, for example at 160*, whereas at the forefoot, that reentrant angle is much
sharper, at about 1100 to 130*, for example at 120*. More generally, the reentrant
angles may range from 100* to 170*. With this geometry, the auxetic structure at the
heel expands in width under longitudinal tension to a greater degree than it expands in
length when under lateral tension. At the forefoot, the reentrant angles do not differ as
much, so that the expansion in width under longitudinal tension at the forefoot is not that
much greater than the expansion in length under lateral tension.
                [0086]              In the example shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the geometrical patterns form
through-hole apertures 321, such that apertures 321 form holes all the way through the
outsole 320. However, in other embodiments, outsole 320 need not include through
hole apertures. Instead, outsole 320 may include blind holes such that there is a thin
continuous layer of material at the top or at the bottom of the outsole. In yet other
embodiments, the geometrical patterns may form through-holes in certain portions of
the outsole and blind holes in other portions of the outsole.
                [0087]             FIGS. 6 is an enlarged views of the heel region 331, the midfoot region
332 and the forefoot region 333, respectively, of the outsole shown in FIG. 5 when the
outsole is not under tension. FIG. 6 shows that the hexagonal patterns formed by the
combination of hinged triangles forming the apertures in the central portion 334 of heel
region 331 are larger than the hexagonal patterns towards the lateral side 335 or the
medial side 336 of heel region 331. For example, hexagonal pattern 351, which is
disposed in central portion 334, may be larger than hexagonal pattern 353, which is
disposed on medial side 336 of heel region 331. If the heel strikes the ground or
playing surface in the direction that is normal to the ground, triangular portions 322 in
central portion 334 of the heel move towards the center of the hexagonal pattern 351.
This increases the density of the structure directly under the heel, and helps cushion the
impact of the heel striking the ground.
                [0088]              In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, the hexagonal patterns in the
central portion 334 of the heel may be approximately symmetric with respect to a

H:\ej\lnterove\NRPortb\DCC\EJL\15808935_1.doc-1/11/2017
                                                              - 17
longitudinal axis that bisects the apertures 321 at the center of the hexagonal patterns.
For example, aperture 342 is approximately symmetric with respect to axis 390 that
bisects aperture 342. The features in the adjoining columns of apertures on either side
of the central portion 334 of the heel, however, are not symmetric. For example,
aperture 343 on the medial side of the heel has a longer inwardly-directed portion 391
than an outwardly-directed portion 392. Aperture 341 on the lateral side of the heel also
has a similar geometry, with an inwardly directed portion that is longer than an
outwardly directed portion of aperture 341. This geometry maximizes the ability of the
central region to compress and attenuate impact forces when the heel strikes the
ground or playing surface. In some embodiments, the dimensions of the features on the
lateral side 335 of the heel and on the medial side 336 of the heel are significantly
smaller (for example, two-thirds the size or smaller) than the dimensions of the features
at the center of the heel. The smaller dimensions of the hexagonal patterns on the
lateral and medial sides of the heel allow the heel to maintain its curved shape around
the upwardly curving contour of the heel, and maximizes the flexibility of the medial and
lateral sides of the heel.
                [0089]             FIG. 7 is a cross-section taken at heel portion 331 shown in FIG. 6,
showing an example of the construction of the footwear. In this example, the heel has
three layers - an outsole layer 320, a midsole layer 340 and an insole layer 350. In
some embodiments, outsole layer 320 is made of a relatively hard, abrasion resistant
material, whereas midsole layer 340 and insole layer 350 are made of relatively resilient
materials so as to provide a comfortable article of footwear. FIG. 7 also shows
apertures 321 through outsole layer 320 and midsole layer 340.
                [0090]              FIGS. 8-9 illustrates the auxetic characteristics of heel region 331 of
outsole 320 as, for example, the wearer lands on the heel of the footwear. Under
longitudinal tension, heel region 331 increases in length. However, because of the
construction of outsole 320 as a pattern of hinged triangles joined at their vertices, heel
region 331 increases in its lateral dimension as well (e.g., its width). For purposes of
illustration, the initial size of heel region 331 prior to applying tension is indicated by line

371. This may help improve the traction between the heel and the playing surface for
various reasons. For example, because the ground-contacting surface is spread over a
somewhat larger area, this increases the likelihood that at least part of the heel will be in
contact with a non-slippery playing surface when the heel hits the ground. Additionally,
the openings between triangles allow the triangles to expand, increasing the area of
contact with the ground. Furthermore, the impact opens the inner edges of the
triangular star-shaped apertures so as to increase the engagement of the edges with
the playing surface.
                [0091]              FIG. 10 is another view of the heel region shown in FIG. 8. In this
case, the heel region 331 has undergone lateral tension. For that reason, the triangles
have rotated and the dimensions of the heel region 331 have increase longitudinally as
well as laterally. The dashed line 373 shows an outline of heel region 331 when it is not
under tension. This configuration provides further improvements in traction when a
wearer cuts sharply or pushes off to one side or the other.
                [0092]              FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram of a sole showing apertures 321,
formed by a pattern of triangular portions 322 that are joined to each other at their
vertices 323. In some embodiments, apertures 321 may be characterized as triangular
star-shaped apertures, due to the presence of three star-like arms extending from a
central region. However, as previously discussed, apertures 321 are not limited to
particular geometry, and could have any polygonal or non-polygonal geometry in other
embodiments.
                [0093]             As noted above, the joints at the vertices function as hinges, allowing
triangular portions 322 to rotate with respect to each other as the sole comes under
tension. Area 901 and area 902, denoted by the dashed circles, are identified in FIG.
11 for further discussion with respect to FIGS. 12-14.
                [0094]             FIG. 12 is an expanded view of the area identified as 901 in FIG. 11,
when the forefoot is under lateral tension. As shown in FIG. 12, when the forefoot is
under lateral tension, for example when the wearer is pushing off to the side, the
outsole at the forefoot increases in dimension longitudinally as well as laterally, thus

improving traction with the ground or playing surface. FIG. 13 is another expanded view
of the area identified as 901 in FIG. 11, in this case illustrating the configuration of the
sole when it is under longitudinal tension, for example when the wearer is pushing off
from his or her forefoot. FIG. 13 shows that when the forefoot is under longitudinal
tension, the outsole increases its lateral dimension as well as it longitudinal dimension.
                [0095]              FIG. 14 is an expanded view of the area identified as 902 in FIG. 11
when the midfoot of the sole is under moderate longitudinal tension, for example when
the contact with the ground is transitioning from the heel to the forefoot. As shown in
FIG. 14, when the midfoot of the sole is under longitudinal tension, it increases in its
lateral dimension as well as in its longitudinal direction. FIG. 15 shows the midfoot
when it is under even greater longitudinal tension, showing that the dimensions of the
sole have increased laterally as well as longitudinally to an even greater extent.
                [0096]             FIG. 16 is an enlarged of the forefoot region 333 when the forefoot is in
a rest condition and therefore not under tension. In the middle portion 381 of forefoot
region 333, the outsole has larger hexagonal patterns 324 on its medial side of the ball
of the foot (i.e., where the phalange from the big toe meets a metatarsal bone), where a
wearer would be pushing off when making a sudden move to one side, and at the big
toe where a wearer would be pushing off to leap or run forwards. These larger features
help absorb the impact of these moves, and increase the traction of those regions of the
outsole with the playing surface.
                [0097]             FIG. 17 shows the forefoot region of FIG. 16 when it is under
longitudinal tension, showing that the region under tension increases its lateral
dimension as well as its longitudinal dimension. FIG. 18 shows the forefoot region of
FIG. 16 when it is under lateral tension, showing that the region under tension increases
its longitudinal dimensions as well as its lateral dimensions. As seen in FIGS. 17 and
18 the auxetic structure of the outsole provides improved traction when subjected to
either longitudinal or lateral tension, since the overall surface area of the outsole
increases under either kind of tension.

               [0098]              FIGS. 19 to 25 illustrate an embodiment with a different sole structure.
In this embodiment, sole 400 is made from an auxetic structure that does not appear to
have openings when the structure is not under tension. However, this structure exhibits
polygonal openings when the structure is under tension. Thus this structure can be
described as being "closed" when it is not under tension (FIG. 19 and 21), and "open"
when it is under longitudinal, lateral or other tension in the plane of the structure (FIG.
22).
               [0099]              FIG. 20 is a side cross-sectional view of sole 400, showing tread
pattern 410 on outsole 401 and midsole 402. In some embodiments, as seen in FIG.
20, outsole 401 may also include an outer covering 403. The embodiment shown in
FIGS. 19 to 25 has an outsole 401 made, for example, of a relatively hard material such
as a hard rubber, and a midsole 402 made of a relatively resilient material such as EVA
foam or polyurethane foam.
               [00100]             As shown in FIGS. 19, 21, 22 and 23, the outsole 401 and the midsole
402 both have the auxetic structure described above, i.e., they have a pattern of
triangles joined at their vertices. The joints between the vertices 423 of triangles 422
are flexible, such that they function as hinges, allowing the triangles to rotate with
respect to each other thus producing the apertures 421 shown in FIG. 22 and FIG. 23.
               [00101]             The portion of the sole outlined in dark dashed lines 440 in FIG. 19 is
shown in the four schematic diagrams of FIG. 23. These diagrams show how the
dimensions of the sole increase from their initial values when the sole is not under
tension (the first diagram on the left) to when the sole is under low tension (second
diagram), then when the sole is under moderate tension (third diagram) and finally when
the sole is under greatest tension (fourth diagram).
               [00102]             FIG. 24 is a bottom view of an outsole of an embodiment shown in
FIG. 19 when it is not under tension. FIG. 24 identifies triangular feature 450 and
triangular feature 451 within dark dashed lines 440. FIG. 25 is a sequence of four
schematic diagrams showing how triangular feature 450 and triangular feature 451

rotate away from each other and open the aperture 453 between them as the outsole
undergoes increasing tension.
               [00103]             In the embodiment shown schematically in FIGS. 19 to 25, the outsole
has a tread pattern 410 that provides improved traction with the ground or the playing
surface. The outsole optionally also has a thin, elastic and flexible "skin" or outer
covering 403 that is molded to fit over the tread pattern. This outer covering may be
made, for example, from an elastomeric material. The outer covering may be used to
prevent water, dirt, particulates or other debris from entering the triangular openings
created when the sole is under tension.
               [00104]             The outer covering may be molded to fit into the star-shaped triangular
apertures in the auxetic structure of the outsole. For example, FIGS. 26-31 are
schematic diagrams of an embodiment in which an elastic and flexible outer covering is
molded to mate into the triangular star-shaped openings of the auxetic structure. FIG.
26 shows the outsole structure 501 when it is not under tension. Outsole structure 501
has triangles 522 joined at their vertices 523 to adjoining triangles, which are separated
by apertures 521. When the sole structure is under tension in one direction, it increases
its dimension in that direction as well as in the direction orthogonal to that direction and
in the plane of the structure, as shown in FIG. 27.
               [00105]             FIG. 28 is a schematic diagram of a top view of outer covering 503,
i.e., it is a view from what would be the interior side of outer covering 503 when outer
covering 503 is attached to the sole. This diagram shows features 551 that protrude
from the surface 550 of outer covering 503. FIG. 29 is a schematic diagram showing
how outer covering 503 mates with outsole 501. The features 551 on outer covering
503 are now shown from the opposite side of outer covering 503, such that they appear
as recesses instead of protuberances. The outer covering (which would be on the
bottom of an article of footwear and therefore bears the ground-contacting surface)
exhibits a triangular tread pattern 552. Because outer covering 503 is fabricated from a
stretchable elastic material, it stretches readily to accommodate the increased length
and width of whatever portions of outsole 501 may be under tension. Thus the pattern

of features 551 serves the dual function of mating to the auxetic material of outsole 501
and providing triangular tread pattern 552 which serves to improve the wearer's traction
against the playing surface.
               [00106]             FIG. 30 is a side perspective view of a section of outsole structure 500
and outer covering 503, showing how the vertices in outer covering 503 fit into
apertures 521. Because outer covering 503 is made from a thin, flexible and elastic
material, it can readily stretch to accommodate the expansion of outsole structure 501
when it is under longitudinal or lateral tension. FIG. 37 is a cross-section of a portion of
an exemplary construction of sole structure 500, showing a midsole layer 530 and an
outsole layer 531, as well as outer covering 503.
               [00107]             FIGS. 32-38 illustrate another embodiment of an article of footwear
600 with a sole having an auxetic structure that is light, flexible and comfortable. This
article of footwear is suitable for use as a shoe for light jogging or walking. As shown in
FIG. 32, this embodiment has an open knit upper 601, an outsole 602 made of an
auxetic structure, and an insole 603. FIG. 32 shows that the polymer material forming
outsole 602 curves up around the back 631 of the heel 630 of the footwear, providing
additional reinforcement, support and protection at the back of the heel. As shown in
FIG. 33 and FIG. 34, outsole 602 has a pattern of reentrant triangular apertures 621
formed by the triangles 622 that are joined at their vertices 623 to the vertices of other
triangles. In this embodiment, the size of reentrant triangular apertures 621 is relatively
uniform all over outsole 602. When a portion of footwear 600 is under longitudinal or
lateral tension due to an impact with the ground, that portion of outsole expands in both
directions, thus absorbing the impact and improving traction as described above.
Outsole 602 may be made by molding the auxetic structure shown in FIGS. 33-35 into a
synthetic rubber, polyurethane or thermoplastic polyurethane material.
               [00108]             FIG. 35 is a schematic diagram of an enlarged view of the back 631 of
heel 630 of article of footwear 600. As shown in FIG. 35, the back 631 of the heel 630
of upper 601 may be overlaid with the auxetic structure used for outsole 602 to
strengthen the back of the heel. This may be fabricated by overmolding the fabric of

 upper 601 with a polymer such that the polymer infiltrates and bonds with the material of
 upper 601. As shown in FIG. 35, the auxetic structure has reentrant angles at the
 bottom side of the apertures, such that the auxetic structure expands laterally when it is
 under longitudinal tension. This effect facilitates pulling the shoe over the heel of the
wearer's foot.
                [00109]             As best shown in FIG. 36 and also shown in FIG. 34, the flexibility of
footwear 600 is enhanced by carve-out 650 at the instep region 604 of outsole 602.
Carve-out 650 limits outsole 602 to just the lateral side of the footwear at instep region
604, thus providing less resistance to the upward bending of the heel with respect to the
forefoot. This structure provides a comfortable, low-stress article of footwear that is
 particularly suitable for activities such as jogging or walking.
                [00110]             FIG. 37 is a schematic diagram showing that, in this embodiment,
 upper 601 is sown to an insole 660 by stitching 661. Outsole 602 can then be attached
to the bottom of insole 650 by using adhesives, for example, or by other means, such as
 by fusing, molding or stitching. FIG. 38 is a cross-section across a portion of the
forefoot of article of footwear 600 at as indicate in FIG. 33, showing insole 660 ,
openings 621 and outsole 602 as well as midsole 603, which is optional.
                [00111]             FIGS. 39-43 are schematic diagrams of an article of footwear 700 that
could be used, for example, as a running shoe for running on hard surfaces such as a
 paved road or an indoor track, where the runner would be pounding the footwear
against the ground. This embodiment has a woven fabric upper 701 and a molded hard
 rubber or polyurethane outsole 702.
                [00112]            As shown in FIG. 40, outsole 702 bears a pattern of hexagonal
 patterns 720 with reentrant triangular apertures 721 formed by triangles 722 that are
joined at their vertices 723 such that they function as hinges, allowing triangles 722 to
 rotate with respect to each other in response to longitudinal or lateral tension. When
any part of the outsole hits the ground or a playing surface, the vertical compression of
the outsole forces the triangles towards the center of the hexagonal patterns, i.e., the
triangular star-shaped apertures collapse towards their centers. This increases the

density of the outsole in the area of impact, and attenuates the impact force. The
pattern in outsole 702 may be formed by molding the outsole material to form the
pattern, or by cutting triangular star-shaped sections out of a solid material.
               [00113]             In this embodiment, the hexagonal patterns have roughly the same
size from the heel to the toe of the foot, with one hexagonal feature 741 directly under
the wearer's heel and several hexagonal patterns 743 under the ball of the wearer's
foot, as shown in FIG. 40. As best shown in FIG. 41, outsole 702 also has one
hexagonal feature 742 directly under the wearer's big toe. Hexagonal patterns 720
towards the medial, lateral, front or rear portions of sole 702 curve upwards from the
outsole and are attached to the fabric of upper 701 by overmolding or by using
adhesives.
               [00114]            As shown in FIG. 42, the back 731 of the heel 730 of the upper 701 is
reinforced with an overmolded or otherwise attached portion of hard rubber or
polyurethane 750 bearing the hexagonal feature of a reentrant triangular aperture
formed by triangles joined at their vertices. When the footwear is pulled over the heel of
the wearer's foot, the reentrant triangular aperture expands laterally, allowing the
footwear to slip more easily over the wear's heel. FIG. 39 and FIG. 42 show that
portions of the sole material may be molded over the fabric of upper 701, providing
reinforcement and abrasion resistance to its lower edges.
               [00115]             FIG. 43 is a schematic diagram cross-section of the embodiment of
FIG. 39 taken at the forefoot, just in front of the laces as shown in FIG. 40. This
diagram shows outer sole 702 with apertures 721 attached to a resilient inner sole 703.
Outer sole 702 may be attached to inner sole 703 by using adhesives, overmolding or
any other suitable means.
               [00116]             FIG. 44 is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of a shoe 800
that could be used for running or other sports or recreational activities. This shoe is
generally similar to the shoe shown in FIG. 32, but it has an additional peripheral band
of material 810 connecting sole 802 to upper 801. Peripheral band 810 extends around
the entire periphery of sole 802 and upper 801. FIG. 45 is a schematic diagram of an

interior view of shoe 800 at its heel region 803, showing insole 820 attached to the
bottom edge of peripheral band 810 using stitching 821. The top edge of peripheral
band 810 is attached to the bottom edge of upper 801. Other methods of attaching
peripheral bands 810 to the insole and to the upper may also be used. Peripheral band
810 provides additional flexibility to footwear 800 by decoupling sole 802 from upper
801, thus allowing sole 802 to expand without being constrained by upper 801.                     The
pattern of apertures 830 in the midsole can be seen under insole 820.
                [00117]            The auxetic structures used for the outsoles and midsoles shown in
these figures can be manufactured by molding a conventional polymer (such as EVA,
rubber, polyurethane or thermoplastic polyurethane) to have the pattern of joined
triangles or polygons with triangular or polygonal apertures as described herein. The
structures could also be manufactured by casting a solid polymer sheet and cutting the
desired patterns into the sheet. For example, the auxetic structure shown in FIGS. 4-15
may be produced by molding a polymer to have the desired pattern, whereas the
auxetic structure shown in FIS. 16-19 may be produced by cutting the patterns into a
polymer sheet.
                [00118]             In some of the sole structures described above the whole extent of the
sole is made of an auxetic structure. However, that is not a requirement for all
embodiments. For example, embodiments may use the auxetic structure described
above in any one, two or three of the heel region, the midfoot region and the forefoot
region of the sole, or throughout the sole. The sole may have a single outsole layer. It
may alternatively have an outsole and an inner sole, or an outsole, a midsole and an
inner sole, or an outer covering, an outsole, a midsole and an inner sole, or any
combination of the above. It may have even more layers, as long as the sole exhibits
an auxetic structure such that, when under tension in one direction, it expands in the
direction orthogonal to the direction of the tension.
                [00119]            The descriptions above have described auxetic structures using
hexagonal patterns formed of hinged triangles that have openings that increase in both
length and width when under longitudinal tension and also increase in both width and

length when under lateral tension. These structures could also be formed using auxetic
foam material, which is a material with a negative Poisson's ratio, such that the resulting
structure expands in the direction orthogonal to an applied tension both because of its
intrinsic properties and because the material itself is intrinsically auxetic.
               [00120]             The present embodiments depict auxetic structures that have a
substantial thickness in comparison to some other kinds of auxetic materials.
Generally, the thickness of an auxetic structure, such as an outsole comprising an
auxetic structure, can vary. In some embodiments, an auxetic structure forming part of
a sole structure may have a thickness greater than or equal to a millimeter. In some
embodiments, an auxetic structure can have a thickness greater than five millimeters.
In some embodiments, an auxetic structure can have a thickness greater than ten
millimeters. In still other embodiments, the auxetic structure can have a thickness
greater than ten millimeters. Moreover, the thickness of the auxetic structure can be
selected in order to achieve desired properties such as cushioning and support.
               [00121]             In some embodiments, the thickness of an auxetic structure in a sole
can be used to enhance cushioning effects provided by the auxetic structure. FIGS. 46
and 47 illustrate how one or more apertures may change under applied compressive
forces, which may generally be applied in the vertical direction. When the outsole is
compressed, for example when the outsole hits the ground, the triangles tend to
collapse towards the centers of their respective triangular apertures, thus increasing the
material within the region of impact, and further cushioning the impact. On the other
hand, when a portion of the outsole is under tension, for example when the wearer is
pushing off from his or her forefoot, that portion of the outsole expands in the lateral as
well as in the longitudinal direction, providing improved traction.
               [00122]            As seen in FIG 46, with no compressive forces applied, apertures 920
of a portion of an outsole 900 (shown schematically) may initially be open. However, as
compressive forces are applied, as shown in FIG. 47, apertures 920 may close. This
may generally occur because the triangular portions 922 that surround apertures 920
may tend to expand in size under the compressive forces (due to mass conservation).

                                                         - 27
This results in an inward contraction of apertures 920, which may have reduced opening
sizes, or may completely close (as in FIG. 40). In particular, triangular portions 922 may
be forced towards the centers of apertures 920.
                [00123]            While various embodiments have been described, the description is
intended to be exemplary, rather than limiting and it will be apparent to those of ordinary
skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible that are
within the scope of the embodiments. Accordingly, the embodiments are not to be
restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents. Also, various
modifications and changes may be made within the scope of the attached claims.
