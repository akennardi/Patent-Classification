                 This disclosure relates to speakers and more specifically to an array
speaker for distributing music uniformly across a room. A number of audio drivers can
be radially distributed within a speaker housing so that an output of the drivers is
distributed evenly throughout the room. In some embodiments, the exit geometry of the
audio drivers can be configured to bounce off a surface supporting the array speaker to
improve the distribution of music throughout the room. The array speaker can include a
number of vibration isolation elements distributed within a housing of the array speaker.
The vibration isolation elements can be configured reduce the strength of forces generated
by a subwoofer of the array speaker.

                                                 FIELD
   [0002]     This disclosure applies generally to speakers. In particular, an array of speakers
20 housed within a cylindrical housing is described.
                                            BACKGROUND
   [0003]     Conventional speakers are generally directional in nature, which can have the effect
   of leaving dead spots within a room. Often a large array of speakers is distributed around a
   room to achieve a substantially uniform level of audio performance throughout the room.
25 Conventional speakers can also be subject to vibratory excursions in certain playback
   regimes. For example, a subwoofer can cause substantial buzzing and or motion of a speaker
   depending on the volume and frequency of the music being played back. Consequently,
   improvements in speaker design are desirable.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0061]      Representative applications of methods and apparatus according to the present
 5 application are described in this section. These examples are being provided solely to add
   context and aid in the understanding of the described embodiments. It will thus be apparent
   to one skilled in the art that the described embodiments may be practiced without some or all
   of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps have not been
   described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the described embodiments.
10 Other applications are possible, such that the following examples should not be taken as
   limiting.
   [0062]     In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying
   drawings, which form a part of the description and in which are shown, by way of
   illustration, specific embodiments in accordance with the described embodiments. Although
15 these embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable one skilled in the art to practice
   the described embodiments, it is understood that these examples are not limiting; such that
   other embodiments may be used, and changes may be made without departing from the spirit
   and scope of the described embodiments.
   [0063]     Speaker configurations tend to be overly large when high quality audio playback is
20 desired and the audio output can be very directional in nature. This often requires a user to
   be positioned in one particular location to get a desired quality level of audio content
   generated by the speakers. For example, a multi-channel speaker setup could require
   speakers to be mounted in multiple different corners of a room to achieve a substantially
   uniform distribution of sound within the room.
25 [0064]     One way to reduce the size of a speaker configuration and simplify speaker setup
   while maintaining an even distribution of sound within a room, is to package multiple mid to
   high frequency drivers into a single housing. The drivers can be distributed within the
   speaker device so that audio exit channels associated with the drivers are distributed at a
   regular radial interval along a periphery of the speaker device. In some embodiments,
30 beamforming techniques can be applied to improve audio performance by, adjusting audio
   exiting from adjacent audio exit openings in order to generate constructively interference. In
   one particular embodiment, the drivers can be positioned in a circular arrangement within a
                                                    8

   1002205903
   cylindrical housing to achieve an even radial distribution of sound. Destructive interference
   caused by reflections from the support surface on which the device is positioned can be
   prevented by orienting the audio exit openings next to the support surface.
   [0065]     In some embodiments, the size of the speaker device can be reduced by packaging
 5 the various internal components in close proximity. For example, a power supply unit can be
   positioned within a central recess defined by a circular arrangement of drivers. In some
   embodiments, capacitors can be located between a centrally located subwoofer and sidewalls
   of a device housing of the speaker device. In one particular embodiment, a magnet of the
   subwoofer can be shaped specifically to accommodate larger capacitors between the
10 subwoofer and the sidewalls of the speaker device.
   [0066]     When the speaker device also includes processing components, heat rejection can
   also be important. In some embodiments, a main logic board of the speaker device can be
   positioned in front of the subwoofer so that air pushed by the subwoofer can convectively
   dissipate heat from heat emitting components of the main logic board.
15 [0067]     Packaging a subwoofer within the speaker device can generate vibrations that could
   cause undesirable buzzing within or motion of the speaker device. In some embodiments, the
   subwoofer can be attached to mounting brackets within the device housing using a fastener
   with an elastomeric grommet. The elastomeric grommet can reduce the amount of vibrations
   imparted to the rest of the speaker device by the subwoofer.
20 [0068]     In some embodiments, the mounting brackets can take the form of an annular
   support structure that is positioned within a device housing of the speaker device by rotating
   the annular support structure along threading arranged along an interior surface of the device
   housing. The mounting bracket can be configured to receive fasteners associated with an
   upper housing component of the device housing and the subwoofer. In some embodiments,
25 the annular support structure can be formed of two separate rings that are compressed
   together by a series of fasteners.
   [0069]     In some embodiments, the speaker device can include a touch-based user interface
   positioned on a top surface of the speaker device. The touch-based user interface can include
   lighting that illuminates different regions of the touch-based user interface. For example, a
30 central portion of the user interface could be illuminated with a shifting pattern of colors in
   response to a voice command being received or processed. The shifting pattern of colors
   could be produced by an array of LEDs embedded beneath an exterior surface of the touch
                                                    9

   1002205903
   based user interface. Other illuminated controls on the touch-based user interface can include
   volume controls. The touch-based user interface can utilize a capacitive touch sensor or other
   touch sensor suitable for detecting gesture-based touch inputs.
   [0070]     These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to FIGS. 1 - 23;
 5 however, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given
   herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be
   construed as limiting.
   [0071]     FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of an array speaker 100. Array speaker 100 can
   have an unbroken, aesthetically pleasing exterior surface and a symmetric substantially
10 cylindrical geometry. As used herein, the term "substantially cylindrical geometry" refers to
   a geometry that is completely cylindrical (i.e., a geometry that includes straight parallel sides
   and has a circular or oval cross-section) as well as a geometry in which the sides of the top
   and/or bottom edges are tapered and rounded more than an actual cylinder. Array speaker
    100 can also have different geometries. For example, a device housing for array speaker
15 could have many different axisymmetric shapes that allows audio device assemblies to be
   distributed radially within the device housing. An axisymmetric geometry refers to a shape
   having symmetry around at least one axis. In the described embodiments, the device housing
   exhibits an axisymmetric geometry that has symmetry about a longitudinal axis of the device
   housing. It should also be noted that the term axisymmetric may also be construed to cover
20 shapes that are substantially symmetric about one axis. For example, a small recess or
   protrusion would not preclude the housing from being described as having an axisymmetric
   geometry for the purpose of the following description.
   [0072]     An upper portion of array speaker 100 can include a user interface 102. User
   interface 102 can allow a user to adjust settings for array speaker 100. For example, track
25 selection and changes in volume can be handled by interacting with user interface 102. In
   some embodiments, user interface 102 can take the form of a touch sensitive surface. User
   interface 102 can include one or more light sources that illuminate various regions of user
   interface 102 to help a user interact with user interface 102. A majority of array speaker 100
   can be covered by acoustic fabric 104. Acoustic fabric 104 can give array speaker 100 a
30 consistent exterior surface. Some audio exit ports can be concealed by acoustic fabric 104 in
   a manner that results in minimal impact on the volume and/or quality of audio exiting array
   speaker 100.

   [0073]     FIG. 2A shows a cross-sectional view of array speaker 100 that includes only
   components disposed within the lower third of array speaker 100. In particular, the cross
   section of one audio driver assembly 202 is depicted. Audio driver assembly 202 can include
   driver housing 204, which surrounds the audio components making up audio driver assembly
 5 202 and defines a rectangular channel 206 for allowing the audio generated by diaphragm
   207 of audio driver assembly 202 to exit driver housing 204. Audio driver assembly 202 can
   be fastened to lower housing component 208 by fastener 210. Driver housing 204 can be
   rotated so that rectangular channel 206 aligns with audio exit channel 212 defined by lower
   housing component 208. Audio waves 214 exiting audio exit channel 212 pass through
10 acoustic fabric 104 and travel along a supporting surface 216 upon which array speaker 100
   rests due to the exit geometry of audio exit channel 212. In some embodiments, acoustic
   fabric 104 can have a pattern designed to conceal components or features positioned beneath
   acoustic fabric 104.
   [0074]     FIG. 2A also shows power receptacle 220. Power receptacle 220 can extend
15 between two adjacent audio driver assemblies 202 to route power to various components
   within array speaker 100. Power receptacle 220 can be electrically coupled to power supply
   unit 222 by electrically conductive cable 224. In some embodiments, power supply unit 222
   can be coupled to power supply board 226, which is in turn coupled to lower housing
   component 208. Power supply unit 222 extends into a recess defined by audio driver
20 assemblies 202. Audio driver assemblies 202 are distributed radially at a regular interval
   about array speaker 100. In this way, power supply unit 222 utilizes the space available
   within the recess defined by audio driver assemblies 202. In some embodiments, amplifier
   board 228 and the components distributed thereon can also be electrically coupled to power
   supply unit 222 and power receptacle 220 by way of electrically conductive cable 224. FIG.
25 2A also depicts cantilevered foot 230, which supports the weight of array speaker 100 atop
   supporting surface 216. Cantilevered foot 230 can be formed of damping material such as
   silicone configured to minimize the amount of vibration transferred from array speaker 100 to
   supporting surface 216. Cantilevered foot 230 can be configured to dissipate forces
   transmitted in Z as well as moments acting about the X and/or Y axes. The wide aspect and
30 symmetric footprint of cantilevered foot 230 also helps prevent rocking of the speaker due to
   moments acting about the X and/or Y axes.
   [0075]     FIG. 2B shows an interior cross-sectional view of one side of array speaker 100
   depicting diaphragm 207 and an audio exit channel 212 associated with one of audio driver
                                                  11

   1002205903
   assemblies 202. Various dimensions of the exit of audio exit channel 212 are depicted in
   millimeters. In particular, the distance between the end of audio exit channel 212 and an
   edge 229 of a sidewall of lower housing component 208 is about 1.5 times greater than the
   height of a downward facing surface of array speaker 100 off a support surface supporting
 5 array speaker 100. The height of foot 230 just below an outlet region for audio exit channel
   212 is about half the distance from supporting surface 216 and the top surface of audio exit
   channel 212. In some embodiments, a periphery of foot 230 has a thickness that is about 6/11
   of distance 231 between a distal end of foot 230 (or supporting surface 216) and the top
   surface of audio exit channel 212 at the outlet region. This geometry results in high
10 frequency audio waves moving around a corner of foot 230 and a comer of the outer edge of
   the housing in such a way that an even vertical directivity is achieved for both low and high
   frequency audio waves. Distance 232 between the edge of lower housing component 208 and
   the periphery of the foot can be slightly longer than distance 231. This allows the downward
   facing surface of lower housing component 208 to help shape the audio waves as they travel
15 away from the speaker device. In some embodiments, a ratio of distance 231 to distance 232
   can be about 11/15.
   [0076]     FIG. 2C shows an interior schematic view of a lower region of array speaker 100.
   FIG. 2C depicts how diaphragm 207 associated with one of audio driver assemblies 202 can
   be configured to emit audio through a number of vertical slots 233 defined by lower housing
20 component 208. Dashed lines 234 depicted within rectangular channel 206 and audio exit
   channel 212 represent sound waves generated by diaphragm 207. In particular, dashed lines
   234 are depicted turning within different regions of rectangular channel 206 and audio exit
   channel 212. These channels are shaped deliberately to minimize destructive interference
   that could negatively affect the quality and/or volume produced by vibration of diaphragm
25 207. For example, the turns in the audio channels direct acoustic waves in ways that preserve
   coherent wave fronts along the length of the audio channels. The shape of the audio channels
   also helps to direct the audio waves in a direction 236 oriented radially outward and upward,
   which results in spherically expanding wavefronts moving away from the supporting surface
   upon which lower housing component 208 rests. While audio waves are depicted two
30 dimensionally by dashed lines 234 it should be appreciated that the audio waves have a three
   dimensional profile that extends circumferentially within and outside of lower housing
   component 208. FIG. 2C also shows how audio waves generated by diaphragm 602 turn in a
   direction substantially orthogonal to an original direction in which the audio waves are
                                                   12

   1002205903
   initially generated. For example, audio waves could shift 70 to 80 degrees in direction before
   exiting driver housing 204 through audio exit opening 710.
   [0077]     FIG. 3A shows a cross-sectional view of array speaker 100 in accordance with
   section line A-A of FIG. 2A. Each driver assembly includes an adapter 302 configured to
 5 position phase plug 304 within driver housing 204. Phase plug 304 reduces destructive
   interference by guiding audio waves from the large surface area of the diaphragm to the small
   entrance area of the throat of the horn rather than allowing the audio waves to interact
   destructively near the diaphragm. Phase plug also helps shape the sound waves leaving audio
   driver assembly 202 to conform to a non-circular or in some cases more rectangular channel
10 206 and audio exit channel 212. A periphery of a diaphragm associated with coil assembly
   306 is engaged with phase plug 304 as depicted. Coil assembly 306 includes a coil of wire
   that is affixed to a central portion of the diaphragm and is configured to generate a shifting
   magnetic field configured to interact with permanent magnet 308, thereby causing waves to
   be generated by the diaphragm. When the shifting magnetic field interacts with the field
15 generated by permanent magnet 308 the diaphragm vibrates at a rate suitable for generating
   audio waves associated with a media file being played back by array speaker 100. Behind
   permanent magnet 308 is a support assembly taking the form of a magnetic motor assembly
   that includes U-cup 310, top plate 311 and permanent magnet 308. In addition to providing a
   surface upon which magnet 308 can be mounted, U-cup 310 directs a magnetic field emitted
20 by magnet 308 to the air gap where the coil is positioned. Behind U-cup 310 is a foam layer
   312, which can be formed from open-cell foam. Foam layer 312 can enhance the audio
   performance of audio driver assembly 202. In some embodiments, foam layer 312 can
   increase the apparent size of a back volume of audio driver assembly 202. Finally, cap 314 is
   secured to driver housing 204 to close an opening in the back of audio driver assembly 202.
25 This rear opening in driver housing 204 can be used to insert the audio components described
   above within driver housing 204. FIG. 3A also shows how channels 206 leading out of driver
   housing 204 can be distributed at a regular radial interval.
   [0078]     FIG. 3B shows a cross-sectional view of array speaker 100 in accordance with
   section line B-B of FIG. 2. In this view, top surfaces of driver housings 204 are depicted.
30 Each driver housing has two driver screw terminals 316. Driver screw terminals 316 can be
   used to create an electrically conductive pathway between the audio components within
   driver housing 204 and other components of array speaker 100.
                                                    13

   1002205903
   [0079]     FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of each of audio driver assemblies 202. In
   particular, caps 314 are shown closing rear openings leading into driver housings 204. Each
   of audio driver assemblies 202 is also depicted with an alignment bracket 402. Alignment
   bracket 402 can be configured to create a buffer between each of audio driver assemblies 202
 5 and lower housing component 208. Alignment brackets 402 can also be configured to help
   align amplifier board 228 with driver screw terminals 316. Amplifier board 228 is
   configured to support capacitors 404 and other electronic components such as electronic
   components 406. Capacitors 404 are configured to provide power for audio driver assemblies
   202. In particular, the power from capacitors 404 can be used to support separate amp
10 channels to power each of audio driver assemblies 202. Amplifier board 228 is also depicted
   with terminals 408. Each of terminals 408 can be configured to receive a fastener for
   coupling amplifier board 228 to driver screw terminals 316. In this way, amplifier board 228
   can be securely coupled to each of audio driver assemblies 202.
   [0080]     FIG. 5A shows a perspective view of a rear portion of audio driver assembly 202.
15 Cap 314 is removed from audio driver assembly 202 to reveal a rear-facing surface of U-cup
   310. U-cup 310 is coupled to peripheral tab portions 508 of phase plug 304. Wires 502 are
   also depicted and can electrically couple audio components of audio driver assembly 202 to
   respective driver screw terminals 316. Amplifier board 228 is shown secured to audio driver
   assemblies 202 by fasteners 504, which are depicted engaging driver screw terminals 316.
20 FIG. 5A also shows a rear view of U-cup 310, which includes engaging features 506 that
   engage tabs 508 of phase plug 304.
   [0081]     FIG. 5B shows a cross-sectional view of fastener 504 engaging driver screw
   terminal 316. Fastener 504 can be an electrically conductive fastener and can be configured
   to carry a signal received from terminal 408 disposed upon amplifier board 228. In some
25 embodiments, amplifier board 228 can also include a lower terminal 507 disposed on a lower
   surface of amplifier board 228. In some embodiments, lower terminal 507 can be
   compressed against driver screw terminal 316, allowing signals to be transferred or a
   grounding path to be established between lower terminal 507 and driver screw terminal 316
   along electrically conductive pathway 509. Those signals can then be transferred to wire 502,
30 which is soldered to a lower portion of driver screw terminal 316. The signals can include
   instructions for generating audio using the audio components within driver housing 204. In
   some embodiments, one of wires 502 can be used to receive instructions and the other can be
                                                  14

   1002205903
   configured to receive power. In some embodiments, one of wires 502 can function as a
   grounding pathway.
   [0082]     FIG. 5C shows another embodiment in which fastener 504 engages an opening
   defined by driver housing 204. When driver housing 204 is made of electrically insulating
 5 materials, electrical signals and power can be routed into driver housing 204 by one or more
   of wires 502. In some embodiments, sheet metal 510 can be positioned between driver
   housing 204 and amplifier board 228. Sheet metal 510 can be bent in order to help define
   electrically conductive pathway 509 toward an exterior surface of driver housing 204. Sheet
   metal 510 can also define an opening or a notch configured to accommodate fastener 504. In
10 some embodiments, wire 502 can be soldered to sheet metal 510.
   [0083]     FIG. 6 shows an exploded view of audio driver assembly 202. Adapter 302 can be
   inserted into driver housing 204. Driver housing 204 can include have internal features
   suited to receive adapter 302. Adapter 302 can define an opening allowing audio waves to
   pass through adapter 302 and out of driver housing 204. A rear-facing surface of adapter 302
15 can be configured to receive protrusions of phase plug 304. Phase plug 304 defines a number
   of openings that shape the audio waves in a manner that prevents destructive interference as
   the audio waves are being directed toward the exit of driver housing 204. Phase plug 304 is
   also depicted with tabs 508, which are configured to be engaged by engaging features 506 of
   U-cup 310.
20 [0084]     FIG. 6 also depicts coil assembly 306, which includes diaphragm 602 and coil 604.
   Coil 604 is electrically coupled with a power source so that it is able to receive alternating
   current. The alternating current results in coil 604 outputting a shifting magnetic field that
   interacts with the magnetic field emitted by permanent magnet 308 of the magnetic motor
   assembly. This interaction results in coil assembly 306 traveling back and forth between
25 phase plug 304 and U-cup 310. The direction of travel of coil assembly 306 can be defined
   by the direction of the circumferential current flow in the coil and the direction of the radially
   oriented magnetic flux within the air gap between top plate 606 and U-cup 310 that is
   generated by permanent magnet 308. The direction of force is perpendicular to both the flow
   of current in coil 604 and the magnetic flux lines. Motion is permitted in that direction by a
30 compliant surround portion of diaphragm 602.. Plate 606 can be coupled to permanent
   magnet 308 and designed to help shape the flow of magnetic flux emitted by permanent
                                                   15

   1002205903
   magnet 308. The force applied to coil 604 results in diaphragm 602 moving and generating
   audio waves that travel through phase plug 304 and then out of driver housing 204.
   [0085]     FIG. 7 shows a cross-sectional view of audio driver assembly 202. In particular, a
   back volume 702 of audio driver assembly 202 is depicted. Generally a back volume refers
 5 to an open area within the speaker housing containing air that is in fluid communication with
   a rear-facing surface of a diaphragm and not in fluid communication with a listener.
   Similarly, a front volume refers to another open area within the speaker housing containing
   air that is in fluid communication with both a forward-facing surface of the diaphragm and
   the listener. A larger back volume 702 increases the amount of air behind diaphragm 602
10 helping to increase low frequency output at a given power output for audio driver assembly
   202. An apparent size of back volume 702 can be increased by foam layer 312, which by
   slowing air down within the back volume increases the apparent volume of back volume 702.
   Back volume 702 can also be enlarged by a portion of back volume 704 that is forward of the
   diaphragm. By leaving a gap 706 between phase plug 304 and driver housing 204, the
15 additional open space can be added on to the total volume of back volume 702. In some
   embodiments, this additional volume forward of diaphragm 602 can substantially improve
   audio performance when diaphragm 602 oscillates in the direction indicated by arrow 708. In
   some embodiments, back volume 702 and forward back volume 704 can add up to about 17
   CCs. FIG. 7 also shows magnetic flux flow lines 710 and how both U-cup 310 and plate 606
20 cooperate to define a flux flow path for the magnetic field emitted by permanent magnet 308.
   In this way, the magnetic field can be concentrated around the path along which coil 604
   traverses during operation of audio driver assembly 202.
   [0086]     FIG. 8 shows a cross-sectional view of array speaker 100 that includes only
   components within a central portion of array speaker 100. FIG. 8 depicts both subwoofer 802
25 and microphones 804. Subwoofer 802 includes a permanent ring magnet 806 for driving a
   coil 808 and a diaphragm 810 of subwoofer 802. It should be noted that diaphragm 810 can
   also be referred to as a cone. While the cone terminology often refers to a rigid oscillating
   member associated with a subwoofer, for the purposes of this description, the oscillating
   member of the subwoofer will be described generally as a diaphragm. Subwoofer 802 can be
30 mounted to lower housing component 208 by damped coupling 812, which can minimize an
   amount of force and/or vibration transferred to lower housing component 208 from
   subwoofer 802. A magnetic field emitted by ring magnet 806 can be shaped by pole structure
                                                  16

   1002205903
   814 and plate structure 816. An air gap between pole structure 814 and plate structure 816
   can help localize the magnetic field emitted by ring magnet 806 around coil 808.
   The position of subwoofer 802 in the upper portion of the housing allows the region beneath
   subwoofer 802 to be used as a back volume for enhancing the audio produced by subwoofer
 5 802. While not depicted this back volume area includes audio driver assemblies 202. This
   works well since the audio waves generated by audio driver assemblies 202 are isolated by
   housings 204 of audio driver assemblies 202 and the audio generated by audio driver
   assemblies 202 exits out the bottom end of the device housing.
   [0087]     FIG. 8 also shows how microphones 804 can be distributed radially as depicted in
10 FIG. 8. In some embodiments, a flexible ribbon cable or flexible PCB 818 can be utilized to
   electrically couple together each of microphones 804. In some embodiments, microphones
   804 can be configured to detect both internal audio sources and external audio sources. In
   some embodiments, microphones 804 can be configured to monitor the inside of array
   speaker 100 for distortion or overdriving to prevent speaker damage. In some embodiments,
15 microphones 804 can be configured to relay audible user commands to a processor of array
   speaker 100. For example, microphones 804 can be aligned with and sealed across an
   opening in the sidewall of the device housing, thereby allowing multiple microphones 804 to
   cooperatively triangulate the location of any audio detected by two or more of microphones
   804.
20 [0088]     FIG. 9A shows how magnet 806 of subwoofer 802 can extend radially around a
   periphery of subwoofer 802 according to an embodiment. Because magnet 806 extends
   radially from subwoofer 802, capacitors 404 are limited in diameter. For this reason, as
   depicted in FIG. 9B, more capacitors 404 can be needed to power audio driver assemblies
   202 than would be needed with a greater diameter capacitor. Generally, using a greater
25 number of capacitors 404 tends to be more expensive and takes up a larger amount of space
   on amplifier board 228.
   [0089]     FIG. 9C shows a subwoofer 902 according to some embodiments of the disclosure
   that includes a magnet 904 instead of magnet 806. Magnet 904 includes a number of
   protruding lobes 906 that can extend radially near or in some cases all the way out to the
30 interior facing surfaces of lower housing component 208. While magnet 904 is depicted
   having three lobes 906 it should be appreciated that magnet 904 could have any number of
   lobes 906 as long as they are distributed at an even interval about magnet 904. For example,
                                                   17

   1002205903
   four narrower lobes could also be utilized. The even distribution of the lobes helps to keep
   the magnetic field emitted by magnet 904 from becoming asymmetric. In addition to lobes
   906 it should be appreciated that an upper plate 908 directly above magnet 904 and a lower
   plate directly below magnet 904 can also be shaped to conform with lobes 906 of magnet
 5 904. FIG. 9D shows how lobes 906 of magnet 904 leaves sufficient room for larger diameter
   capacitors 912. This configuration would allow audio driver assemblies 202 (not depicted) to
   be powered by larger diameter capacitors 912. In some embodiments, this can allow more
   power to be delivered to audio driver assemblies 202 allowing for higher quality and/or
   louder audio output of driver assemblies 202.
10 [0090]     FIG. 10A shows a perspective view of subwoofer 802. Subwoofer 802 includes a
   lip with multiple notches configured to receive fasteners. The lip is used to secure subwoofer
   802 to a housing of array speaker 100. Unfortunately, the inertia of the moving mass of
   subwoofer 802 creates forces in the Z axis and moments about the X and Y axes, which can
   lead to visible shaking and hopping of array speaker 100. This could lead array speaker 100
15 to move laterally while playing music and become a drop hazard. The motion generated by
   subwoofer 802 can also create vibrations throughout the system, which can cause audible
   buzzing noises and potentially result in premature component failure or disconnection.
   Vertical motion of array speaker in the Z axis can also make a touch interface positioned on
   the top of array speaker 100 more difficult to use. For example, vertical motion of array
20 speaker 100 could cause a user to touch the wrong portion of the touch interface or to make
   an input earlier than otherwise desired.
   [0091]     FIG. 1OA shows a solution to this problem. A number of elastomeric grommets
    1002 and shoulder screws 1004 can be used to secure a flange 1006 of subwoofer 802 to a
   mounting feature within array speaker 100. This can be accomplished by sliding each
25 grommet 1002 into a notch 1008 defined by flange 1006. Once secured within notch 1008,
   shoulder screw 1004 can be inserted through an opening defined by grommet 1002. A
   shoulder portion of shoulder screw 1004 can be positioned within the opening defined by
   grommet 1002 and a threaded portion of shoulder screw 1004 can be used to engage the
   mounting feature.
30 [0092]     FIG. 1OB shows a perspective view of grommet 1002, which can be made from
   highly damped rubber and have a specific geometry to achieve optimal stiffness properties to
   damp oscillations generated by subwoofer 802. Grommet 1002 can define a U-shaped
                                                  18

   1002205903
   channel 1010 configured to allow grommet 1002 to slide into one of notches 1008. When
   flange 1006 is engaged within U-shaped channel 1010, the shape of U-shaped channel 1010
   acts as an anti-rotation feature that prevents rotation of grommet 1002 within notch 1008.
   This can be helpful when driving shoulder screws 1004 into an attachment feature. Grommet
 5  1002 also includes protrusions 1012 protruding from upper flange 1014. Protrusions 1012
   also protrude from lower flange 1016. Protrusions 1012 can also be configured to compress
   more easily when shoulder screw 1004 engages grommet 1002 through opening 1018. The
   height and/or width of protrusions 1012 can be tuned to adjust the overall stiffness provided
   by grommet 1002.
10 [0093]     FIG. 11 A shows an exploded view of a convex user interface 1100. Cosmetic layer
    1102 can be formed from glass or plastic and be configured to provide a smooth surface upon
   which a user can comfortably make inputs. The depicted pattern on cosmetic layer 1102
   includes symbols corresponding to increasing and decreasing a setting. In some
   embodiments, the plus and minus signs can apply to raising the volume or skipping tracks in
15 a song. For example, a long press of the plus can be configured to increase volume while a
   short press could skip to the next track of a media playlist. Cosmetic layer 1102 can be
   coupled to adhesive layer 1104. Adhesive layers 1104 can join cosmetic layer to wedge 1106
   and wedge 1106 to touch / LED board 1108. Adhesive layers 1104 can define a number of
   openings configured to reduce any attenuation in the touch signals caused by adhesive layers
20  1104. Wedge 1106 can define the convex geometry of user interface 1100. A dielectric
   constant of wedge 1106 can be tuned to efficiently pass touch inputs from cosmetic layer
    1102 to touch/LED board 1108. It should be noted that some of the openings defined by
   adhesive layers 1104 and wedge 1106 can be designed to accommodate fasteners 1110,
   which secure touch/LED board 1108 to mounting frame 1112. Light guides 1114 can be
25 configured to direct light emitted by light sources coupled to touch/LED board 1108 toward
   cosmetic layer 1102 of user interface 1100. In some embodiments, the openings defined by
   the different openings can be configured to allow light from LEDs disposed on touch/LED
   board 1108 to illuminate portions of cosmetic layer 1102.
   [0094]     FIG. 11 B shows a cross-sectional view of assembled convex user interface 1100.
30 LEDs 1116 are depicted on upper and lower surfaces of touch/LED board 1108. In this way,
   upper LED 1116 can shine light directly toward cosmetic layer 1102. Lower LEDs 1116
   shine light into a recess defined by mounting frame 1112. The light emitted by lower LEDs
                                                    19

    1116 can then be redirected by light guides 1114 toward other openings situated below the
   plus and minus indicators of cosmetic layer 1102.
   [0095]     FIG. 11 C shows a cross-sectional view of array speaker 100 with convex user
   interface 1100 disposed at the top. Audio waves 1118 are shown being generated by the
 5 oscillation of subwoofer 802 in a vertical direction. In some embodiments, the oscillation can
   be aligned with a longitudinal axis of lower housing component 208. In this instance, the
   term aligned is used to mean that the direction of motion is substantially parallel to the
   longitudinal axis of lower housing component 208. Audio waves 1118 are configured to exit
   array speaker 100 through vents 1120. Main logic board 1122 is shown secured to a bottom
10 surface of convex user interface 1100. Main logic board 1122 can include one or more heat
   generating components such as a processor. Audio waves 1118 incident to main logic board
    1122 can dissipate heat generated by the heat generating components of main logic board
    1122. In some embodiments, heat generated by touch/LED board 1108 can be conducted to
   main logic board 1122, where the heat can be convectively dissipated by the air displaced by
15 audio waves 1118. In some embodiments, subwoofer 802 can be configured to operate at a
   sub-sonic frequency designed to maximize the amount of air pushed past main logic board
    1122, when heat dissipation is a priority. In some embodiments, array speaker 100 can
   include various sensors within above subwoofer 802 that identify high heat loading
   conditions that could result in heat dissipation becoming a priority. For example, a heat
20 sensor could be affixed to a surface of main logic board 1122. Furthermore, various flow rate
   sensors could be positioned between subwoofer 802 and vents 1120 to identify any vent
   blockages. Subwoofer 802 can also be configured to oscillate at a frequency that generates
   haptic feedback along an exterior surface of convex user interface 100. For example,
   subwoofer 802 could be commanded to operate at the frequency that generates the haptic
25 feedback in response to one or more different types of user inputs.
   [0096]     FIG. 1IC also shows seal 1124, which is configured to seal the back volume of
   subwoofer 802. Seal 1124 can be useful in preventing upper housing component 1126 from
   buzzing against lower housing component 208. FIG. 1IC also shows vibration ring 1125,
   which twists along threads 1128. Vibration ring 1125 formed of polymeric material that
30 twists down until it engages channels defined by alignment brackets 402 of driver housings
   204 of each driver in order to discourage vibration of audio driver assemblies 202. In some
   embodiments, vibration ring 1125 can include at least three rows of threads around the
   periphery of vibration ring 1125.
                                                   20

   [0097]     FIG. 12A shows a perspective view of seal 1124. Seal 1124 is arranged in a loop
   and capable of forming a seal around an audio component secured to lower housing
   component 208. Seal 1124 is configured to seal across parting lines and absorb tolerances of
   injection molded plastic parts. Seal 1124 can be made up of multiple layers. FIG. 12B shows
 5 a cross-sectional view of seal 1124 in accordance with section line C-C. The cross-sectional
   view shows how two compliant foam layers 1202 can be joined together by a stiff plastic
   layer 1204. The stiff plastic layer 1204 can make the installation more reliable by helping to
   retain the shape of seal 1124. This design can provide better performance at lower cost than a
   typical O-ring. FIG. 12C shows a close-up view of seal 1124 arranged between upper
10 housing component 1126 and support halo 1206.
   [0098]     FIGS. 13A-13B show how upper housing component 1126 can be attached to lower
   housing component 208. Both upper and lower housing components 1126 and 208 include a
   number of discrete threading segments. The threading segments are arranged on an exterior
   facing surface of upper housing component 1126 and an interior-facing surface of lower
15 housing component 208. In order to attach upper and lower housing components 1126 and
   208 together, threading segment 1302 of upper housing component 1126 can be aligned with
   threading segment 1304 of lower housing component 208. Upper housing component 1126
   can then be lowered until the threading segments 1302 and 1304 contact each other. Upper
   housing component 1126 can then be twisted to shift threading segment 1302 to the right
20 until threading segment 1302 clears threading segment 1304 and then contacts threading
   segment 1306. Once threading segment 1302 contacts threading segment 1306 upper
   housing component 1126 can be twisted in the opposite direction to move threading segment
    1302 to the left until threading segment 1302 clears threading segment 1306 and contacts
   threading segment 1308. Upper housing component 1126 can continue to move in alternating
25 directions until threading segment 1310 is secured against locking surface 1312 of threading
   segment 1314. Threading segment 1310 can have a locking feature 1316 configured to
   engage locking surface 1312. Locking feature 1316 is able to deflect due to an area
   surrounding locking feature 1316 being removed from upper housing component 1126. FIG.
    13B shows upper housing component 1126 locked against lower housing component 208 by
30 interaction between locking surface 1312 and locking feature 1316.
   [0099]     FIGS. 14A - 14D show cantilevered foot 230. FIG. 14A shows cantilevered foot
   230 just below array speaker 100. Cantilevered foot 230 is configured to support the weight
   of array speaker 100 above a support surface and to dissipate any vibrations propagating
                                                  21

   1002205903
   through array speaker 100. FIG. 14B shows a perspective view of cantilevered foot 230. An
   interior layer 1402 of cantilevered foot 230 can be formed of a somewhat rigid but
   deflectable material such as polycarbonate. An exterior layer 1404 formed of a more
   compliant material such as silicone can be configured to dissipate vibrations transmitted to
 5 cantilevered foot 230. Unfortunately, sometimes vibrations can be severe enough to cause
   bouncing or lateral shifting to occur with more standardized vibration dissipating feet.
   [0100]     FIG. 14C shows a top view of cantilevered foot 230 and in particular, a section line
   D-D bisecting cantilevered foot 230. FIG. 14D shows interior layer 1402 and exterior layer
    1404. When a force 1406 acts upon cantilevered foot 230, instead of a thickness of exterior
10 layer 1404 being solely responsible for dissipating any vibrations propagated to cantilevered
   foot 230, cantilevered arms 1408 flex radially to absorb some of force 1406 associated with
   the vibrations as depicted. This radial flexing results in the vertical vibrations being
   translated horizontally and substantially reducing the vertical vibrations. The other positive
   effect of the radial flexing is it places more of exterior layer 1404 in contact with the support
15 surface, increasing the friction between cantilevered foot 230 and the support surface and
   consequently the resistance of array speaker to lateral shift. In some embodiments,
   cantilevered foot 230 and grommets 1002 work together to attenuate undesirable vibration of
   array speaker 100. In some embodiments, annular foam 1410 can be added along a periphery
   of cantilevered foot 230, which can be configured to prevent unwanted vibration of the
20 periphery of cantilevered foot 230. In this way, foam 1410 is positioned to prevent vibrations
   that would otherwise generate distracting vibration when the speaker device generates audio
   waves likely to resonate within cantilevered foot 230.
   [0101]     FIG. 15 shows an exploded view of an alternative convex user interface 1500 that
   differs in some respects from the user interface depicted in FIGS. 11 A - 1 IC. In particular,
25 convex user interface 1500 includes two distinct illuminated, touch interface regions. User
   interface 1500 includes a mounting frame 1502, which defines a channel 1503 running along
   a circumference of mounting frame 1502. Channel 1503 can be configured to receive a
   drawstring associated with acoustic fabric covering array speaker 100. Channel 1503 allows
   each end of the drawstring to be conveniently wrapped around mounting frame 1502 along
30 channel 1503.    Mounting frame 1502 also defines multiple recesses 1504 configured to
   receive and accommodate light emitting components. In particular, the light emitting
   components include LED array board 1506 and light sources 1508. LED array board 1506
   includes an array of LEDs 1510. Each of LEDs 1510 can be configured to emit three or more
                                                    22

   1002205903
   colors of light. LEDs 1510 can also be configured to cooperatively generate various designs
   associated with a first touch interface region. Light sources 1508 can each include one or
   more LEDs for emitting one or more colors of light associated with a second touch interface
   region. Interposer board 1512 can be configured to set a standoff distance between LED
 5 array board 1506 and touch printed circuit board (PCB) 1514. Interposer board 1512 can
   define openings that allow light generated by LEDs 1510 to pass through interposer board
    1512. Interposer board 1512 can take the form of an electrically insulating layer having
   electrically conductive edge plating arranged along its periphery for routing power and
   signals between touch PCB 1514 and LED array board 1506. In this way, light emitted by
10 LEDs 1510 can be modulated in accordance with touch inputs processed by components
   associated with touch PCB 1514. Touch PCB 1514 defines a number of apertures through
   which light generated by the light emitting components generate. In particular, volume
   control openings 1516 can have the shape of plus and minus symbols associated with
   increasing and decreasing respectively the volume of the speaker system associated with user
15 interface 1500.
   [0102]     FIG. 15 also shows fasteners 1518, which can be configured to secure touch PCB
    1514 to mounting frame 1502. In some embodiments, fasteners 1518 can be self-tapping
   screws that form threads within openings defined by mounting frame 1502. Touch PCB 1514
   can be coupled to wedge 1520 by adhesive layer 1522. Both adhesive layer 1522 and wedge
20  1520 can include openings through which light emitted by the light-emitting components can
   pass. Adhesive layer 1522 and wedge 1520 can also include openings to accommodate the
   head portions of fasteners 1518. Wedge 1520, which has a substantially thicker central
   region than its peripheral region, can be configured to give user interface 1500 its curved or
   convex exterior geometry. The central region of wedge 1520 includes an opening for
25 accommodating a diffuser assembly 1523 configured to spread light received from LEDs
    1510. Diffuser assembly 1523 includes a lens array 1524 having discrete diffusing optics for
   each of LEDs 1510. In some embodiments, lens array 1524 can take the form of a single
   piece of glass spreading the light from each of LEDs 1510. In other embodiments, lens array
    1524 can include multiple discrete lenses that spread the light. Lens array 1524 can be
30 secured to touch PCB 1514 by adhesive foam ring 1526. In some embodiments, touch plate
    1528 can be secured to a downward facing surface of lens array 1524. Openings defined by
   touch plate 1528 can accommodate lens protrusions of lens array 1524. Touch plate 1528 can
   take the form of a thin, electrically conductive plate that improves the capacitive coupling for
                                                   23

   1002205903
   touch inputs received by user interface 1500. Touch plate can be electrically coupled to
   touch PCB 1514. In some embodiments, the flat surface of touch plate 1514 can include a
   touch sensor that is optimized for reading the inputs made at the convex cosmetic touch
   surface of user interface 1500. For example, a density of a sensing grid associated with touch
 5 plate 1514 can have a varied density that allows inputs made to be adjusted for the curvature
   at the exterior surface. In this way, a consistent user input can be achieved across the entire
   exterior touch surface of user interface 1500, thereby avoiding the situation in which touch
   inputs are read at a different speed in the center than along a periphery of the touch sensor.
   An upward-facing surface of lens array 1524 can be secured to a first diffuser plate 1530 by
10 adhesive strips 1532 arranged along the periphery of lens array 1524. A layer of diffuser film
    1534 for additional light spreading can be positioned between first diffuser plate 1530 and
   lens array 1524. First diffuser plate 1530 can also be configured to increase the amount of
   diffusion of the light emitted by LEDs 1510.
   [0103]     In some embodiments, first diffuser plate 1530 can be formed from a clear
15 polycarbonate resin that is doped with particles having a different index of refraction than the
   clear polycarbonate resin. For example, the polycarbonate resin could be doped with
   Titanium Oxide particles that both give a white appearance to first diffuser plate 1530 and
   help to further diffuse the light passing through first diffuser plate 1530. First diffuser plate
    1530 is secured to a second diffuser plate 1536 by adhesive strips 1532 arranged along the
20 periphery of first diffuser plate 1530. Adhesive strips 1532 can be sized to create a small air
   gap between the first and second diffuser plates.    Second diffuser plate 1536 can have a
   dome-shaped surface helping diffuser assembly 1523 achieve the same curvature as wedge
    1520. Finally a fade film 1538 can be applied to an upward facing surface of second diffuser
   plate 1536. Fade film can take the form of a radially graduated filter that feathers the
25 intensity of light along a periphery of the light emitted by LEDs 1510. In this way, fade film
    1538 prevents adhesive layer 1540 from abruptly shifting from illuminated to unilluminated
   in a central region of a top cap 1542. Top cap 1542 can take the form of a layer of glass or
   transparent polymer material such as a polycarbonate material. In some embodiments, top
   cap 1542 can include a layer of ink that further diffuses light passing through top cap 1542.
30 In some embodiments, light emitted by LEDs 1510 and diffused by the aforementioned
   diffusive elements can cooperatively generate a mix of light having a diameter of about three
   centimeters.
                                                   24

   1002205903
   [0104]     FIG. 16A shows a downward facing surface of lens array 1524. As depicted, lens
   array 1524 takes the form of a single piece of shaped glass having discrete optics for multiple
   different light sources. In particular, lens array 1524 includes protruding lenses 1602 for
   diffusing light from 19 LEDs 1510 that are arranged in a honeycomb pattern. It should be
 5 appreciated that a larger or smaller number of LEDs 1510 could be accommodated by lens
   array 1524. Furthermore, protruding lenses 1602 could be arranged in an irregular pattern or
   a different regular pattern such as a rectangular grid.
   [0105]     FIG. 16B shows a cross-sectional side view of a portion of convex user interface
    1500 that includes lens array 1524 in accordance with section line E-E. It should be noted
10 that the adhesive layers have been omitted from this view for clarity. In particular LEDs
    1510 are shown attached to LED array board 1506. Five LEDs 1510 are shown emitting light
   into lens array 1524. Protruding lenses 1602 of lens array 1524 diffuse the light received
   from LEDs 1510 prior to the light entering first and second diffuser plates 1530 and 1536.
   As depicted, each of protruding lenses 1602 include a concave surface oriented toward a
15 respective one of LEDs 1510. The diffuser plates can be configured to further diffuse this
   light prior to the light exiting through top cap 1542. By the time the light exits through top
   cap 1542, the light emitted from each LED 1510 can be mixed with light from adjacent ones
   of LEDs 1510. In this way, a relatively small number of LEDs can cooperate to produce a
   mixed pattern of lights at an exterior surface defined by top cap 1542. In some embodiments,
20 the light appearing along the surface can have a total diameter of about 30mm and light from
   each LED 1510 can be spread across a diameter of about 7mm.
   [0106]     FIG. 17A shows a cross-sectional, exploded view of an expandable opening defined
   by one end of fabric 1700. Fabric 1700 can take the form of a tube having a fixed size
   opening at a first end and elastic and/or expandable second end. FIG. 17A depicts the second
25 expandable end. Fabric layers 1702, 1704 and 1706 can be configured to provide a
   cosmetically pleasing exterior surface for a speaker device without inhibiting the passage of
   audio waves generated by the speaker device. Fabric layers 1702, 1704 and 1706 can be
   formed of materials such as polyester, nylon and polyurethane. In some embodiments, fabric
   layer 1702 can have a diamond shaped pattern defining an array of diamond shaped openings
30 that limit the amount of resistance generated by fabric layer 1702. Fabric layer 1702 can be
   adhered to fabric layer 1704 by adhesive layer 1708. While adhesive layer 1708 is depicted
   as a solid layer it should be appreciated that the adhesive can be formed to have the same
   pattern as fabric layer 1702. In this way, an exterior surface of fabric 1700 can be free of
                                                    25

   1002205903
   exposed adhesive material. An inner lip of fabric layer 1704 can be coupled to fabric layer
    1706 by adhesive ring 1710. Fabric layer 1706 can then be secured to upper housing
   component 1126 (not shown, see FIG. 13B). In this way, fabric 1700 can be securely
   coupled to the speaker device.
 5 [0107]     FIG. 17A also shows stitched threading 1712. In some embodiments, stitched
   threading 1712 can be sewn to a lip of fabric layer 1702. Stitched threading 1712 can take
   the form of a fiber arranged in a number of loops arranged along a lip of fabric 1700 and
   sized to accommodate drawstring 1714. Drawstring 1714 can be threaded through the
   openings defined by the loops of stitched threading 1712. By pulling on or releasing both
10 ends of drawstring 1714 the lip of fabric 1700 the opening can be expanded or contracted in
   order to respectively install and remove fabric 1700 from the speaker device.
   [0108]     FIG. 17B shows a cross-sectional view of fabric assembly 1700 fully adhered
   together and how both ends of drawstring 1714 can protrude from the same radial position of
   fabric assembly 1700. Drawstring 1714 can be long enough to wrap around a mounting
15 frame associated with a user interface of the speaker device, which allows for the drawstring
   to smoothly contract the opening 1716 defined by fabric 1700. In some embodiments,
   stitched fabric 1712 and drawstring 1714 can be replaced by an elastic loop insert-molded
   around the lip of fabric 1700. The elastic loop can act similarly to a rubber band and have the
   resilience to securely keep the fabric in place while also allowing the fabric defining opening
20  1716 to be expanded for removal of fabric assembly 1700 off of the speaker device.
   [0109]     FIG. 17C shows a top view of fabric assembly 1700 installed around a portion of
   upper housing component 1126. FIG. 17C shows drawstrings 1714 only partially tightened,
   leaving an annular gap between the opening defined by fabric assembly 1700 and the opening
   defined by upper housing component 1126. FIG. 17D shows how drawstring 1714 can be
25 routed through an opening 1708 defined by mounting frame 1502 and then tightened causing
   fabric assembly 1700 to cinch evenly around a periphery of mounting frame 1502.
   [0110]     FIG. 18 shows an exploded view of a halo assembly 1800. Halo assembly includes
   an upper ring 1802 and a lower ring 1804 that are coupled together by fasteners 1806. Both
   upper and lower rings 1802 and 1804 respectively define cooperatively define threading
30 around their periphery. The threading allows the rings to twist into place within an interior
   volume of a speaker housing. The bottom surface of upper ring 1802 and the top surface of
   lower ring 1804 have complementary geometries that allow the two rings to be radially
                                                   26

   1002205903
   aligned. Furthermore, when the rings are radially aligned the peripheral threading continues
   smoothly across the interface between the two rings. For example, lower ring includes ramp
   feature 1808, which aligns with recessed feature 1810, when the two rings are radially
   aligned. Radial alignment of rings 1802 and 1804 also results in fastener openings 1812
 5 being aligned with fastener openings 1814. Upper ring 1802 can include additional openings
   adjacent to each of openings 1812, which are configured to receive additional fasteners for
   securing other internal components to halo assembly 1800. An interior facing surface of
   upper ring 1802 can include protrusions helping to thicken portions of upper ring 1802 that
   include openings configured to receive fasteners. Halo assembly 1800 also includes seal
10  1124, which can be positioned within groove 1816 and function to prevent audio waves from
   propagating around the periphery of halo assembly 1800.
   [0111]     FIG. 18 also depicts flex connector 1820. Flex connector assembly 1820 can be
   configured to electrically couple components distributed throughout a speaker enclosure. In
   particular, flex connector assembly can extend through opening 1818 in upper ring 1802 to
15 reach electrical component connectors disposed above halo assembly 1800. In some
   embodiments, ring 1804 can also include an opening aligned with opening 1818 to allow for
   the passage of flex connector substrate 1822. Flex connector substrate 1822 can take the
   form of a polyimide substrate. In some embodiments, flex connector assembly 1820 includes
   board to board connector 1824 that is configured to electrically couple with an electrical
20 component such as touch PCB 1514 (see FIG. 15). Flex connector assembly 1820 can
   include other connectors such as connector 1826 that is configured to be electrically coupled
   with speaker drivers at the lower end of an associated speaker device.
   [0112]     FIG. 19 shows a partial cross-sectional view of a speaker device with halo assembly
    1800 installed therein. Upper ring 1802 is depicted in direct contact with lower ring 1804.
25 Fastener 1806 is shown securing upper ring 1802 and lower ring 1804 together after rotating
   the two rings along threads 1902 of housing component 208. Prior to fastener 1806 securing
   the upper and lower rings 1802 and 1804 together, threading 1904 and 1906 could fit
   somewhat loosely between threading 1902. In this way, halo assembly is configured to rotate
   easily into housing component 208. Once the correct position has been achieved, fastener
30  1806 causes threading 1904 and 1906 to bear against threading 1902, which secures halo
   assembly in place and prevents vibration of halo assembly 1800 relative to housing
   component 208. FIG. 19 also shows how fastener 1004 associated with flange 1006 secures
   flange 1006 of subwoofer 802 to upper ring 1802 of halo assembly 1800.
                                                   27

   1002205903
   [0113]     FIG. 20 shows how upper housing component 1126 can be secured to halo assembly
    1800 by fastener 2002. Upper housing component 1126 can include a fastener opening
   allowing fastener 2002 to extend vertically through upper housing component 1126 and
   engage upper ring 1802 of halo assembly 1800. A cosmetic plug 2004 can be inserted in a
 5 recess that surrounds the opening configured to accommodate fastener 2002. Cosmetic plug
   2004 prevents a fabric covering from protruding into the recess and adversely affecting the
   cosmetic appearance of the speaker device. FIG. 20 also shows how seal 1124 can be
   positioned between upper ring 1802 and lower housing component 208, which is operative to
   prevent audio waves from propagating around a periphery of upper ring 1802. The speaker
10 can also include seal 2006, positioned between upper ring 1802 and flange 1006, that can
   help prevent audio waves from propagating through a central opening of upper ring 1802.
   FIG. 20 also illustrates the relative position of stepped threading 1302 of upper housing
   component 1126 and stepped threading 1304 of lower housing component 208.
   [0114]     FIG. 21 shows a perspective view of an alternative upper housing component.
15 Upper housing component 2100 includes diamond shaped vents 2102. Diamond shaped
   vents 2102 can have a shape similar to a pattern of acoustic fabric covering upper housing
   component 2100. Even when diamond shaped vents 2102 are substantially larger than the
   pattern of the acoustic fabric, having a similar pattern results in the pattern contours being
   aligned. This alignment can make the vent openings beneath the acoustic fabric substantially
20 less likely to be seen by a user of a speaker device associated with upper housing component
   2100. In some embodiments, the pattern of the acoustic fabric could be aligned with vents
   2102. For example, the acoustic fabric could be aligned so that a pattern of 4 or 16 diamond
   patterns is aligned within each of vents 2102. In this way the edges of the patterns could be
   aligned, further reducing the likelihood of vents 2102 being visible to a user. Upper housing
25 component 2100 can also include protruding support members 2104 configured to support a
   convex user interface along the lines of convex user interface 1500 as depicted in FIG. 15.
   [0115]     FIG. 22 shows a diagram indicating different types of connected electronics that can
   communicate and/or interact with array speaker 100. In some embodiments, array speaker
    100 can act as a central hub to facilitate home automation. Memory on-board array speaker
30  100 or memory accessible through a network, which is accessible by array speaker 100, can
   be used to store rules governing the interaction of the various depicted device types. Array
   speaker can then send instructions to the disparate devices in accordance with the stored
   rules. Microphones disposed within array speaker 100 can be configure to receive voice
                                                    28

   1002205903
   commands to carry out specific actions related to connected electronics within a user's home.
   In some embodiments, convex user interface can receive commands for adjusting various
   settings on a particular connected electronic device. For example, array speaker 100 can be
   configured to receive commands to make adjustments to smart locking device 2202. In some
 5 embodiments, array speaker 100 can include instructions allowing it to lock and unlock smart
   locking device 2202 in response to a voice command. Furthermore, array speaker 100 can be
   configured to alert occupants within a house that smart locking device 2202 has been
   unlocked. In some embodiments, array speaker 100 can announce the identity of the user
   who unlocked smart locking device 2202. In such a circumstance, smart locking device 2202
10 can be configured to open in response to a command received from an electronic device such
   as a mobile phone. Array speaker 100 can then identify the user when a user is associated
   with that mobile phone. In some embodiments, array speaker 100 can be configured to
   interact with other devices in response to actuation of smart locking device 2202. For
   example, array speaker could direct the illumination of one or more of lights 2204 and adjust
15 a temperature of an HVAC system associated with smart thermometer 2206 in response to the
   unlocking event.
   [0116]     FIG. 22 also shows communication between array speaker 100 and smart garage
   opener 2208. In response to detecting an opening event of smart garage opener 2208, array
   speaker could be configured to perform similar actions described above with respect to the
20 operation of smart locking device 2202. In some embodiments, different ones of lights 2204
   could be illuminated in anticipation of the user entering the housing from a different
   direction.
   [0117]     Array speaker 100 could also be configured to operate different smart devices in
   accordance with various calendar events associated with an electronic calendar. For example,
25 array speaker could be configured to disable surveillance camera 2210 during an event
   located in the same room as surveillance camera 2210 when that event is marked as private.
   Array speaker could also be configured to notify one or more users if window sensor 2212
   indicates a window remains open after a particular time of day or night. In some
   embodiments, array speaker 100 can act as a media hub cooperating with other components
30 such as television/monitor 2214 to present both video and audio content in response to
   various user inputs and/or smart device activities. For example, televisions/monitor 2214
   could present a status screen and/or progress monitor indicating the status and/or activity
   being performed by other components that may or may not have the ability to present a
                                                  29

   1002205903
   graphical interface to a user of array speaker 100. In some embodiments, array speaker could
   be configured to remotely direct refrigerator 2216 to send the user images of interior areas of
   refrigerator 2216 shortly before a user has a grocery shopping trip scheduled. While these
   various operations could be stored in internal memory of array speaker 100, array speaker
 5  100 can also be in communication with a cloud service provider helping to coordinate various
   activities with users that may or may not be connected with a local area network with array
   speaker 100. For example, a user could connect remotely with array speaker 100 with a
   device such as a smart phone to activate certain tasks for smart components with which array
   speaker 100 is in communication.
10 [0118]     In some embodiments, array speaker can be configured to interact with wearable
   display 2218. Wearable display 2218 can take the form of augmented reality or virtual reality
   goggles that present digital content to a user. When wearable display 2218 is an augmented
   reality display, wearable display 2218 can overlay various control interfaces around array
   speaker 100. For example, virtual content could overlay convex user interface atop array
15 speaker 100 to make the user interface larger. In some embodiments, the enlarged user
   interface could include an expanded display and enlarged control manipulation regions that
   allow a user to control array speaker 100 with more efficiently and/or with a greater degree of
   options. For example, user interface could be configured to display a virtual graphics
   equalizer allowing a user to increase or reduce treble and/or bass output associated with the
20 audio being generated by array speaker 100. In some embodiments, a user could be
   presented with an overlay that visualized the various regions of the room covered by each of
   a number of speaker drivers contained within array speaker 100. The user could then be able
   to adjust audio output specific to a particular region associated with one or more speaker
   drivers. For example, the user could identify only the depicted regions containing individuals
25 listening to the audio output from array speaker 100. Furthermore, the user could reduce the
   audio output for a first user positioned in a first region of the array speaker associated with a
   first audio driver and increase the audio output for a second user positioned in a second
   region of the array speaker associated with a second audio driver. In this way, listeners can
   enjoy audio at a desired volume and the virtual interface allows the user to quickly identify
30 the regions within which various listeners are located. In some embodiments, array speaker
    100 can include various indicia that help circuitry and sensors associated with wearable
   display 2218 to orient the virtual content relative to array speaker 100. For example, since
   array speaker 100 is cylindrical it could be difficult to determine a radial position of each of
                                                    30

   1002205903
   the speaker drivers within array speaker 100. Small indicia such as decorative symbols could
   be embedded within acoustic fabric covering array speaker 100. In this way, the various
   listening zones could be more accurately associated with array speaker 100. In some
   embodiments, array speaker 100 can include optical sensors configured to identify the
 5 position of various listeners in a room and then change the audio output to improve the audio
   experience for the identified listeners.
   [0119]     In some embodiments, wearable display device can be configured to receive optical
   commands from array speaker 100. For example, a display associated with a user interface
   can be configured to output particular patterns of light. Optical sensors of wearable display
10 device 2218 can identify the patterns of light and in response vary the display in some
   manner. For example, the type, size and orientation of virtual controls displayed by wearable
   display 2218 can be varied in accordance with the output of the display associated with the
   user interface.
   [0120]     FIG. 23 shows a block diagram illustrating communication and interoperability
15 between various electrical components of array speaker 100. Processor 2302 can be in
   communication with the depicted electrical components. User interface 2304 can receive
   user inputs that are then received by processor 2302. In response to the user inputs, processor
   2302 can interpret and relay signals corresponding to the received user inputs to other
   electrical components. For example, user interface can receive user inputs directing an
20 increase in output of both subwoofer 2306 and audio driver assemblies 2308. In some
   embodiments, the electrical components can all be linked together by electrically conductive
   pathways established by components such as flex connector 1820, which is able to route
   electrical signals to various electrical components distributed throughout a device housing of
   array speaker 100. Array speaker 100 can also include display system 2312. Display system
25 2312 can be configured to provide visual feedback to a user of array speaker 100. For
   example, the visual feedback can be provided in response to interaction with a voice assistant
   such as the Siri    voice assistant produced by Apple Inc., of Cupertino, CA. In some
   embodiments, an array of colorful mosaic patterns could be presented while a voice request is
   being processed and/or as the voice assistant is waiting for the voice request. Array speaker
30 can also include a computer readable medium 2314. Computer readable medium 2314 can be
   configured to store or at least cache an amount of media files for playback by subwoofer
   2306 and audio driver assemblies 2308. In some embodiments, the media files stored on
   computer readable medium 2314 can include, e.g., movies, TV shows, pictures, audio
                                                   31

   1002205903
   recordings and music videos. In some embodiments, a video portion of a media file can be
   transmitted to another device for display by wireless communication system 2316. This
   could be desirable even when display system 2312 is showing the video portion since another
   device may have a larger or more easily viewable display for a particular user. For example,
 5 the other display device could be selected in accordance with a user's position within a room.
   [0121]     FIG. 23 also shows RAM/ROM component 2318. RAM/ROM component 2318
   can include RAM (random access memory) for short term caching of frequently used
   information and/or information cued just prior to playback. ROM (read only memory) can be
   used to store computer code such as device drivers and lower level code used in the basic
10 operation of array speaker 100. In some embodiments, RAM/ROM component 2318 can
   take the form of two separate components.
   [0122]     FIG. 23 also shows how array speaker 100 can also include a sensor array 2320 that
   includes microphones, proximity sensors, touch sensors, accelerometers and the like.
   Microphones of sensor array 2320 could be configured to monitor for voice commands. In
15 some embodiments, the microphones could be configured to process voice commands only
   after recognizing a command phrase indicating the user's intent to issue a voice command.
   Microphones can be interspersed radially along the outside of the device housing so that the
   housing doesn't mask or obscure the voice commands. Multiple microphones can also be
   utilized to triangulate a position of a user within the room. In certain instances it may be
20 desirable to optimize audio output or cue additional smart devices (see FIG. 22) in
   accordance with a determined location of the user.
   [0123]     In addition to identifying a user's location by triangulation with spatially dispersed
   microphones, proximity sensors can be distributed along the exterior surface of array speaker
    100 in order to help identify the presence of users and/or obstructions surrounding array
25 speaker 100. In some embodiments, the proximity sensors can be configured to emit infrared
   pulses that help characterize objects surrounding array speaker 100. The pulses reflected
   back to the sensor can be processed by processor 2302, which can then make a
   characterization of any objects surrounding array speaker 100. In some embodiments, an
   audio output of array speaker 100 can be adjusted in situations where surrounding objects
30 substantially change the expected audio output of array speaker 100. For example, if array
   speaker 100 is positioned against a wall or column the infrared sensors could identify the
   obstruction and attenuate or cease output of speaker drivers pointed toward the wall or
                                                    32

   1002205903
   column. The reflected pulses and audio triangulation data can be combined to further refine
   the position of a user delivering instructions to array speaker 100. Sensor array 2320 can also
   include touch sensors that allow a user to input commands along an exterior surface of array
   speaker 100. For example, touch PCB 1514 of the convex user interface depicted in FIG. 15
 5 is configured to detect user gestures made along top cap 1542 and interpret the gestures as
   various instructions to be carried out by one or more components of array speaker 100.
   [0124]     Sensor array 2320 can also include one or more accelerometers. The
   accelerometers can be configured to measure any tilt of array speaker 100 with respect to a
   gravitational reference frame. Since array speaker 100 is optimized to evenly distribute audio
10 content in a room when positioned on a flat surface, placing array speaker 100 on an inclined
   or declined surface could negatively impact the acoustic output of array speaker 100. In
   response to the accelerometer determining array speaker 100 is tilted at an angle of greater
   than 2 degrees, array speaker could be configured to prompt the user to find a flatter surface
   to place array speaker on. Alternatively, array speaker can be configured to alter the sound
15 output to compensate for the tilted angle. In some embodiments, accelerometers could also
   be configured to monitor for any resonant vibrations within array speaker 100. Processor
   2302 could then be configured to adjust the audio output to help subwoofer 2306 and/or
   audio driver assemblies 2308 avoid or reduce the generation of frequencies that cause array
   speaker 100 to vibrate at one or more resonant frequencies.
20 [0125]     The various aspects, embodiments, implementations or features of the described
   embodiments can be used separately or in any combination. Various aspects of the described
   embodiments can be implemented by software, hardware or a combination of hardware and
   software. The described embodiments can also be embodied as computer readable code on a
   computer readable medium for controlling operation of the array speaker. In some
25 embodiments, the computer readable medium can include code for interacting with other
   connected devices within a user's home. For example, the array speaker could be configured
   to use its ambient light sensor to identify human activity and to learn when to activate and
   deactivate certain devices within the user's home. The computer readable medium is any
   data storage device that can store data, which can thereafter be read by a computer system.
30 Examples of the computer readable medium include read-only memory, random-access
   memory, CD-ROMs, HDDs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and optical data storage devices. The
   computer readable medium can also be distributed over network-coupled computer systems
   so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
