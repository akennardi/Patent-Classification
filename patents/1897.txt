          The compound referred to herein as MA-1 is (1R-trans)-N-[[2-(2,3-dihydro-4
   benzofuranyl)cyclopropyl]methyl]propanamide. It is disclosed in U.S. 5,856,529,
   which is incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth.
          MA-1 is a specific and potent agonist of the MT1 R and MT2R melatonin
25 receptors in the Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the region of the brain associated
   with the biological clock. (Kokkola,T. & Laitinen,J.T. Melatonin receptor genes. Ann.

  Med 30, 88-94 (1998).) Engagement of these receptors by melatonin is believed to
  regulate circadian rhythms, including the sleep/wake cycle. Consistent with its
  receptor binding profile, MA-1 demonstrates potent chronobiotic activity in preclinical
  models of acute phase-shifting and chronic re-entrainment.
5 Previous studies showed that MA-1 is well-tolerated by healthy volunteers in single
  doses up to 300 mg and in multiple doses (up to 28 days) up to 150 mg. A 28-day
  Phase II study was also conducted to investigate the effects of MA-1 in elderly
  patients with primary insomnia. In this study MA-1 did not differentiate from

placebo with respect to sleep latency and the number of nocturnal awakenings.
While patients with the lowest melatonin levels (< 5 mg) may have benefited from
MA-1 treatment more than placebo, the design of this study made it difficult to
interpret the effects of MA-1 on the sleep-wake cycle.
                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        This invention relates to the discovery of effective doses of MA-1.   In an
illustrative embodiment, it comprises a method of administering MA-1 to a human
subject in need thereof which comprises orally administering MA-1 to the subject in
an amount of about 10 mg to about 100 mg per day.
                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        This invention, which is hereinafter described with respect to illustrative
emdodiments, contemplates use of the melatonin agonist herein referred to as MA-1,
to treat sleep disorders and circadian rhythm disorders. MA-1 is a white to off-white
powder with a melting point of about 780C (DSC) and has the structure illustrated in
Formula 1.
Formula 1: MA-1 Chemical Structure
        This invention comprises internal administration of MA1 to a patient, typically
an adult, of typical size, e.g., approximately 70 Kg and typically within the range of
about 45 to about 150 kg, who is in need thereof in doses of from about 10 mg/day
to about 100 mg/day.
                                           -2-

   WO 2007/137244                                                     PCT/US2007/069411
       Typically the drug is administered in immediate release form but controlled
release forms are included within the scope of the invention. The drug can be
delivered alone or in combination with another active pharmaceutical ingredient.
       The route of administration is usually oral although other routes of
administration, e.g., parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, buccal, lozenge,
transdermal, transmucosal, etc., can be used. Controlled release forms, e.g.,
sustained, pulsatile, or delayed, including depot forms such as are disclosed in
W02003037337 or W02004006886, can also be used.
       The compositions are preferably formulated in an oral unit dosage form, each
dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg of MA-1. The term "unit dosage
form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human
subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated
to produce the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect over the course of a
treatment period, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. So, for
example, an adult patient suffering a circadian rhythm disorder could be prescribed
1-4 tablets, each having about 5 to about 100 mg of MA-1 for a total daily dose of
about 10 to about 100 mg/day. The term, "about" means, in general, a range of plus
or minus ten percent, except that with respect to whole single digit or fractional
values, the range is within plus or minus one of the last digit recited. Thus, "about
100" includes 90 to 110, "about 5" includes 4 to 6, and "about 1.5" includes 1.4 to
1.6. In no event can the term, "about," include a nonsensical value such as a value
that exceeds 100% or is less than zero.
       An effective amount, quantitatively, may vary, e.g., depending upon the
patient, the severity of the disorder or symptom being treated, and the route of
administration. Such dose can be determined by routine studies. In general, for
                                           -3-

   WO 2007/137244                                                        PCT/US2007/069411
systemic administration, e.g., oral administration, the dose of MA-1 will be in the
range of about 10 to about 100 mg/day, in one or more unit dosage forms.
        It will be understood that the dosing protocol including the amount of MA-1 or
MA-2 actually administered will be determined by a physician in the light of the
relevant circumstances including, for example, the condition to be treated, the
chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual
patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. Patients should of course be
monitored for possible adverse events.
       Particle size will also affect the dose selected. At larger particle sizes, i.e.,
D50 is greater than about 100 um, e.g., about 100 to about 200 um, oral doses at
the higher end, i.e., up to about 100 mg are effective, whereas at smaller particle
sizes, i.e., D50 is less than about 100 um, e.g., about 20 to about 50 um, lower
doses, i.e., less than about 100 mg, are useful, e.g., about 10 mg to about 80 mg
and about 20 mg to about 50 mg. (Particle size measurements supporting the above
were made laser diffraction using a Malvern Mastersizer. The D50 (D10, D90, D100)
value means that 50% (10%, 90%, 100%) of the particles by weight are of the
indicated diameter or smaller.) In one embodiment of the invention, the above doses
are administered in immediate release form, i.e., a non-controlled release
formulation.
        If desired, doses can optionally be adjusted for body size using the following
as guidance: useful amounts for larger particles are up to about 1.5 mg/kg; useful
amounts for smaller particles include doses of less than about 1.5 mg/kg, e.g., about
.1 mg/kg to about 1.2 mg/kg and about .3 mg/kg to about .7 mg/kg.
       Treatment is continued until the patient's circadian rhythm is restored to
normal, i.e., until the patient's normal daily functioning is not inhibited by the
                                            -4-

    WO 2007/137244                                                     PCT/US2007/069411
circadian rhythm disorder or, in the case of a sleep disorder, until the patient is
sleeping normally, i.e., until the patient's normal daily functioning is not inhibited by
the sleep disorder. Treatment can continue for some time after these end points are
achieved so as to lessen the likelihood of relapse.
         For therapeutic or prophylactic use, MA-1 or MA-2 will normally be
administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as the (or an) essential
active ingredient at least one such compound in association with a solid or liquid
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically
acceptable adjuvants and excipients employing standard and conventional
techniques.
         MA-1 is very soluble or freely soluble in 95% ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile,
ethyl acetate, isopropanol, polyethylene glycols (PEG-300 and PEG-400), and only
slightly soluble in water. The native pH of a saturated solution of MA-1 in water is
8.5 and its aqueous solubility is practically unaffected by pH.
         Pharmaceutical compositions useful in the practice of this invention include
suitable dosage forms for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,
intradermal and intravenous), transdermal, bronchial or nasal administration. Thus,
if a solid carrier is used, the preparation may be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin
capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The solid
carrier may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tableting
lubricants, disintegrants, wetting agents and the like. The tablet may, if desired, be
film coated by conventional techniques. If a liquid carrier is employed, the
preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile
vehicle for injection, an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension, or may be a dry
product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Liquid
                                             -5-

   WO 2007/137244                                                     PCT/US2007/069411
preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents,
emulsifying agents, wetting agents, non-aqueous vehicle (including edible oils),
preservatives, as well as flavoring and/or coloring agents. For parenteral
administration, a vehicle normally will comprise sterile water, at least in large part,
although saline solutions, glucose solutions and like may be utilized. Injectable
suspensions also may be used, in which case conventional suspending agents may
be employed. Conventional preservatives, buffering agents and the like also may be
added to the parenteral dosage forms. Particularly useful is the administration of a
compound of Formula I in oral dosage formulations. The pharmaceutical
compositions may be prepared by conventional techniques appropriate to the
desired preparation containing appropriate amounts of MA-1 or MA-2. See, for
example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company,
Easton, Pa., 17th edition, 1985.
        In making pharmaceutical compositions for use in the invention, the active
ingredient(s) will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed
within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other
container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid
material which acts as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient.
Thus, the composition can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges,
sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a
solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing for example up to 10% by weight of
the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable
solutions and sterile packaged powders.
        Some examples of suitable carriers and diluents include lactose, dextrose,
sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates,

   WO 2007/137244                                                     PCT/US2007/069411
tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
cellulose, water, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl- and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc,
magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include
lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving
agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention
may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active
ingredient after administration to the patient.
        The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each
dosage containing from about 0.1 to about 100 mg of the active ingredient. The term
"unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for
human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity
of active material calculated to produce the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect
over the course of a treatment period, in association with the required
pharmaceutical carrier. So, for example, an adult patient suffering a depressive
disorder could be prescribed 1-4 tablets, each having 5-100 mg of MA-1, to be taken
once, twice or three times daily and might expect improvement in his or her condition
within about one to about 12 weeks.
        A typical unit dose form could be size 0 or size 1 capsule comprising 20, 50,
or 100 mg of MA-1 in addition to anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon
dioxide colloidal, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. Storage at 15 to
200C with protection from moisture and sunlight is recommended.
        In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, the D50 of the MA-1
administered is less than about 100 um, for example, about 20 to about 50 um or
about 30 to 40 um.
                                           -7-

        MA-1 can also be formulated in a controlled release form, e.g., delayed,
sustained, or pulsatile release. MA-1 can also be administered concomitantly with
other drug therapies, including but not limited to other antidepressant drug therapies
or other drug therapies for treating other emotional disorders. So, for example, the
invention encompasses administration of MA-1 or MA-2 in combination with other
melatonergic agonists or other sleep-inducing agents.
Examples
        The examples that follow are illustrative and not limiting of the invention and
illustrate the usefulness of MA-1 in the prevention and treatment of symptoms of
depressive disorders.
Example 1.
        A clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety of MA-1 as well as to
determine the ability of MA-1 to shift the sleep/wake cycle following a 5 hour
advance in bedtime. The study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
placebo-controlled study. It consisted of a 2-4 week outpatient screening period
followed by an 8-day inpatient stay. After acclimating to the sleep lab, bedtime was
advanced by 5 hours. The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the
exposure-response to MA-1 on advancement of circadian release of endogenous
melatonin rhythm as measured by dim light melatonin onset (DLMO, a biomarker of
the sleep-wake cycle), to investigate the exposure-response to MA-1 on mean sleep
efficiency parameters as measured by PSG, to investigate the exposure-response to
MA-1 on objective neurobehavioral performance lapses during scheduled work-time
as measured by computerized continuous performance testing, and to assess the
safety and tolerability of MA-1. Forty-five healthy volunteers, men and women aged
                                            -8-

   WO 2007/137244                                                   PCT/US2007/069411
18-50, were enrolled into this study. Thirty-nine subjects were randomized. The
results of this study are presented below.
        The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of four oral doses
of MA-1 (10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) compared to matching placebo on
circadian phase shift, sleep parameters during the major sleep episode, and subject
alertness. After written informed consent was signed, subjects that met the
inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening and baseline were enrolled into the 8-day in
patient portion of the study. All in-patient assessments were conducted in a time
isolation sleep lab in which no time cues were available to subjects. During the first
three nights, subjects were given placebo 30 minutes prior to bedtime (11:00 PM) in
a single-blind fashion. Baseline assessments for the efficacy parameters were
measured during this period. At 5:00 PM on day 3, subjects started a 19 hour Pre
constant posture (CP) segment during which time the subjects remained seated in a
semi-recumbent position and blood samples were collected approximately every
hour from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The purpose of the pre-CP segment is to provide a
measure of each subject's circadian phase before the start of the night shift
segment. On day 4, subjects were randomized to once daily treatment in one of the
five treatment groups. In addition, subject sleep-wake routines were advanced 5
hours, such that subjects were required to sleep from approximately 6:00 PM - 2:00
AM. Treatment was administered and the time shift was maintained for 3 days.
Efficacy parameters were collected during this time. To measure circadian phase at
the end of the study, a 24-hour post-CP was conducted immediately after the
treatment segment on day 7. Over the course of the study, approximately 500 mL of
blood was drawn from each subject. Safety was assessed throughout the study, at
                                            -9-

   WO 2007/137244                                                    PCT/US2007/069411
the end of study (EOS) visit on day 8, and at the Follow-up visit. The target number
of subjects for enrollment was 40 but 45 were actually enrolled.
        The particle size of the MA-1 used in this study was:
         D10                    D50                    D90                    D100
        10 um                  115 um                316 um                 631 um
        It is hypothesized that in order to achieve maximum efficacy peak plasma
concentrations of MA-1 should coincide with the time that subjects go to bed. Since
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached at 0.5-1 hour after oral
administration 4 5' , MA-1 was administered 30 minutes prior to bedtime. A placebo
control was used to distinguish the effects of the drug from other components of
treatment in the study population over a defined treatment period.
        The oral doses selected were based on safety and efficacy data obtained
from previous MA-1 pre-clinical and clinical trials. In vitro pharmacologic models of
acute and chronic phase-shifting demonstrated chronobiotic activity at doses ranging
from 1 to 5 mg/kg. Extrapolation of these data to humans suggests that the 0.14 to
0.71 mg/kg, or 10 to 50 mg in a 70 kg subject, should effectively advance the sleep
wake cycle. Though not optimally designed to assess the chronobiotic potential of
MA-1, clinical trial CN116-002 measured the effects MA-1 on the circadian sleep
wake cycle. Results from that study showed that 50 mg MA-1 consistently shifted
circadian rhythms. The doses selected for the study (10, 20, 50 and 100 mg) were
within the expected dose range for efficacy. The safety of the selected doses for this
study is supported by previous clinical studies. In Phase I clinical trials, a single oral
dose of 1 to 300 mg of MA-1 was safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.
Additionally, safety and tolerability of MA-1 at doses up to 150 mg has been
demonstrated in daily administration for 28 days in healthy subjects and elderly
                                            -10-

    WO 2007/137244                                                   PCT/US2007/069411
subjects with chronic insomnia. The highest dose in the study, 100 mg, is well within
the safety margin established in both Phase I single and multiple ascending dose
trials and in a Phase Il study.
        To assess circadian sleep-wake cycles in the study, plasma melatonin levels
were assessed. The onset of melatonin production, or dim light melatonin onset
(DLMO), is associated with onset of sleep. DLMO is considered a standard marker
used frequently to assess circadian phase 4 . To assess the effects of MA-I on the
sleep-wake cycles, DLMO was monitored in subjects before and after treatment. For
this study, DLMO was defined as the time when melatonin production reaches 25%
of the nightly peak (MEL25%up) of the fitted melatonin phase curve 7 .
        Because light has a significant confounding effect on melatonin release, light
levels in the sleep laboratory were carefully regulated. Subjects were exposed to a
light intensity of 25 lux in the angle of gaze (50 lux maximum light intensity in the
room) during the awake portions of the protocol, except in the first 6 hours of the CP
segment. Twenty-five lux in the angle of gaze was chosen because this low intensity
reduces the phase-shifting effect of light and is also consistent with the light
exposure many shift workers experience at work. Subjects were exposed to a light
intensity of less than 2 lux in the angle of gaze (8 lux maximum intensity in the room)
during the first 6 hours of the CP segments. Endogenous melatonin production,
including the onset and maximum plasma concentration, is measured during the CP
portion of the protocol. Low light intensity was chosen to eliminate the effect of light
on endogenous melatonin secretion.
DLMO
        DLMO is a biomarker of the circadian sleep-wake cycle. One of the primary
objectives of this study was to investigate the exposure-response of MA-1 on the
                                             -11-

    WO 2007/137244                                                    PCT/US2007/069411
sleep-wake cycle as measured by DLMO. To construct the melatonin phase curve,
plasma melatonin levels (pg/ml) were measured once every 30 minutes during the
first 14 hours of the CP segments and hourly for the remainder of the CP segments.
The full melatonin phase curve was constructed so that peak melatonin
concentrations could be defined. Based on peak melatonin concentrations, DLMO,
defined as 25% of the peak, was determined. During double-blind treatment (Days
4-6), plasma melatonin levels were measured every 30 minutes from 4:00 PM to
2:00 AM. This window of time was estimated to contain the DLMO. To determine if
any dose of MA-1 induced a phase-shift in circadian rhythm, the difference between
DLMO on treatment days and baseline for MA-1-treated subject was compared
against the difference between DLMO on treatment days and baseline for placebo
treated subjects.
Sleep Efficiency
        Another primary objective of this study was to investigate the exposure
response to MA-1 on mean sleep efficiency parameters. Sleep efficiency (time
asleep/time in bed * 100%) was measured using polysomnography (PSG). A variety
of sensors were applied to the subjects with paste or tape through which brain
waves, eye movements, muscle tone, body movements, heart rate, and breathing
were recorded. Audiovisual recordings were also taken. PSG recording was done
during the sleep episodes of days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of this study (referred to as
Nights 1-7). Sleep efficiencies of MA-1-treated subjects were compared with sleep
efficiencies from placebo-treated subjects. Data from PSG on Nights 3 and 7 were
not analyzed.

Secondary Efficacy Parameters

these recordings sleep latency (latency to persistent sleep) and wake after sleep
onset (WASO) were calculated. PSG on Nights 3 and 7 was not analyzed.
Efficacy Analyses
       Primary Efficacy Variables
Dim Liqht Melatonin Onset
       Peak melatonin was determined from a subject's melatonin values as the
mean of the maximal values obtained on Night 3 and Night 7; if melatonin was not
sampled on one of these days (or if there were inadequate samples obtained during
the period at which melatonin should peak), peak melatonin was the peak for the
other day. For the primary analysis, threshold was calculated as 25% of peak
melatonin (DLMO25%). DLMO was calculated by linear interpolation of these
melatonin values and the corresponding time points.
       The differences in DLMO25% between the endpoint day (Nights 4, 5 and 6)
and baseline (Night 3) were analyzed by comparing pairwise each dose group to
placebo using a linear one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model using in SAS@
(SAS@ Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Means were calculated using the LS Means
method in SAS@. Standard deviations were calculated using the Statistical
Summary function in SAS@. Other statistical tests were also presented in graphics.
These included: linear regression of response vs. exposure (dose, AUC, or Cmax),
Kendall-tau nonparametric regression, and Spearman nonparametric regression.

Sleep Efficiency
        Another primary outcome of interest was sleep efficiency (SE). SE (%) was
defined as the total time asleep divided by the time allowed as an opportunity for
sleep in a period multiplied by 100%. SE over portions of the night was also
analyzed, including first and second halves of the night, and first, second and final
thirds of the night. Time allowed for sleep was 8 hours (480 minutes).
        The effect of treatment (Nights 4, 5, and 6) vs. baseline (Night 2) was based
on the difference between SE values on these days. The overall mean sleep
efficiency on Nights 4, 5, and 6 was also calculated and compared to baseline. The
same baseline and endpoint days were used for the portions of the night analyses.
The differences in SE between the endpoint day and baseline were analyzed by
comparing pairwise each dose group to placebo using a linear one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) model in SAS@ (SAS@ Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Means
were calculated using the LS Means method in SAS@. Standard deviations were
calculated using the Statistical Summary function in SAS@. Other statistical tests
were also presented in graphics. These included: linear regression of response vs.
exposure (dose, AUC, or Cmax), Kendall-tau nonparametric regression, and
Spearman nonparametric regression.
        Secondary Efficacy Variable(s)
DLMO - Time to Onset and Lowest Effective Dose
        Time (day) at which maximum advance in the circadian period occurred was
determined by comparing DLMO25% from baseline and treated nights for all
subjects, as described above. Additionally, the lowest effective dose was also
determined by comparing DLMO25% from baseline and treated nights as described
                                           -14-

above. The first dose with a statistically significant p-value in the ANOVA with
pairwise contrast was considered the lowest effective dose.
Sleep and PSG-based Outcomes
        Sleep latency (latency to persistent sleep and wake after sleep onset (WASO)
were measured by PSG on Nights 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
        The differences in these sleep parameters between the endpoint day and
baseline were analyzed by comparing pairwise each dose group to placebo using a
linear one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model in SAS@ (SAS@ Institute, Cary,
North Carolina). Means were calculated using the LS Means method in SAS®.
Standard deviations were calculated using the Statistical Summary function in
SAS®. Other statistical tests were also presented in graphics. These included:
linear regression of response vs. exposure (dose, AUC, or Cmax), Kendall-tau
nonparametric regression, and Spearman nonparametric regression.
Primary Efficacy Results
11.1.1.1       Shift of Dim Light Melatonin Onset
In this study, Dim Light Melatonin Onset 2 5 %,LOQ5 (DLMO   2 5 %,LOQ5) was defined as the
time when melatonin production reached 25% of the maximum melatonin
concentration (MELmax) and samples below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the
melatonin assay were assigned 5 pg/ml. LOQ5 represents half of the lowest level of
quantification for the assay (10 pg/ml) and is a more probable value to estimate for
samples below the limit of quantification than assigning a value of zero.
        MA-1, when compared to placebo, was able to induce a forward shift in
DLMO 2 5 %,LOQ5 on the first night of treatment (Night 4) when compared to baseline
DLMO 2 5 %,LOQ5 (Night 3) in a dose-dependent manner (Table 11.1.1).

 Change in Sleep Efficiency
         The ability of MA-1 to correct the disruption in sleep caused by a phase
 advance was investigated by comparing the change in sleep efficiencies of MA-1
 treated subjects upon a phase advance against the change in sleep efficiencies in
 placebo upon a phase advance. Sleep efficiency (time asleep/opportunity to sleep        *
 100%) was measured objectively by overnight polysomnogramic recordings.
 Polysomnographic recording from baseline (Night 1 and 2) and on treatment nights
 4, 5, and 6 were analyzed for this study.

Full Night Sleep Efficiency
        MA-1 was able to minimize the disruption in full night sleep efficiency between
Night 4 and Night 2 in a dose-related manner. (Table 11.1.2).

Sleep Efficiency in Parts of the Niqht
        Sleep efficiency was also compared in parts of the night by dividing the full
night into thirds. MA-1 improved sleep efficiency in the middle third of the night in a
dose-related manner. (Table 11.1.2).
11.1.2       Secondary Efficacy Results
11.1.2.1        DLMO Shift - Time to Onset and Lowest Effective Dose
        As detailed in Section 11.1.1.1, MA-1, when compared to placebo, was able
to induce a forward shift in DLMO     2 5 %,LOQ5 on the first night of treatment (Night 4)
when compared to baseline (Night 3) in a dose-dependent manner (Table 11.1.1,
Figure 11.1.1). While nonparametric analysis clearly indicates an overall dose
response, the MA-1 100 mg dose is considered the lowest effective dose for DLMO
shift since it was the first dose with a statistically significant p-value in the ANOVA
with contrasts.
11.1.2.2        Other Sleep Parameters
         In addition to sleep efficiency, the exposure-response of MA-1 on sleep
latency, sleep maintenance, and sleep architecture were examined.
Sleep Latency
        MA-1, when compared to placebo, was able to reduce latency to persistent
sleep (LPS) on the first night of treatment (Night 4) when compared to baseline
(Night 2) (Table 11.1.3).

       Wake after sleep onset (WASO) was calculated as both a unit of time
(number of minutes that a subject was awake after falling into persistent sleep) and

as a fraction (fraction of time that the subject was awake in the time frame from
persistent sleep to lights on). Statistical significance was achieved when the MA-1
100 mg dose was compared to placebo in WASO as both a unit of time and as a
fraction (Table 11.1.4). While dose response as measured by nonparametric
analyses was not statistically significant, linear regression analysis of change in
WASO at each dose tested demonstrates that the MA-1 100 mg dose was able to
minimize the disruption in wake after sleep onset between Day 4 and Day 2 in the
majority of subjects in this treatment arm.
Sleen Architecture and REM Polarity
        MA-1 did not change the percentage of time in each sleep stage between
Night 4 and Night 2.
        On Night 4, MA-1 was able to minimize the disruption in REM polarity caused
by a phase advance by increasing the number of episodes of REM during the final
third of the night. After Hour 4 on Night 4, there were fewer cumulative episodes of
REM with placebo compared to the larger doses of MA-1. This disruption in REM
polarity was not observed on Night 2.
        Additional analyses evaluated cumulative REM epochs during the thirds of the
night. MA-1 was able to induce a dose-related increase in the number of episodes of
REM during the final third of the night consistent with preserving the REM sleep
architecture of Night 2 prior to the phase advance.
Example 2.
        A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of single oral doses of

VEC-162 (20, 50, and 100 mg) and matching placebo in healthy male and female
subjects with induced transient insomnia. Approximately four hundred subjects were
randomized in approximately a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the treatment groups.
        In general, a screening period began 14 to 35 days prior to the start of the
evaluation period, which was Day 1. Prior to Day 1, subjects were asked to increase
their sleep time to 9 hours per night. Drug, or placebo, was administered on Night 1,
approximately 0.5 hour prior to lights off.
        The primary efficacy variable was LPS. LPS is defined as the length of time
elapsed between lights off and onset of persistent sleep. In this trial, persistent sleep
is defined as the point at which 10 minutes of uninterrupted sleep has begun. Sleep
was determined on the basis of polysomnography (PSG).
        Secondary efficacy parameters included the following:
        Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO): WASO is defined as the time spent awake
between onset of sleep and Lights On during Night 1, determined by PSG.
        Latency to Non-Awake (LNA): LNA is defined as the number of minutes to
reach any stage of sleep.
        Total Sleep Time (TST): TST is defined as the number of minutes spent
asleep during the entire time in bed.

       respectively.
       The trial also demonstrated that VEC-1 62 was well-tolerated at all doses.
       Several conclusions can be drawn from Examples 1 and 2. These include but
are not necessarily limited to the following.
   -   MA-1 was well-tolerated at doses of 10, 20, 50, and 100mg.
   -   MA-1, when compared to placebo, induced a forward shift in DLMO 2 5 %,LOQ5
       on the first night of treatment in a dose-dependent manner.
   -   MA-1 minimized the disruption in sleep efficiency (full night and middle third of
       the night) caused by a phase advance.
   -   MA-1 minimized the disruption in REM polarity caused by a phase advance by
       increasing in the number of episodes of REM during the final third of the night.
   -   MA-1 minimized the disruption in wake after sleep onset (WASO) caused by a

    -  The Cmax values increased in a manner approximately proportional to the
       dose. AUC increased approximately proportional to dose.
    -  Exposure levels were not affected by age, weight, height, gender, creatinine
       clearance, or ALT baseline levels.
    -  50 mg was more efficacious than 100 mg despite both doses being well
       tolerated, indicating that a single oral dose of about 50 mg is preferable to an
       oral dose of about 100 mg.
    -  20 mg was comparable or superior to 100 mg in efficacy despite 100 mg
       being well-tolerated, indicating that a single oral dose of about 20 mg is
       preferable to an oral dose of about 100 mg.
    -  An oral dose of about 20 to about 50 mg is effective in treating sleep
       disorders.
    -  An oral dose of about 20 to about 50 mg is effective in treating sleep disorders
       when administered about 1/2 hour before sleep time.

                                       CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A method of administering MA-1 to a human subject in need thereof which
comprises orally administering MA-1 to the subject in an amount of about 10 mg to
about 100 mg per day.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein MA-1 is administered at a daily dose of about 0.1
mg/kg to about 1.5 mg/kg.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the dose is about 10 mg to about 50 mg.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the dose is about 20 mg to about 50 mg.
5. The method of claim 1, 2, 3, or 4, wherein MA-1 is being administered to treat or
prevent a circadian rhythm disorder or a sleep disorder.
6. The method of claim 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, wherein the condition being treated or
prevented is waking after sleep onset and the MA-1 is orally administered at a dose
of about 20 to about 50 mg per day.
7. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein MA-1 is administered at or
within about 2 hours prior to bedtime.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein MA-1 is administered at about 0.5 hours prior to
bedtime.

9. The method of claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8, wherein the MA-1 is orally administered
at a dose of about 20 mg/day or about 50 mg/day.
10.The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the condition being treated
or prevented is long sleep latency and the MA-1 is orally administered at a dose of
about 10 mg/day.
11.The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the condition being treated
or prevented is long sleep latency and the MA-1 is orally administered at a dose of
about 20 mg/day.
12.The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the condition being treated
or prevented is long sleep latency and the MA-1 is orally administered at a dose of
about 50 mg/day.
13.The method of any of the preceding claims wherein, MA-1 is orally administered
at a dose of about 100 mg/day.
14.The method of any of the preceding claims wherein the D 50 of the MA-1 is less
than about 100 um.
15.The method of any of the preceding claims wherein the D 50 of the MA-1 is about
20 um to about 50 um.
