                                  Background of the Invention
[0002]     Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is an important biological determinant of
protein production and cellular differentiation and plays a significant pathogenic role in a
number of human diseases.
[0003]     Epigenetic regulation involves heritable modification of genetic material without
changing its nucleotide sequence. Typically, epigenetic regulation is mediated by selective
and reversible modification (e.g., methylation) of DNA and proteins (e.g., histones) that
control the conformational transition between transcriptionally active and inactive states of
chromatin. These covalent modifications can be controlled by enzymes such as
methyltransferases (e.g., arginine methyltransferases), many of which are associated with
specific genetic alterations that can cause human disease.
[0004]     Disease-associated chromatin-modifying enzymes (e.g., arginine
methyltransferases) play a role in diseases such as proliferative disorders, autoimmune
disorders, muscular disorders, vascular disorders, metabolic disorders, and neurological
disorders. Thus, there is a need for the development of small molecules that are capable of
inhibiting the activity of arginine methyltransferases.
                        Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments
[0005]     Arginine methyltransferases are attractive targets for modulation given their role in
the regulation of diverse biological processes. It has now been found that compounds
described herein, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions thereof, are
effective as inhibitors of arginine methyltransferases. Such compounds have the general
Formula (I):

[0007]     In certain embodiments, compounds described herein inhibit activity of an arginine
methyltransferase (RMT) (e.g., PRMT1, PRMT3, CARMI, PRMT6, and/or PRMT8). In
certain embodiments, methods of inhibiting an arginine methyltransferase are provided which
comprise contacting the arginine methyltransferase with an effective amount of a compound
of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The RMT may be purified or
crude, and may be present in a cell, tissue, or a subject. Thus, such methods encompass
inhibition of RMT activity both in vitro and in vivo. In certain embodiments, the RMT is
wild-type. In certain embodiments, the RMT is overexpressed. In certain embodiments, the
RMT is a mutant. In certain embodiments, the RMT is in a cell. In some embodiments, the
RMT is expressed at normal levels in a subject, but the subject would benefit from RMT
inhibition (e.g., because the subject has one or more mutations in an RMT substrate that
causes an increase in methylation of the substrate with normal levels of RMT). In some
embodiments, the RMT is in a subject known or identified as having abnormal RMT activity
(e.g., overexpression).
[0008]     In certain embodiments, methods of modulating gene expression in a cell are
provided which comprise contacting a cell with an effective amount of a compound of
Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition
thereof. In certain embodiments, the cell in culture in vitro. In certain embodiments, cell is

 [0010]     In some embodiments, methods of treating an RMT-mediated disorder (e.g., a
PRMT1-, PRMT3-, CARM1-, PRMT6-, or PRMT8-mediated disorder) are provided which
comprise administering to a subject suffering from an RMT-mediated disorder an effective
amount of a compound described herein (e.g., a compound of Formula (I)), or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. In certain
embodiments, the RMT-mediated disorder is a proliferative disorder. In certain
embodiments, compounds described herein are useful for treating cancer. In certain
embodiments, compounds described herein are useful for treating breast cancer, prostate
cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, or leukemia. In certain embodiments, the
RMT-mediated disorder is a muscular disorder. In certain embodiments, the RMT-mediated
disorder is an autoimmune disorder. In certain embodiments, the RMT-mediated disorder is
a neurological disorder. In certain embodiments, the RMT-mediated disorder is a vascular
disorder. In certain embodiments, the RMT-mediated disorder is a metabolic disorder.

In any of the monocyclic or bicyclic heteroaryl groups, the point of attachment can be any
carbon or nitrogen atom, as valency permits.
[0035]        "Partially unsaturated" refers to a group that includes at least one double or triple
bond. The term "partially unsaturated" is intended to encompass rings having multiple sites
of unsaturation, but is not intended to include aromatic groups (e.g., aryl or heteroaryl
groups) as herein defined. Likewise, "saturated" refers to a group that does not contain a
double or triple bond, i.e., contains all single bonds.
[0036]        In some embodiments, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, and
heteroaryl groups, as defined herein, are optionally substituted (e.g., "substituted" or
  unsubstituted" alkyl, "substituted" or "unsubstituted" alkenyl, "substituted" or
  unsubstituted" alkynyl, "substituted" or "unsubstituted" carbocyclyl, "substituted" or
"unsubstituted" heterocyclyl, "substituted" or "unsubstituted" aryl or "substituted" or
"unsubstituted" heteroaryl group). In general, the term "substituted", whether preceded by
the term "optionally" or not, means that at least one hydrogen present on a group (e.g., a
carbon or nitrogen atom) is replaced with a permissible substituent, e.g., a substituent which
upon substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound which does not
spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, or
other reaction. Unless otherwise indicated, a "substituted" group has a substituent at one or
more substitutable positions of the group, and when more than one position in any given
structure is substituted, the substituent is either the same or different at each position. The
term "substituted" is contemplated to include substitution with all permissible substituents of
organic compounds, including any of the substituents described herein that results in the
formation of a stable compound. The present disclosure contemplates any and all such
combinations in order to arrive at a stable compound. For purposes of this disclosure,
heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any suitable substituent

any manner by the above exemplary listing of substituents.
[0050]         "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which are, within the scope
of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and other
animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, and are
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well

known in the art. For example, Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in
detail in J. PharmaceuticalSciences (1977) 66:1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of
the compounds describe herein include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic
acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are
salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic
acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, or malonic acid or by
using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable
salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate,
borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate,
dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate,

persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate,
sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.
Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium
and N*(C 1 4 alkyl) 4 salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium,
lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable
salts include, when appropriate, quaternary salts.
[0051]      A "subject" to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited to,
humans (e.g., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g, infant, child,
adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult or senior adult)) and/or
other non-human animals, for example, non-human mammals (e.g., primates (e.g.,
cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys); commercially relevant mammals such as cattle,
pigs, horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs), birds (e.g., commercially relevant birds such as
chickens, ducks, geese, and/or turkeys), rodents (e.g., rats and/or mice), reptiles, amphibians,
and fish. In certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal. The non-human
animal may be a male or female at any stage of development. A non-human animal may be a
transgenic animal.
[0052]      "Condition," "disease," and "disorder" are used interchangeably herein.
[0053]      "Treat," "treating" and "treatment" encompasses an action that occurs while a
subject is suffering from a condition which reduces the severity of the condition or retards or
slows the progression of the condition ("therapeutic treatment"). "Treat," "treating" and
                                                  25/379

"treatment" also encompasses an action that occurs before a subject begins to suffer from the
condition and which inhibits or reduces the severity of the condition ("prophylactic
treatment").
[0054]      An "effective amount" of a compound refers to an amount sufficient to elicit the
desired biological response, e.g., treat the condition. As will be appreciated by those of
ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a compound described herein may vary
depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the pharmacokinetics of the
compound, the condition being treated, the mode of administration, and the age and health of
the subject. An effective amount encompasses therapeutic and prophylactic treatment.
[0055]      A "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to
provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of a condition or to delay or minimize one or
more symptoms associated with the condition. A therapeutically effective amount of a
compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other
therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the condition. The term
"therapeutically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy,
reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of the condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy
of another therapeutic agent.
[0056]      A "prophylactically effective amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to
prevent a condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the condition or prevent its
recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of a
therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other agents, which provides a prophylactic
benefit in the prevention of the condition. The term "prophylactically effective amount" can
encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic
efficacy of another prophylactic agent.
[0057]      As used herein, the term "methyltransferase" represents transferase class enzymes
that are able to transfer a methyl group from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule, e.g.,
an amino acid residue of a protein or a nucleic base of a DNA molecule. Methytransferases
typically use a reactive methyl group bound to sulfur in S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the
methyl donor. In some embodiments, a methyltransferase described herein is a protein
methyltransferase. In some embodiments, a methyltransferase described herein is a histone
methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases (HMT) are histone-modifying enzymes,
(including histone-lysine N-methyltransferase and histone-arginine N-methyltransferase), that
catalyze the transfer of one or more methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone

 [00119]    In certain embodiments, two RD groups are joined to form an optionally substituted
carbocyclic ring, e.g., an optionally substituted C3 _6 carbocyclic ring. In certain embodiments,
two RD groups are joined to form an optionally substituted C3 carbocyclic ring, optionally
 substituted C 4 carbocyclic ring, optionally substituted C5 carbocyclic ring, or optionally
 substituted C6 carbocyclic ring. In certain embodiments, the RD groups are joined to form an
unsubstituted carbocyclic ring. However, in certain embodiments, the RD groups are joined to
form a substituted carbocyclic ring, e.g., substituted with one or more alkyl groups.
 [00120]    In certain embodiments, two RD groups are joined to form an optionally substituted
heterocyclic ring, e.g., an optionally substituted 3- to 6- membered heterocyclic ring
comprising 1 or 2 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. In certain
embodiments, two RD groups are joined to form an optionally substituted 3- membered
heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted 4- membered heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted
5- membered heterocyclic ring, or optionally substituted 6- membered heterocyclic ring. In
certain embodiments, the RD groups are joined to form an unsubstituted heterocyclic ring.
However, in certain embodiments, the RD groups are joined to form a substituted heterocyclic

 [00121]    In certain embodiments, two RN groups are joined to form an optionally substituted
heterocyclic ring, e.g., an optionally substituted 3- to 6- membered heterocyclic ring. In
certain embodiments, two RN groups are joined to form an optionally substituted 5
membered heterocyclic ring, or optionally substituted 6- membered heterocyclic ring. In
certain embodiments, the RN groups are joined to form an unsubstituted heterocyclic ring.
However, in certain embodiments, the RN groups are joined to form a substituted heterocyclic
ring, e.g., substituted with one or more alkyl groups.
 [00122]    In certain embodiments, one RN group and one RD group (e.g., wherein the N atom
to which the RN group is attached and the RD group are joined to the same carbon atom) are
joined to form an optionally substituted heterocyclic ring, e.g., an optionally substituted 3- to
6- membered heterocyclic ring. In certain embodiments, one RN group and one RD group are
joined to form an optionally substituted 5- membered heterocyclic ring, or optionally
 substituted 6- membered heterocyclic ring. In certain embodiments, one RN group and one RD
group are joined to form an unsubstituted heterocyclic ring. However, in certain
embodiments, one RN group and one RD group are joined to form a substituted heterocyclic
ring, e.g., substituted with one or more alkyl groups.

[00198]     Pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be prepared by any method
known in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include the steps of
bringing a compound described herein (the "active ingredient") into association with a carrier
and/or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary and/or desirable,
shaping and/or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.
[00199]     Pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in bulk, as a
single unit dose, and/or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a "unit dose" is
discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of
the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of
the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject and/or a convenient fraction of
such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage.
[00200]     Relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the present
disclosure will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject treated

[00219]     In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption
of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the
use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility.
The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn,
may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a
parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in
an oil vehicle.
[00220]     Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are typically suppositories which
can be prepared by mixing the compounds described herein with suitable non-irritating
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient.
[00221]     Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders,
and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active ingredient is mixed with at least one
inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium
phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol,
and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating
agents such as agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates,
and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators
such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl
alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,
sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the
dosage form may comprise buffering agents.
[00222]     Solid compositions of a similar type can be employed as fillers in soft and hard
filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may
optionally comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the
active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally,
in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include
polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type can be employed as

fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar
as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
[00223]     The active ingredient can be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid
dosage forms the active ingredient can be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as
sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms may comprise, as is normal practice,
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting
aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules,
tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may comprise buffering agents. They may optionally
comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the active
ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric
substances and waxes.
[00224]     Dosage forms for topical and/or transdermal administration of a provided
compound may include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays,
inhalants and/or patches. Generally, the active ingredient is admixed under sterile conditions
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or any desired preservatives and/or buffers as
can be required. Additionally, the present disclosure encompasses the use of transdermal
patches, which often have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an active
ingredient to the body. Such dosage forms can be prepared, for example, by dissolving
and/or dispensing the active ingredient in the proper medium. Alternatively or additionally,
the rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane and/or by
dispersing the active ingredient in a polymer matrix and/or gel.
[00225]     Formulations suitable for topical administration include, but are not limited to,
liquid and/or semi liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, oil in water and/or water in
oil emulsions such as creams, ointments and/or pastes, and/or solutions and/or suspensions.
Topically-administrable formulations may, for example, comprise from about 1% to about
10% (w/w) active ingredient, although the concentration of the active ingredient can be as
high as the solubility limit of the active ingredient in the solvent. Formulations for topical
administration may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described
herein.

[00226]     A provided pharmaceutical composition can be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in
a formulation suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity. Such a
formulation may comprise dry particles which comprise the active ingredient and which have
a diameter in the range from about 0.5 to about 7 nanometers or from about 1 to about 6
nanometers. Such compositions are conveniently in the form of dry powders for
administration using a device comprising a dry powder reservoir to which a stream of
propellant can be directed to disperse the powder and/or using a self propelling
solvent/powder dispensing container such as a device comprising the active ingredient
dissolved and/or suspended in a low-boiling propellant in a sealed container. Such powders
comprise particles wherein at least 98% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater
than 0.5 nanometers and at least 95% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 7
nanometers. Alternatively, at least 95% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater
than 1 nanometer and at least 90% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 6
nanometers. Dry powder compositions may include a solid fine powder diluent such as sugar
and are conveniently provided in a unit dose form.
[00227]     Low boiling propellants generally include liquid propellants having a boiling point
of below 65 'F at atmospheric pressure. Generally the propellant may constitute 50 to 99.9%
(w/w) of the composition, and the active ingredient may constitute 0.1 to 20% (w/w) of the
composition. The propellant may further comprise additional ingredients such as a liquid
non-ionic and/or solid anionic surfactant and/or a solid diluent (which may have a particle
size of the same order as particles comprising the active ingredient).
[00228]     Pharmaceutical compositions formulated for pulmonary delivery may provide the
active ingredient in the form of droplets of a solution and/or suspension. Such formulations
can be prepared, packaged, and/or sold as aqueous and/or dilute alcoholic solutions and/or
suspensions, optionally sterile, comprising the active ingredient, and may conveniently be
administered using any nebulization and/or atomization device. Such formulations may
further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, a flavoring
agent such as saccharin sodium, a volatile oil, a buffering agent, a surface active agent, and/or
a preservative such as methylhydroxybenzoate. The droplets provided by this route of
administration may have an average diameter in the range from about 0.1 to about 200
nanometers.
[00229]     Formulations described herein as being useful for pulmonary delivery are useful
for intranasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition. Another formulation suitable for
intranasal administration is a coarse powder comprising the active ingredient and having an

rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close to the
nares.
[00230]      Formulations for nasal administration may, for example, comprise from about as
little as 0.1% (w/w) and as much as 100% (w/w) of the active ingredient, and may comprise
one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. A provided pharmaceutical
composition can be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation for buccal
administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of tablets and/or
lozenges made using conventional methods, and may contain, for example, 0.1 to 20% (w/w)
active ingredient, the balance comprising an orally dissolvable and/or degradable
composition and, optionally, one or more of the additional ingredients described herein.
Alternately, formulations for buccal administration may comprise a powder and/or an
aerosolized and/or atomized solution and/or suspension comprising the active ingredient.
Such powdered, aerosolized, and/or aerosolized formulations, when dispersed, may have an
average particle and/or droplet size in the range from about 0.1 to about 200 nanometers, and
may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein.
[00231]      A provided pharmaceutical composition can be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in
a formulation for ophthalmic administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the
form of eye drops including, for example, a 0.1/1.0% (w/w) solution and/or suspension of the
active ingredient in an aqueous or oily liquid carrier. Such drops may further comprise
buffering agents, salts, and/or one or more other of the additional ingredients described
herein. Other opthalmically-administrable formulations which are useful include those
which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form and/or in a liposomal
preparation. Ear drops and/or eye drops are contemplated as being within the scope of this
disclosure.
[00232]      Although the descriptions of pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are
principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for administration to
humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions are generally
suitable for administration to animals of all sorts. Modification of pharmaceutical
compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the compositions
suitable for administration to various animals is well understood, and the ordinarily skilled
veterinary pharmacologist can design and/or perform such modification with ordinary
experimentation.

[00233]     Compounds provided herein are typically formulated in dosage unit form for ease
of administration and uniformity of dosage. It will be understood, however, that the total
daily usage of provided compositions will be decided by the attending physician within the
scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any
particular subject or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disease,
disorder, or condition being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the
specific active ingredient employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body
weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject; the time of administration, route of
administration, and rate of excretion of the specific active ingredient employed; the duration
of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific active ingredient
employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.
[00234]     The compounds and compositions provided herein can be administered by any
route, including enteral (e.g., oral), parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial,

intravaginal, intraperitoneal, topical (as by powders, ointments, creams, and/or drops),
mucosal, nasal, bucal, sublingual; by intratracheal instillation, bronchial instillation, and/or
inhalation; and/or as an oral spray, nasal spray, and/or aerosol. Specifically contemplated
routes are oral administration, intravenous administration (e.g., systemic intravenous
injection), regional administration via blood and/or lymph supply, and/or direct
administration to an affected site. In general the most appropriate route of administration will
depend upon a variety of factors including the nature of the agent (e.g., its stability in the
environment of the gastrointestinal tract), and/or the condition of the subject (e.g., whether
the subject is able to tolerate oral administration).
[00235]     The exact amount of a compound required to achieve an effective amount will vary
from subject to subject, depending, for example, on species, age, and general condition of a

[00244]     Compounds and compositions described herein are generally useful for the
inhibition of RMT (e.g., PRMT1, PRMT3, CARMI, PRMT6, and/or PRMT8). In some
embodiments, methods of treating an RMT-mediated disorder in a subject are provided which
comprise administering an effective amount of a compound described herein (e.g., a
compound of Formula (I)), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), to a subject in need
of treatment. In certain embodiments, the effective amount is a therapeutically effective
amount. In certain embodiments, the effective amount is a prophylactically effective amount.
In certain embodiments, the subject is suffering from a RMT-mediated disorder. In certain
embodiments, the subject is susceptible to a RMT-mediated disorder.

[00245]     As used herein, the term "RMT-mediated disorder" means any disease, disorder, or
other pathological condition in which an RMT (e.g., PRMT1, PRMT3, CARMI, PRMT6,
and/or PRMT8) is known to play a role. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present
disclosure relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which an
RMT is known to play a role.
[00246]     In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method of inhibiting an
RMT comprising contacting the RMT with an effective amount of a compound described
herein (e.g., a compound of Formula (I)), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The
RMT may be purified or crude, and may be present in a cell, tissue, or subject. Thus, such
methods encompass both inhibition of in vitro and in vivo RMT activity. In certain
embodiments, the method is an in vitro method, e.g., such as an assay method. It will be
understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that inhibition of an RMT does not necessarily
require that all of the RMT be occupied by an inhibitor at once. Exemplary levels of
inhibition of an RMT (e.g., PRMT1, PRMT3, CARMI, PRMT6, and/or PRMT8) include at
least 10% inhibition, about 10% to about 25% inhibition, about 25% to about 50% inhibition,
about 50% to about 75% inhibition, at least 50% inhibition, at least 75% inhibition, about
80% inhibition, about 90% inhibition, and greater than 90% inhibition.
[00247]     In some embodiments, provided is a method of inhibiting RMT activity in a
subject in need thereof (e.g., a subject diagnosed as having an RMT-mediated disorder)
comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound described herein
(e.g., a compound of Formula (I)), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a
pharmaceutical composition thereof.
[00248]     In certain embodiments, provided is a method of modulating gene expression in a
cell which comprises contacting a cell with an effective amount of a compound of Formula
(I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the cell is in
culture in vitro. In certain embodiments, the cell is in an animal, e.g., a human. In certain
embodiments, the cell is in a subject in need of treatment.
[00249]     In certain embodiments, provided is a method of modulating transcription in a cell
which comprises contacting a cell with an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the cell is in culture in
vitro. In certain embodiments, the cell is in an animal, e.g., a human. In certain
embodiments, the cell is in a subject in need of treatment.
[00250]     In certain embodiments, a method is provided of selecting a therapy for a subject
having a disease associated with an RMT-mediated disorder or mutation comprising the steps

of determining the presence of an RMT-mediated disorder or gene mutation in an RMT gene
(e.g., a PRMT1, PRMT3, CARMI, PRMT6, and/or PRMT8 gene) or and selecting, based on
the presence of an RMT-mediated disorder a gene mutation in the RMT gene a therapy that
includes the administration of a provided compound. In certain embodiments, the disease is
cancer.
[00251]     In certain embodiments, a method of treatment is provided for a subject in need
thereof comprising the steps of determining the presence of an RMT-mediated disorder or a
gene mutation in the RMT gene and treating the subject in need thereof, based on the
presence of a RMT-mediated disorder or gene mutation in the RMT gene with a therapy that
includes the administration of a provided compound. In certain embodiments, the subject is a
cancer patient.
[00252]     In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating a
proliferative disorder, such as cancer. For example, while not being bound to any particular
mechanism, protein arginine methylation by PRMTs is a modification that has been
implicated in signal transduction, gene transcription, DNA repair and mRNA splicing, among
others; and overexpression of PRMTs within these pathways is often associated with various
cancers. Thus, compounds which inhibit the action of PRMTs, as provided herein, are
effective in the treatment of cancer.
[00253]     In some embodiments, compounds provided herein are effective in treating cancer
through the inhibition of PRMT1. For example, PRMT1 overexpression has been observed
in various human cancers, including, but not limited to, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung
cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, and leukemia. In one example, PRMT1 specifically
deposits an asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA) mark on histone H4 at arginine 3
(H4R3me2a), and this mark is associated with transcription activation. In prostate cancer, the
methylation status of H4R3 positively correlates with increasing tumor grade and can be used
to predict the risk of prostate cancer recurrence (Seligson et al., Nature 2005 435, 1262
1266). Thus, in some embodiments, inhibitors of PRMT1, as described herein, are useful in
treating cancers associated with the methylation status of H4R3, e.g., prostate cancer.
Additionally, the methylarginine effector molecule TDRD3 interacts with the H4R3me2a
mark, and overexpression of TDRD3 is linked to poor prognosis for the survival of patients
with breast cancer (Nagahata et al., Cancer Sci. 2004 95, 218-225). Thus, in some
embodiments, inhibitors of PRMT 1, as described herein, are useful in treating cancers
associated with overexpression of TDRD3, e.g., breast cancer, as inhibition of PRMT1 leads
to a decrease in methylation of H4R3, thereby preventing the association of overexpressed
                                                211/379

TDRD3 with H4R3me2a. In other examples, PRMT1 is known to have non-histone
substrates. For example, PRMT1, when localized to the cytoplasm, methylates proteins that
are involved in signal transduction pathways, e.g., the estrogen receptor (ER). The
expression status of ER in breast cancer is critical for prognosis of the disease, and both
genomic and non-genomic ER pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast
cancer. For example, it has been shown that PRMT1 methylates ERa, and that ERa
methylation is required for the assembly of ERa with SRC (a proto-oncogene tyrosine
protein kinase) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Further, the silencing of endogenous
PRMT1 resulted in the inability of estrogen to activate AKT. These results suggested that
PRMT1-mediated ERa methylation is required for the activation of the SRC-PI3K-FAK
cascade and AKT, coordinating cell proliferation and survival. Thus, hypermethylation of
ERa in breast cancer is thought to cause hyperactivation of this signaling pathway, providing
a selective survival advantage to tumor cells (Le Romancer et al., Mol. Cell 2008 31, 212
221; Le Romancer et al., Steroids 2010 75, 560-564). Accordingly, in some embodiments,
inhibitors of PRMT1, as described herein, are useful in treating cancers associated with ERa
methylation, e.g., breast cancer. In yet another example, PRMT1 has been shown to be
involved in the regulation of leukemia development. For example, SRC-associated in
mitosis 68 kDa protein (SAM68; also known as KHDRBS1) is a well-characterized PRMT1
substrate, and when either SAM68 or PRMT1 is fused directly to the myeloid/lymphoid
leukemia (MLL) gene, these fusion proteins can activate MLL oncogenic properties,
implying that the methylation of SAM68 by PRMT1 is a critical signal for the development
of leukemia (Cheung et al., Nature Cell Biol. 2007 9, 1208-1215). Accordingly, in some
embodiments, inhibitors of PRMT 1, as described herein, are useful in treating cancers
associated with SAM68 methylation, e.g., leukemia. In still another example, PRMT1 is
implicated in leukemia development through its interaction with AE9a, a splice isoform of
AMLI-ETO (Shia et al., Blood 2012 119:4953-62). Knockdown of PRMT1 affects
expression of certain AE9a-activated genes and suppresses AE9a's self-renewal capability. It
has also been shown that AE9a recruits PRMT1 to AE9a activated gene promoters, which
leads to increased H4 Arg3 methylation, H3 Lys9/14 acetylation, and transcription activated.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, inhibitors of PRMT1, as described herein, are useful in
treating cancers associated with AMLI-ETO, e.g., leukemia. Thus, without being bound by
any particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMT1, e.g., by compounds described herein, is
beneficial in the treatment of cancer.

[00254]     In some embodiments, compounds provided herein are effective in treating cancer
through the inhibition of PRMT3. In one example, the DALi tumor suppressor protein has
been shown to interact with PRMT3 and inhibits its methyltransferase activity (Singh et al.,
Oncogene 2004 23, 7761-777 1). Epigenetic downregulation of DALi has been reported in
several cancers (e.g., meningiomas and breast cancer), thus PRMT3 is expected to display
increased activity, and cancers that display DALi silencing may, in some aspects, be good
targets for PRMT3 inhibitors, e.g., those described herein. Thus, without being bound by any
particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMT3, e.g., by compounds described herein, is
beneficial in the treatment of cancer.
[00255]     In some embodiments, compounds provided herein are effective in treating cancer
through the inhibition of PRMT4, also known as CARM 1. For example, PRMT4 levels have
been shown to be elevated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), as well as in
aggressive breast tumors (Hong et al., Cancer 2004 101, 83-89; Majumder et al., Prostate
2006 66, 1292-1301). Thus, in some embodiments, inhibitors of PRMT4, as described
herein, are useful in treating cancers associated with PRMT4 overexpression. PRMT4 has
also been shown to affect ERa-dependent breast cancer cell differentiation and proliferation
(Al-Dhaheri et al., Cancer Res. 2011 71, 2118-2128), thus in some aspects PRMT4
inhibitors, as described herein, are useful in treating ERa-dependent breast cancer by
inhibiting cell differentiation and proliferation . In another example, PRMT4 has been shown
to be recruited to the promoter of E2F1 (which encodes a cell cycle regulator) as a
transcriptional co-activator (Frietze et al., CancerRes. 2008 68, 301-306). Thus, PRMT4
mediated upregulation of E2F1 expression may contribute to cancer progression and
chemoresistance as increased abundance of E2F1 triggers invasion and metastasis by
activating growth receptor signaling pathways, which in turn promote an antiapoptotic tumor
environment (Engelmann and Pitzer, CancerRes 2012 72; 571). Accordingly, in some
embodiments, the inhibition of PRMT4, e.g., by compounds provided herein, is useful in
treating cancers associated with E2F1 upregulation. Thus, without being bound by any
particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMT4, e.g., by compounds described herein, is
beneficial in the treatment of cancer.
[00256]     In some embodiments, compounds provided herein are effective in treating cancer
through the inhibition of PRMT6. For example, PRMT6 has been reported to be
overexpressed in a number of cancers, e.g., bladder and lung cancer (Yoshimatsu et al., Int. J.
Cancer2011 128, 562-573). Thus, in some embodiments, the inhibition of PRMT6, by
                                                 213/379

    WO 2014/153226                                                         PCT/US2014/029710
compounds provided herein, is useful in treating cancers associated with PRMT6
overexpression. In some aspects, PRMT6 is primarily thought to function as a transcriptional
repressor, although it has also been reported that PRMT6 functions as a co-activator of
nuclear receptors. For example, as a transcriptional repressor, PRMT6 suppresses the
expression of thrombospondin 1 (TSP1; also known as THBS1; a potent natural inhibitor of
angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration) and p21 (a natural inhibitor of cyclin dependent
kinase), thereby contributing to cancer development and progression (Michaud-Levesque and
Richard, J. Biol. Chem. 2009 284, 21338-21346; Kleinschmidt et al., PLoS ONE 2012 7,
e41446). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the inhibition of PRMT6, by compounds
provided herein, is useful in treating cancer by preventing the repression of THBsI and/or
p21. Thus, without being bound by any particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMT6, e.g.,
by compounds described herein, is beneficial in the treatment of cancer.
[00257]     In some embodiments, compounds provided herein are effective in treating cancer
through the inhibition of PRMT8. For example, deep-sequencing efforts of cancer genomes
(e.g., COSMIC) have revealed that of all the PRMTs, PRMT8 is reported to be the most
mutated. Of 106 sequenced genomes, 15 carry mutations in the PRMT8 coding region, and
nine of these result in an amino acid change (Forbes et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 39,
D945-D950). Because of its high rate of mutation in cancer, PRMT8 is thought to contribute
to the initiation or progression of cancer. Thus, without being bound by any particular
mechanism, the inhibition of PRMT8, e.g., by compounds described herein, is beneficial in
the treatment of cancer.

[00259]      In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating diseases
associated with increased levels of circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (aDMA), e.g.,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney failure, renal disease, pulmonary disease, etc.
Circulating aDMA is produced by the proteolysis of asymmetrically dimethylated proteins.
PRMTs which mediate aDMA methylation include, e.g., PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT4, PRMT6,
and PRMT8. aDMA levels are directly involved in various diseases as aDMA is an
endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), thereby reducing the
production of nitric oxide (NO) (Vallance et al., J. Cardiovasc.Pharmacol. 1992 20(Suppl.
12):S60-2). NO functions as a potent vasodilator in endothelial vessels, and as such
inhibiting its production has major consequences on the cardiovascular system. For example,
since PRMT1 is a major enzyme that generates aDMA, the dysregulation of its activity is
likely to regulate cardiovascular diseases(Boger et al., Ann. Med. 2006 38:126-36), and other
pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes mellitus (Sydow et al., Vasc. Med. 2005
10(Suppl. 1):S35-43), kidney failure (Vallance et al., Lancet 1992 339:572-5), and chronic
pulmonary diseases (Zakrzewicz et al., BMC Pulm. Med. 2009 9:5). Additionally, it has been
demonstrated that the expression of PRMT1 and PRMT3 are increased in coronary heart
disease (Chen et al., Basic Res. Cardiol.2006 101:346-53). In another example, aDMA
elevation is seen in patients with renal failure, due to impaired clearance of this metabolite
from the circulation (Jacobi et al., Am. J. Nephrol. 2008 28:224-37). Thus, circulating
                                                 216/379

aDMA levels is observed in many pathophysiological situations. Accordingly, without being
bound by any particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMTs, e.g., by compounds described
herein, results in the decrease of circulating aDMA, which is beneficial in the treatment of
diseases associated with increased levels of circulating aDMA, e.g., cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, kidney failure, renal disease, pulmonary disease, etc. In certain embodiments, a
compound described herein is useful for treating or preventing vascular diseases.
[00260]    In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating metabolic
disorders. For example, PRMT1 has been shown to enhance mRNA levels of Fox01 target
genes in gluconeogenesis, which results in increased hepatic glucose production, and
knockdown of PRMT promotes inhibition of FoxO1 activity and thus inhibition of hepatic
gluconeogenesis (Choi et al., Hepatology 2012 56:1546-56). Additionally, genetic
haploinsufficiency of Prmt] has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in mouse models.
Thus, without being bound by any particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMT1, e.g., by
compounds described herein, is beneficial in the treating of metabolic disorders, such as
diabetes. In some embodiments, a provided compound is useful in treating type I diabetes.
In some embodiments, a provided compound is useful in treating type II diabetes.
[00261]    In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating muscular
dystrophies. For example, PRMT1, as well as PRMT3 and PRMT6, methylate the nuclear
poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1) in a region located near its C-terminus (Perreault et al., J.
Biol. Chem. 2007 282:7552-62). This domain is involved in the aggregation of the PABPN1
protein, and abnormal aggregation of this protein is involved in the disease oculopharyngeal
muscular dystrophy (Davies et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 2006 38:1457-62). Thus,
without being bound by any particular mechanism, the inhibition of PRMTs, e.g., by
compounds described herein, is beneficial in the treatment of muscular dystrophies, e.g.,
oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, by decreasing the amount of methylation of PABPN1,
thereby decreasing the amount of PABPN1 aggregation.
[00262]    CARM1 is also the most abundant PRMT expressed in skeletal muscle cells, and
has been found to selectively control the pathways modulating glycogen metabolism, and
associated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated
protein kinase) expression. See, e.g., Wang et al., Biochem (2012) 444:323-33 1. Thus, in
some embodiments, inhibitors of CARMI, as described herein, are useful in treating
metabolic disorders, e.g., for example skeletal muscle metabolic disorders, e.g., glycogen and
glucose metabolic disorders. Exemplary skeletal muscle metabolic disorders include, but are
not limited to, Acid Maltase Deficiency (Glycogenosis type 2; Pompe disease), Debrancher
                                                217/379

X; GSDX; GSD 10), Lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency (GSD 11), Branching enzyme
deficiency (GSD 4), Aldolase A (muscle) deficiency, P-Enolase deficiency, Triosephosphate
isomerase (TIM) deficiency, Lafora's disease (Progressive myoclonic epilepsy 2), Glycogen
storage disease (Muscle, Type 0, Phosphoglucomutase 1 Deficiency (GSD 14)), and
Glycogenin Deficiency (GSD 15).
[00263]     In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating
autoimmune disease. For example, several lines of evidence strongly suggest that PRMT
inhibitors may be valuable for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, e.g., rheumatoid
arthritis. PRMTs are known to modify and regulate several critical immunomodulatory
proteins. For example, post-translational modifications (e.g., arginine methylation), within T
cell receptor signaling cascades allow T lymphocytes to initiate a rapid and appropriate
immune response to pathogens. Co-engagement of the CD28 costimulatory receptor with the
T cell receptor elevates PRMT activity and cellular protein arginine methylation, including
methylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VavI (Blanchet et al., J. Exp. Med.
2005 202:371-377). PRMT inhibitors are thus expected to diminish methylation of the
guanine exchange factor Vav1, resulting in diminished IL-2 production. In agreement, siRNA
directed against PRMT5 was shown to both inhibit NFAT-driven promoter activity and IL-2
secretion (Richard et al., Biochem J. 2005 388:379-386). In another example, PRMT1 is
known to cooperate with PRMT4 to enhance NFkB p65-driven transcription and facilitate the
transcription of p65 target genes like TNFa (Covic et al., Embo. J. 2005 24:85-96). Thus, in
some embodiments, PRMT1 and/or PRMT4 inhibitors, e.g., those described herein, are
useful in treating autoimmune disease by decreasing the transcription of p65 target genes like
TNFa. These examples demonstrate an important role for arginine methylation in
inflammation. Thus, without being bound by any particular mechanism, the inhibition of
PRMTs, e.g., by compounds described herein, is beneficial in the treatment of autoimmune
diseases.
[00264]     In some embodiments, a compound provided herein is useful in treating
neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). For example, a gene
involved in ALS, TLS/FUS, often contains mutated arginines in certain familial forms of this
disease (Kwiatkowski et al., Science 2009 323:1205-8). These mutants are retained in the
cytoplasm, which is similar to reports documenting the role arginine methylation plays in
                                              218/379

    WO 2014/153226                                                           PCT/US2014/029710
nuclear-cytoplasmic shuffling (Shen et al., Genes Dev. 1998 12:679-91). This implicates
PRMT, e.g., PRMT1, function in this disease, as it was demonstrated that TLS/FUS is
methylated on at least 20 arginine residues (Rappsilber et al., Anal. Chem. 2003 75:3107-14).
Thus, in some embodiments, the inhibition of PRMTs, e.g., by compounds provided herein,
are useful in treating ALS by decreasing the amount of TLS/FUS arginine methylation.

cyanoborohydride and catalytic acid such as acetic acid) in an appropriate solvent such as
methanol to give intermediates of general formula XIII. In certain embodiments, Sonagashira
reaction of intermediates of general formula XIII with boronic acids or boronic esters of
general formula XIV in which Lr is an acetylene linker and      Q is a boronic  acid or boronic
ester group in the presence of a palladium catalyst (e.g. PdCl 2 (dppf)) and a base (e.g.
potassium carbonate) in an organic solvent (e.g. toluene) at elevated temperature yields
intermediates of general formula XV-a in which Lr is an acetylene linker. Boc deprotection
of intermediates of general formula XV-a gives acetylene compounds of formula VI-a. In
certain embodiments, Suzuki reaction of intermediates of general formula XIII with boronic

Boc deprotection of intermediates of general formula XV-b gives olefin compounds of

XIII with pinacol boranes of general formula XIVc in which L1 , is bond, Rw' is a
heterocycloalkenyl or cycloalkenyl group and Q is a pinacol borane group yields
intermediates of general formula XV-c in which L1 , is bond and Rw' is a heterocycloalkenyl
or cycloalkenyl group. In certain embodiments, compounds of formula I wherein Li is bond
and Rw is a heterocyclyl or carbocyclyl group can be prepared by hydrogenation of
intermediates of formula XV-c followed by Boc deprotection. In certain embodiments,
compounds of formula I where L1 is -0- can be synthesized from intermediates of general
formula XIII by Goldberg reaction with alcohols of formula RwOH followed by Boc
deprotection. In certain embodiments, compounds of formula I where Li is -N(RB)- can be
synthesized from intermediates of general formula XIII by palladium catalyzed Buchwald
coupling reaction conditions with amines of formula R wN(R B)H followed by Boc

coupling reaction conditions of amides with aryliodides using copper iodide an amine ligand
and a base with amides of formula RwC(=O)NHRB followed by Boc deprotection.
[00266]    Scheme 1.1 shows an alternative general synthesis route to pyrazole compounds of
Formula (I), that involves reversal in the order of the first two steps of the reaction sequence
detailed for Scheme 1.0. Thus, in the first step iodopyrazole carboxaldehydes of general
formula XI are coupled with compounds or reagents of general formula XIV (e.g. via Suzuki
reaction with pinacol boranes of general formula XIVc in which L1 , is bond, Rw' is a
heterocycloalkenyl or cycloalkenyl group and Q is a pinacol borane group) and in a second
step the corresponding reductive amination reaction to yield common intermediates of
general formula XV is a carried out.

[00267]     In certain embodiments, iodopyrazole carboxaldehydes of general formula XI may
be prepared from suitable known pyrazole compound intermediates by established synthetic
chemistry methods. Standard methods include direct iodination of a pyrazole 3-carboxylate
and Sandmeyer reaction of a 3-amino pyrazole 4-carboxylate. In certain embodiments,
iodopyrazole carboxaldehydes can be derived from iodopyrazole carboxylates by reduction
to a hydroxymethyl group followed by oxidation to carboxaldehyde. In certain embodiments,
mono-Boc protected ethylenediamines XII can be synthesized by standard methods known in
the literature for derivatizing or preparing ethylenediamines. For example intermediates of
formula XII may be prepared by treatment of the corresponding unprotected diamine
precursors with Boc 20 and purifying the mixture of mono and dibocylated products. In
certain embodiments, pyrazole compounds of general formula II can be prepared from
iodopyrazole carboxaldehydes of general formula XXI as depicted in Scheme 2. In certain
embodiments where R 4 is hydrogen compounds of general formula II are equivalent to
compounds of general formula III which are tautomers. In certain embodiments, R4 is a
protecting group such as tetrahydropyranyl (THP) which maybe cleaved to hydrogen under
acidic conditions in the final Boc-deprotection step. In certain embodiments, iodopyrazole
carboxaldehydes of general formula XXI can be prepared as depicted in Scheme 3.

[00274]      General methods and experimental procedures for preparing and characterizing
compounds of the present invention are set forth below. Wherever needed, reactions were
heated using conventional hotplate apparatus or heating mantle or microwave irradiation
equipment. Reactions were conducted with or without stirring, under atmospheric or elevated
pressure in either open or closed vessels. Reaction progress was monitored using
conventional techniques such as TLC, HPLC, UPLC, or LCMS using instrumentation and
methods described below. Reactions were quenched and crude compounds isolated using
conventional methods as described in the specific examples provided. Solvent removal was
carried out with or without heating, under atmospheric or reduced pressure, using either a
rotary or centrifugal evaporator.
Compound purification was carried out as needed using a variety of traditional methods
including, but not limited to, preparative chromatography under acidic, neutral, or basic
conditions using either normal phase or reverse phase HPLC or flash columns or Prep-TLC
plates. Compound purity and mass confirmations were conducted using standard HPLC and /
or UPLC and / or MS spectrometers and / or LCMS and / or GC equipment (e.g., including,
but not limited to the following instrumentation: Waters Alliance 2695 with 2996 PDA

0.005% BSG, and 0.002% Tween 20, prepared on the day of use. Compounds in 100%
DMSO (lul) were spotted into a polypropylene 384-well V-bottom plates (Greiner) using a
Platemate Plus outfitted with a 384-channel head (Thermo Scientific). DMSO (lul) was
added to Columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows A-H for the maximum signal control and lul of SAH,
a known product and inhibitor of PRMT1, was added to columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows I-P for
the minimum signal control. A cocktail (40ul) containing the PRMT1 enzyme was added by
Multidrop Combi (Thermo-Fisher). The compounds were allowed to incubate with PRMT1
for 30 min at room temperature, then a cocktail (1Oul) containing SAM and peptide was
added to initiate the reaction (final volume = 5lul). The final concentrations of the
components were as follows: PRMT1 was 0.5 nM,         3H-SAM    was 200 nM, non-radiolabeled
SAM was 1.5 uM, peptide was 20 nM, SAH in the minimum signal control wells was 1 mM,

DMSO (lul) were spotted into a polypropylene 384-well V-bottom plates (Greiner) using a
Platemate Plus outfitted with a 384-channel head (Thermo Scientific). DMSO (lul) was
added to Columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows A-H for the maximum signal control and lul of SAH,
a known product and inhibitor of PRMT8, was added to columns 11, 12, 23, 24, rows I-P for
the minimum signal control. A cocktail (40ul) containing the PRMT8 enzyme was added by
Multidrop Combi (Thermo-Fisher). The compounds were allowed to incubate with PRMT8
for 30 min at room temperature, then a cocktail (10ul) containing H-SAM and peptide was
added to initiate the reaction (final volume = 5lul). The final concentrations of the
components were as follows: PRMT8 was 1.5 nM,         3H-SAM    was 50 nM, non-radiolabeled
SAM was 550 nM, peptide was 150 nM, SAH in the minimum signal control wells was 1
mM, and the DMSO concentration was 2%. The assays were stopped by the addition of non
radiolabeled SAM (10ul) to a final concentration of 400 uM, which dilutes the 3H-SAM to a
level where its incorporation into the peptide substrate is no longer detectable. 50ul of the

cells per mL to a poly-D-lysine coated 384 well culture plate (BD Biosciences 356697) with
50 p L per well. Compound (100 nL) from a 96-well source plate was added directly to 384
well cell plate. Plates were incubated at 37'C, 5% CO 2 for 72 hours. After three days of
incubation, plates were brought to room temperature outside of the incubator for ten minutes
and blotted on paper towels to remove cell media. 50 pL of ice cold 100% methanol was
added directly to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After 30 min,
plates were transferred to a Biotek EL406 plate washer and washed 2 times with 100 p L per
well of wash buffer (IX PBS). Next 60 pL per well of Odyssey blocking buffer (Odyssey
Buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) were added to each plate and incubated 1 hour at room
temperature. Blocking buffer was removed and 20 pL per well of primary antibody was
added (mono-methyl arginine diluted 1:200 in Odyssey buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) and
plates were incubated overnight (16 hours) at 4'C. Plates were washed 5 times with 100 PL

buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates
were washed 5 times with 100 p L per well wash buffer then 2 times with 100 P L per well of
water. Plates were allowed to dry at room temperature then imaged on the Licor Odyssey
machine which measures integrated intensity at 700nm and 800nm wavelengths. Both 700
and 800 channels were scanned.
[0055]     Calculations: First, the ratio for each well was determined by:
[0056]     Each plate included fourteen control wells of DMSO only treatment (minimum
activation) as well as fourteen control wells for maximum activation treated with 20 PM of a
reference compound. The average of the ratio values for each control type was calculated and
used to determine the percent activation for each test well in the plate. Reference compound
was serially diluted three-fold in DMSO for a total of nine test concentrations, beginning at
20 pM. Percent activation was determined and EC 30 curves were generated using triplicate
wells per concentration of compound.
