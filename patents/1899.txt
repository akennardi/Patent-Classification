      METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ABLATION PLANNING AND CONTROL
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The     present        invention           relates         generally        to      treating
   arrhythmia, and particularly to methods and apparatus                                                  for

                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Tissue        ablation           may      be     used      for      treating          various
   types       of    diseases,           such      as     cardiac         arrhythmia.            In      some
   cases,       the ablation to be applied is                             complex and requires
10 pre-planning.              Various            techniques            may      be     applied            for
   planning and controlling the ablation procedure.
            For      example,           U.S.       Patent          Application           Publication

   reference,           describes            a    system         and     method       for       ablation
15 planning         including          defining          shapes        and     sizes     for       one     or
   more      ablation        volumes         based       on     probability          of    treatment,
   and       determining             a      target         volume          to    be     treated.            A
   procedure          plan      is     provided          by     determining          a    number          and
   location          of   planned          ablations           within         the   target          volume
20 using         the      one       or       more        ablation            volumes.          A      joint
   probability           distribution              is    determined            for    at     least        two
   planned           ablations            in       the        target          volume.          A      final
   configuration                is      visualized                to      determine            if       plan
   objectives           are     met     based         on    a    probability          of      treatment
25 for the target volume.

                                               OVERVIEW
         Cardiac          ablation         procedures            typically              require      pre
   planning       for      achieving         accurate         results.             For     example,       a
   pulmonary          vein          (PV)     isolation            procedure               blocks       the
25 propagation         of     undesired         electrical             impulses            across      the
   PV,  by    ablating           a   contiguous          lesion       around           the   perimeter
   of   the     PV.       It      is    important          to     plan         and       control       the
   procedure so as to form the contiguous                                 lesion accurately.
         Embodiments                of     the     present            invention             that       are

   planning         and        controlling          ablation       procedures.           In     some
   embodiments,               in     planning         the      ablation       procedure,           a
   processor        is      configured to display to a user                      (typically a
   physician)           a     three-dimensional              (3D)    tube    that       visually
 5 represents          a    target       region      of   the    PV   to  be    ablated.         The
   user        then          provides           the      processor         with         ablation
   information            that      specifies        one    or    more   planned        ablation
   locations         along        the    3D    tube,    and     one   or  more      respective
   planned         ablation           configurations             for    ablating          at     the
10 specified         ablation           locations.         An   ablation      configuration
   for a certain ablation location may specify, for example,

            In      some      embodiments,                processor           41     is     configured        to
   estimate,            for       each        ablation           location,           the      size      of   the
   lesion          that       would           be      formed         assuming            the      respective
   ablation           configuration                  were       applied.          In     an     embodiment,
 5 processor            41    is      configured            to     mark     a   colored           section     of
   tube 50          on either side                  of the ablation location. The                           size
   of    these         colored           sections           corresponds             to     the      estimated
   size of the lesion.
            In      some      embodiments,                this      technique           may     be     used   in
10 the    ablation           planning              stage,       in    which        case       physician       30
   may    start         with       an     initial         ablation        plan        of    locations        and
   corresponding                ablation            configurations.                In     an    embodiment,
   processor           41 displays                the estimated impact of the planned
   ablation           by    filling             the     respective           sections           of     tube   50
15 accordingly.
           By       using        this       visualization              technique,             physician       30
   can    plan         the     procedure              adaptively,           e.g.,         in    a    way    that
   will      fill       the      entire          tube,      thereby        ensuring           formation       of
   a    contiguous                lesion.            In     case       the      estimated             ablation
20 impact         indicates            that       the    planned         scheme         does     not     form a
   contiguous             lesion,             processor            41    will        display          unmarked
   (e.g.,           transparent)                   sections           in      tube         50      that      are
   indicative             of      a     non-contiguous                 lesion.          In     such      cases,
   physician             30     may        modify         the      planned          scheme,         e.g.,     by
25 moving           ablation             locations             along       tube         50,       adding      or
   removing              locations,                 and/or          modifying              the        ablation
   configurations                    in        one       or      more        ablation             locations.
   Processor            41     will         display          the     estimated            impact        of   the
   modified          plan        on     tube        50   for      reevaluation.               Physician       30
30 may repeat this                  iterative plan modification process until
   the medical requirements are fulfilled.

   are virtually displayed e.g.,                        as marks, on tube               50.
             In    some      embodiments,          processor        41    is     configured         to

10 ablation            configuration,            for     assisting        physician            30   in
   planning           and     execution         of    the     ablation        procedure.           For
   example,            using     the     boundaries           marks     physician            30    may

   contiguous lesion around PV 48.
15           In an embodiment, processor 41                        is   further configured
   to display tube               50   overlaid on the anatomical                     image      of PV

             Fig.       3   is    a   schematic,          visual      illustration             of   an

   invention.
25           In      an   embodiment,           during        the    ablation          procedure,
   processor           41   receives the position of the distal end from

   50     so    that      physician        30    may    navigate        the     distal        end   to
30 the      selected           ablation        locations         (e.g.,       location          55A).

            3413250v1

   After        navigating          the   distal         end,   e.g.,        to  location          55A,
   physician           30     activates         electrodes          40      for   ablating           the
   tissue        using        the     predefined           ablation         configuration             of
   location 55A, as described in Fig. 2 above.
 5           Typically,            the     ablation          is    carried         out      at       the
   planned          locations            and       using       the        respective          planed
   configurations.                 In     some        cases,       however,          the       actual
   ablation          applied         to    the       tissue      may       deviate        from       the
   planned ablation.                 For example, during the                   ablation of           the
10 tissue, the            actual ablation configuration may differ                                 from
   the planned configuration. As                          another example, the                 actual
   position          of     distal       end      40    may    deviate         from      the     exact
   planned         location.           In   such       cases,      the       resulting         lesion
   will not match the exact lesion as planned.
15           After        ablating          at       location          55A,      processor            41
   virtually          "fills"         a   section         60A   of     tube     50     with      color
   that represents               the    actual lesion formed by the                       ablation.
   In    an     embodiment,          processor          41  displays         the   filled        color
   in section           60A based on the actual                   location of distal                 end
20 40     during        the      ablation          ("actual      ablation         location"           as
   obtained         from      the position            tracking        system)      and     based      on
   the       actual         ablation         configuration              performed          at      this
   location.
             In   an embodiment,             the      size    and     the    color      of   section
25 60A      (measured along scale                   52)   visualize         the actual impact
   of     the    ablation          on   the     tissue       at   location        55A.      In     some

             In    the example       of Fig.        3,     the ablations              at     locations
   55A and 55B fills the planned section of tube 50                                            as   shown
   by    respective         sections       60A     and      60B.      In    this      example,          the
   visualization            of   the   ablation           impact        at    location          55C,     as
 5 shown        by    a   section      60C,       covers         less       than       the      planned
   area,        as   demonstrated         by    sections           62    and     63     that      remain
   transparent          in    tube    50.     Transparent             section         62     indicates
   that      a   contiguous        lesion was           not     formed        in    this       section,
   and      therefore,          this      discontinuity                may       fail        to     block

             In     some    embodiments,            processor             41     may       suggest         a
   modified          ablation        configuration,                or      physician            30      may
   manually          modify     the    ablation            configuration               at      location
15 55D so as to form a contiguous                          lesion in section                   63,     that
   is     required        for     blocking         undesired            electrical             impulses
   from passing through section                        63.     For example, at                 location
   55D     physician         30   may    increase          the      actual        ablation          power
   and/or extend the actual ablation duration so as to close
20 the      gap     of   section      63    and      to      form      a   contiguous             lesion
   visualized by sections 60C and 60D.
             In an embodiment, processor 41                          is   further configured

   ablation           configuration            at       location           55D.         The       excess
