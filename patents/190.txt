L0 Antibody-based therapies for cancer have the potential of higher specificity and lower side
   effect profile as compared to conventional drugs. The reason is a precise distinction between
   normal and neoplastic cells by antibodies and the fact, that their mode of action relies on less
   toxic immunological anti-tumor mechanisms, such as complement activation and recruitment
   of cytotoxic immune cells.
L5
   Targets for antibody-based therapies need to have particular qualities, which form the basis for
   proper discrimination between normal and neoplastic cells. Obviously, a target with either
   exclusive restriction to tumor cells and entirely undetectable on normal tissues is ideal for the
   development of efficient and safe antibody therapeutics. In another aspect, a high-level
20 overexpression may be the basis for the therapeutic window and low side effects exemplified
   by the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER-2), which as a result of gene
   amplification Is a good target for the antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin).
   Other targets for antibodies which are either already approved or m clinical development for
25 tumor therapy have distinct qualities, which are not based on a numeric overexpression of
   target molecules on tumor cells. In the case of antibodies to the proteoglycan MUC-1, a
   peptide repeat epitope in the backbone of the target is underglycosylated in tumor cells and
   thus altered to its normal counterpart. In the case of antibodies to CD20 (rituximab), CD52
   (Campath-IH) and CD22 ( epratuzumab ), antibody targets have comparable expression levels
30 on tumor cells and normal lymphocytes. Here, the ablation of normal cells by the antibody is
   tolerable since target-negative stem cells restore the normal lymphocyte repertoire. Other
   examples of differential accessibility of antibody targets are carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA)
   and carboanhydrase IX (CA9). Both antigens are expressed on normal epithelia of colon and
                                                    1

kidney, respectively. However, radioactively labeled imaging antibodies do distinguish well
between tumor and normal tissue, and cytotoxic antibodies are well tolerated. This is most
likely due to a restricted expression of CA9 and CEA on the luminal side of
                                               la

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     normal epithelial tissue where IgG antibodies do not have access. Also antigen
     epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) belongs to this category. As a
     homotypic cell adhesion molecule for epithelial cells it is localized in the
     intercellular space. Intriguingly, whereas high-affinity anti-Ep-CAM antibodies are
 5   very toxic, intermediate-affinity antibodies are well tolerated. This suggests
     accessibility of the Ep-CAM target on normal cells but also indicates that kinetics
     of antibody binding may open a therapeutic window.
     One possibility is that other epithelial cell-specific proteins involved in cell/cell
     adhesion may be also attractive for antibody approaches, since they may be barely
10   accessible in well-structured epithelia to antibodies but become exposed on tumor
     cells. We therefore analyzed proteins involved in organizing epithelial tissue
     architecture for their suitability as targets for therapeutic antibodies. A protein,
     which particularly attracted our attention is claudin 18.
     The claudin 18 (CLD18) molecule (Genbank accession number: splice variant 1
15   (CLD18A1): NP_057453,          NM_016369,      and splice variant 2 (CLD18A2):
     NM_001002026, NP_001002026) is an integral transmembrane protein with a
     molecular weight of approximately 27,9 / 27,72 kD. Claudins are integral
     membrane proteins located within the tight junctions of epithelia and endothelia.
     Tight junctions organize a network of interconnected strands of intramembranous
20   particles between adjacent cells. In tight junctions, occludin and claudins are the
     most prominent transmembrane          protein components. Due to their strong
     intercellular adhesion properties they create a primary barrier to prevent and
     control the paracellular transport of solutes and restrict the lateral diffusion of
     membrane lipids and proteins to maintain cellular polarity. Tight junction forming
25   proteins are critically involved in organizing epithelial tissue architecture. We
     assumed that such proteins may be barely accessible to antibodies in well
      structured epithelia but become exposed on tumor cells.
      CLD18 is a tetraspanin and has as such 4 hydrophobic regions. We have generated
     data indicating that CLD 18 displays several different conformations, which may be
30    selectively addressed by antibodies. One conformation (CLD18-Conformation-1)
      implies, that all four hydrophobic regions serve as regular transmembrane domains
      (TM) and two extracellular loops (loop1 embraced by hydrophobic region 1 and
                                             2

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     hydrophobic region 2; loop2 embraced by hydrophobic regions 3 and 4) are
     formed, as described for the vast majority of claudin family members. A second
     conformation (CLD18-Conformation-2) implies that, as described for PMP22,
     another member of the tetraspanin family (Taylor et al., J. Neurosc. Res. 62:15-27,
 5   2000), that the second and third hydrophobic domains do not fully cross the
     plasma membrane so that portion (loopD3) in between the first and fourth
     transmembrane       domain    is extracellular.   A   third conformation   (CLD18
     Conformation-3)      implies,   a large   extracelluar domain with two internal
     hydrophobic regions embraced by the first and fourth hydrophobic region, which
10   serve as regular transmembrane domains. Due to the presence of classical N
     glycosylation site in loopD3 the Claudin- 18 topology variants CLD 18 topology-2
     and CLD 18 topology-3 harbour an additional extracellular N-glycosylation site.
     Another level of complexity is added to CLD18 molecule by the presence of two
     different splice variants, which are described in mouse and in human (Niimi, Mol.
15    Cell. Biol. 21:7380-90, 2001). The splice variants CLD18AI and CLD18A2 differ
      in the first 21 N-terminal amino acids, which comprise the first TM and loopl,
      whereas the primary protein sequence of the C-terminus is identical.
      CLD18A 1 is selectively expressed on normal lung and stomach epithelia, whereas
20    CLD18A2 is expressed only on gastric cells (Niimi, Mol. Cell. Biol. 21:7380-90,
      2001). Most importantly, CLD18A2 is restricted to the differentiated short-lived
      cells of stomach epithelium but is devoid from the gastric stem cell region. Using
      sensitive RT-PCR, we have shown that both variants are not detectable at all in any
      other normal human organ, but are robustly expressed in several cancer types
25    including stomach, esophageal, pancreatic and lung tumors as well as human
      cancer cell lines. Expression is most prominent in the adenocarcinoma subtypes of
      these indications.
      The molecular weight of the protein differs in some cancers and adjacent normal
30    tissue. The higher molecular weight protein observed in healthy tissue can be
      transferred into the same molecular weight as observed in cancer by treating tissue
      lysates with the deglycosylating compound PNGase F. This suggests, that CLD 18
      is less N-glycosylated in cancer as compared to its normal tissue counterpart. This
      structural difference is likely to give rise to an altered epitope. A classical N
                                             3

   WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
      glycosylation motif is in position aa 116 within the loopD3 domain of the
      molecule.
      The terms "CLD18" and "CLD18-variant" according to the invention shall
 5    encompass (i) CLD18-splice variants, (ii) CLD18-N-glycosylation variants, (iii)
      CLD1 8-conformation variants, (iv) CLD1 8-free and homotypically/heterotypically
      associated variants localized at intercellular tight junctions and (v) CLD 18-cancer
      related and CLD 18-non-cancer cell related variants.
10    The molecular and functional characteristics of CLD18 make this molecule a
      highly interesting target for antibody based cancer therapy. These are in particular
      (i) the absence of CLD18 from the vast majority of toxicity relevant normal
      tissues, (ii) the restriction of CLD18A2 variant expression to a dispensible cell
      population as differentiated gastric cells, which can be replenished by target
15    negative stem cells of the stomach, (iii) hints to potential differential glycosylation
      between normal and neoplastic cells, and (iv) the presence of different
      conformational topologies. Moreover, the role of CLD18 as tight junction protein
      may further contribute to a good therapeutic window. Because tumor cells express
      claudins but often do not form classical tight junctions by homotypic and
20    heterotypic association of claudins as found in normal epithelial tissue, tumor cells
      may have a considerable pool of free claudin that is amenable to extracellular
      antibody binding and immunotherapy. It is possible that binding epitopes of
      claudins in healthy epithelium are shielded within tight junctions from the access
      by such antibodies.

      The object of the invention is to provide antibodies useful for therapy of diseases
      wherein CLD18 is expressed, such as tumor diseases. The antibodies described
      herein have also utility in diagnosing such diseases.
30    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

      loop1 or loop2 of CLD-conformation-1. In further preferred embodiments, the
      antibody of the invention binds to and is specific for loopD3 of CLD
10    conformation-2 and, in particular, binds at or around a potential N-glycosylation
      site at position 116 within loopD3. In further embodiments, the antibody of the

     antibody, e.g. 26D12.
     The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody
25   of the invention and/or a conjugate thereof with a therapeutic agent, and a
     pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
     In a further aspect the invention relates to a method of inhibiting growth and/or
     killing of a cell expressing CLD18, preferably CLD18A2, comprising contacting
30   the cell with an effective amount of an antibody of the invention and/or a
     conjugate thereof with a therapeutic agent. CLD 18 is preferably expressed on the
     surface of said cell.

      In a further aspect the invention relates to a method of treating or preventing a
      disease or disorder involving cells expressing CLD18, preferably CLD18A2,
      comprising administering to a subject an antibody of the invention, a conjugate
      thereof with a therapeutic agent, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the
 5    antibody of the invention or the conjugate thereof with a therapeutic agent.
      Preferably the disease or disorder is a tumor-related disease and in particular
      embodiments is selected from the group consisting of gastric cancer, esophageal
      cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, hepatic
      cancer, head-neck cancer, and cancer of the gallbladder. CLD18 is preferably
10    expressed on the surface of said cells.
      Preferably, the antibodies of the invention have the ability to discriminate CLD 18
      variants expressed by different cell types including cancer cells and non-malignant
      cells. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention have
15    the ability to bind to CLD18A2 while they do not bind to CLD18A1, or bind to
      CLD18A1 with a lower specificity compared to the binding specificity to
      CLD18A2.
      The term "binding" according to the invention preferably relates to a specific
20    binding. "Specific binding" means that an agent such as an antibody binds stronger
      to a target such as an epitope for which it is specific compared to the binding to
      another target. An agent binds stronger to a first target compared to a second target
      if it binds to the first target with a dissociation constant (KD) which is lower than
      the dissociation constant for the second target. Preferably the dissociation constant
25    (KD)   for the target to which the agent binds specifically is more than 10-fold,
      preferably more than 20-fold, more preferably more than 50-fold, even more
      preferably more than 100-fold, 200-fold, 500-fold or 1000-fold lower than the
      dissociation constant (KD) for the target to which the agent does not bind
      specifically.

      The antibodies of the invention mediate killing of cells expressing CLD18,
      preferably CLD18A2, by binding to CLD18, preferably expressed on the surface
      of said cells. In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention induce complement
      dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g. at least about 20-40% CDC mediated lysis,

     preferably about 40-50% CDC mediated lysis, and more preferably more than 50%
     CDC mediated lysis of cells expressing CLD18. Such antibodies are exemplified
     herein by the following antibodies: 37H8, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11, 61C2, 26B5,
     26D12, 28D10, 163E12, 175D10, 45C1, 125E1, ch-163E12, and ch-175D10.
 5   Alternatively or in addition to inducing CDC, antibodies of the invention may
     induce antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of cells expressing
     CLD18 in the presence of effector cells (e.g., monocytes, mononuclear cells, NK
     cells and PMNs). Such antibodies are exemplified herein by the following
     antibodies: 37G11, 37H8, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11, 43A11, 61C2, 26B5, 26D12,
10   28D10, 42E12, 163E12, 175D10, 45C1, and 125E1. Antibodies of the invention
     may have the ability to induce apoptosis of cells expressing CLD18, induce
     homotypic adhesion of cells expressing CLD18 and/or induce phagocytosis of
     cells expressing CLD18 in the presence of macrophages. The antibodies of the
     invention may have one or more of the above described functional properties.
15   Preferably, antibodies of the invention induce CDC mediated lysis and ADCC
     mediated lysis of cells expressing CLD18 and more preferably induce ADCC
     mediated lysis of cells expressing CLD18 while they do not induce CDC mediated
     lysis of said cells. Exemplary target cells for antibodies of the present invention
     include, but are not limited to, cancer cells expressing CLD18, preferably
20   CLD18A2, such as tumorigenic gastric, pancreatic, esophageal and lung cancer
     cells. In a particular preferred embodiment, killing of cells mediated by antibodies
     of the invention is CLD18A2 specific, i.e. antibodies of the invention mediate

20       CLD18
     d) which bind to human as well as to mouse CLD18 allowing to thoroughly
         perform preclinical toxicity studies in mice.
     Antibodies of the invention may be derived from different species, including but
25   not limited to mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig and human. Antibodies of the
     invention also include chimeric molecules in which an antibody constant region

     and IgM antibodies. However, other antibody isotypes are also encompassed by
     the invention, including IgGI, IgAl, IgA2, secretory IgA, IgD, and IgE antibodies.
     The antibodies can be whole antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
     including, for example, Fab, F(ab') 2 , Fv, single chain Fv fragments or bispecific

     to an immunoglobulin hinge region polypeptide, (ii) an immunoglobulin heavy
     chain CH2 constant region fused to the hinge region, and (iii) an immunoglobulin

     domain immunoglobulin fusion proteins are further disclosed in US2003/0118592
     and US 2003/0133939.
     Antibodies of the present invention preferably dissociate from CLD18 with a
15   dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of approximately           1-1OOnM or less.
     Preferably, antibodies of the invention do not cross-react with related cell-surface
     antigens and thus do not inhibit their function.
     In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention can be characterized
20   by one or more of the following properties:
     a) specificity for CLD18, in particular specificity for CLD18A2;
     b) a binding affinity to CLD 18, in particular CLD 18A2, of about 100 nM or less,
         preferably, about 5-10 nM or less and, more preferably, about 1-3 nM or less,

    j)   the ability to deplete cells which express low levels of CLD18 and/or
     k) the ability to aggregate CLD18 on the surface of living cells
     The anti-CLD 18 antibodies of the present invention can be derivatized, linked to or
 5   co-expressed to other binding specificities. In a particular embodiment, the
     invention provides a bispecific or multispecific molecule comprising at least one
     first binding specificity for CLD18 (e.g., an anti-CLD18 antibody or mimetic
     thereof), and a second binding specificity for a effector cell, such as a binding
     specificity for an Fc receptor (e.g., a Fc-gamma receptor, such as Fc-gamma RI, or
10   any other Fc receptor) or a T cell receptor, e.g., CD3.
     Accordingly, the present invention includes bispecific and multispecific molecules
     that bind to both CLD18 and to an Fc receptor or a T cell receptor, e.g. CD3.
     Examples of Fc receptors are IgG receptor, Fc-gamma receptor (FcyR), such as
15   FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (CD32), and FcyRIII (CD16). Other Fc receptors, such as
     IgA receptors (e.g., FcaRI), also can be targeted. The Fc receptor is preferably
     located on the surface of an effector cell, e.g., a monocyte, macrophage or an
     activated mononuclear cell. In a preferred embodiment, the bispecific and
     multispecific molecules bind to an Fc receptor at a site which is distinct from the
20   immunoglobulin Fc (e.g., IgG or IgA) binding site of the receptor. Therefore, the
     binding of the bispecific and multispecific molecules is not blocked by
     physiological levels of immunoglobulins.
     In yet another aspect, anti-CLD18 antibodies of the invention are derivatized,
25   linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or
     protein (e.g., a Fab' fragment). For example, an antibody of the invention can be
     functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent
     association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another
     antibody (e.g. to produce a bispecific or a multispecific antibody), a cytotoxin,
30   cellular ligand or antigen (e.g. to produce an immunoconjugate, such as an
     immunotoxin). An antibody of the present invention can be linked to other
     therapeutic moieties, e.g., a radioisotope, a small molecule anti-cancer drug, a
     recombinant      cytokine   or chemokine.     Accordingly,   the present   invention
     encompasses a large variety of antibody conjugates, bispecific and multispecific
                                             13

      molecules, and fusion proteins, all of which bind to CLD18 expressing cells and
      which can be used to target other molecules to such cells.
      In still another aspect, the invention provides compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical
 5    and diagnostic compositions/kits, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
      formulated along with one or a combination of antibodies of the invention. In a
      particular embodiment, the composition includes a combination of antibodies
      which bind to distinct epitopes or which possess distinct functional characteristics,
      such as inducing CDC and/or ADCC and inducing apoptosis. In this embodiment
10    of the invention, antibodies may be used in combination, e. g., as a pharmaceutical
      composition comprising two or more anti-CLD18 monoclonal antibodies. For
      example, anti-CLD 18 antibodies having different but complementary activities can
      be combined in a single therapy to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. In a
      preferred embodiment, the composition includes an anti-CLD18 antibody that
15    mediates CDC combined with another anti-CLD18 antibody that induces
      apoptosis. In another embodiment, the composition includes an anti-CLD18
      antibody that mediates highly effective killing of target cells in the presence of
      effector cells, combined with another anti-CLD 18 antibody that inhibits the growth
      of cells expressing CLD 18.
20
      The present invention also includes the simultaneous or sequential administration
      of two or more anti-CLD18 antibodies of the invention, wherein at least one of
      said antibodies is a chimeric anti-CLD 18 antibody and at least one further antibody
      is a human anti-CLD18 antibody, the antibodies binding to the same or different
25    epitopes of CLD18. Preferably, a chimeric CLD18 antibody of the invention is
      administered first followed by the administration of a human anti-CLD 18 antibody
      of the invention, wherein the human anti-CLD18 antibody is preferably
      administered for an extended period of time, i.e. as maintenance therapy.
30    Antibodies, immunoconjugates,       bispecific and multispecific molecules and
      compositions of the present invention can be used in a variety of methods for
      inhibiting growth of cells expressing CLD18, in particular CLD18A2 and/or
      selectively killing cells expressing CLD18, in particular CLD18A2 by contacting
      the cells with an        effective  amount of the antibody,       immunconjugate,

     bispecific/multispecific molecule or composition, such that the growth of the cell
     is inhibited and/or the cell is killed. In one embodiment, the method includes
     killing of the cell expressing CLD18, optionally in the presence of effector cells,
     for example, by CDC, apoptosis, ADCC, phagocytosis, or by a combination of two
 5   or more of these mechanisms. Cells expressing CLD18 which can be inhibited or
     killed using the antibodies of the invention include cancer cells such as
     tumorigenic stomach, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, ovarian, colon, hepatic, head
     neck, and gallbladder cells.
10   Accordingly, antibodies of the present invention can be used to treat and/or prevent
     a variety of diseases involving cells expressing CLD18 by administering the
     antibodies to patients suffering from such diseases. Exemplary diseases that can be
     treated (e.g., ameliorated) or prevented include, but are not limited to, tumorigenic
     diseases. Examples of tumorigenic diseases, which can be treated and/or prevented
15   include gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, ovarian
     cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, head-neck cancer, and cancer of the
     gallbladder.
     In a particular embodiment of the invention, the subject being administered the
20   antibody is additionally treated with a chemotherapeutic agent, radiation, or an
     agent that modulates, e.g., enhances or inhibits, the expression or activity of an Fc
     receptor, e.g. an Fc-gamma receptor, such as a cytokine. Typical cytokines for
     administration during treatment include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G
     CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-y
25   (IFN-y), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Typical therapeutic agents include,
     among others, anti-neoplastic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, taxotere, 5
     fluoruracil, methotrexat, gemzitabin and cyclophosphamide.
     In yet another aspect, the invention relates to an immunization strategy to
30   immunize non-human animals such as mice with human CLD18 or a peptide
     fragment thereof, preferably CLD18A2 or a peptid fragment thereof to obtain
     antibodies. Preferred peptides for immunization are those selected from the group
     consisting of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 16, 18, 20-23, and 26-31. Accordingly, in
     preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are those obtained by
                                            15

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      immunization using peptides selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:2,
      4, 6, 16, 18, 20-23, and 26-3 1. Analogously, antibodies to CLD18 can be generated
      in a transgenic non-human animal, such as a transgenic mouse. The transgenic
      non-human animal may be a transgenic mouse having a genome comprising a
 5    heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene encoding all or a portion of an
      antibody.
      Wildtype as well as transgenic non-human animals can be immunized with a
      purified or enriched preparation of CLD18 antigen and/or nucleic acids and/or
10    cells expressing CLD18 or a peptide fragment thereof. Preferably, the non-human
      animal, is capable of producing multiple isotypes of human monoclonal antibodies
      to CLD18 (e.g., IgG, IgA and/or IgM) by undergoing V-D-J recombination and
      isotype switching. Isotype switching may occur by e.g., classical or non-classical
      isotype switching.
15
      Accordingly, in yet another aspect, the invention provides isolated B cells from a
      non-human animal as described above. The isolated B cells can then be
      immortalized by fusion to an immortalized cell to provide a source (e.g., a
      hybridoma) of antibodies of the invention. Such hybridomas (i.e., which produce
20    antibodies of the invention) are also included within the scope of the invention.
      As exemplified herein, antibodies of the invention can be obtained directly from
      hybridomas which express the antibody, or can be cloned and recombinantly
      expressed in a host cell (e.g., a CHO cell, or a lymphocytic cell). Further examples
25    of host cells are microorganisms, such as E. coli, and fungi, such as yeast.
      Alternatively, they can be produced recombinantly in a transgenic non-human
      animal or plant.
      Preferred hybridoma cells for producing antibodies of the invention are those

      cells expressing CLD 18, and preferably (i) bind to cells expressing CLD 18A2, and
      (ii) do not bind to cells not expressing CLD18A2 but expressing CLD18A1. The
      antibodies of the invention preferably (i) mediate killing of cells expressing
25    CLD18A2, and (ii) do not mediate killing of cells not expressing CLD18A2 but

      expressing CLD18, (ii) do not mediate killing of CLD18 expressing cells of
                                            32

  WO 2007/059997                                                      PCT/EP2006/011302

20   of producing multiple isotypes of human monoclonal antibodies to CLD18 by
     undergoing V-D-J recombination and isotype switching. Such transgenic animal
     can also be a transgenic rabbit for producing polyclonal antibodies such as
     disclosed in US 2003/0017534.
25   Binding of an antibody of the invention to the CLD18 antigen may mediate the
     killing of cells expressing CLD18 (e.g. a tumor cell), e.g. by activation of the
     complement system. The killing of cells expressing CLD18 may occur by one or
     more of the following mechanisms: complement dependent cytotoxity (CDC) of
     cells expressing CLD18; apoptosis of cells expressing CLD18; effector cell
30   phagocytosis of cells expressing CLD18; or effector cell antibody dependent
     cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of cells expressing CLD18.

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms
     are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed
     description.
 5   DEFINITION OF TERMS
     The term "CLD18" relates to claudin-18 and includes any variants, including
     CLD18AI and CLD18A2, conformations, isoforms and species homologs of
     CLD18 which are naturally expressed by cells or are expressed by cells transfected
10   with the CLD18 gene. Preferably, "CLD18" relates to human CLD18, in particular
     CLD18A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2) and/or CLD18A1 (SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8), more
     preferably CLD 18A2.
     The term "CLD1 8Al" includes posttranslationally modified variants, isoforms and
15   species homologs of human CLD18A1 which are naturally expressed by cells or
     are expressed on cells transfected with the CLD18A1 gene.
     The term "CLD1 8A2" includes posttranslationally modified variants, isoforms and
     species homologs of human CLD18A2 which are naturally expressed by cells or
20   are expressed on cells transfected with the CLD18A2 gene.
     The term "CLD 18 variant" shall encompass (i) CLD 18 splice variants, (ii) CLD 18
     posttranslationally modified variants, particularly including variants with different
     N-glycosylation status, (iii) CLD18 conformation variants, particularly including
25   CLD18-conformation-1, CLD18-conformation-2 and CLD18-conformation-3, (iv)
     CLD18 free and homotypically/heterotypically associated variants localized at
     intercellular tight junctions, (v) CLD18 cancer related and CLD18 non-cancer
     related variants.
30   The term "raft" refers to the sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane
     microdomains located in the outer leaflet area of the plasma membrane of a cell.
     The ability of certain proteins to associate within such domains and their abbility
     of forming "aggregates" or "focal aggregates" can effect the protein's function. For
     example, the translocation of CLD18 molecules into such structures, after being
                                           34

  WO 2007/059997                                                      PCT/EP2006/011302
     bound by antibodies of the present invention, creates a high density of CLD18
     antigen-antibody complexes in the plasma membranes. Such a high density of
     CLD18 antigen-antibody complexes can enable efficient activation of the
     complement system during CDC.
 5
     The terms "conformation" and "topology" describe how an integrale membrane
     molecule is positioned in the cell surface membrane, and, in particular, which of its
     regions are extracellular and thus eligible for antibodies. CLD18 for example can
     exist in three different conformations, which most likely depend on whether it is
10   prevalent as homomers or heteromers            and whether it is integrated        in
     supramolecular tight junction structures or "free". These different states result in
     different epitopes eligible to antibodies.
     According to the invention, the term "disease" refers to any pathological state,
15   including cancer, in particular those forms of cancer described herein.
     By "tumor" is meant an abnormal group of cells or tissue that grows by a rapid,
     uncontrolled cellular proliferation and continues to grow after the stimuli that
     initiated the new growth cease. Tumors show partial or complete lack of structural
20   organization and functional coordination with the normal tissue, and usually form
     a distinct mass of tissue, which may be either benign or malignant.
     By "metastasis" is meant the spread of cancer cells from its original site to another
     part of the body. The formation of metastasis is a very complex process and
25   depends on detachment of malignant cells from the primary tumor, invasion of the
     extracellular matrix, penetration of the endothelial basement membranes to enter
     the body cavity and vessels, and then, after being transported by the blood,
     infiltration of target organs. Finally, the growth of a new tumor at the target site
     depends on angiogenesis. Tumor metastasis often occurs even after the removal of
30   the primary tumor because tumor cells or components may remain and develop
     metastatic potential. In one embodiment, the term "metastasis" according to the
     invention relates to "distant metastasis" which relates to a metastasis which is
     remote from the primary tumor and the regional lymph node system.

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     The term "treatment of a disease" includes curing, shortening the duration,
     ameliorating, preventing, slowing down or inhibiting progression or worsening, or
     preventing or delaying the onset of a disease or the symptoms thereof.
 5   According to the invention, a sample may be any sample useful according to the
     present invention, in particular a biological sample such a tissue sample, including
     bodily fluids, and/or a cellular sample and may be obtained in the conventional
     manner such as by tissue biopsy, including punch biopsy, and by taking blood,
     bronchial aspirate, sputum, urine, feces or other body fluids. According to the
10   invention, the term "biological sample" also includes fractions of biological
     samples.
     The term "antibody" refers to a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H)
     chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen
15   binding portion thereof. The term "antibody" also includes all recombinant forms
     of antibodies, in particular of the antibodies described herein, e.g., antibodies
     expressed in prokaryotes, unglycosylated antibodies, and any antigen-binding
     antibody fragments and derivatives as described below. Each heavy chain is
     comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a
20   heavy chain constant region. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable
     region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The VH and
     VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed
     complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are
     more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed
25   of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus
     in the following order: FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable
     regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with
     an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the
     immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune
30   system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical
     complement system.
     The term "humanized antibody" refers to a molecule having an antigen binding
     site that is substantially derived from an immunoglobulin from a non-human
                                            36

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     species, wherein the remaining immunoglobulin structure of the molecule is based
     upon the structure and/or sequence of a human immunoglobulin. The antigen
     binding site may either comprise complete variable domains fused onto constant
     domains or only the complementarity determining regions (CDR) grafted onto
 5   appropriate framework regions in the variable domains. Antigen binding sites may
     be wild-type or modified by one or more amino acid substitutions, e.g. modified to
     resemble human immunoglobulins more closely. Some forms of humanized
     antibodies preserve all CDR sequences (for example a humanized mouse antibody
     which contains all six CDRs from the mouse antibody). Other forms have one or
10   more CDRs which are altered with respect to the original antibody.
     The term "chimeric antibody" refers to those antibodies wherein one portion of
     each of the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains is homologous to
     corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or
15   belonging to a particular class, while the remaining segment of the chain is
     homologous to corresponding sequences in another. Typically the variable region
     of both light and heavy chains mimics the variable regions of antibodies derived
     from one species of mammals, while the constant portions are homologous to
     sequences of antibodies derived from another. One clear advantage to such
20   chimeric forms is that the variable region can conveniently be derived from
     presently known sources using readily available B-cells or hybridomas from non
     human host organisms in combination with constant regions derived from, for
     example, human cell preparations. While the variable region has the advantage of
     ease of preparation and the specificity is not affected by the source, the constant
25   region being human, is less likely to elicit an immune response from a human
     subject when the antibodies are injected than would the constant region from a non
     human source. However the definition is not limited to this particular example.
     The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody (or simply "binding portion"),
30   as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the
     ability to specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen
     binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length
     antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen
     binding portion" of an antibody include (i) Fab fragments, monovalent fragments
                                           37

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH domains; (ii) F(ab') 2 fragments, bivalent
      fragments comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge
      region; (iii) Fd fragments consisting of the VH and CH domains; (iv) Fv fragments
      consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) dAb
  5   fragments (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341: 544-546), which consist of a VH
      domain; (vi) isolated complementarity determining regions (CDR), and (vii)
      combinations of two or more isolated CDRs which may optionally be joined by a
      synthetic linker. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL
      and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant
10    methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein
      chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known
      as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242: 423-426; and
      Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 5879-5883). Such single chain
      antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen-binding
15    portion" of an antibody. A further example is binding-domain immunoglobulin
      fusion proteins comprising (i) a binding domain polypeptide that is fused to an
      immunoglobulin hinge region polypeptide, (ii) an immunoglobulin heavy chain
      CH2 constant region fused to the hinge region, and (iii) an immunoglobulin heavy
      chain CH3 constant region fused to the CH2 constant region. The binding domain
20    polypeptide can be a heavy chain variable region or a light chain variable region.
      The binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion proteins are further disclosed in US
      2003/0118592 and US 2003/0133939. These antibody fragments are obtained
      using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the
      fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.
25
      The term "epitope" means a protein determinant capable of binding to an antibody,
      wherein the term "binding" herein preferably relates to a specific binding. Epitopes
      usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino
      acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural
30    characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non
      conformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not
      the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents.
                                               38

  WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
     The term "discontinuous epitope" as used herein, means a conformational epitope
     on a protein antigen which is formed from at least two separate regions in the
     primary sequence of the protein.
 5   The term "bispecific molecule" is intended to include any agent, e.g., a protein,
     peptide, or protein or peptide complex, which has two different binding
     specificities. For example, the molecule may bind to, or interact with (a) a cell
     surface antigen, and (b) an Fc receptor on the surface of an effector cell. The term
     "multispecific molecule" or "heterospecific molecule" is intended to include any
10   agent, e.g., a protein, peptide, or protein or peptide complex, which has more than
     two different binding specificities. For example, the molecule may bind to, or
     interact with (a) a cell surface antigen, (b) an Fc receptor on the surface of an
     effector cell, and (c) at least one other component. Accordingly, the invention
     includes, but is not limited to, bispecific, trispecific, tetraspecific, and other
15   multispecific molecules which are directed to CLD18, and to other targets, such as
     Fc receptors on effector cells. The term "bispecific antibodies" also includes
     diabodies. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which the VH and VL
     domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too
     short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby
20   forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and
     creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g. , Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl.
     Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. (1994) Structure 2: 1121
     1123).
25   The invention also includes derivatives of the antibodies described herein. The
     term "antibody derivatives" refers to any modified form of an antibody, e.g., a
     conjugate of the antibody and another agent or antibody. As used herein, an
     antibody is "derived from" a particular germline sequence if the antibody is
     obtained from a system by immunizing an animal or by screening an
30   immunoglobulin gene library, and wherein the selected antibody is at least 90%,
     more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or
     99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the
     germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, an antibody derived from a particular
     germline sequence will display no more than 10 amino acid differences, more
                                             39

   WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
      preferably, no more than 5, or even more preferably, no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1
      amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline
      immunoglobulin gene.
 5    As used herein, the term "heteroantibodies" refers to two or more antibodies,
      derivatives thereof, or antigen binding regions linked together, at least two of
      which have different specificities. These different specificities include a binding
      specificity for an Fc receptor on an effector cell, and a binding specificity for an
      antigen or epitope on a target cell, e.g., a tumor cell.
10
      The antibodies described herein may be human antibodies. The term "human
      antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and
      constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The
      human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded
15    by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by
      random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo).
      The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to a preparation of antibody
      molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody displays a
20    single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. In one embodiment,
      the monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell
      obtained from a non-human animal, e.g., mouse, fused to an immortalized cell.
      The term "recombinant antibody", as used herein, includes all antibodies that are
25    prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a)
      antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or
      transchromosomal with respect to the immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma
      prepared therefrom, (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express
      the antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant,
30    combinatorial antibody library, and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or
      isolated by any other means that involve splicing of immunoglobulin gene
      sequences to other DNA sequences.

   WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
      The term "transfectoma", as used herein, includes recombinant eukaryotic host
      cells expressing an antibody, such as CHO cells, NS/0 cells, HEK293 cells,
      HEK293T cells, plant cells, or fungi, including yeast cells.
 5    As used herein, a "heterologous antibody" is defined in relation to a transgenic
      organism producing such an antibody. This term refers to an antibody having an
      amino acid sequence or an encoding nucleic acid sequence corresponding to that
      found in an organism not consisting of the transgenic organism, and being
      generally derived from a species other than the transgenic organism.
10
      As used herein, a "heterohybrid antibody" refers to an antibody having light and
      heavy chains of different organismal origins. For example, an antibody having a
      human heavy chain associated with a murine light chain is a heterohybrid
      antibody.
15
      The antibodies described herein are preferably isolated. An "isolated antibody" as
      used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody which is substantially free of other
      antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that
      specifically binds to CLD18 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically
20    bind antigens other than CLD 18). An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an
      epitope, isoform or variant of human CLD18 may, however, have cross-reactivity
      to other related antigens, e.g., from other species (e.g., CLD18 species homologs).
      Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material
      and/or chemicals. In one embodiment of the invention, a combination of "isolated"
25    monoclonal antibodies relates to antibodies having different specificities and being
      combined in a well defined composition.
      According to the invention, the term "binding" preferably relates to "specific
      binding". As used herein, "specific binding" refers to antibody binding to a
30    predetermined     antigen.   Typically,   the  antibody    binds with    an  affinity
      corresponding to a KD of about 1 x 10-7 M or less, and binds to the predetermined
      antigen with an affinity corresponding to a KD that is at least two orders of
      magnitude lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA,
      casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen.

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      The term "KD" (M), as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation
      equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
 5    As used herein, "isotype" refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgGi) that is
      encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.
      As used herein, "isotype switching" refers to the phenomenon by which the class,
      or isotype, of an antibody changes from one Ig class to one of the other Ig classes.
10
      The term "naturally occurring" as used herein as applied to an object refers to the
      fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or
      polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can
      be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified
15    by man in the laboratory is naturally occurring.
      The term "rearranged" as used herein refers to a configuration of a heavy chain or
      light chain immunoglobulin locus wherein a V segment is positioned immediately
      adjacent to a D-J or J segment in a conformation encoding essentially a complete
20    VH or VL domain, respectively. A rearranged immunoglobulin (antibody) gene
      locus can be identified by comparison to germline DNA; a rearranged locus will
      have at least one recombined heptamer/nonamer homology element.
      The term "unrearranged" or "germline configuration" as used herein in reference to
25    a V segment refers to the configuration wherein the V segment is not recombined
      so as to be immediately adjacent to a D or J segment.
      The term "nucleic acid molecule", as used herein, is intended to include DNA
      molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or
30    double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.
      The nucleic acids described according to the invention have preferably been
      isolated. The term "isolated nucleic acid" means according to the invention that the
      nucleic acid was (i) amplified in vitro, for example by polymerase chain reaction
                                            42

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     (PCR), (ii) recombinantly produced by cloning, (iii) purified, for example by
     cleavage and gel-electrophoretic fractionation, or (iv) synthesized, for example by
     chemical synthesis. An isolated nucleic acid is a nucleic acid which is available for
     manipulation by recombinant DNA techniques.
 5
     Nucleic acids may, according to the invention, be present alone or in combination
     with other nucleic acids, which may be homologous or heterologous. In preferred
     embodiments, a nucleic acid is functionally linked to expression control sequences
     which may be homologous or heterologous with respect to said nucleic acid. The
10   term "homologous" means that a nucleic acid is also functionally linked to the
     expression control sequence naturally and the term "heterologous" means that a
     nucleic acid is not functionally linked to the expression control sequence naturally.
     A nucleic acid, such as a nucleic acid expressing RNA and/or protein or peptide,
15   and an expression control sequence are "functionally" linked to one another, if
     they are covalently linked to one another in such a way that expression or
     transcription of said nucleic acid is under the control or under the influence of said
     expression control sequence. If the nucleic acid is to be translated into a functional
     protein, then, with an expression control sequence functionally linked to a coding
20   sequence, induction of said expression control sequence results in transcription of
     said nucleic acid, without causing a frame shift in the coding sequence or said
     coding sequence not being capable of being translated into the desired protein or
     peptide.
25   The term "expression control sequence" comprises according to the invention
     promoters, ribosome binding sites, enhancers and other control elements which
     regulate transcription of a gene or translation of a mRNA. In particular
     embodiments of the invention, the expression control sequences can be regulated.
     The exact structure of expression control sequences may vary as a function of the
30   species or cell type, but generally comprises 5'-untranscribed and 5'- and 3'
     untranslated sequences which are involved in initiation of transcription and
     translation, respectively, such as TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence,
     and the like. More specifically, 5'-untranscribed expression control sequences
     comprise a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional
                                            43

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     control of the functionally linked nucleic acid. Expression control sequences may
     also comprise enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences.
     According to the invention the term "promoter" or "promoter region" relates to a
 5   nucleic acid sequence which is located upstream (5') to the nucleic acid sequence
     being expressed and controls expression of the sequence by providing a
     recognition and binding site for RNA-polymerase. The "promoter region" may
     include further recognition and binding sites for further factors which are involved
     in the regulation of transcription of a gene. A promoter may control the
10   transcription of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic gene. Furthermore, a promoter may be
     "inducible" and may initiate transcription in response to an inducing agent or may
     be "constitutive" if transcription is not controlled by an inducing agent. A gene
     which is under the control of an inducible promoter is not expressed or only
     expressed to a small extent if an inducing agent is absent. In the presence of the
15   inducing agent the gene is switched on or the level of transcription is increased.
     This is mediated, in general, by binding of a specific transcription factor.
     Promoters which are preferred according to the invention include promoters for
     SP6, T3 and T7 polymerase, human U6 RNA promoter, CMV promoter, and
20   artificial hybrid promoters thereof (e.g. CMV) where a part or parts are fused to a
     part or parts of promoters of genes of other cellular proteins such as e.g. human
     GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase), and including or not
     including (an) additional intron(s).
25   According to the invention, the term "expression" is used in its most general
     meaning and comprises the production of RNA or of RNA and protein/peptide. It
     also comprises partial expression of nucleic acids. Furthermore, expression may be
     carried out transiently or stably.
30   In a preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule is according to the invention
     present in a vector, where appropriate with a promoter, which controls expression
     of the nucleic acid. The term "vector" is used here in its most general meaning and
     comprises any intermediary vehicle for a nucleic acid which enables said nucleic
     acid, for example, to be introduced into prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic cells and,
                                           44

   WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
      where appropriate, to be integrated into a genome. Vectors of this kind are
      preferably replicated and/or expressed in the cells. Vectors comprise plasmids,
      phagemids, bacteriophages or viral genomes. The term "plasmid" as used herein
      generally relates to a construct of extrachromosomal genetic material, usually a

      As the vector for expression of an antibody, either of a vector type in which the
      antibody heavy chain and light chain are present in different vectors or a vector
      type in which the heavy chain and light chain are present in the same vector can be
10    used.
      The teaching given herein with respect to specific nucleic acid and amino acid
      sequences, e.g. those shown in the sequence listing, is to be construed so as to also
      relate to modifications of said specific sequences resulting in sequences which are
15    functionally equivalent to said specific sequences, e.g. amino acid sequences
      exhibiting properties identical or similar to those of the specific amino acid
      sequences and nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences exhibiting
      properties identical or similar to those of the amino acid sequences encoded by the
      specific nucleic acid sequences. One important property is to retain binding of an
20    antibody to its target or to sustain effector functions of an antibody. Preferably, a
      sequence modified with respect to a specific sequence, when it replaces the
      specific sequence in an antibody retains binding of said antibody to CLD 18 and
      preferably functions of said antibody as described herein, e.g. CDC mediated lysis
      or ADCC mediated lysis.
25
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in particular the sequences of
      the CDR, hypervariable and variable regions can be modified without losing the
      ability to bind CLD18. For example, CDR regions will be either identical or highly
      homologous to the regions specified herein. By "highly homologous" it is
30    contemplated that from 1 to 5, preferably from 1 to 4, such as 1 to 3 or 1 or 2
      substitutions may be made in the CDRs. In addition, the hypervariable and variable
      regions may be modified so that they show substantial homology with the regions
      specifically disclosed herein.

     It is to be understood that the specific nucleic acids described herein also include
     nucleic acids modified for the sake of optimizing the codon usage in a particular
     host cell or organism. Differences in codon usage among organisms can lead to a
     variety of problems concerning heterologous gene expression. Codon optimization
 5   by changing one or more nucleotides of the original sequence can result in an
     optimization of the expression of a nucleic acid, in particular in optimization of
     translation efficacy, in a homologous or heterologous host in which said nucleic
     acid is to be expressed. For example if nucleic acids derived from human and
     encoding constant regions and/or framework regions of antibodies are to be used
10   according to the present invention, e.g. for preparing chimeric or humanised
     antibodies, it may be preferred to modify said nucleic acids for the sake of
     optimization of codon usage, in particular if said nucleic acids, optionally fused to
     heterologous nucleic acids such as nucleic acids derived from other organisms as
     described herein, are to be expressed in cells from an organism different from
15   human such as mouse or hamster. For example, the nucleic acid sequences
     encoding human light and heavy chain constant regions such as those according to
     SEQ ID NOs: 40 and 45, respectively, can be modified to include one or more,
     preferably, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20 and preferably up to 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
     50, 70 or 100 or more nucleotide replacements resulting in an optimized codon
20   usage but not resulting in a change of the amino acid sequence. Such nucleotide
     replacements preferably relate to replacements of nucleotides in SEQ ID Nos: 40
     and 45, respectively, selected from the replacements shown in the following
     alignment of SEQ ID Nos: 40 and 45, respectively, with their modified
     counterparts and not resulting in a change in the encoded amino acid sequence or
25   relate to corresponding replacements at corresponding positions in other nucleic
     acid sequences encoding human            light and heavy chain constant regions,
     respectively. Preferably, all of the replacements shown in the following alignments
     of SEQ ID Nos: 40 and 45, respectively, with their modified counterparts not
     resulting in a change in the encoded amino acid sequence are effected in nucleic
30   acid sequences encoding human            light and heavy chain constant regions,
     respectively.

      0.5% SDS, 2 mM EDTA). SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride/0.15 M sodium citrate,

      "Sequence similarity" indicates the percentage of amino acids that either are
      identical or that represent conservative amino acid substitutions. "Sequence
      identity" between two polypeptide or nucleic acid sequences indicates the
      percentage of amino acids or nucleotides that are identical between the sequences.

  WO 2007/059997                                                     PCT/EP2006/011302
     The "percentage identity" is obtained after the best alignment, this percentage
     being purely statistical and the differences between the two sequences being
     distributed randomly and over their entire length. Sequence comparisons between
 5   two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are conventionally carried out by
     comparing these sequences after having aligned them optimally, said comparison
     being carried out by segment or by "window of comparison" in order to identify
     and compare local regions of sequence similarity. The optimal alignment of the
     sequences for comparison may be produced, besides manually, by means of the
10   local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Ads App. Math. 2, 482,
     by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, 1970, J.
     Mol. Biol. 48, 443, by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and
     Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444, or by means of computer
     programs which use these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, BLAST P,
15   BLAST N and TFASTA in Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics
     Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.).
     The percentage identity is calculated by determining the number of identical
     positions between the two sequences being compared, dividing this number by the
20   number of positions compared and multiplying the result obtained by 100 so as to
     obtain the percentage identity between these two sequences.
     "Conservative substitutions," may be made, for instance, on the basis of similarity
     in polarity, charge,     solubility, hydrophobicity,  hydrophilicity,   and/or the
25   amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example:             (a) nonpolar
     (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline,
     phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; (b) polar neutral amino acids include
     glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; (c)
     positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and
30   (d) negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic
     acid. Substitutions typically may be made within groups (a)-(d). In addition,
     glycine and proline may be substituted for one another based on their ability to
     disrupt [alpha]-helices. Some preferred substitutions may be made among the
     following groups: (i) S and T; (ii) P and G; and (iii) A, V, L and I. Given the

     known genetic code, and recombinant and synthetic DNA techniques, the skilled
     scientist readily can construct DNAs encoding the conservative amino acid
     variants.
 5   The present invention comprises antibodies in which alterations have been made in
     the Fc region in order to change the functional or pharmacokinetic properties of the
     antibodies. Such alterations may result in a decrease or increase of Clq binding
     and CDC or of FcyR binding and ADCC. Substitutions can, for example, be made
     in one or more of the amino acid residues of the heavy chain constant region,
10   thereby causing an alteration in an effector function while retaining the ability to
     bind to the antigen as compared with the modified antibody, cf. US 5,624,821 and
     US 5,648,260.
     The in vivo half-life of antibodies can be improved by modifying the salvage
15   receptor epitope of the Ig constant domain or an Ig-like constant domain such that
     the molecule does not comprise an intact CH2 domain or an intact Ig Fc region, cf.
     US 6,121,022 and US 6,194,551. The in vivo half-life can furthermore be
     increased by making mutations in the Fc region, e.g., by substituting threonine for
     leucine at position 252, by substituting threonine for serine at position 254, or by
20   substituting threonine for phenylalanine at position 256, cf. US 6,277,375.
     Furthermore, the glycosylation pattern of antibodies can be modified in order to
     change the effector function of the antibodies. For example, the antibodies can be
     expressed in a transfectoma which does not add the fucose unit normally attached
25   to Asn at position 297 of the Fc region in order to enhance the affinity of the Fc
     region for Fc-Receptors which, in turn, will result in an increased ADCC of the
     antibodies in the presence of NK cells, cf. Shield et al. (2002) JBC, 277: 26733.
     Furthermore, modification of galactosylation can be made in order to modify CDC.
30   Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly
     along all or part of a anti-CLD 18 antibody coding sequence, such as by saturation
     mutagenesis, and the resulting modified anti-CLD18 antibodies can be screened
     for binding activity.

      The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell"), as used herein, is
      intended to refer to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been
      introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only
      to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain
 5    modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or
      environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent
      cell, but are still included within the scope of the term "host cell" as used herein.
      Recombinant host cells include, for example, transfectomas, such as CHO cells,
      NS/0 cells, and lymphocytic cells.
10
      As used herein, the term "subject" includes any human or non-human animal. The
      term "non-human animal" includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non
      mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dog, cow, chickens, amphibians,
      reptiles, etc.
15
      The terms "transgenic animal" refers to an animal having a genome comprising
      one or more transgenes, preferably heavy and/or light chain transgenes, or
      transchromosomes (either integrated or non-integrated into the animal's natural
      genomic DNA) and which is preferably capable of expressing the transgenes. For
20    example, a transgenic mouse can have a human light chain transgene and either a
      human heavy chain transgene or human heavy chain transchromosome, such that
      the mouse produces human anti-CLD 18 antibodies when immunized with CLD 18
      antigen and/or cells expressing CLD18. The human heavy chain transgene can be
      integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the mouse, as is the case for transgenic
25    mice, e.g., HuMAb mice, such as HCo7 or HCol2 mice, or the human heavy chain
      transgene      can be    maintained   extrachromosomally,    as  is the    case   for
      transchromosomal (e.g., KM) mice as described in WO 02/43478. Such transgenic
      and transchromosomal mice may be capable of producing multiple isotypes of
      human monoclonal antibodies to CLD18 (e.g., IgG, IgA and/or IgE) by
30    undergoing V-D-J recombination and isotype switching.

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     Mechanisms of mAb action
     Although the following provides           considerations  regarding the mechanism
     underlying the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention it is not to be
     considered as limiting to the invention in any way.
 5
     The antibodies described herein preferably interact with components of the
     immune system, preferably through ADCC or CDC. Antibodies of the invention
     can also be used to target payloads (e.g., radioisotopes, drugs or toxins) to directly
     kill tumor cells or can be used synergistically with traditional chemotherapeutic
10   agents, attacking tumors through complementary mechanisms of action that may
     include anti-tumor immune responses that may have been compromised owing to a
     chemotherapeutic's cytotoxic side effects on T lymphocytes.
     Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. ADCC describes the cell-killing
15   ability of effector cells as described herein, in particular lymphocytes, which
     preferably requires the target cell being marked by an antibody.
     ADCC preferably occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on tumor cells and the
     antibody Fc domains engage Fc receptors (FcR) on the surface of immune effector
20   cells. Several families of Fc receptors have been identified, and specific cell
     populations characteristically express defined Fc receptors. ADCC can be viewed
     as a mechanism to directly induce a variable degree of immediate tumor
     destruction that leads to antigen presentation and the induction of tumor-directed
     T-cell responses. Preferably, in vivo induction of ADCC will lead to tumor
25   directed T-cell responses and host-derived antibody responses.
     Complement-dependent cytotoxicity. CDC is another cell-killing method that
     can be directed by antibodies. IgM is the most effective isotype for complement
     activation. IgGl and IgG3 are also both very effective at directing CDC via the
30   classical   complement-activation     pathway.   Preferably,   in this cascade,    the
     formation of antigen-antibody complexes results in the uncloaking of multiple Cl q
     binding sites in close proximity on the CH2 domains of participating antibody
     molecules such as IgG molecules (Clq is one of three subcomponents of
     complement Cl). Preferably these uncloaked Clq binding sites convert the
                                            53

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     previously low-affinity Cl q-IgG interaction to one of high avidity, which triggers
     a cascade of events involving a series of other complement proteins and leads to
     the proteolytic release of the effector-cell chemotactic/activating agents C3a and
     C5a. Preferably, the complement cascade ends in the formation of a membrane
 5   attack complex, which creates pores in the cell membrane that facilitate free
     passage of water and solutes into and out of the cell.
     Production of antibodies
     Antibodies of the invention can be produced by a variety of techniques, including
10   conventional monoclonal antibody methodology, e.g., the standard somatic cell
     hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256: 495 (1975). Although
     somatic cell hybridization procedures are preferred, in principle, other techniques
     for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed, e.g., viral or oncogenic
     transformation of B-lymphocytes or phage display techniques using libraries of
15   antibody genes.
     The preferred animal system for preparing hybridomas that secrete monoclonal
     antibodies is the murine system. Hybridoma production in the mouse is a very well
     established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of
20   immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g.,
     murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also known.
     Other preferred animal systems for preparing hybridomas that secrete monoclonal
     antibodies are the rat and the rabbit system (e.g. described in Spieker-Polet et al.,
25   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92:9348 (1995), see also Rossi et al., Am. J. Clin.
     Pathol. 124: 295 (2005)).
     In yet another preferred embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies directed
     against CLD18 can be generated using transgenic or transchromosomal mice
30   carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These
     transgenic and transchromosomic mice include mice known as HuMAb mice and
     KM mice, respectively, and are collectively referred to herein as "transgenic
     mice." The production of human antibodies in such transgenic mice can be
     performed as described in detail for CD20 in W02004 035607
                                           54

   WO 2007/059997                                                      PCT/EP2006/011302
      Yet another strategy for generating monoclonal antibodies is to directly isolate
      genes encoding antibodies from lymphocytes producing antibodies of defined
      strategy e.g. see Babcock et al., 1996; A novel strategy for generating monoclonal
  5   antibodies from single, isolated lymphocytes producing antibodies of defined
      strategy. For details of recombinant antibody engineering see also Welschof and
      Kraus, Recombinant antibodes for cancer therapy ISBN-0-89603-918-8 and Benny
      K.C. Lo Antibody Engineering ISBN 1-58829-092-1.
10    Immunizations
      To generate antibodies to CLD 18, mice can be immunized with carrier-conjugated
      peptides    derived from the CLD 18 sequence, an enriched preparation of
      recombinantly expressed CLD18 antigen or fragments thereof and/or cells
      expressing CLD 18, as described. Alternatively, mice can be immunized with DNA
15    encoding full length human CLD18 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1) or fragments thereof, in
      particular those of SEQ ID Nos: 15, 17, and 19. In the event that immunizations
      using a purified or enriched preparation of the CLD18 antigen do not result in
      antibodies, mice can also be immunized with cells expressing CLD18, e.g., a cell
      line, to promote immune responses.
20
      The immune response can be monitored over the course of the immunization
      protocol with plasma and serum samples being obtained by tail vein or retroorbital
      bleeds. Mice with sufficient titers of anti-CLD18 immunoglobulin can be used for
      fusions. Mice can be boosted intraperitonealy or intravenously with CLD18
25    expressing cells 3 days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen to increase the
      rate of specific antibody secreting hybridomas.
      Generation of Hybridomas Producing Monoclonal Antibodies
      To generate hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies to CLD18, splenocytes
30    and lymph node cells from immunized mice can be isolated and fused to an
      appropriate immortalized cell line, such as a mouse myeloma cell line. The
      resulting hybridomas can then be screened for the production of antigen-specific
      antibodies. Individual wells can then be screened by ELISA for antibody secreting
      hybridomas. By Immunofluorescence and FACS analysis using CLD 18 expressing
                                            55

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     cells, antibodies with specificity for CLD18 can be identified. The antibody
     secreting hybridomas can be replated, screened again, and if still positive for anti
     CLD18 monoclonal antibodies can be subcloned by limiting dilution. The stable
     subclones can then be cultured in vitro to generate antibody in tissue culture
 5   medium for characterization.
     Generation of Transfectomas Producing Monoclonal Antibodies
     Antibodies of the invention also can be produced in a host cell transfectoma using,
     for example, a combination of recombinant DNA techniques and gene transfection
10   methods as are well known in the art (Morrison, S. (1985) Science 229: 1202).
     For example, in one embodiment, the gene(s) of interest, e.g., antibody genes, can
     be ligated into an expression vector such as a eukaryotic expression plasmid such
     as used by the GS gene expression system disclosed in WO 87/04462, WO
15   89/01036 and EP 338 841 or other expression systems well known in the art. The
     purified plasmid with the cloned antibody genes can be introduced in eukaryotic
     host cells such as CHO cells, NS/0 cells, HEK293T cells or HEK293 cells or
     alternatively other eukaryotic cells like plant derived cells, fungal or yeast cells.
     The method used to introduce these genes can be methods described in the art such
20   as electroporation, lipofectine, lipofectamine or others. After introduction of these
     antibody genes in the host cells, cells expressing the antibody can be identified and
     selected. These cells represent the transfectomas which can then be amplified for
     their expression level and upscaled to produce antibodies. Recombinant antibodies
     can be isolated and purified from these culture supernatants and/or cells.
25   Alternatively, the cloned antibody genes can be expressed in other expression
     systems, including prokaryotic cells, such as microorganisms, e.g. E. coli.
     Furthermore, the antibodies can be produced in transgenic non-human animals,
     such as in milk from sheep and rabbits or in eggs from hens, or in transgenic
     plants; see e.g. Verma, R., et al. (1998) J. Immunol. Meth. 216: 165-181; Pollock,
30   et al. (1999) J. Immunol. Meth. 231: 147-157; and Fischer, R., et al. (1999) Biol.
     Chem. 380: 825-839.
                                            56

  WO 2007/059997                                                     PCT/EP2006/011302
     Use   of Partial Antibody Sequences         to Express Intact Antibodies       (i.e.
     humanization and chimerisation).
     a) Chimerization
     Murine monoclonal antibodies can be used as therapeutic antibodies in humans
 5   when labeled with toxins or radioactive isotopes. Nonlabeled murine antibodies are
     highly immunogenic in man when repetitively applied leading to reduction of the
     therapeutic effect. The main immunogenicity is mediated by the heavy chain
     constant regions. The immunogenicity of murine antibodies in man can be reduced
     or completely avoided if respective antibodies are chimerized or humanized.
10   Chimeric antibodies are antibodies, the different portions of which are derived
     from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from
     a murine antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Chimerisation of
     antibodies is achieved by joining of the variable regions of the murine antibody
     heavy and light chain with the constant region of human heavy and light chain
15   (e.g. as described by Kraus et al., in Methods in Molecular Biology series,
     Recombinant antibodies for cancer therapy ISBN-0-89603-918-8). In a preferred
     embodiment chimeric antibodies are generated by joining human kappa-light chain
     constant region to murine light chain variable region. In an also preferred
     embodiment chimeric antibodies can be generated by joining human lambda-light
20   chain constant region to murine light chain variable region. The preferred heavy
     chain constant regions for generation of chimeric antibodies are IgGI, IgG3 and
     IgG4. Other preferred heavy chain constant regions for generation of chimeric
     antibodies are IgG2, IgA, IgD and IgM.
25   b) Humanization
     Antibodies interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid
     residues that are located in the six heavy and light chain complementarity
     determining regions (CDRs). For this reason, the amino acid sequences within
     CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than sequences outside of
30   CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen
     interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the
     properties of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression
     vectors that include CDR sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody
     grafted onto framework sequences from a different antibody with different
                                          57

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     properties (see, e.g., Riechmann, L. et al. (1998) Nature 332: 323-327; Jones, P. et
     al. (1986) Nature 321: 522-525; and Queen, C. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
     U. S. A. 86: 10029-10033). Such framework sequences can be obtained from
     public DNA databases that include germline antibody gene sequences. These
 5   germline sequences will differ from mature antibody gene sequences because they
     will not include completely assembled variable genes, which are formed by V (D)
     J joining during B cell maturation. Germline gene sequences will also differ from
     the sequences of a high affinity secondary repertoire antibody at individual evenly
     across the variable region. For example, somatic mutations are relatively
10   infrequent in the amino terminal portion of framework region 1 and in the carboxy
     terminal portion of framework region 4. Furthermore, many somatic mutations do
     not significantly alter the binding properties of the antibody. For this reason, it is
     not necessary to obtain the entire DNA sequence of a particular antibody in order
     to recreate an intact recombinant antibody having binding properties similar to
15   those of the original antibody (see WO 99/45962). Partial heavy and light chain
     sequences spanning the CDR regions are typically sufficient for this purpose. The
     partial sequence is used to determine which germline variable and joining gene
     segments contributed to the recombined antibody variable genes. The germline
     sequence is then used to fill in missing portions of the variable regions. Heavy and
20   light chain leader sequences are cleaved during protein maturation and do not
     contribute to the properties of the final antibody. To add missing sequences, cloned
     cDNA sequences can be combined with synthetic oligonucleotides by ligation or
     PCR amplification. Alternatively, the entire variable region can be synthesized as a
     set of short, overlapping, oligonucleotides and combined by PCR amplification to
25   create an entirely synthetic variable region clone. This process has certain
     advantages such as elimination or inclusion or particular restriction sites, or
     optimization of particular codons.
     The nucleotide sequences of heavy and light chain transcripts from hybridomas are
30   used to design an overlapping set of synthetic oligonucleotides to create synthetic
     V sequences with identical amino acid coding capacities as the natural sequences.
     The synthetic heavy and kappa chain sequences can differ from the natural
     sequences in three ways: strings of repeated nucleotide bases are interrupted to
     facilitate oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification; optimal translation
                                            58

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      initiation sites are incorporated according to Kozak's rules (Kozak, 1991, J. Biol.
      Chem. 266: 19867-19870); and HindIl sites are engineered upstream of the
      translation initiation sites.
 5    For both the heavy and light chain variable regions, the optimized coding and
      corresponding non-coding, strand sequences are broken down into 30-50
      nucleotides approximately at the midpoint of the corresponding non-coding
      oligonucleotide. Thus, for each chain, the oligonucleotides can be assembled into
      overlapping double stranded sets that span segments of 150-400 nucleotides. The
10   pools are then used as templates to produce PCR amplification products of 150
     400 nucleotides. Typically, a single variable region oligonucleotide set will be
     broken down into two pools which are separately amplified to generate two
     overlapping PCR products. These overlapping products are then combined by PCR
     amplification to form the complete variable region. It may also be desirable to
15   include an overlapping fragment of the heavy or light chain constant region in the
     PCR amplification to generate fragments that can easily be cloned into the
     expression vector constructs.
     The reconstructed chimerized or humanized heavy and light chain variable regions
20   are then combined with cloned promoter, leader, translation initiation, constant
     region, 3' untranslated, polyadenylation, and transcription termination sequences to
     form expression vector constructs. The heavy and light chain expression constructs
     can be combined into a single vector, co-transfected, serially transfected, or
     separately transfected into host cells which are then fused to form a host cell
25   expressing both chains. Plasmids for use in construction of expression vectors for
     human IgGic are described below. The plasmids were constructed so that PCR
     amplified V heavy and V kappa light chain cDNA sequences could be used to
     reconstruct complete heavy and light chain minigenes. These plasmids can be used
     to express completely human, or chimeric IgG1, Kappa or IgG4, Kappa antibodies.
30   Similar plasmids can be constructed for expression of other heavy chain isotypes,
     or for expression of antibodies comprising lambda light chains.
     Thus, in another aspect of the invention, the structural features of the anti-CLD 18
     antibodies of the invention, are used to create structurally related humanized anti
                                            59

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     CLD 18 antibodies that retain at least one functional property of the antibodies of
     the invention, such as binding to CLD18. More specifically, one or more CDR
     regions of mouse monoclonal antibodies can be combined recombinantly with
     known human framework regions and CDRs to create additional, recombinantly
 5   engineered, humanized anti-CLD 18 antibodies of the invention.
     Binding to antigen expressing cells
     The ability of the antibody to bind CLD18 can be determined using standard
     binding assays, such as those set forth in the examples (e.g., ELISA, Western Blot,
10   Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis)
     Characterization of binding of antibodies
     To purify anti-CLD 18 antibodies, selected hybridomas can be grown in two-liter
     spinner-flasks for monoclonal antibody purification. Alternatively, anti-CLD18
15   antibodies can be produced in dialysis based bioreactors. Supernatants can be
     filtered and, if necessary, concentrated before affinity chromatography with protein
     G-sepharose or protein A-sepharose. Eluted IgG can be checked by gel
     electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography to ensure purity. The
     buffer solution can be exchanged into PBS, and the concentration can be
20   determined by OD280 using 1.43 extinction coefficient. The monoclonal
     antibodies can be aliquoted and stored at -80*C.
     To determine if the selected anti-CLD18 monoclonal antibodies bind to unique
     epitopes, site-directed or multi-site directed mutagenesis can be used.
25   Isotype determination
     To determine the isotype of purified antibodies, isotype ELISAs with various
     commercial kits (e.g. Zymed, Roche Diagnostics) can be performed. Wells of
     microtiter plates can be coated with anti-mouse Ig. After blocking, the plates are
     reacted with monoclonal antibodies or purified isotype controls, at ambient
30   temperature for two hours. The wells can then be reacted with either mouse IgG1,
     IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG3, IgA or mouse IgM-specific peroxidase-conjugated probes.
     After washing, the plates can be developed with ABTS substrate (1 mg/ml) and
     analyzed at OD of 405-650. Alternatively, the IsoStrip Mouse Monoclonal

 5   In order to demonstrate presence of anti-CLD 18 antibodies in sera of immunized
     mice or binding of monoclonal antibodies to living cells expressing CLD 18, flow
     cytometry can be used. Cell lines expressing naturally or after transfection CLD18
     and negative controls lacking CLD18 expression (grown under standard growth
     conditions) can be mixed with various concentrations of monoclonal antibodies in
10   hybridoma supernatants or in PBS containing 1% FBS, and can be incubated at
     4C for 30 min. After washing, the APC- or Alexa647-labeled anti IgG antibody
     can bind to CLD 18-bound monoclonal antibody under the same conditions as the
     primary antibody staining. The samples can be analyzed by flow cytometry with a
     FACS instrument using light and side scatter properties to gate on single, living
15   cells. In order to distinguish CLD18-specific monoclonal antibodies from non
     specific binders in a single measurement, the method of co-transfection can be
     employed. Cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding CLD18 and a
     fluorescent marker can be stained as described above. Transfected cells can be
     detected in a different fluorescence channel than antibody-stained cells. As the
20   majority of transfected cells express both transgenes, CLD18-specific monoclonal
     antbodies bind preferentially to fluorescence marker expressing cells, whereas
     non-specific antibodies bind in a comparable ratio to non-transfected cells. An
     alternative assay using fluorescence microscopy may be used in addition to or
     instead of the flow cytometry assay. Cells can be stained exactly as described
25   above and examined by fluorescence microscopy.
     Tight junction proteins tend to be internalized, if cell cell contact to neighbouring
     cells of particularly adherent cells is lost by e.g. detachment of cells. Cell surface
     expression of CLD18 can be optimized by a) adjusting culture conditions, e.g.
30   culturing in higher cell densitiy in a standardized manner, using mild detachment
     (e.g. 2mM EDTA/PBS or accutase), processing at room temperature, and adding
     inhibitors of endocytosis (e.g. sodium azide) or activators of CLD18 transcription
     or translation, and by b) selecting and cloning of cells maintaining CLD 18 in high
                                            61

   WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
      levels at the cell surface, e.g. by selection with antibiotics in terms of transfected
      cells, by immunomagnetic or FACS cell sorting, and by limited dilution cloning.
      Immunofluorescence microscopy
  5   In order to demonstrate presence of anti-CLD18 antibodies in sera of immunized
      mice or binding of monoclonal antibodies to living cells expressing CLD18,
      immunofluorescence microscopy analysis can be used. For example, cell lines
      expressing either spontaneously or after transfection CLD 18 and negative controls
      lacking CLD18 expression are grown in chamber slides under standard growth
10    conditions in DMEM/F 12 medium, supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum
      (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 ptg/ml streptomycin. Cells
      can then be fixed with methanol or paraformaldehyde or left untreated. Cells can
      then be reacted with monoclonal antibodies against CLD18 for 30 min. at 25*C.
      After washing, cells can be reacted with an Alexa555-labelled anti-mouse IgG
15    secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) under the same conditions. Cells can then
      be examined by fluorescence microscopy.
      Total CLD18 levels in cells can be observed when cells are methanol fixed or
      paraformaldehyde fixed and permeabilized with Triton X-100. In living cells and
20    non-permeabilized, paraformaldehyde fixed cells surface localization of CLD18
      can be examined. Additionally targeting of CLD18 to tight junctions can be
      analyzed by co-staining with tight junction markers such as ZO-1. Furthermore,
      effects of antibody binding and CLD 18 localization within the cell membrane can
      be examined.
25
      Western Blot
      Anti-CLD18 IgG can be further tested for reactivity with CLD18 antigen by
      Western Blotting. Briefly, cell extracts from cells expressing CLD18 and
      appropriate negative controls can be prepared and subjected to sodium dodecyl
30    sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the
      separated antigens will be transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked, and
      probed with the monoclonal antibodies to be tested. IgG binding can be detected
      using anti-mouse IgG peroxidase and developed with ECL substrate.

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      Immunohistochemistry
      Anti-CLD 18 mouse IgGs can be further tested for reactivity with CLD 18 antigen
      by Immunohistochemistry in a manner well known to the skilled person, e.g. using
     paraformaldehyde or acetone fixed cryosections or paraffin embedded tissue
 5    sections fixed with paraformaldehyde from non-cancer tissue or cancer tissue
      samples obtained from patients during routine surgical procedures or from mice
      carrying xenografted tumors inoculated with cell lines expressing spontaneously
      (e.g. DAN-G, SNU-16, or KATO-III) or after transfection (e.g. HEK293) CLD18.
      For immunostaining antibodies reactive to CLD18 can be incubated followed by
10   horseradish-peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies
      (DAKO) according to the vendors instructions.
     Phagocytic and Cell Killing Activities of Antibodies in vitro
     In addition to binding specifically to CLD18, anti-CLD18 antibodies can be tested
15   for their ability to mediate phagocytosis and killing of cells expressing CLD18.
     The testing of monoclonal antibody activity in vitro will provide an initial
     screening prior to testing in vivo models.
     Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC):
20   Briefly, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), NK cells, monocytes, mononuclear
     cells or other effector cells, from healthy donors can be purified by Ficoll Hypaque
     density centrifugation, followed by lysis of contaminating erythrocytes. Washed
     effector cells can be suspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
     fetal calf serum or, alternatively with 5% heat-inactivated human serum and mixed
            51
25   with     Cr labeled target cells expressing CLD18, at various ratios of effector cells
     to target cells. Alternatively, the target cells may be labeled with a fluorescence
     enhancing ligand (BATDA). A highly fluorescent chelate of Europium with the
     enhancing ligand which is released from dead cells can be measured by a
     fluorometer. Another alternative technique may utilize the transfection of target
30   cells with luciferase. Added lucifer yellow may then be oxidated by viable cells
     only. Purified anti-CLD18 IgGs can then be added at various concentrations.
     Irrelevant human IgG can be used as negative control. Assays can be carried out
     for 4 to 20 hours at 37*C depending on the effector cell type used. Samples can be
     assayed for cytolysis by measuring       51Cr release or the presence of the EuTDA
                                             63

  WO 2007/059997                                                          PCT/EP2006/011302
      chelate in the culture supernatant. Alternatively, luminescence resulting from the
      oxidation of lucifer yellow can be a measure of viable cells.
      Anti-CLD 18 monoclonal antibodies can also be tested in various combinations to
      determine whether cytolysis is enhanced with multiple monoclonal antibodies.
  5
      Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).
      Monoclonal anti-CLD18 antibodies can be tested for their ability to mediate CDC
      using a variety of known techniques. For example, serum for complement can be
      obtained from blood in a manner known to the skilled person. To determine the
10    CDC activity of mAbs, different methods can be used.             51Cr release can for
      example be measured or elevated membrane permeability can be assessed using a
      propidium iodide (PI) exclusion assay. Briefly, target cells can be washed and 5 x
      105/ml can be incubated with various concentrations of mAb for 10-30 min. at
      room temperature or at 37*C. Serum or plasma can then be added to a final
15    concentration of 20% (v/v) and the cells incubated at 37*C for 20-30 min. All cells
      from each sample can be added to the PI solution in a FACS tube. The mixture can
     then be analyzed immediately by flow cytometry analysis using FACSArray.
     In an alternative assay, induction of CDC can be determined on adherent cells. In
     one embodiment of this assay, cells are seeded 24 h before the assay with a density
20   of 3 x 104 /well in tissue-culture flat-bottom microtiter plates. The next day growth
     medium is removed and the cells are incubated in triplicates with antibodies.
     Control cells are incubated with growth medium or growth medium containing
     0.2% saponin for the determination of background lysis and maximal lysis,
     respectively. After incubation for 20 min. at room temperature supernatant is
25   removed and 20% (v/v) human plasma or serum in DMEM (prewarmed to 37*C)
     is added to the cells and incubated for another 20 min. at 37*C. All cells from each
     sample are added to propidium iodide solution (10 pg/ml). Then, supernatants are
     replaced by PBS containing 2.5 pg/ml ethidium bromide and fluorescence
     emission upon excitation at 520 nm is measured at 600 nm using a Tecan Safire.
30   The percentage specific lysis is calculated as follows: % specific lysis =
     (fluorescence sample-fluorescence background)/ (fluorescence maximal lysis
     fluorescence background) x 100.

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     Inhibition of cell proliferationby monoclonal antibodies:
     To test for the ability to initiate apoptosis, monoclonal anti-CLD 18 antibodies can,
     for example, be incubated with CLD18 positive tumor cells, e.g., SNU-16, DAN
     G, KATO-III or CLD18 transfected tumor cells at 37*C for about 20 hours. The
 5   cells can be harvested, washed in Annexin-V binding buffer (BD biosciences), and
     incubated with Annexin V conjugated withFITC or APC (BD biosciences) for 15
     min. in the dark. All cells from each sample can be added to PI solution (10 ptg/ml
     in PBS) in a FACS tube and assessed immediately by flow cytometry (as above).
     Alternatively, a general inhibition of cell-proliferation by monoclonal antibodies
10   can be detected with commercially available kits. The DELFIA Cell Proliferation
     Kit (Perkin-Elmer, Cat. No. AD0200) is a non-isotopic immunoassay based on the
     measurement of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation during DNA
     synthesis of proliferating cells in microplates. Incorporated BrdU is detected using
     europium labelled monoclonal antibody. To allow antibody detection, cells are
15   fixed and DNA denatured using Fix solution. Unbound antibody is washed away
     and DELFIA inducer is added to dissociate europium ions from the labelled
     antibody into solution, where they form highly fluorescent chelates with
     components of the DELFIA Inducer. The fluorescence measured - utilizing time
     resolved fluorometry in the detection - is proportional to the DNA synthesis in the
20   cell of each well.
     Preclinical studies
     Monoclonal antibodies which bind to CLD18 also can be tested in an in vivo
     model (e.g. in immune deficient mice carrying xenografted tumors inoculated with
25   cell lines expressing CLD18, e.g. DAN-G, SNU-16, or KATO-III, or after
     transfection, e.g. HEK293) to determine their efficacy in controlling growth of
     CLD18-expressing tumor cells.
     In vivo studies       after xenografting      CLD18   expressing tumor     cells into
30   immunocompromised mice or other animals can be performed using antibodies of
     the invention. Antibodies can be adminstered to tumor free mice followed by
     injection of tumor cells to measure the effects of the antibodies to prevent
     formation of tumors or tumor-related symptoms. Antibodies can be adminstered to
     tumor-bearing mice to determine the therapeutic efficacy of respective antibodies
                                             65

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     to reduce tumor growth, metastasis or tumor related symptoms. Antibody
     application can be combined with application of other substances as cystostatic
     drugs, growth factor inhibitors, cell cycle blockers, angiogenesis inhibitors or other
     antibodies to determine synergistic efficacy and potential toxicity of combinations.
 5   To analyze toxic side effects mediated by antibodies of the invention animals can
     be inoculated with antibodies or control reagents and thoroughly investigated for
     symptoms possibly related to CLD18-antibody therapy. Possible side effects of in
     vivo application of CLD18 antibodies particularly include toxicity at CLD18
     expressing tissues including stomach and lung. Antibodies recognizing CLD18 in
10   human and in other species, e.g. mice, are particularly useful to predict potential
     side effects mediated by application of monoclonal CLD 18-antibodies in humans.
     Epitope mapping
     Mapping of epitopes recognized by antibodies of invention can be performed as
15   described in detail in "Epitope Mapping Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology)
     by Glenn E. Morris ISBN-089603-375-9 and in ,,Epitope Mapping: A Practical
     Approach" Practical Approach Series, 248 by Olwyn M. R. Westwood, Frank C.
     Hay.
20   1. Bispecific/Multispecific Molecules Which Bind to CLD18
     In yet another embodiment of the invention, antibodies to CLD18 can be
     derivatized or linked to another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or
     protein (e.g., an Fab' fragment) to generate a bispecific or multispecific molecule
     which binds to multiple binding sites or target epitopes. For example, an antibody
25   of the invention can be functionally linked (e.g. by chemical coupling, genetic
     fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other binding
     molecules, such as another antibody, peptide or binding mimetic.
     Accordingly, the present invention includes bispecific and multispecific molecules
30   comprising at least one first binding specificity for CLD18 and a second binding
     specificity for a second target epitope. In a particular embodiment of the invention,
     the second target epitope is an Fc receptor, e.g. human Fc-gammaRl (CD64) or a
     human Fc-alpha receptor (CD89), or a T cell receptor, e.g. CD3. Therefore, the
     invention includes bispecific and multispecific molecules capable of binding both
                                            66

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     to Fc-gammaR, Fc-alphaR or Fc-epsilonR expressing effector cells (e.g.
     monocytes, macrophagesor polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs)), and to target cells
     expressing CLD18. These bispecific and multispecific molecules may target
     CLD18 expressing cells to effector cell and may trigger Fc receptor-mediated
 5   effector cell activities, such as phagocytosis of CLD18 expressing cells, antibody
     dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), cytokine release, or generation of
     superoxide anion.
     Bispecific and multispecific molecules of the invention can further include a third
10   binding specificity, in addition to an anti-Fc binding specificity and an anti-CLD 18
     binding specificity. In one embodiment, the third binding specificity is an anti
     enhancement factor (EF) portion, e.g. a molecule which binds to a surface protein
     involved in cytotoxic activity and thereby increases the immune response against
     the target cell. The "anti-enhancement factor portion" can be an antibody,
15   functional antibody fragment or a ligand that binds to a given molecule, e.g., an
     antigen or a receptor, and thereby results in an enhancement of the effect of the
     binding determinants for the Fc receptor or target cell antigen. The "anti
     enhancement factor portion" can bind an Fc receptor or a target cell antigen.
     Alternatively, the anti-enhancement factor portion can bind to an entity that is
20   different from the entity to which the first and second binding specificities bind.
     For example, the anti-enhancement factor portion can bind a cytotoxic T cell (e.g.,
     via CD2, CD3, CD8, CD28, CD4, CD40, ICAM-1 or other immune cell that
     results in an increased immune response against the target cell).
25   In one embodiment, the bispecific and multispecific molecules of the invention
     comprise as a binding specificity at least one antibody, including, e.g., an Fab,
     Fab', F(ab') 2, Fv, or a single chain Fv. The antibody may also be a light chain or
     heavy chain dimer, or any minimal fragment thereof such as a Fv or a single chain
     construct as described in Ladner et al., US 4,946,778. The antibody may also be a
30   binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as disclosed in US2003/0118592
     and US 2003/0133939.
     In one embodiment bispecific and multispecific molecules of the invention
     comprise a binding specificity for an Fc-gammaR or an Fc-alphaR present on the
                                            67

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      surface of an effector cell, and a second binding specificity for a target cell
      antigen, e.g., CLD18.
      In one embodiment, the binding specificity for an Fc receptor is provided by a
  5   monoclonal      antibody, the binding of which         is not blocked by human
      immunoglobulin G (IgG). As used herein, the term "IgG receptor" refers to any of
      the eight gamma-chain genes located on chromosome 1. These genes encode a
      total of twelve transmembrane or soluble receptor isoforms which are grouped into
      three Fc-gamma receptor classes: Fc-gammaRl (CD64), Fc-gammaRII (CD32),
10    and Fc-gammaRIII (CD 16). In one preferred embodiment, the Fc-gamma receptor
      is a human high affinity Fc-gammaRl.
      The production and characterization of these preferred monoclonal antibodies are
      described by Fanger et al. in WO 88/00052 and in US 4,954,617. These antibodies
15    bind to an epitope of Fc-gammaRl, Fc-gammaRII or Fc-gammayRIII at a site
      which is distinct from the Fcy binding site of the receptor and, thus, their binding is
      not blocked substantially by physiological levels of IgG. Specific anti-Fc
      gammaRI antibodies useful in this invention are mAb 22, mAb 32, mAb 44, mAb
      62 and mAb 197. In other embodiments, the anti-Fcy receptor antibody is a
20    humanized form of monoclonal antibody 22 (H22). The production and
      characterization of the H22 antibody is described in Graziano, R. F. et al. (1995) J.
      Immunol. 155 (10): 4996-5002 and WO 94/10332. The H22 antibody producing
      cell line was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection on November 4,
      1992 under the designation HA022CL1 and has the accession No. CRL 11177.
25
      In still other preferred embodiments, the binding specificity for an Fc receptor is
      provided by an antibody that binds to a human IgA receptor, e.g., an Fc-alpha
      receptor (Fc-alphaRI (CD89)), the binding of which is preferably not blocked by
      human immunoglobulin A (IgA). The term "IgA receptor" is intended to include
30    the gene product of one alpha-gene (Fc-alphaRl) located on chromosome 19. This
      gene is known to encode several alternatively spliced transmembrane isoforms of
      55    to   110    kDa.   Fc-alphaRI   (CD89)      is  constitutively   expressed    on
      monocytes/macrophages, eosinophilic and neutrophilic granulocytes, but not on
      non-effector cell populations. Fc-alphaRl has medium affinity for both IgAl and
                                           68

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      IgA2, which is increased upon exposure to cytokines such as G-CSF or GM-CSF
      (Morton, H. C. et al. (1996) Critical Reviews in Immunology 16: 423-440). Four
      Fc-alphaRl-specific monoclonal antibodies, identified as A3, A59, A62 and A77,
      which bind Fc-alphaRI outside the IgA ligand binding domain, have been
 5    described (Monteiro, R. C. et al. (1992) J.Immunol. 148: 1764).
      Fc-alphaRI and Fc-gammaRI are preferred trigger receptors for use in the
      invention because they (1) are expressed primarily on immune effector cells, e.g.,
      monocytes, PMNs, macrophages and dendritic cells; (2) are expressed at high
10    levels (e.g., 5,000-100,000 per cell); (3) are mediators of cytotoxic activities (e.g.,
      ADCC, phagocytosis); (4) mediate enhanced antigen presentation of antigens,
      including self-antigens, targeted to them.
      In another embodiment the bispecific molecule is comprised of two monoclonal
15    antibodies according to the invention which have complementary functional
      activities, such as one antibody predominately working by inducing CDC and the
      other antibody predominately working by inducing apoptosis.
      An "effector cell specific antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody or
20    functional antibody fragment that binds the Fc receptor of effector cells. Preferred
      antibodies for use in the subject invention bind the Fc receptor of effector cells at a
      site which is not bound by endogenous immunoglobulin.
     As used herein, the term "effector cell" refers to an immune cell which is involved
25   in the effector phase of an immune response, as opposed to the cognitive and
     activation phases of an immune response. Exemplary immune cells include cells of
     myeloid or lymphoid origin, e.g, lymphocytes (e.g., B cells and T cells including
     cytolytic T cells (CTLs), killer cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, monocytes,
     eosinophils, neutrophils, polymorphonuclear cells, granulocytes, mast cells, and
30   basophils. Some effector cells express specific Fc receptors and carry out specific
     immune functions. In preferred embodiments, an effector cell is capable of
     inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), e.g., a neutrophil
     capable of inducing ADCC. For example, monocytes, macrophages, which express
     FcR are involved in specific killing of target cells and presenting antigens to other
                                              69

  WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
     components of the immune system, or binding to cells that present antigens. In
     other embodiments, an effector cell can phagocytose a target antigen, target cell, or
     microorganism. The expression of a particular FcR on an effector cell can be
     regulated by humoral factors such as cytokines. For example, expression of Fc
 5   gammaRI has been found to be up-regulated by interferon gamma (IFN-y). This
     enhanced expression increases the cytotoxic activity of Fc-gammaRI-bearing cells
     against targets. An effector cell can phagocytose or lyse a target antigen or a target
     cell.
10    "Target cell" shall mean any undesirable cell in a subject (e.g., a human or animal)
     that can be targeted by an antibody of the invention. In preferred embodiments, the
     target cell is a cell expressing or overexpressing CLD 18. Cells expressing CLD 18
     typically include tumor cells.
15   Bispecific and multispecific molecules of the present invention can be made using
     chemical techniques (see e.g., D. M. Kranz et al. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
     USA 78:5807), "polydoma" techniques (See US 4,474,893, to Reading), or
     recombinant DNA techniques.
20   In particular, bispecific and multispecific molecules of the present invention can be
     prepared by conjugating the constituent binding specificities, e.g., the anti-FcR and
     anti-CLD18 binding specificities, using methods known in the art. For example,
     each binding specificity of the bispecific and multispecific molecule can be
     generated separately and then conjugated to one another. When the binding
25   specificities are proteins or peptides, a variety of coupling or cross-linking agents
     can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples of cross-linking agents include
     protein A, carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate           (SATA),    5,5'
     dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N
     succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N
30   maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky
     et al. (1984) J. Exp. Med. 160: 1686; Liu, MA et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
     USA 82: 8648). Other methods include those described by Paulus (Behring Ins.
     Mitt. (1985) No. 78,118-132); Brennan et al. (Science (1985) 229: 81-83), and
     Glennie et al. (J. Immunol. (1987) 139: 2367-2375). Preferred conjugating agents
                                            70

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both available from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford,
     IL).
     When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated via
 5    sulfhydryl bonding of the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a
     particularly preferred embodiment, the hinge region is modified to contain an odd
     number of sulfhydryl residues, preferably one, prior to conjugation.
     Alternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and
10   expressed and assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful
     where the bispecific and multispecific molecule is a mAb x mAb, mAb x Fab, Fab
     x F(ab') 2 or ligand x Fab fusion protein. A bispecific and multispecific molecule of
     the invention, e.g., a bispecific molecule, can be a single chain molecule, such as a
     single chain bispecific antibody, a single chain bispecific molecule comprising one
15   single chain antibody and a binding determinant, or a single chain bispecific
     molecule comprising two binding determinants. Bispecific and multispecific
     molecules can also be single chain molecules or may comprise at least two single
     chain molecules. Methods for preparing bi-and multispecific molecules are
     described for example in US 5,260,203; US 5,455,030; US 4,881,175; US
20   5,132,405; US 5,091,513; US 5,476,786; US 5,013,653; US 5,258,498; and US
     5,482,858.
     Binding of the bispecific and multispecific molecules to their specific targets can
     be     confirmed     by   enzyme-linked     immunosorbent      assay    (ELISA),    a
25   radioimmunoassay (RIA), FACS analysis, a bioassay (e.g., growth inhibition), or a
     Western Blot Assay. Each of these assays generally detects the presence of
     protein-antibody complexes of particular interest by employing a labeled reagent
     (e.g., an antibody) specific for the complex of interest. For example, the FcR
     antibody complexes can be detected using e.g., an enzyme-linked antibody or
30   antibody fragment which recognizes and specifically binds to the antibody-FcR
    complexes. Alternatively, the complexes can be detected using any of a variety of
    other immunoassays. For example, the antibody can be radioactively labeled and
    used in a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (see, for example, Weintraub, B., Principles of
    Radioimmunoassays, Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques,
                                            71

  WO 2007/059997                                                          PCT/EP2006/011302
     The Endocrine Society, March, 1986). The radioactive isotope can be detected by
     such means as the use of a y-counter or a scintillation counter or by
     autoradiography.
 5   11. Immunoconjugates
     In another aspect, the present invention features an anti-CLD18 antibody
     conjugated to a therapeutic moiety or agent, such as a cytotoxin, a drug (e.g., an
     immunosuppressant) or a radioisotope. Such conjugates are referred to herein as
     "immunoconjugates". Immunoconjugates which include one or more cytotoxins
10   are referred to as "immunotoxins". A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any
     agent that is detrimental to and, in particular, kills cells. Examples include taxol,
     cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide,
     tenoposide,    vincristine,   vinblastine,   colchicin,   doxorubicin,    daunorubicin,
     dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1
15   dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol,
     and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof.
     Suitable therapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates of the invention
     include, but are not limited to,            antimetabolites   (e.g.,  methotrexate,  6
20   mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, fludarabin, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine),
     alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine,          thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan,
     carmustine    (BSNU)     and lomustine (CCNU),          cyclophosphamide,     busulfan,
     dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum
     (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin)
25   and    doxorubicin),   antibiotics   (e.g.,  dactinomycin    (formerly   actinomycin),
     bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g.,
     vincristine and vinblastine). In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agent is a
     cytotoxic agent or a radiotoxic agent. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent
     is an immunosuppressant. In yet another embodiment, the therapeutic agent is GM
30   CSF. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agent is doxorubicin, cisplatin,
     bleomycin, sulfate, carmustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide or ricin A.
     Antibodies of the present invention also can be conjugated to a radioisotope, e.g.,
     iodine- 131, yttrium-90 or indium-111, to generate cytotoxic radiopharmaceuticals
                                             72

   WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
      for treating a CLD18-related disorder, such as a cancer. The antibody conjugates
      of the invention can be used to modify a given biological response, and the drug
      moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents.
      For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired
  5   biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, an enzymatically
      active toxin, or active fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas
      exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor or interferon
      y; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines,
      interleukin-1 ("IL-1"), interleukin-2 ("IL-2"), interleukin-6 ("IL-6"), granulocyte
10    macrophage      colony    stimulating  factor  ("GM-CSF"),      granulocyte   colony
      stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), or other growth factors.
      Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known,
      see, e.g., Amon et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In
15    Cancer Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al.
      (eds. ), pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., "Antibodies For
      Drug Delivery", in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp.
      623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, "Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic
      Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review", in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological
20    And Clinical Applications, Pincheraet al. (eds. ), pp. 475-506 (1985); "Analysis,
      Results, And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled
      Antibody In Cancer Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection
      And Therapy, Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp. 303-16 (Academic Press 1985), and
      Thorpe et al., "The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties Of Antibody-Toxin
25    Conjugates", Immunol. Rev., 62: 119-58 (1982).
      In a further embodiment, the antibodies according to the invention are attached to a
      linker-chelator, e.g., tiuxetan, which allows for the antibody to be conjugated to a
      radioisotope.

      IH. Pharmaceutical Compositions
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a
      pharmaceutical composition, containing one or a combination of antibodies of the
      present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated with
                                            73

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
      pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known
      adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as those
      disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition,
      Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1995. In one embodiment, the
 5    compositions include a combination of multiple (e.g., two or more) isolated
      antibodies of the invention which act by different mechanisms, e.g., one antibody
      which predominately acts by inducing CDC in combination with another antibody
      which predominately acts by inducing apoptosis.
10   Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention also can be administered in
      combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. For example, the
     combination therapy can include a composition of the present invention with at
      least one anti-inflammatory agent or at least one immunosuppressive agent. In one
     embodiment such therapeutic agents include one or more anti-inflammatory
15   agents, such as a steroidal drug or a NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).
     Preferred agents include, for example, aspirin and other salicylates, Cox-2
     inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx) and celecoxib (Celebrex), NSAIDs such as
     ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), fenoprofen (Nalfon), naproxen (Naprosyn), sulindac
     (Clinoril), diclofenac (Voltaren), piroxicam (Feldene), ketoprofen (Orudis),
20   diflunisal   (Dolobid), nabumetone        (Relafen),  etodolac  (Lodine),   oxaprozin
     (Daypro), and indomethacin (Indocin).
     In another embodiment, such therapeutic agents include agents leading to the
     depletion or functional inactivation of regulatory T cells like low dose
25   cyclophosphamid,      anti-CTLA4      antibodies,    anti-IL2  or   anti-IL2-receptor
     antibodies.
     In yet another embodiment, such therapeutic agents include one or more
     chemotherapeutics, such as Taxol derivatives, taxotere, gemcitabin, 5-Fluoruracil,
30   doxorubicin (Adriamycin), cisplatin (Platinol), cyclophosphamide            (Cytoxan,
     Procytox, Neosar). In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention
     may be administered in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, which
     preferably show therapeutic efficacy in patients suffering from stomach,
     esophageal, pancreatic and lung cancer.
                                            74

  WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
     In yet another embodiment, the antibodies of the invention may be administered in
     conjunction with radiotherapy and/or autologous peripheral stem cell or bone
     marrow transplantation.
 5
     In still another embodiment, the antibodies of the invention may be administered in
     combination with one or more antibodies selected from anti-CD25 antibodies, anti
     EPCAM antibodies, anti-EGFR, anti-Her2/neu, and anti-CD40 antibodies.
10   In yet a further embodiment, the antibodies of the invention may be administered
     in combination with an anti-C3b(i) antibody in order to enhance complement
     activation.
     As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all
15   solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic
     and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible.
     Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,
     parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion).
     Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, i.e., antibody,
20   bispecific and multispecific molecule, may be coated in a material to protect the
     compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate
     the compound.
     A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that retains the desired
25   biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired
     toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci. 66: 1-19).
     Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid
     addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as
30   hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous
     and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and
     dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids,
     aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition
     salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium,
                                            75

  WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
     magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as
     N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine,      N-methylglucamine,      chloroprocaine,  choline,
     diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.
 5   A composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of
     methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route
     and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. The
     active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound
     against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants,
10   transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable,
     biocompatible    polymers    can   be used,     such as    ethylene   vinyl  acetate,
     polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid.
     Methods for the preparation of such formulations are generally known to those
     skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery
15   Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.
     To administer a compound of the invention by certain routes of administration, it
     may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with,
     a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the compound may be
20   administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a
     diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer
     solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as
     conventional liposomes (Strejan et al. (1984) J. Neuroimmunol. 7: 27).
25   Pharmaceutically    acceptable   carriers  include sterile    aqueous solutions    or
     dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile
     injectable solutions or dispersions. The use of such media and agents for
     pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any
     conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof
30   in   the  pharmaceutical    compositions     of the    invention   is  contemplated.
     Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.
     Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions
     of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution,
                                            76

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug
      concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for
      example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and
      liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper
  5   fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by
      the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the
      use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents,
      for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in
      the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be
10    brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for
      example, monostearate salts and gelatin.
      Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound
      in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of
15    ingredients    enumerated     above,   as    required,   followed  by    sterilization
     microfiltration.
     Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a
     sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other
20   ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the
     preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are
     vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active
     ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered
     solution thereof.
25
     Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a
     therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several
     divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally
     reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It
30   is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit
     form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as
     used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the
     subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active
     compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with
                                            77

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of
      the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique
       characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be
       achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active
  5    compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.
       Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble
       antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate,
       sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such
10    as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene
       (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal
      chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA),
      sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.
15    For the therapeutic compositions, formulations of the present invention include
      those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal,
      vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be
      presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods known in the
      art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a
20    carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the
      subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of
      active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single
      dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a
      therapeutic effect.
25
      Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 0.01 per
      cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 0.1
      percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 1 percent to about 30
      percent.
30
      Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration
      also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations
      containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms
      for the topical or transdermal administration of compositions of this invention
                                             78

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches
     and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a
     pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or
     propellants which may be required.
 5
     The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used
     herein means       modes     of administration    other   than  enteral  and   topical
     administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous,
     intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac,
10   intradermal,      intraperitoneal,   transtracheal,     subcutaneous,    subcuticular,
     intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal
     injection and infusion.
     Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in
15   the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols
     (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable
     mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters,
     such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of
     coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size
20   in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
     These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting
     agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the presence of
     microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures, and by the
25   inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben,
     chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include
     isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the
     compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical
     form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such
30   as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
     In one embodiment the monoclonal antibodies of the invention are administered in
     crystalline form by subcutaneous injection, cf. Yang et al. (2003) PNAS, 100 (12):
     6934-6939. When the compounds of the present invention are administered as

     pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given alone or as a
     pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.01 to 99.5% (more
     preferably,    0.1   to    90%) of active     ingredient  in    combination    with   a
     pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

     Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present
     invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the
     pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into
     pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to
10   those of skill in the art.
     Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions
     of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active
     ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a
15   particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to
     the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of
     pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the
     present invention employed, the route of administration, the time of administration,
     the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of
20   the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with
     the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general
     health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well
     known in the medical arts.
25   A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine
     and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required.
     For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of
     the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that
     required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase
30   the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a
     composition of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the
     lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will
     generally depend upon the factors described above. It is preferred that
     administration be intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous,
                                            80

   WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
      preferably administered proximal to the site of the target. If desired, the effective
      daily dose of a therapeutic composition may be administered as two, three, four,
      five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals
      throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. While it is possible for a
  5   compound of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to
      administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition).
      In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention may be administered by
      infusion, preferably slow continuous infusion over a long period, such as more
10    than 24 hours, in order to reduce toxic side effects. The administration may also be
      performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as of
      from 2 to 12 hours. Such regimen may be repeated one or more times as necessary,
      for example, after 6 months or 12 months. The dosage can be determined or
      adjusted by measuring the amount of circulating monoclonal anti-CLD18
15    antibodies upon administration in a biological sample by using anti-idiotypic
      antibodies which target the anti-CLD 18 antibodies.
      In yet another embodiment, the antibodies are administered by maintenance
      therapy, such as, e.g., once a week for a period of 6 months or more.
20
      In still another embodiment, the antibodies according to the invention may be
      administered by a regimen including one infusion of an antibody against CLD18
      followed by an infusion of an antibody against CLD18 conjugated to a
      radioisotope. The regimen may be repeated, e.g., 7 to 9 days later.
25
      Therapeutic compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the
      art. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a therapeutic composition of the
      invention can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such
      as the devices disclosed in US 5,399,163; US 5,383,851; US 5,312,335; US
30    5,064,413; US 4,941,880; US 4,790,824; or US 4,596,556. Examples of well
      known implants and modules useful in the present invention include those
      described in: US 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump
      for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; US 4,486,194, which discloses a
      therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; US 4,447,233,
                                            81

  WO 2007/059997                                                     PCT/EP2006/011302
     which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise
     infusion rate; US 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion
     apparatus for continuous drug delivery; US 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic
     drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and US 4,475,196,
 5   which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system.
     Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those
     skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be
     formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain
10   barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the
     therapeutic compounds of the invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be
     formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes,
     see, e.g., US 4,522,811; US 5,374,548; and US 5,399,331. The liposomes may
     comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells
15   or organs, and thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V.V. Ranade (1989)
     J. Clin. Pharmacol. 29: 685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin
     (see, e.g., US 5,416,016 to Low et al.); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988)
     Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153: 1038); antibodies (P.G. Bloeman et al.
     (1995) FEBS Lett. 357: 140; M. Owais et al. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents
20   Chemother. 39: 180); and surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al. (1995) Am.
     J. Physiol. 1233: 134).
     In one embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic compounds of the invention
     are formulated in liposomes. In a more preferred embodiment, the liposomes
25   include a targeting moiety. In a most preferred embodiment, the therapeutic
     compounds in the liposomes are delivered by bolus injection to a site proximal to
     the desired area, e.g., the site of a tumor. The composition must be fluid to the
     extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of
     manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of
30   microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.
     In a further embodiment, antibodies of the invention can be formulated to prevent
     or reduce their transport across the placenta. This can be done by methods known
     in the art, e.g., by PEGylation of the antibodies or by use of F(ab)2' fragments.
                                           82

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302

      conjugates. Resistance to enzymatic degradation. J. Immunol. Methods, 152: 177

      A "therapeutically effective dosage" for tumor therapy can be measured by
      objective tumor responses which can either be complete or partial. A complete
      response (CR) is defined as no clinical, radiological or other evidence of disease. A
10    partial response (PR) results from a reduction in aggregate tumor size of greater
      than 50%. Median time to progression is a measure that characterizes the durability
      of the objective tumor response.
      A "therapeutically effective dosage" for tumor therapy can also be measured by its
15    ability to stabilize the progression of disease. The ability of a compound to inhibit
      cancer can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human
      tumors. Alternatively, this property of a composition can be evaluated by
      examining the ability of the compound to inhibit cell growth or apoptosis by in
      vitro assays known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount
20    of a therapeutic compound can decrease tumor size, or otherwise ameliorate
      symptoms in a subject. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine
      such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the
      subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration
      selected.
25
      The composition must be sterile and fluid to the extent that the composition is
      deliverable by syringe. In addition to water, the carrier can be an isotonic buffered
      saline solution, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid
      polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity
30    can be maintained, for example, by use of coating such as lecithin, by maintenance
      of required particle size in the case of dispersion and by use of surfactants. In
      many cases, it is preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars,
      polyalcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the composition.
      Long-term absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by
                                             83

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
      including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example,
      aluminum monostearate or gelatin.
      When the active compound is suitably protected, as described above, the
  5   compound may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an
      assimilable edible carrier.
      IV. Uses and Methods of the Invention
      The     antibodies     (including    immunoconjugates,      bispecifics/multispecifics,
10    compositions and other derivatives described herein) of the present invention have
      numerous therapeutic utilities involving the treatment of disorders involving cells
      expressing CLD18. For example, the antibodies can be administered to cells in
      culture, e.g., in vitro or ex vivo, or to human subjects, e.g., in vivo, to treat or
      prevent a variety of disorders such as those described herein. As used herein, the
15    term "subject" is intended to include human and non-human animals which
      respond to the antibodies against CLD18. Preferred subjects include human
      patients having disorders that can be corrected or ameliorated by killing diseased
      cells, in particular cells characterized by an altered expression pattern of CLD18
      compared to normal cells.
20
      A therapeutic effect in the treatments discussed herein is preferably achieved
      through the functional properties of the antibodies of the invention to mediate
      killing of cells e.g. by inducing complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
      mediated lysis, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated lysis,
25    apoptosis, homotypic adhesion, and/or phagocytosis, preferably by inducing CDC
      mediated lysis and/or ADCC mediated lysis.
      For example, in one embodiment, antibodies of the present invention can be used
      to treat a subject with a tumorigenic disorder, e.g., a disorder characterized by the
30    presence of tumor cells expressing CLD18 including, for example, gastric cancer.
      Examples of tumorigenic diseases which can be treated and/or prevented
      encompass all CLD18 expressing cancers and tumor entities including stomach
      cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast
      cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, cancer of the gallbladder and head-neck
                                             84

   WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
       cancer. These cancers may be in early, intermediate or advanced stages, e.g.
       metastasis.
       The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment described according to
  5    the invention may also be used for immunization or vaccination to prevent a
       disease described herein.
       In another embodiment, antibodies of the invention can be used to detect levels of
       CLD 18 or particular forms of CLD 18, or levels of cells which contain CLD 18 on
10     their membrane surface, which levels can then be linked to certain diseases or
       disease symptoms such as described above. Alternatively, the antibodies can be
       used to deplete or interact with the function of CLD18 expressing cells, thereby
       implicating these cells as important mediators of the disease. This can be achieved
      by contacting a sample and a control sample with the anti-CLD 18 antibody under
15    conditions that allow for the formation of a complex between the antibody and
      CLD 18. Any complexes formed between the antibody and CLD 18 are detected
      and compared in the sample and a control sample, i.e. a reference sample.
      Antibodies of the invention can be initially tested for their binding activity
20    associated with therapeutic or diagnostic uses in vitro. For example, the antibodies
      can be tested using flow cytometric assays as described herein.
      Moreover, activity of the antibodies in triggering at least one effector-mediated
      effector cell activity, including inhibiting the growth of and/or killing of cells
25    expressing CLD18, can be assayed. For example, the ability of the antibodies to
      trigger CDC and/or apoptosis can be assayed. Protocols for assaying for CDC,
      homotypic adhesion, molecular clustering or apoptosis are described herein.
      The antibodies of the invention can be used to elicit in vivo or in vitro one or more
30    of the following biological activities: to inhibit the growth of and/or differentiation
      of a cell expressing CLD18; to kill a cell expressing CLD18; to mediate
      phagocytosis or ADCC of a cell expressing CLD18 in the presence of effector
      cells; to mediate CDC of a cell expressing CLD18 in the presence of complement;
                                             85

  WO 2007/059997                                                      PCT/EP2006/011302
     to mediate apoptosis of a cell expressing CLD18; to induce homotypic adhesion;
     and/or to induce translocation into lipid rafts upon binding CLD18.
     In a particular embodiment, the antibodies are used in vivo or in vitro to treat,
 5   prevent or diagnose a variety of CLD18-related diseases. Examples of CLD18
     related diseases include, among others, cancers such as gastric cancer, pancreatic
     cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer and cancers as those listed above.
     CLD18A2 is also expressed in differentiated normal stomach cells. Possible
10   antibody induced clinical side effects by killing of these cells may be reduced or
     avoided by parallel administration of stomach protective drugs such as antacida, or
     inhibitors of the gastric proton pump such as omeprazol or related drugs.
      Suitable routes of administering the antibody compositions of the invention in vivo
15   and in vitro are well known in the art and can be selected by those of ordinary
     skill.
     As described above, anti-CLD18 antibodies of the invention can be co
     administered with one or other more therapeutic agents, e.g., a cytotoxic agent, a
20   radiotoxic agent, antiangiogeneic agent or and immunosuppressive agent to reduce
     the induction of immune responses against the antibodies of invention. The
     antibody can be linked to the agent (as an immunocomplex) or can be administered
     separate from the agent. In the latter case (separate administration), the antibody
     can be administered before, after or concurrently with the agent or can be co
25   administered with other known therapies, e.g., an anti-cancer therapy, e.g.,
     radiation. Such therapeutic agents include, among others, anti-neoplastic agents
     such as listed above. Co-administration of the anti-CLD18 antibodies of the
     present invention with chemotherapeutic agents provides two anti-cancer agents
     which operate via different mechanisms yielding a cytotoxic effect to tumor cells.
30   Such co-administration can solve problems due to development of resistance to
     drugs or a change in the antigenicity of the tumor cells which would render them
     unreactive with the antibody.
                                            86

   WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
      In another particular embodiment of the invention, the subject being administered
      the antibody is additionally treated with an antiagionic agent including antibodies
      targeting VEGF or VEGFR and one or more chemical compounds inhibiting
      angiogenesis. Pretreatment with or parallel applicatition of these drugs may
 5    improve the penetration of antibodies in bulk tumors.
      In another particular embodiment of the invention, the subject being administered
      the antibody is additionally treated with a compound inhibiting growth factor
      receptor signaling including monoclonal antibodies binding to the EGFR receptor
10    as well as chemical compounds inhibiting signaling initiated by the EGFR, Herl or
      Her2/neu receptor.
      Target-specific effector cells, e.g., effector cells linked to compositions (e.g.
      antibodies, multispecific and bispecific molecules) of the invention can also be
15    used as therapeutic agents. Effector cells for targeting can be human leukocytes
      such as macrophages, neutrophils or monocytes. Other cells include eosinophils,
      natural killer cells and other IgG-or IgA-receptor bearing cells. If desired, effector
      cells can be obtained from the subject to be treated. The target-specific effector
      cells can be administered as a suspension of cells in a physiologically acceptable
20    solution. The number of cells administered can be in the order of 108 to 109 but
      will vary depending on the therapeutic purpose. In general, the amount will be
      sufficient to obtain localization at the target cell, e.g., a tumor cell expressing
      CLD18, and to effect cell killing by, e.g., phagocytosis. Routes of administration
      can also vary.
25
      Therapy with target-specific effector cells can be performed in conjunction with
      other techniques for removal of targeted cells. For example, anti-tumor therapy
      using the compositions of the invention and/or effector cells armed with these
      compositions can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy. Additionally,
30    combination immunotherapy may be used to direct two distinct cytotoxic effector
      populations toward tumor cell rejection. For example, anti-CLD18 antibodies
      linked to anti-Fc-RI or anti-CD3 may be used in conjunction with IgG- or IgA
      receptor specific binding agents.
                                            87

  WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
     Bispecific and multispecific molecules of the invention can also be used to
     modulate Fc-gammaR or Fc-alphaR levels on effector cells, such as by capping
     and eliminating receptors on the cell surface. Mixtures of anti-Fc receptors can
     also be used for this purpose.
 5
     The compositions (e.g., antibodies, multispecific and bispecific molecules and
     immunoconjugates) of the invention which have complement binding sites, such as
     portions from IgGI, -2, or -3 or IgM which bind complement, can also be used in
     the presence of complement. In one embodiment, ex vivo treatment of a population
10   of cells comprising target cells with a binding agent of the invention and
     appropriate effector cells can be supplemented by the addition of complement or
     serum containing complement. Phagocytosis of target cells coated with a binding
     agent of the invention can be improved by binding of complement proteins. In
     another embodiment target cells coated with the compositions of the invention can
15   also be lysed by complement. In yet another embodiment, the compositions of the
     invention do not activate complement.
     The compositions of the invention can also be administered together with
     complement. Accordingly, within the scope of the invention are compositions
20   comprising antibodies, multispecific or bispecific molecules and serum or
     complement. These compositions are advantageous in that the complement is
     located in close proximity to the antibodies, multispecific or bispecific molecules.
     Alternatively, the antibodies, multispecific or bispecific molecules of the invention
25   and the complement or serum can be administered separately. Binding of the
     compositions of the present invention to target cells causes translocation of the
     CLD18 antigen-antibody complex into lipid rafts of the cell membrane. Such
     translocation creates a high density of antigen-antibody complexes which may
     efficiently activate and/or enhance CDC.
30
     Also within the scope of the present invention are kits comprising the antibody
     compositions of the invention (e.g., antibodies and immunoconjugates) and
     instructions for use. The kit can further contain one or more additional reagents,

     one or more additional antibodies of the invention (e.g., an antibody having a
     complementary activity).
     Accordingly, patients treated with antibody compositions of the invention can be
 5   additionally    administered    (prior  to, simultaneously     with,  or  following
     administration of a antibody of the invention) with another therapeutic agent, such
     as a cytotoxic or radiotoxic agent, which enhances or augments the therapeutic
     effect of the antibodies of the invention.
10   In other embodiments, the subject can be additionally treated with an agent that
     modulates, e.g., enhances or inhibits, the expression or activity of Fc-gamma or
     Fc-alpha receptors by, for example, treating the subject with a cytokine. Preferred
     cytokines include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte
     macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-y (IFN-y), and tumor
15   necrosis factor (TNF). Other important agents for increasing the therapeutic
     efficacy of the antibodies and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are   p
     glucans which are homopolysaccharides of branched glucose residues and are
     produced by a variety of plants and microorganisms, for example, bacteria, algae,
     fungi, yeast and grains. Fragments of $-glucans produced by organisms may be
20   also be used. Preferably, the p-glucan is a polymer of    P(1,3) glucose wherein at
     least some of the backbone glucose units, e.g. 3-6 % of the backbone glucose units,
     possess branches such as   P(1,6) branches.
     In a particular embodiment, the invention provides methods for detecting the
25   presence of CLD18 antigen in a sample, or measuring the amount of CLD18
     antigen, comprising contacting the sample, and a control sample, with a antibody
     which specifically binds to CLD 18, under conditions that allow for formation of a
     complex between the antibody or portion thereof and CLD 18. The formation of a
     complex is then detected, wherein a difference complex formation between the
30   sample compared to the control sample is indicative for the presence of CLD18
     antigen in the sample.
     In still another embodiment, the invention provides a method for detecting the
     presence or quantifying the amount of CLD 18-expressing cells in vivo or in vitro.
                                            89

  WO 2007/059997                                                    PCT/EP2006/011302
     The method comprises (i) administering to a subject a composition of the invention
     conjugated to a detectable marker; (ii) exposing the subject to a means for
     detecting said detectable marker to identify areas containing CLD 18-expressing
     cells.
 5
     Methods as described above are useful, in particular, for diagnosing CLD18
     related diseases and/or the localization of CLD18-related diseases such as cancer
     diseases. Preferably an amount of CLD18, preferably CLD18-A2 in a sample
     which is higher than the amount of CLD18, preferably CLD18-A2, in a control
10   sample is indicative for the presence of a CLD18-related disease in a subject, in
     particular a human, from which the sample is derived.
     In yet another embodiment immunoconjugates of the invention can be used to
     target compounds (e.g., therapeutic agents, labels, cytotoxins, radiotoxins
15   immunosuppressants, etc.) to cells which have CLD18 expressed on their surface
     by linking such compounds to the antibody. Thus, the invention also provides
     methods for localizing ex vivo or in vitro cells expressing CLD18, such as
     circulating tumor cells.
20   The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are
     not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
     EXAMPLES
25   1. Generation of murine antibodies against CLD18
     a. Immunizations:
     Balb/c or C57/BL6 mice were immunized with eucaryotic expression vectors,
     encoding human CLD18 fragments (SEQ ID NO: 15, 16; 17, 18). 50 Ig or 25 Ig
     of plasmid DNA was injected into the quadriceps (intramuscular, i.m.) on days 1
30   and 10 for generation of monoclonal antibodies of Setl or alternatively on days 1
     and 9, 1 and 11, or 1, 16 and 36 for generation of monoclonal antibodies of Set2 in
     the presence of adjuvants, for example CpG (for details see Tab. lb). CpG as well
     as cells transfected with CLD18A2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) alone or co-transfected
     additionally with     murine   soluble   CD40L encoding     RNA were       injected
                                           90

     intramuscularly, PEI-Man was injected intramuscularly or intraperitonally. The
     presence of antibodies directed against human CLD18 in sera of mice was
     monitored by immune fluorescence microscopy between day 16 and 43 depending
     on the specific immunization protocol used. The immune fluorescence was
 5   determined using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a nucleic acid
     encoding a fusion construct comprising human CLD 18A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2) and
     a fluorescent reporter protein. Mice with detectable immune responses (Fig. 1)
     were boosted three days prior to splenectomy for generation of monoclonal
     antibodies of Setl, or mice were boosted three days, three and two days, or mice
10   were boosted four, three and two days prior to splenectomy for generation of
     monoclonal antibodies of Set2 by intraperitonal injection of 5 x 107 or alternatively
      1 x 108 HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a nucleic acid encoding human
     CLD18A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2) (for details see Tab. 1b). In Tab. la the
     immunization protocols used are dedicated to the respective monoclonal

     b. Generation of hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies to CLD 18:
     Mouse splenocytes were isolated and fused with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell
     line based on standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas were then screened for
     production of immunoglobulines with CLD18 specificity using HEK293 cells
 5   transfected with a nucleic acid encoding human CLD18 by FACS analysis.
     Single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused
     with P3X63Ag8U.1 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1597) in a
     2:1 ratio using 50% PEG (Roche Diagnostics, CRL 738641). Cells were plated at
     approximately 3 x 104 /well in flat bottom microtiter plates, followed by about two
10   week incubation in selective medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2%
     hybridoma fusion and cloning supplement (HFCS, Roche Diagnostics, CRL 1 363
     735) plus 10 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 pg/ml gentamycin
     and 1x HAT (Sigma, CRL H0262). After 10 to 14 days individual wells were
     screened by flow cytometry for anti-CLD18 monoclonal antibodies. The antibody
15   secreting hybridomas were replated, screened again and, if still positive for anti
     CLD18 monoclonal antibodies, were subcloned by limiting dilution. The stable
     subclones were then cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in
     tissue culture medium for characterization. At least one clone from each
     hybridoma, which retained the reactivity of parent cells (by FACS), was chosen. 9
20   vial cell banks were generated for each clone and stored in liquid nitrogen.
     c. Selection of monoclonal antibodies binding to CLD 18:
     To determine the isotype of antibodies, an isotype ELISA was performed. The
     mouse monoAB ID Kit (Zymed, CRL 90-6550) or alternatively the IsoStrip Mouse
25   Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Kit (Roche, Cat. No. 1493027) was used to
     determine Ig subclasses of the identified CLD18 reactive monoclonal antibodies.
     Defined as Setl, nineteen hybridoma cell lines were generated, six from a fusion of
     cells from a C57/BL6 mouse immunized with CLD18A2-LoopD3 (SEQ ID NOs:
      17, 18), thirteen from a fusion of cells from a Balb/c mouse immunized with

     2. Production of Monoclonal Antibodies
     Production and purification of monoclonal antibodies reactive to CLD 18:
     To produce mg amounts of antibody for functional characterization, hybridoma
     cells were seeded in dialysis based bioreactors (CELLine CL1000, Integra, Chur,
 5   CH) at 2 x 106 cells / ml. Antibody containing supernatant was harvested once
     weekly. Mouse monoclonal antibody was purified using Melon Gel (Pierce,
     Rockford, USA) and concentrated by ammonium sulphate precipitation or
     alternatively purified by ProteinA using FPLC. Antibody concentration and purity
     was determined by BCA-Assay and purity checked by sodium dodecylsulphate gel
10   electrophoresis and coomassie staining.

     To generate CLD18A2 expressing cells, HEK293 or CHO cells were transfected
15   with nucleic acids encoding CLD18A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2) or CLD18A2-myc
     (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4).
     HEK293 cells were transfected with CLDN18A2-myc (SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4) or left
     untransfected. 24 hours post transfection, cells were harvested, lysed and subjected
     to sodium dodecylsulphate gel electrophoresis. The gel was blotted and stained
20   with a mouse anti-myc antibody. After incubation with a peroxidase labelled anti
     mouse antibody, the blot was developed with ECL reagent and visualized using a
     LAS-3000 imager (Fuji). Only in the transfected cells but not in the negative
     control, a band with the expected molecular weight of CLD 18-myc was observed
     (Fig. 2).
25   CHO cells were transfected with CLDl8A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2) and grown on
     chamber slides for 24 h. Cells were fixed with methanol and stained with a rabbit
     polyclonal antibody against CLD18 at 1 ig/ml for 60 min. at 25*C. After washing,
     cells were stained with an Alexa488 labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular
     Probes) and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 3 shows transfected CHO
30   cells, expressing CLD 18 on the cell membrane as well as untransfected cells.
     These heterologously CLD18 expressing cells were used for the following assays
     to test the specificity of antibody binding.

  WO 2007/059997                                                     PCT/EP2006/011302
     b. Selection of Monoclonal Antibodies Binding to CLD18/Primary Screens by
     Flow Cytometry:
     HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding human
     CLD 18A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2) and a fluorescing reporter protein 40 h prior to the
 5   assay or alternatively HEK293 cells stably expressing human CLD18A2
     (HEK293-CLD18A2) were used and counterstained with propidium iodide (PI).
     After cell detachment using 2mM EDTA/PBS cells were washed with complete
     growth medium and plated at approximately 1-5 x 105 cells/well in U-bottom
     microtiter plates. Cells were incubated for 30 min. at 4* C with hybridoma
10   supernatant followed by two washing steps with 1%heatinactivated FBS/PBS and
     finally incubation with APC or Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG specific
     secondary antibody. After two washing steps, co-transfected cells were fixed with
     CellFIX (BD Biosciences). Binding was assessed by flow cytometry using a BD
     FACSArray. Fluorescence marker expression is plotted on the horizontal axis
15   against antibody binding on the vertical axis. All mouse antibodies 24H5, 26B5,
     26D12, 28D10, 37G11, 3718, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11, 41C6, 42E12, 43Al1, 44E10,
     47D12, 61C2, 75B8, 85A3, 9E8, 19B9, 45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2, and
      175D10 were dectected to bind specifically to the surface of fluorescence marker
     expressing cells (Fig. 4, cells in Q2) as exemplified for hybridoma supernatants
20   containing monoclonal antibodies 24H5 (Fig. 4A, cells in Q2), 85A3 (Fig. 4B),
      175D10, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2 and 45C1 (Fig. 4C, cells in Qi).
     c. Comparison of antibody binding to Myc- or HA-tagged CLD18A2:
     The binding characteristics      of the identified   CLD18-specific    monoclonal
25   antibodies were further specified. Therefore, monoclonal antibody binding was
     analyzed to CLD18A2 mutants, created by insertion of epitope tags. CLD18A2
     HA (SEQ ID NO: 6) contains a HA-epitope tag in CLD18A2-loopl, whereas
     CLD18A2-Myc (SEQ ID NO: 4) contains a Myc-epitope tag inserted into
     CLD18A2-loop2. As insertion of these tags causes destruction of epitopes, the
30   identified monoclonal antibodies, can be grouped according to the loss of binding
     to any of the mutants. HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with a fluorescence
     marker and human CLD 18A2, or with a fluorescence marker and CLD 18A2-HA,
     or with a fluorescence marker and CLD 18A2-Myc were incubated with hybridoma
     supernatants containing CLD1 8-specific monoclonal antibodies for 30 min. at 4*C,
                                          96

   WO 2007/059997                                                     PCT/EP2006/011302
      followed by incubation with Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
      antibody. Before analysis on a BD FACSArray, cells were fixed using CeIlFIX. As
      exemplified for 24H5, 9E8, 26B5 and 19B9 in Fig. 5, monoclonal antibodies could
      be separated based on their binding characteristics into four different groups: (i)
  5   antibodies that bind to unmodified CLD18A2 as well as to CLD18A2-HA and
      CLD18A2-Myc, e.g. 24H5, (Fig. 5A), or (ii) antibodies that do not bind to
      CLD18A2-HA, e.g. 9E8, (Fig. 5B), or (iii) antibodies that do not bind to
      CLD18A2-Myc, e.g. 26B5, (Fig. 5C), or (iv) antibodies that do not bind to
      CLDl8A2-HA nor to CLD18A2-Myc, e.g. 19B9, (Fig. 5D).
10
      d. Comparison of antibody binding to human CLD18A1 versus CLD18A2
      transfectants by flow cytometry:
      Binding specificity of the identified monoclonal antibodies to CLD 18A2 isoforms
      was analyzed by flow cytometry. HEK293 cells stably expressing human
15    CLD18A2 (HEK293-CLD18A2) and HEK293 cells stably expressing human
      CLDl8AI (SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8) (HEK293-CLD18A1) were incubated for 30 min.
      at 4'C with hybridoma supernatants containing monoclonal antibodies, followed
      by incubation with Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and
      fixation of cells or alternatively without fixation but with PI counterstaining.
20    Binding was assessed by flow cytometry using a BD FACSArray. Fig. 6 shows
     examples for the two groups of monoclonal antibodies that were identified in the
     panel comprised of 24H5, 26B5, 26D12, 28D10, 37G11, 37H8, 38G5, 38H3,
     39F11, 41C6, 42E12, 43All, 44E10, 47D12, 61C2, 75B8, 85A3, 9E8, 19B9,
     45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2, 175D10: (i) monoclonal antibodies 43A11, 45C1,
25   and 163E12 bind specifically to human CLDl8A2 but not to human CLD18AI
     (Fig 6A,B), and (ii) monoclonal antibody 37H8 binds to both human isoforms (Fig
     6A).
     e. Comparison of antibody binding to human CLD18AI versus CLD18A2
30   transfectants by immunofluorescence microscopy:
     HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding a
     fusion protein of CLD18AI (SEQ ID NO: 8) or CLDl8A2 (SEQ ID NO: 2) with a
     fluorescence reporter and grown on chamber slides. Cells were either stained
     unfixed or after paraformaldehyde fixation with monoclonal antibody containing
                                            97

   WO 2007/059997                                                         PCT/EP2006/011302
      tissue culture supernatant for 30 min. at 37*C. After washing, cells were stained
      with an Alexa555-labelled anti-mouse Ig antibody (Molecular Probes). Binding of
      antibodies was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7,
      antibody 37G11 specifically reacted with CLD18A2 (Fig. 7A) but not with
  5   CLD 18A 1 (Fig. 7B). In contrast, antibody 26B5 was reactive with both, CLD 18A2
      and CLD18AI (Fig. 8).
      For antibodies 24H5, 26B5, 26D12, 28D10, 37G11, 37H8, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11,
      41C6, 42E12, 43All, 44E10, 47D12, 61C2, 75B8, 85A3, 9E8, 19B9, a clear
      difference between staining of living cells and paraformaldehyde fixed cells was
10    observed. The antibodies formed an uniform membrane staining when cells were
      fixed (Fig. 7C, 8C, 8D). In contrast, incubation of living cells with these antibodies
      leads to the generation of protein clusters, visible as a speckle like staining pattern
      (Fig. 7A, 8A, 8B). This shows that all antibodies bind to native epitopes as found
      on the surface of living cells.
15
      f. Determination of endogenously expressing cell lines:
      A CLD18A2 gene-specific primer pair (SEQ ID NO: 11, 12) was used in RT-PCR
      analyses to screen cell lines for expression of CLD 18A2. Human gastric carcinoma
     cell lines NCI-SNU-16 (ATCC CRL-5974), NUGC-4 (JCRB0834) and KATO-III
20   (ATCC HTB- 103) and human pancreas adenocarcinoma cell line DAN-G (DSMZ
     ACC249) were found to display robust endogenous expression of CLD 18 (Fig. 9).
     Expression was confirmed on protein level by staining with a rabbit polyclonal
     serum against CLD 18.
25   g. Staining of endogenously expressing cell lines with CLD18 specific antibodies
     and immunofluorescence analysis:
     DAN-G, SNU-16, NUGC-4 and KATO-III cells were grown on chamber slides
     under standard conditions. Cells were unfixed or alternatively fixed with methanol
     and stained with the respective antibodies. For antibodies 24H5, 26B5, 26D12,
30   28D10, 37G11, 37H8, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11, 41C6, 42E12, 43A11, 44E10, 47D12,
     61C2, 75B8, 85A3, 9E8, 19B9 staining of the cell surface was observed as
     exemplified in Fig. 10, 11 and 12A. For antibodies 45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2,
     and 175D10 native epitope recognition was assayed and cell surface staining was
     observed on unfixed cells as shown in Fig 12B. Subgroups of antibodies showed
                                             98

   WO 2007/059997                                                     PCT/EP2006/011302
      homogenous staining of the cell membrane either preponderantly at cell-cell
      interfaces or at free parts of the membrane not adjacent to other cells. Other
      antibodies stained discrete foci and aggregates on the cell membrane altogether
      demonstrating that the respective antibodies bind to different epitopes including
  5   epitopes which are masked by homotypic or heterotypic association of CLD18 as
      well as CLD18 epitopes accessible in preformed tight junctions.
      h. Staining of endogenously expressing cell lines by flow cytometry:
      Surface expression of constitutively expressed CLD18A2 on KATO-III and
10    NUGC-4 living cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. This is exemplified by
      KATO-III and NUGC-4 cells stained with monoclonal antibody 61C2 or 163E12,
      followed by incubation with Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
      antibody and fixation of cells or alternatively without fixation. Binding was
      assessed by flow cytometry using a BD FACSArray. Fig. 13 shows a strong
15    binding of 61C2 to at least 70.3% of KATO-III cells and of 163E12 to CLD18A2
      on KATO-III and NUGC-4 cells.
      i. Sequence alignment of mouse and human CLD1 8AI and CLD1 8A2:
      Human CLD18A2 (NP_ 001002026) and human CLD18AI (NP_057453) in a
20    sequence comparison differ in the N-terminus and mouse CLD18 variants
     (NP_062789 and AAL15636) demonstrate high homology and sequence variation
      sites between the molecules (see Fig. 14).
     j. Reactivity of antibodies with murine CLD 18A 1 and murine CLD 18A2 analyzed
25   by flow cytometry:
     Binding of the identified monoclonal antibodies to murine CLD18A2 and
     CLD18AI was analyzed by flow cytometry. HEK293 cells transiently co
     transfected with a fluorescence marker and murine CLD1 8A2 (SEQ ID NOs: 33,
     35) or with a fluorescence marker and murine CLD18Al (SEQ ID NOs: 36, 37)
30   were incubated with hybridoma supernatants containing the human CLD18
     specific monoclonal antibodies 38G5, 38H3,           37G11, 45C1      and 163E12,
     respectively, for 30 min. at 4C, followed by incubation with Alexa647-conjugated
     anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and fixation of cells. Binding was assessed by
     flow cytometry using a BD FACSArray. Fig. 15 shows three different binding
                                            99

   WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
      profiles: 38G5, and 45C1 do not bind to any of the murine CLD18 isoforms,
      37G11, and 163E12 bind to murine CLD18A2 but not to murine CLD18A1, and
      38H3 binds to murine CLD18A1 and CLD18A2. These antibodies are valuable
      tools to determine a potential toxicity of CLD18 monoclonal antibodies in
  5   preclinical studies.
      Altogether these data show, that monoclonal antibodies of the invention 24H5,
      26B5, 26D12, 28D10, 37G11, 37H8, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11, 41C6, 42E12, 43Al1,
      44E10, 47D12, 61C2, 75B8, 85A3, 9E8, 19B9, 45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2, and
      175D 10 generated against CLD 18 represents a diversity of binding characteristics
10    to different epitopes and topologies of human CLD18.
      A combination of different properties described in examples 3b, c, d, e, g, h, and j
      can be used to categorize monoclonal antibodies into such different classes.
      4. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
15    A CLD18A2 epitope specific antibody generated by immunization with the
     peptide of SEQ ID NO: 21 was used for immunohistochemical characterisation of
      CLD18A2       expression. Paraffin embedded tissue sections derived from a
      comprehensive panel of normal and tumor tissues were used for protein expression
     and localisation analyses. No significant expression was detected in any other
20   normal organ tissue except stomach (see Tab. 2, Fig. 16A). In contrast, CLD1 8A2
     expression was verified by immunohistochemistry in different cancers including
     stomach cancer and lung cancer (Fig. 16B).
     Interestingly, expression of CLD18A2 protein in gastric mucosa was restricted to
     terminally differentiated cells of the gastric epithelium in the base and pit regions.
25   In contrast, cells in the neck region of gastric mucosa, in particular gastric stem
     cells in the isthmus part, which replenish the entire mucosa, do not express
     CLD18A2 (Fig. 16C).

   The monoclonal antibody 39Fll was used for immunohistochemical CLD18A2 specific
   studies. As shown in Fig. 17A, no significant reactivity was detectable on all tested normal
   tissues except stomach (Fig. 17A), whereas stomach carcinomas and lung carcinomas remain
5  strongly positive (Fig. 17B).
  Another group of antibodies of the invention shows a specific cancer staining pattern with
  binding to stomach cancer but no reactivity with normal stomach tissue. Such a staining
  pattern is shown in Fig. 18A with monoclonal antibody 26B5.
  Immunohistochemistry was used for specificity analysis of 175D10 (Fig. 18B), 43A1 1 (Fig.
0  18C), 163E12 (Fig.18D) and 45C1 (Fig. 18E) on sections derived from HEK293 tumor cell
   lines: HEK293 tumor cell lines stably expressing human CLD1 8A2 (HEK293-CLD1 8A2) or
   CLD18AI (HEK293-CLD18A1) or being transfected with an expression control plasmid
  containing only the antibiotic resistence gene for selection (HEK293-mock) were xenografted
  into mice to form solid tumors. No expression was detectable in mock-transfected HEK293
5 xenograft tumors. In contrast, strong and homogeneous membran-staining was observed in
  HEK293-CLD18A2 xenograft tumors and in stomach carcinoma specimens.
  5.       Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)
  a. CDC of monoclonal antibodies of Setl as measured by flow cytometry:
D Plasma for complement lysis was prepared by drawing blood from healthy volunteers into S
  Monovette-EDTA vacutainer tubes (Sarstedt, Nuirmbrecht, Germany) which were then
  centrifuged at 600 g for 20 min. Plasma was harvested and stored at -20*C.
  In a first set of experiments hybridoma supernatants were analyzed for their capability to
5 induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against HEK293 cells stably expressing
  human CLD18A2 (HEK293-CLD18A2). Cells were incubated with hybridoma supernatants
  containing monoclonal antibodies 85A3, 28D10, 241-15 or 26D12, respectively for 20 min. at
  room temperature. Following centrifugation (5 min. at 450 g) the supernatant was removed
  and 20% human plasma in DMEM (prewarmed to 37*C) was added to the cells and incubated
0 for another 20 min. at 37*C. Thereafter, cell lysis was determined on FACS by using the
  propidium iodide (PI) staining method. PI was added to a final concentration of 2.5 pg/ml.
  For flow cytometry, a BD FACSArray flow cytometer was used (BD Biosciences, Mountain
  View, CA). At least 10000 events were collected for analysis with cell debris excluded by
  adjustment of the forward sideward scatter (FCS) threshold. The percentage of lysed cells (PI
                                               102

      WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
  positive cells) is shown in Figure 19. Monoclonal antibodies 85A3, 28D10 and 26D12
  induced lysis of 33.5%, 38.2% and 39.2%, respectively of HEK293-CLD18A2 cells, whereas
  CDC mediated by 24H5 was only 19.3%.
5 b. CDC of monoclonal antibodies of Setl:
  In a second set of experiments the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to induce CDC on
  CLD18A2 expressing cells was analyzed. Therefore, a set of antibodies binding either
  specific to human CLD18A2 or also binding to human CLD18A1 was tested for CDC
  induction against CHO cells stably transfected with human CLD18A2 (CHO-CLD18A2) or
0 human CLD18AI (CHO-CLD18A1). CHO-CLD18A2 and CHO-CLD18AI cells were
  seeded 24 h before the assay with a density of 3 x 104 /well in tissue-culture flat-bottom
  microtiter plates. The next day growth medium was removed and the cells were incubated in
  triplicates with hybridoma supernatants adjusted to a concentration of 10 ptg/ml containing
  monoclonal antibodies 24H5, 26D12, 28D10, 37G11, 37H8, 38G5, 38H3, 39F11, 41C6,
5 42E12, 43All, 44E10, 47D12, and 61C2, respectively. Control cells were incubated with
  growth medium or growth medium containing 0.2% saponin for the determination of
  background lysis and maximal lysis, respectively. After incubation for 20 min. at room
  temperature supernatant was removed and 20% human plasma in DMEM (prewarmed to
  37*C) was added to the cells and incubated for another 20 min. at 37'C. Then, supernatants
o were replaced by PBS containing 2.5 pg/ml ethidium bromide and fluorescence emission after
  excitation at 520 nm was measured using a Tecan Safire. The percentage specific lysis was
  calculated as follows: % specific lysis = (fluorescence sample - fluorescence background) /
  (fluorescence maximal lysis - fluorescence background) x 100. Fig. 20 shows that monoclonal
  antibodies 26D12, 28D10, 37H8, 38H3 and 39F1 1 mediate high, monoclonal antibody 38G5
5 mediates medium, monoclonal antibodies 41C6 and 61C2 mediate low, and monoclonal
  antibodies 24H5, 37G 11, 42E12, 43A 11, 44E10 and 47D12 mediate no CDC against CHO
  CLD 18A2 cells. In contrast, none of the antibodies is capable of inducing CDC against CHO
  CLDA1 cells, although 26D12, 28D10, 37H8, 38H3, 39F11, 41C6, 47D12 and 61C2 also
  bind to CLD1 8Al as determined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.

  c. Monoclonal antibody titration and CDC using monoclonal antibodies of Setl:
  To measure the ability of the anti-CLD 18 antibodies to induce CDC at low concentrations, an
  experiment was performed where three different antibodies were titrated. CHO-CLD18A2
  cells growing in microtiter plates were incubated with a concentration range of 75B8 (100, 30,
                                               103

   10, 3 and 1 ptg/ml), 37H8 (10, 3.3 and 1 pg/ml) and 28D10 (10, 1 and 0.1 pg/ml),
  respectively, for 20 min. at room temperature. Supernatant was removed and 20% human
  plasma in DMEM (prewarmed to 37*C) was added to the cells and incubated for another 20
  min. at 37*C. Before analysis using a Tecan Safire, supernatants were replaced by PBS
5 containing 2.5 ig/ml ethidium bromide. Figures 21A-C show the percentage of specific lysis
  as a function of antibody concentration. Monoclonal antibody 75B8 induces lysis of 31.0%
  CHO-CLD18A2 cells at 10 ig/ml, and drops to 6.2% at 1 jig/ml (Fig. 21A), whereas
  monoclonal antibodies 28D10 and 37H8 still induce 39% and 26.5% specific lysis at 1 Ig/ml
  (Fig. 21B, C), respectively.

  d. CDC of monoclonal antibodies of Set2 as measured by flow cytometry:
  Serum for complement lysis was prepared by drawing blood from healthy volunteers into
  Serum-Monovette vacutainer tubes (Sarstedt, Niirmbrecht, Germany) which were then
  centrifuged at 600 g for 20 min. Serum was harvested and stored at -20*C. Control serum
5 was heat inactivated at 56*C for 30 min before storage.
  Hybridoma supernatants were analyzed for their capability to induce complement dependent
  cytotoxicity (CDC) against KATO-III cells endogenously expressing human CLD 1 8A2. Cells
  were incubated with crude or purified hybridoma supernatants containing monoclonal
  antibodies 45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2, and 175D10, respectively for 30 min. at 37*C. 20%
0 human serum in RPMI was added to the cells and incubated for another 30 min. at 37*C.
  Thereafter, cell lysis was determined on FACS by using the propidium iodide (PI) staining
  method. PI was added to a final concentration of 2,5 ptg/ml. For flow cytometry a BD
  FACSArray flow cytometer was used (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). At least 10000
  events were collected for analysis with cell debris excluded by adjustment of the forward
5 sideward scatter (FSC/SSC) threshold.      Specific lysis was calculated by the following
  formula: specific lysis = (% PI-positive cells in sample - % PI-positive cells in sample with
  heat inactivated serum). Robust CDC mediated lysis was observed in particular for 163E12.
  6. Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
0 Hybridoma supernatants were analyzed for their capability to induce antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HEK293 cells stably expressing human CLD18A2
  (HEK293-CLD 18A2) or human CLD 18A 1 (HEK293-CLD 18A 1).

  a. Enrichment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: Human blood from healthy
  donors was diluted twice in phosphate buffer (PBS) and blood cells were layered on Ficoll
  (Lymphocyte Separation Medium 1077 g/ml, PAA Laboratories, cat. no. J15-004). Peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) were collected from the interphase, washed and
5 resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
  calf serum, 2 mM L- glutamine.
  b. ADCC set up: Target cells were labeled with with a fluorescence enhancing ligand
  (BADTA, Perkin Elmer cytotoxicity assay kit DELFIA EuTDA Cytotoxicity Reagents, cat.
o no. ADO 116) for 30 minutes. After extensive washing in RPMI-10 supplemented with 10 mM
  probenecid (Sigma, cat. no. P8761), 10-20 mM HEPES, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf
  serum, the cells were adjusted to 1 x 105 cells/ml. Labeled target cells, effector cells (MNCs),
  and supernatants containing monoclonal antibodies adjusted to a concentration of 10 pg/ml
  were added to round-bottom microtiter plates. For isolated effector cells, an effector to target
5 (E:T) ratio of 100:1 (data not shown for 50:1 and 25:1) was used. After incubation (2 hours,
  370 C), assays were stopped by centrifugation, and fluorescence ligand release from duplicates
  was measured in europium counts in a time-resolved fluorometer. Percentage of cellular
  cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula: % specific lysis = (experimental
  release counts - spontaneous release counts) / (maximal release counts - spontaneous release
o counts) x 100, with maximal fluorescence ligand release determined by adding Triton X-100
  (0,25% final concentration) to target cells, and spontaneous release measured in the absence
  of antibodies and effector cells. Figure 22 shows that monoclonal antibodies 26B5, 37H8,
  38G5, 47D12, and 61C2 mediate ADCC against HEK293-CLD18A2 cells. In contrast, these
  antibodies induce no significant or only low level cytotoxicity on CLD18A1 targets
5 demonstrating a CLD 18A2 specific ADCC (Figure 23).
  7. Proliferation Inhibition
  Purified murine monoclonal antibodies were analyzed for their capability to inhibit cell
  growth of KATO-II cells endogenously expressing human CLD 18A2.
o lx104 target cells endogenously expressing CLD18A2 (KATO-III) were cultured in the
  presence of approximatly 10 pg monoclonal antibodies.
  DELFIA Cell Proliferation Kit (Perkin-Elmer, Cat. No. AD0200) is a non-isotopic
  immunoassay based on the measurement of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation
  during DNA synthesis of proliferating cells in microplates. Incorporated BrdU is detected

   using europium labelled monoclonal antibody. To allow antibody detection cells are fixed and
   DNA denatured using Fix solution. Unbound antibody is washed away and DELFIA inducer
   is added to dissociate europium ions from the labelled antibody into solution, where they form
   highly fluorescent chelates with components of the DELFIA Inducer. The fluorescence
 5 measured - utilizing time-resolved fluorometry in the detection - is proportional to the DNA
   synthesis in the cell of each well.
   Strong inhibition of proliferation was observed with antibodies 125E1, 163E12, 45C1,
   37G1 1, 37H8, 28D10 and 166E2, respectively. . Moderate inhibition of proliferation was
   observed with murine antibodies 43A11, 175D10, 42E12, 26D12, 61C2                   and 38H3,
 0 respectively.
   8. Performance in therapeutic mouse xenograft models
   Therapeutic potential of the identified monoclonal antibodies binding specifically to
   CLD 18A2 was studied in therapeutic xenograft models.
 5
   a. Early treatment of highly CLD18A2 expressing tumors in mice
   SCID mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 x 107 HEK293 cells stably expressing high
   levels of human CLD18A2 (HEK293-CLD18A2). Expression levels of human CLD18A2 in
   HEK293-CLD18A2 cells were comparable with expression levels in primary gastric cancers
 o from patients. Each experimental treatment group comprised 10 mice (number of mice per
   group n=10). Therapy of mice started 3 days after tumor inoculation. 200 ig of purified
   hybridoma supernatants representing murine monoclonal antibodies 26B5, 26D12, 28D10,
   37G 11, 37H8, 38G5, 39F 11, 42E12, 43A 1l, 38H3, or 61C2 were injected once per week for
   4 weeks intravenously. Alternatively 200 pg of purified hybridoma supernatants containing
?5 murine monoclonal antibodies 45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2, or 175D10 were administered
   twice per week for 6 weeks by alternating intravenous and intraperitoneal injection. Tumor
   growth of treated mice was monitored twice per week (Tumor Volume = Length x Width x
   Width divided by 2 in mm 3). The mice were killed if the tumor reached a volume of 500 mm 3
   or in case of severe morbidity. Fig. 24 exemplifies robust inhibition of HEK293-CLD18A2
30 tumor cell growth by antibodies of the invention. Fig. 25A and 25B show prolongation of
   survival by treatment with antibodies of the invention in an early treatment xenograft model
   using HEK293-CLD18A2 cells.

  b. Late onset treatment of advanced highly CLD18A2 expressing tumors in mice
  The same tumor xenograft model based on HEK293-CLD18A2 cells was designed as a late
  therapy onset protocol as opposed to the early treatment described above. On day 27 after
  tumor cell inoculation mice were randomized in test groups each comprising 5-6 mice and
5 therapy was initiated with 200 pg of purified hybridoma supernatants containing murine
  monoclonal antibodies 43All,         163E12, and 175D10, respectively.          Antibodies were
  administered twice per week for 6 weeks by alternating intravenous and intraperitoneal
  injection. Also in this model antibodies of the invention were shown to inhibit tumor growth.
  For several antibodies this resulted in prolongation of survival (Fig. 26).

  c. Early treatment of tumors expressing low levels of CLD18A2
  SCID mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 2 x 105 cells of the DAN-G tumor cell line,
  an infiltrating human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line that constitutively expresses
  CLD18A2 protein at low level. Treatment of mice (10 per group) was initiated 3 days after
5 tumor grafting: 200 pg of purified hybridoma supernatants containing murine monoclonal
  antibodies 45C1, 125E1, 163E12, 166E2, or 175D10 were administered twice per week for 6
  weeks by alternating intravenous and intraperitoneal injection. Owing to the aggressive and
  fast tumor growth of the pancreatic DAN-G tumor cell line in vivo mice developed tumor
  cachexia and died within a few days. Even though, as a consequence, the window for
o measuring therapeutic effects was narrow, tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival
  mediated by antibodies of the invention was also observed in this model (Fig. 27A and 27B).
  d Antibodies of the invention do not elicit side effects in mice
  A murine CLDl8A2-specific primer pair (s: CTA CCA AGG GCT ATG GCG TTC, as: GCA
5 CCG AAG GTG TAC CTG GTC) was used in RT-PCR analyses to amplify cDNA derived
  from a comprehensive panel of normal mouse tissues (see Fig. 28).
  Expression of murine CLD18A2 was not detectable in any tested normal tissues, except
  stomach (see Fig. 28). Furthermore, an CLD18A2 specific antibody, which crossreacts with
  human and mouse CLD18A2, was used for immunohistochemical analysis of CLD18A2
0 expression in a large panel of normal mouse tissues (see Tab. 3). Except for normal gastric
  tissue all tested normal tissues show no CLD 18A2 expression. As we observed for the human
  CLD18A2, we also found for the mouse counterpart that while the surface epithelia- and
  deeper crypt cells express CLD 18A2 at their cell surface, the central neck region is CLD 18A2
  negative (see Fig. 29 A-C). In summary, tissue distribution of CLD18A2 appears to be

 D We further investigated potential side effects mediated by antibodies 125E1, 163E12, 166E2
   and 175D 10 in mice. All of these antibodies had been previously shown by FACS analysis to
   react with the murine CLD 18A2 as well as with the human protein.
   Neither were any visible side effects observed in mice during and after treatment with these
o  antibodies, nor were any histomorphological correlates of toxicity observed in the gastric
   mucosa of antibody treated mice as compared to untreated (PBS- treated) mice (see Figure
   30).
   9. Chimerization of antibodies
5
   a. Generation of mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibodies
   Total RNA and subsequently single stranded cDNA was prepared from human peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and from human spleen tissue by standard methods known
   to those skilled in the art, for example by using RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) and Superscript II
0  reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
                                                 108

        WO 2007/059997                                                        PCT/EP2006/011302
    The constant region of the human kappa light chain was amplified from PBMC cDNA by
    PCR. The sense oligomer (SEQ ID NO:38) added a BamHI restriction site at the 5' end of the
    constant region and changed the original nucleic acid sequence 5'-CGAACT-3' coding for the
 5  first two amino acids (Arg-Thr) of the constant region into 5'-CGTACG-3', generating a
    BsiWI restriction site without changing the amino acid sequence. The antisense oligomer
    (SEQ ID NO:39) included a stop codon and added a NotI restriction site at the 3' end of the
    amplified constant region. The PCR product as well as a standard expression vector (for
    example pcDNA3.1(+), Invitrogen) were sequentially incubated with BamHI and NotI
 D  restriction enzymes. The vector was additionally treated with calf intestinal alkaline
    phosphatase to prevent recirculation. The constant region was finally ligated into the vector,
    so that any forthcoming fusion of a variable region in front of the constant region is now
   possible via a HindIll restriction site (5'-AAGCTT-3')        from the residual vector multiple
    cloning site and via the BsiWI restriction site (5'-CGTACG-3') generated with the PCR
 D product. The sequence of the human kappa light chain constant region inserted into the vector
   is listed as SEQ ID NO:40, the amino acid sequence of the human kappa constant region is
   listed as SEQ ID NO:41.
   The constant region of the human gamma-i heavy chain was amplified from spleen cDNA by
 > PCR. The 5' phosphorylated sense oligomer (SEQ ID NO:42) was placed over the naturally
   occurring Apal restriction site, located 11 nucleotides downstream of the beginning of the
   constant region, and added a HindlIl restriction site at the 5' end of the amplified part of the
   constant region. The 5' phosphorylated antisense oligomer (SEQ ID NO: 43) included a stop
   codon and added a NotI restriction site at the 3' end of the thus amplified constant region. The
5  thus generated PCR product was blunt ended and 5' phosphorylated. The amplified gamma
   constant region was verified to be of the IgGI subclass by PCR with a discriminating
   antisense oligomer (SEQ ID NO: 44) and by sequencing. A standard expression vector (for
   example pcDNA3.1(+)/Hygro, Invitrogen) with a different antibiotic resistance (for example
   hygromycin) than that of the vector used for expression of the light chain (for example
0  neomycin) was incubated with PmeI restriction enzyme to completely remove the multiple
   cloning site leaving blunt ends. The vector was additionally treated with calf intestinal
   alkaline phosphatase to prevent recirculation. The constant region was finally ligated into the
   vector, so that any forthcoming fusion of a variable region in front of the constant region is
   now possible via the HindIll restriction site (5'-AAGCTT-3') and via the Apal restriction site
                                                  109

     (5'-GGGCCC-3'),      both generated with the PCR product. The correct orientation of the
     constant region in the vector, i.e. suitable for the preceeding promoter of the vector, was
     verified by sequencing. Due to the position of the ApaI restriction site, any amplification of a
     variable region for this purpose has to include the first 11 nucleotides of the sequence of the
 5   human gamma-I constant region in addition to the sequence of the Apal site. The sequence of
     the thus amplified human gamma-1 heavy chain constant region inserted into the vector is
     listed as SEQ ID NO:45, the amino acid sequence of the thus expressed human gamma-i
     constant region is listed as SEQ ID NO: 46.

     Amplification of the murine variable regions of light and heavy chains was carried out
     according to the "step-out PCR" method described in Matz et al. (Nucleic Acids Research,
     1999, Vol. 27, No. 6). For this, total RNA was prepared from monoclonal hybridoma cell
                                                   110

       WO 2007/059997                                                      PCT/EP2006/011302
  lines (see Tab. 4) by standard methods known to those skilled in the art, for example with the
  use of RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Single stranded cDNA was prepared according to the
  "template-switch" method also described in Matz et al. (Nucleic Acids Research, 1999, Vol.
  27, No. 6, 1558). In addition to an (dT)30 oligomer (SEQ ID NO: 47), it included a
  DNA/RNA hybrid oligomer (SEQ ID NO: 48) serving as an 5' adaptor for template switching
  during polymerization of the cDNA strand. In this adaptor oligomer the last three nucleotides
  were ribo- instead of deoxyribonucleotides. The subsequent "step-out PCR" used an antisense
  oligomer targeted to the constant region of the mouse kappa chain or to the constant region of
  the subclasses 1, 2a or 3 of the gamma chains (SEQ ID NO: 49 to 52, respectively). The IgG
> subclass of the murine monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cell lines was afore
  immunologically analyzed with IsoStrip (see Example 1), and the appropriate antisense
  oligomer was chosen accordingly (see Tab. 4). A primer mix served as the sense oligomer in
  the "step-out PCR", comprising the two oligomers listed in SEQ ID NO: 53 and 54. Some
  hybridoma cell lines expressed more than one heavy or light chain (in addition to the chains
5 expressed by the myeloma cell line used for the generation of hybridomas). Table 4
  summarizes the SEQ ID NOs of the cloned and sequenced variable regions of the murine
  antibody chains (SEQ ID NO: 55 to 69 and SEQ ID NO: 132 to 146) and of the cloned and
  sequenced full-length chimieric antibody chains (SEQ ID NO: 100 to 129).
J The identified murine variable regions were then amplified by PCR omitting the 5' UTR and
  the 3' mouse constant region, adding restriction sites to the ends which allowed subcloning
  into the prepared expression vectors carrying the human constant regions. In addition, the
   sense oligomers provided a consensus Kozak sequence (5'-GCCGCCACC-3' or 5'
  AGCCACC-3') and the antisense oligomers for heavy chain variable regions included the
5 first 11 nucleotides of the human gamma-I constant region in addition to the Apal restriction
   site (see Tab. 4, SEQ ID NO: 70 to 99). Kappa light chain variable regions were cloned using
  HindIl and BsiWI restriction enzymes, gamma heavy chain variable regions demanded
   HindIl and Apal restriction enzymes. The heavy gamma chain variable region of monoclonal
   antibody 45C1 contained an internal HindIl restriction site - here, the compatible BsaI
o  enzyme was used instead (see SEQ ID NO: 80). SEQ ID NO: 100 to 114 show the nucleic
   acid sequences of the resulting chimerized antibodies (see Tab. 4). SEQ ID NO: 115 to 129
   show the amino acid sequences of the accordingly expressed chimerized antibodies (see Tab.
   4).

  b. Generation and production of chimeric antibodies against CLD18
  Mammalian cell lines producing chimeric antibodies with CLD18 specificity were generated.
  The cell lines derived from HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-l 1268). One day before
  transfection, 2.5 x 107 cells were plated in a 14.5 cm tissue culture dish and cultured in 20 ml
5 of complete medium, or alternatively 1 x 1       cells were plated in a 10 cm tissue culture dish
  and cultured in 10 ml of complete medium, or alternatively 0.6 x 106 cells were plated in a
  well of a 12-well tissue plate and cultured in 2-3 ml of complete medium (complete medium:
  DMEM:F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics). The recommended
  cell density at the time of transfection should be 90% confluence. Immediately before
3 transfection, medium was replaced by fresh medium. HEK293T cells were transfected with
  transfection reagents, e.g. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-019) or alternatively
  Polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich, 408727). Exemplified for transfection of HEK293T cells a
  total DNA amount of 110 pg or 296 pg was used for a 14.5 cm tissue dish, and the ratio of
  transfection agent to DNA was 1:2.5 and 1:12 for Lipofectamine 2000 and PEI, respectively.
5 24 h after transfection medium was replaced with a GMP suitable medium, e.g. X-Vivo 15
  (Cambrex) or a chemical defined medium like Pro293a (Cambrex) without serum.
  Transfected HEK293T cells producing chimeric monoclonal antibodies against CLD18 were
  cultured for further 96 h. Crude supernatants were harvested, sterile filtered and purified by
  protein A-sepharose. Antibody concentration was determined by BCA Assay and purity
0 checked by sodium dodecylsulphate gel electrophoresis and coomassie staining.
  c. Binding Characteristics of Chimeric Monoclonal Antibodies
  Binding specificity of the cloned and generated chimeric monoclonal antibodies to CLD 18A2
  was analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Example 3. HEK293 living cells stably
5 expressing human CLD18A2 (HEK293-CLD18A2) and HEK293 cells stably expressing
  human CLD18A1 (SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8) (HEK293-CLD18A1) were incubated for 30 min. at
  4C with purified HEK293T cell culture supernatants containing chimeric monoclonal
  antibodies, followed by incubation with APC-conjugated F(ab') 2 fragment goat anti-human
  IgG Fcy secondary antibody and counterstained with PI. Binding was assessed by flow
0 cytometry using a BD FACSArray.
  Similarly, endogenously CLD18A2 expressing human tumor cell lines, for example KATO
  III and NUGC-4 cells, were analyzed by flow cytometry.
                                                 112

      WO 2007/059997                                                       PCT/EP2006/011302
  Fig. 31 A and B show flowcytometric analyses of chimeric antibodies ch-43A 11, ch- 125E 1,
  ch-163E12, ch-166E2, and ch-175D10. All of them show native epitope recognition and
  exhibit specific and strong binding to CLD 18A2 but not CLD 18A 1 expressing cells.
5 d. Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)
  Serum for complement lysis was prepared by drawing blood from healthy volunteers into
  Serum-Monovette vacutainer tubes (Sarstedt, Ntrmbrecht, Germany) which were then
  centrifuged at 600 g for 20 min. Serum was harvested and stored at -20*C. Control serum was
  heat inactivated at 56*C for 30 min before storage.
o Protein A-sepharose-purified chimeric antibodies of this invention were analyzed for their
  capability to induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against KATO-III cells
  endogenously expressing human CLD18A2, as well as stably transfected CHO-CLD18A2
  cells. Cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies ch-163E12, ch-166E2, and ch
   175D10, respectively, in a final concentration of 2.5 pg/ml to 35 pg/ml for 30 min. at 37*C.
5 20% human serum in RPMI was added to the cells and incubated for another 30 min. at 37*C.
  Thereafter, dead and living cells were discriminated by PI staining in a final concentration of
  2.5 pig/ml and percentage of antibody-mediated cell lysis was determined by flow cytometry.
  For flow cytometric analysis a BD FACSArray flow cytometer was used (BD Biosciences,
  Mountain View, CA). At least 10000 events were collected for analysis with cell debris
o excluded by adjustment of the forward sideward scatter (FSC/SSC) threshold. Specific lysis
  was calculated by the following formula: specific lysis = (% PI-positive cells in sample - %
  PI-positive cells in sample with heat inactivated serum). Specific lysis mediated by CDC was
  shown for several antibodies. All three antibodies mediated robust CDC on CHO-CLD 18A2
  cells (Figure 32). On KATO-III cells antibodies ch-163E12 and ch-175D10 were inducers of
5 robust CDC.
  e. Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
  FPLC-purified, chimeric antibodies of the invention were analyzed for their capability to
  induce    antibody-dependent    cellular  cytotoxicity   (ADCC)     against   KATO-III     cells
o endogenously expressing human CLD 18A2.
  Human blood from healthy donors was diluted twice in phosphate buffer (PBS) and blood
  cells were layered on Ficoll (1077 g/ml, Pharmacia). After centrifugation, peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from the interphase, washed and resuspended in
5 X-Vivo-15 culture medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated human serum.
                                                113

      WO 2007/059997                                                      PCT/EP2006/011302
  15h before the assay, KATO-II cells were transfected with luciferase and plated at 5 x 104
  cells/well in a white microplate.
  For the assay, effector cells (PBMC, prepared as described above) at an effector to target
  (E:T) ratio of 20:1 and FPLC-purified chimeric antibodies were added and incubated for 2
5 3h at 370 C, 5% CO 2. Final concentration of the antibody in the well was 50p1g/ml. After 2-3h
  of pre-incubation, lucifer yellow (BD Biosciences, San Jose USA) was added at lmg/ml.
  Luminescence resulting from the oxidation of lucifer yellow by the luciferase of viable cells
  was measured continually for up to 6h using a microplate-reader (Infinite200, Tecan,
  Switzerland). Percentage of cellular cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula:
3 % specific lysis = 100-((sample luminescence counts - spontaneous luminescence counts) /
  (maximal luminescence counts - spontaneous luminescence counts) x 100), with the
  spontaneous luminescence determined by adding Triton X-100 (0,2% final concentration),
  and the maximal signal measured in the absence of antibodies.
  Using this assay it was shown that monoclonal antibodies ch-163E12 and ch-175D10 mediate
5 strong ADCC on KATO-III cells (Fig. 33).
  f. Proliferation Inhibition
  FPLC-purified chimeric antibodies of the invention were analyzed for their capability to
  inhibit cell growth of KATO-III cells endogenously expressing human CLD18A2.
  Target cells (KATO-III) were cultured in the presence of chimeric respective antibodies (see
  proliferation inhibition of murine antibodies, Example 7). FPLC purified chimeric antibodies
  ch-163E12 and ch-166E2 were shown to inhibit cell proliferation.
5 10.     Selection of antibodies as clinical lead candidates
  Ideal clinical leads may cover a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic applications (see
  also section IV - Uses and Methods of the Invention). According to the invention antibodies
  directed to CLD18-A2 are provided. It is shown that the antibodies provided according to the
o invention offer a broad spectrum of properties regarding specificity, ability to induce CDC
  and ADCC and inhibit proliferation of cells expressing CLD18, in particular tumor cells.
  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that chimerisation of antibodies may lead to the
  aquisition of additional Fc-dependent effector functions not present in the parental murine
  molecule. For example, it is shown herein that antibody 175D10 with murine IgG1 does not
5 induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (see Example 5), while ch-175D10 with human
                                                114

  IgGI induces specific lysis of constitutively CLD18 expressing tumor cells (see Tab. 5 and
  Tab. 6).
  Antibodies provided according to the present invention may be categorized into distinct
  classes according to their binding properties and their ability to mediate effector functions on
5 cells expressing CLD18. From the antibodies provided according to the present invention,
  clinical lead candidates may be selected based on their functional characteristics. An overview
