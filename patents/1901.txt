   20-diketone-2 1-acetate is a kind of hormone drug intermediate which is used for
   making becort drug. Becort drug belongs to one kind of amcinonide which is mainly
   used for anti-inflammatory and anti allergic and suited for rheumatoid arthritis and
15 various skin diseases. The effect of dexamethasone is same to betamethasone, but the
   anti-inflammatory effects are more strong and fewer side effects when compared with
   dexamethasone triamcinolone and hydrocortisone. However, most of the existing
   synthesis methods are using sodium bichromate solution and sulfuric acid solution as
   reactions,   the sodium bichromate solution is more polluted to the environment, it is
20 not suitable for large-scale industrial production, sulfuric acid solution attributes to
   high-risk chemicals,   the synthesis method is complicated. Therefore, it is necessary to
   propose a new synthesis method.
