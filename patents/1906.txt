TITLE OF INVENTION
[0001] The method of a set of systems consisting of cloud computing, database
processing, and App software downloaded to both the service provider
PC/mobile terminal and service user mobile terminal assists the parties below to
solve the problems when the service is in demand.
[0002] The definition of service provider to include automobile repair
shop/mobile mechanic, boat repair shop, motorbike repair shop, bicycle repair
shop, household appliance repair shop, computer technician/shop, household
plumber, house repair, handyman.
[0003] The definition of a service user includes the owner of automobile, boat,
motorbike, bike, household owner, and computer owner.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0004] The present invention relates to the computer cloud technology. It is the
method of a computer & App linking the service provider and service user, and
assisting them to send and receive the service messages in expected area with
GNSS assistance.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0005]With modern development of computers and software technology,
the distance in communication between computer users is shortened by a
computer, cloud server, and mobile terminal. For automotive, boat,
motorbike industry, people at present only can get their automotive, boat,
motorbike, fridge, air-conditioning, electrical service, home maintenance

                                       2
serviced by phone booking appointment, online research, yellow page, or
specific forum to find relevant service provider. For service user, it is very
hard for them to find a service provider during holiday season to get a
service done. The cloud technology with GNSS can solve the problem by
App software linking both service providers and service users in selected
areas with satellite assistance. Even in a normal situation, the cloud system
with App can easily assist both sides to identify the location, service
demand, and both sides can select their expected service or demand.
The software App can be downloaded into the user mobile phone and
service provider's PC terminal or mobile terminal. Through the App on
terminals (PC or mobile phone), a message or warning signal be sent to
each other and a service is bridged by the App or Computer via cloud
server.
[0006] The service user and service provider need to register and download
the App to their communication terminal such as mobile phone or
computer PC. By registration online and preferred postcode and area, the
App on each side can display the name, service time, location, available
time, pricing message, service level (marked with star), and credit
background.
[0007] At present, for a service user and provider, it is limited how to find
each other by traditional yellow pages, online research etc. People can turn
to their computer and smart phone making phone calls to do research, book
a time, and locate the service provider. Most service providers do not
answer phone calls or provide service during holiday season to customers.

                                        3
With the App, mobile service provider can receive the service demand in
24 hours and can make a decision to provide the service or not quickly and
it helps the service user to save time in selected area where there are
possibly many or just a few service providers.
TECHNICAL ISSUES
[0008] The first objective of the present invention is to provide a method
for the defined service user and service provider in service demand area,
locate each other, shorten the distance via cloud and App, save the time,
improve the efficiency and maximize the use of resource.
[0009]The second objective of the present invention is to provide a system
for both the service user and service provider fair competition and save the
resource with the App.
TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS
[0010] In order to achieve the first objective above, the invention provides
a method for combined system including PC terminal/Mobile terminal and
cloud server with satellite assistance. Once the service user sends the
message via their mobile app or pc app, the service provider or seller can
get the message by the app or computer online. Satellite navigation map
software needs to be downloaded into the App or must be installed in the
computer. Computer with navigation map and cloud website can assist the
service user and service provider to communicate online.

                                        4
[0011] The service user turns on the mobile phone with Satellite/Network
roaming/Wi-Fi function. Mobile phone owner can receive the signal from
telecom station and exchange the information online. Registered business
service providers also can see and locate the service user. The App has the
function to locate all the service providers and service demander, their
name, phone number, their request or service providing by the cloud server,
and App. The App provides the service by filtering the customer location
after their registration with their own postcode.
[0012] In order to achieve the second objective above, the invention
provides a method by combined system including PC terminal/Mobile
phone terminal and cloud server with satellite assistance. Except the basic
information displayed such as both parties' name, history/feedback for
service is available, a service pricing/product pricing system can be quoted
online and shown to the customer after the customer sends service demand
message. Through navigation GNSS system, the customer can select the
closest or the lowest.
ADVANTAGES
[0013] The principle above shows that both the end user/customer and
service provider/product seller in defined area with GNSS assistance and
postcode can locate the position of each other in defined area after they log
in their App or PC terminal. Through alarm warning or message by
different sound or colored message, both parties can know what
service/product the end user is in demand of such as "emergency repair

                                       5
service" in red color message text or "green color message text means
"need battery replacement" and such mechanism for other demanded
services.

[0019] First, step S 101, service user/demander and service provider/seller
all register online with legal identities by computer or mobile phone.
[0020] In step S 101, service user/demander and service provider/seller all
turn on their mobile phone App or computer and log on cloud website or
mobile phone App.
[0021] In step S 102, the position for both parties (service user/demander
and service provider/seller) can be displayed by installed GNSS map via
mobile phone App and computer;
[0022] In step S 102, service user/demander and service provider/seller
prefer to select the opposite party in nearest area. The App and cloud
website can help to achieve this function by typing in the postcode. Now
within the area, service user/demander and service provider/seller can find
the location of each other by the map and mobile icon on the App or
Computer. Service user/demander and service provider/seller can measure
the distance via map installed in App or Computer. Communication now is
ready via software installed on the App or Computer in between service
user/demander and service provider/seller.
[0023]Next, in step S 103, the service user/demander sends an online
message via mobile phone App or Computer to let service provider/seller

                                       7
know "service in need", such a message like "Can you help? I need.... The
service".
[0024] In step S 103, service user/demander sends a message for service
request to a selected service provider/seller, and the service provider/seller
responds to solve the problem, details such as pricing, appointment time
which will be agreed online cloud website or the App used.
[0025] At last, in step S104, the service/product is provided. Both service
user/demander and service provider/seller can leave experience/quality
feedback to each other and leave it as future reference for other people.
[0026] In Figure 2, service user 201, 202, 203 can use their registered
account via App/Computer 207/208 to send message by mobile
phone/computer via BTS/Wi-Fi 209/210 to cloud server 211 and
GNSS/GPS 212, through the cloud server computing & linkage with
postcode option and GNSS/GPS, service provider/seller 204,205,206 can
receive the message "service in need" and locations for each party can be
positioned by GNSS/GPS 212 assistance.
[0027] In Figure 2, cloud servers 211 have the storage functions keeping
and tracking registered accounts, payment gateway for service deposit, and
data exchange.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION
[0028] The present invention is mainly applied for the automotive industry.

                                        8
Through the cloud website, GNSS, App and computer, service
users/demander can easily locate the service provider/seller' position, their
credit, contacts, working time, service quality, public feedback, more over
they can communicate via App or Computer regarding service appointment,
pricing quote and payment deposit in advance via App or Computer online.
The App and cloud website provide the function to hold the deposit for the
service based on their agreement online after communication to each other.
For example, in holiday season, a car driver found his car is broken or has
problems and could not drive it. It is difficult for people to make phone
calls to service provider/seller to get help. With the invention, licensed
mechanics, licensed car shop, licensed mobile mechanics can get a service
demand message and provide the service once they reach agreement over
the App or computer. It solves the problem especially in emergency
situation in which traditional service phone call cannot help. It improves
the efficiency, minimizes the danger and risk of the service user, reduces
energy consumption, and maximizes the opportunity to provide the service
people in need.
[0029] It can also be applied in the boat, household service, motorbike
industries, where people easily can meet the same problem as the car
industry.
