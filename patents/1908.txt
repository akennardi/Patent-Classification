   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
20 having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   where game outcomes are generated in a main window and any
   active additional windows. Contributing symbols from
   active additional windows are applied to the main window
   to form a modified game outcome which is evaluated by the
25 game controller to determine whether to make an award. In
   an embodiment, the additional windows are activated one by
   one in response to activation conditions being met.
   General construction of gaming system
30
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
35
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
                                              10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 9
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
 5 wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
10 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
15 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.   For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
20 machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
25 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
30 the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
35 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
                                             10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 10
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions           (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
 5
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
10 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
15 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
20 stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
25 integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
30 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
35 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 11
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
 5 having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
10 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
15 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
20 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
25 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
30 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
35 type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
                                               10393653_1 (GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
 5 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
10 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
15 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
20 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
25 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
30 screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
35 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 13
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
 5 the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
10
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
15 to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
20 module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
25 an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.             The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.             The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
30 some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
35
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
                                             10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
 5 alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
10 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
15 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
20 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
25 In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
30 collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
35 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.

   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
 5 provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
10 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
15 client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
20 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
25 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
30 for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
35 plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
                                              10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
 5 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
10
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager and hence the win entitlement which will be
   evaluated for this play of the game and initiates a play
   of the game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
15 that a player's win entitlement will vary from game to
   game dependent on player selections. In most spinning reel
   games, it is typical for the player's entitlement to be
   affected by the amount they wager and selections they make
    (i.e. the nature of the wager) . For example, a player's                    win
20 entitlement may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game   (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and how much they wager per line.    Such win lines are
25 typically formed by a combination of symbol display
   positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
   positions being located relative to one another such that
   they form a line.
30 In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the win entitlement.
35
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 17
   selecting a number of reels to play and an amount to wager
   per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The
   selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol of
 5 the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
   designated display positions. In other words, all symbols
   displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
   selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
   symbols displayed at a designated, symbol display
10 positions of the other reels.  For example,   if there are
   five reels and three symbol display positions for each
   reel such that the symbol display positions comprise three
   rows of five symbol display positions, the symbols
   displayed in the centre row are used for non-selected
15 reels. As a result, the total number of ways to win is
   determined by multiplying the number of active display
   positions of each reel, the active display positions being
   all display positions of each selected reel and the
   designated display position of the non-selected reels. As
20 a result for five reels and fifteen display positions
   there are 243 ways to win.
   In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
25 e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
   including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
   wins including plums.
   In other embodiments a player may be able to place an ante
30 bet. Depending on the embodiment, an ante bet may affect
   the manner in which games are evaluated, however, more
   typically the ante bet allows the player access to an
   additional aspect of game play that does not occur in
   games where an ante bet is not place. For example, the
35 ante bet may allow access to a different feature game with
   a higher return to player or the rules of the feature game
   may be modified in return for an ante bet.
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 18
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
 5 art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
   be implemented in some other way, for example by a
   dedicated circuit.
   These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
10 operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
   the a game. In the embodiment, the game includes a base
   game and a feature game. The base game is a part of the
   game which is carried out each time the player makes a
15 wager, irrespective of the wager amount, whereas the
   feature game will only be carried out occasionally when a
   condition is met such as a trigger event occurring during
   play of the base game.
20 Accordingly, in the embodiment the outcome generator
   generates a base game outcome which will then be evaluated
   by outcome evaluator 623. The first part of forming the
   game outcome is for a symbol selector 622A to select
   symbols from a set of symbols specified by symbol data 641
25 using random number generator 621. The selected symbols
   are advised to the display controller 626 which causes
   them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of display
   positions.
30 One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones
   of a plurality of spinning reels. In this embodiment, the
   symbol data 641 includes base game reels 641A. The base
35 game reels 641A specify a sequence of symbols for each
   reel such that the symbol selector 622A can select all of
   the symbols to be displayed for each reel by selecting a
                                             10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 19
   stopping position in the sequence. In one example, three
   symbols of each of five reels may be displayed such that
   symbols are displayed at fifteen display positions on
   display 54. It is known to use a probability table stored
 5 in memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop
   position being selected. Other techniques can be used to
   control the odds of particular outcomes occurring to
   thereby control the return to player of the game.
10 After symbols of the base game are selected, they are
   evaluated by the outcome evaluator 624 based on a pay
   table 643 which lists a series of symbol combinations and
   awards that correspond to those combinations, typically in
   amounts of credit.  Any awards are added to the credit
15 meter stored as part of meter data 644.   Any awards are
   displayed on the display under the control of the display
   controller 626.
   In the embodiment, a further possible outcome of the
20 generation of a game outcome in the base game is that a
   trigger condition can be met.   In the embodiment, the
   trigger is the occurrence of a symbol combination in the
   game outcome, but other triggers may be employed such as
   the occurrence of a specific symbol in the game. In some
25 embodiments, triggers be based on turnover on the game or
   based on some form of random evaluation.
   The trigger condition 642a is specified as part of game
   rule data 642.  The game controller 60 implements a
30 feature game controller 625 which includes a trigger
   monitor 625a which monitors the base game outcomes to
   determine whether a trigger condition has been met.
   In response to the trigger monitor 625a, determining that
35 a feature game is to be conducted, the feature game
   controller 625 initiates a series of additional game
   rounds often known in the art as a free game series.                     In
                                              10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 20
   this respect, feature controller 625 also has a game round
   controller 625d which sets an initial number of game
   rounds based on game rule data 642 and keeps track of
   whether the game rounds have been played until all the
 5 games have been played and the feature game ends.                  In this
   respect, the number of game rounds that are awarded may be
   dependent on aspects of the game rules 642, for example,
   the number of occurrences of a symbol in the trigger
   conditions.   For example, one commonly used trigger
10 condition is the occurrence of scatter symbols and 3, 4,
   and 5 scatter symbols may trigger different numbers of
   additional game rounds.
   The feature controller 625 also controls the display
15 controller 626 to alter the display to display a main
   window 54A and four additional windows 54B to 54E.
   Further, the feature controller controls the outcome
   generator so that symbol selector 622A will select game
   outcomes using feature game reels 641B.    In the
20 embodiment, the feature game reels 641B are different to
   the base game reels 641A.    In this respect, persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that there are a number
   of ways to make feature game reels different to base game
   reels such as replacing the base game reels with a
25 completely different set of feature game reels or using an
   overlay reel containing symbols at some positions and
   blanks symbols at other positions such that where the
   overlay reel overlays the base game reel, it modifies the
   base game reel by replacing the symbol of the base game
30 reel. Another way of modifying base game reels is               to add
   additional  symbols the base game reel.   Depending on how
   this is implemented, this can be achieved by actively
   modifying the reels or replacing them with reels with the
   additional symbols to achieve the effect of adding symbols
35 to the reels.   The feature game reels may use the same or
   different symbols to the base game reels. For example, the
   feature game reels may use the same symbols but have a
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 21
   higher proportion of high value symbols. In another
   example, one or more symbols from the base game reels may
   "change" when the game transitions to use of the feature
   game reels.
 5
   In the embodiment, at the beginning of the feature game,
   only the main window 54A is active and the other four
   additional windows are shown as inactive.    In this
   respect, it will be appreciated that there may be a
10 different number of additional windows that may be
   activated.  It will also be appreciated that the
   availability of additional windows or the number of
   additional windows that are available may be dependent on
   factors such as the player's wager. For example,
15 additional windows may only be available when an ante bet
   is placed.
   Further, it will be appreciated that the additional
   windows need not necessarily be displayed on the same
20 display 54 as the main window.  Indeed, as described above
   many gaming machines include an additional top box display
   which is suitable for display of the additional windows.
   Further, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
   inactive additional windows may not be displayed.
25 However, in the embodiment, it is preferred that the
   windows are displayed in a manner that indicates that they
   are inactive so that the player understands that the
   windows can be activated as play continues.
30 In this respect, depending on the embodiment, game
   outcomes may be generated for the inactive additional
   windows but not evaluated or game outcomes may only be
   generated for the additional windows 54B to 54E when they
   are active.
35
   Accordingly, as indicated above, during a first game round
   of the series of game rounds, a game outcome will only be
                                             10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 22
   evaluate for the main window.    Accordingly, the outcome
   generator 622 generates a game outcome in the same manner
   as described in relation to the base game and this is
   evaluated by the outcome evaluator 624 based on the pay
 5 table 643 which may be the same or different to that of
   the base game.   At the conclusion of the game round, an
   activation condition monitor 625C of the feature
   controller determines whether a window activation
   condition which forms part of game rule data 642 has been
10 met.  In an embodiment, the activation condition may be
   that a count of an activation symbol occurring in game
   outcomes during a feature game has reached a threshold
   level. To this end, an activation symbol counter 645
   controlled by the activation condition monitor 625C is
15 maintained in the memory 64.    Accordingly, at the end of
   each game round, the activation condition monitor 625C
   updates the count 645 in the memory 64 and compares the
   count with a threshold.   In this respect, in the
   embodiment, the windows 54B to 54E are activated one by
20 one based on particular thresholds being reached.
   Accordingly, there are, in effect, four activation
   conditions.   Depending on how frequently the activation
   symbol occurs, a different number of additional windows
   will be activated during the course of play of different
25 feature game.
   Once an activation condition has been met, a window
   activator activates one or more of the additional windows
   54B to 54E such that in the next game round an additional
30 window will be available for evaluation as will be
   described in further detail below.
   In the preferred embodiment, the window activator 625B
   causes display controller 626 to display a message to a
35 player on the display 54 to select which one of the
   windows they wish to activate.    The player operates the
   game play mechanism 56, for example, by touching the
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 23
   window on the touch screen to activate a selected window.
   The game controller 60 receives the selection and the
   window activator 625B causes the display controller to
   control the display to show the selected window as active.
 5
   Accordingly, once one or more additional windows are
   active, in each game round thereafter, the outcome
   generator 622 generates outcomes that will be evaluated
   for each of the active windows.  In the embodiment,
10 contributing symbols of the additional windows 54B to 54E
   are used to modify the outcome in the main window 54A
   before the main window is evaluated.  In one example, the
   contributing symbol is a special symbol with an additional
   game play characteristic such as a WILD symbol.            In a
15 preferred embodiment, occurrence of the WILD symbol in any
   active additional window is transferred to the
   corresponding position on the main window. For example, if
   each of the windows displays a 5x3 array of symbols
   corresponding to 5 reels with 3 symbol positions per reel,
20 and a WILD symbol occurs in the top most position of the
   second from left reel in one of the additional windows,
   the WILD symbol is applied to the main window by being
   displayed at the top position of the second from left reel
   of the main window.
25
   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that as a WILD symbol
   may substitute for all other symbols, the occurrence of a
   contributing symbol results in increased likelihood of
   awards being made from the pay table and in those awards
30 being of higher value.
   In the embodiment, the outcome evaluator 625 determines
   whether to make awards from each of the main window and
   the additional windows based on the pay table 643.
35 However, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the
   art that in other embodiments, only the main window may be
   evaluated.
                                             10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                               - 24
   In the embodiment, the contributing symbol is also used as
   the activation symbol.
 5 The method of the invention is summarized in Figure 7.
   The method 700 involves initiating play of a game 705.                        A
   base game is conducted 710.    It is determined 715 whether
   a trigger condition is met and if not the game ends 720.
   If a trigger condition is met, a feature game is started
10 where the reels are changed and a game round counter is
   set to an initial value  (e.g. a count) 725.
   During the feature game, outcomes are generated 730 for
   the main window and each active additional window (in the
15 sense that they will be evaluated for the active
   additional windows at least to the extent that they may
   modify the main window). At step 735, it is determined
   whether there are any contributing symbols in active
   additional windows.   If there are, the main window is
20 modified 740 and in either event, the game controller
   proceeds by evaluating 745 the main and any active
   additional windows for awards.
   After the main and any active additional windows have been
25 evaluated, the game round counter is decreased by one by
   the game round controller 625D and if the count equals
   zero 755, the game ends 780.    Otherwise, it is determined
   760 whether an activation condition was met by the last
   game round and if so, the game controller proceeds to the
30 receive 765 a player selection of a window to activate and
   activates the window 770 before generating a further game
   outcome at 730.
   In this respect, a timer may be applied to a player
35 activating a window such that the game controller may
   select a window if the player takes too long.           Further, it
   will be appreciated that once all bar one activatable
                                               10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

                              - 25
   window has been activated, the player may not be required
   to activate the final window and this can be done
   automatically by the game controller once the final
   threshold is achieved.
 5
   Referring now to Figure 8, there is shown an example of a
   display 54 during conduct of a base game, the game
   involves selecting symbols for 5 reels 810A to 810E where
   three symbols are displayed for each reel.      The game
10 displays 820 the amount bet in the current game 830 and a
   win meter 840 corresponding to the current game.              The game
   also displays the denomination 850 played in the game.
   Figure 9 shows an example of the display during play of a
15 feature game in accordance with the embodiment. In this
   example, there is a main window 54A and four additional
   windows 54B to 54E shown on display 54.  The game also
   displays a counter 920 showing the number of activation
   symbols needed to be collected in order to activate an
20 additional window.  At the stage of the game shown in
   Figure 9, a message 930 is displayed to the player to
   indicate that they have unlocked an additional window and
   may activate the window by touching one of the windows. In
   this respect, the windows are shown as locked by the
25 depiction of cages 910 over the windows.
   Figure 10 shows an alternative exemplary display again
   featuring a main window 54A and four sub windows 54B to
   54E. Figure 10 shows that the activation condition may be
30 represented in a number of different ways. In Figure 10 a
   lantern 1020 is shown which must be filled in order to
   activate an additional set of reels.  When a lantern is
   lit, the player can touch the set of reels as the player
   has done in the exemplary display of Figure 10 in order to
35 activate reels 54B which as shown as lit up by lantern

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in the
   above embodiment, there may be more than one game round in
   a play of a gaming machine when the feature game is
 5 awarded. As indicated above, in the embodiment, the
   outcome of a game round may be no win or a win from a
   winning combination of symbols resulting in an award. Such
   an award may never actually be physically received by a
   player. For example, many gaming systems provide a player
10 with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the player
   can double or forfeit their credits before commencing
   another play of the game or cashing out. Further, as
   credits are fungible, once credits have been added to the
   credit meter it is not possible to distinguish between
15 credits which exist because the player has input cash or
   the like and credits resulting from an award.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
20 that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
25 out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
30 such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
35 code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
                                             10393653 1(GHMatters) P90332.AU.3 21/06/18

    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
    a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
    server). Further different parts of the program code can
    be executed by different devices, for example in a client
  5 server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
    appreciate that program code provides a series of
    instructions executable by the processor.
    It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
10  invention that many modifications may be made without
    departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
    particular it will be apparent that certain features of
    embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
    further embodiments.
