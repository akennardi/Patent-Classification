Invention Title:                  A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION
The present application is a divisional of Australian patent application No 2013314453, which is the
national phase application based on International patent application No PCT/EP2013/068488 filed
6 September 2013, which claims priority from UK Patent Application No GB1216385.3 filed
13 September 2012, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety
for all purposes.
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of
performing it known to us:

                                            -1a
                            A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION
   The present invention relates generally to soft gelatin capsules and, in particular, soft
   gelatin capsules containing a pharmaceutical formulation comprising omega-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids in free acid form for use in the treatment of a variety of
 5 conditions      including     chronic     inflammatory     conditions;   dyslipidaemia;
   hypertriglyceridaemia; asthma; bipolar disorder and neoplastic disease.        The soft
   gelatin capsules have        particular application in the treatment of "moderate"
   hypertriglyceridaemia in humans, i.e. humans having a blood plasma triglyceride
   level from about 200 to about 500 mg/dl, who are also on statin therapy, or "severe"
10 hypertriglyceridaemia in humans, i.e. humans having a blood plasma triglyceride
   level of at least 500 mg/dl.
   Gelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of water-soluble proteins of high molecular weight
   extracted from a number of sources of collagen such bovine bones and hide, pig skin
   or fish skin. Broadly speaking, there are two types of gelatin, Type A gelatin and
15 Type B gelatin, depending on the method of extraction.
   According to "Gelatin Processing" (US National Organic Standards Board Technical
   Advisory Panel Review; 1s" March 2002), Type A gelatin is extracted following an acid
   pre-treatment process and porcine gelatin is usually (but not necessarily) extracted in
   this way. Where porcine gelatin is from pigskin, the pigskins are typically dehaired
20 and degreased and the resultant skin is passed through a chopper or macerator to
   cut the skin into uniform sizes. The skin is then soaked at a pH of 1 to 4 with a food
   grade mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid or sulphuric acid for 8
   to 30 hours. The acid-treated pigskin is then washed with water to remove impurities
   and extracted with hot water.         The extract is filtered through an anion-cation
25 exchange column to reduce ash or mineral levels. The gelatin extract is vacuum
   concentrated or ultra filtered to a concentration between 15 to 35%, filtered, pH
   adjusted to between 3.5 and 6, and evaporated to 50% solids. The residue is chilled,
   extruded, dried and milled to the required particle size and then packaged. Bovine
   Type A gelatin and fish Type A gelatin are also known.
30 Type B gelatin is extracted following an alkali pre-treatment process and bovine
   gelatin is usually extracted in this way (ibid). Bones are crushed, cooked, centrifuged
   and dried.     The extracted bone is degreased prior to gelatin extraction and de
   mineralised with 4 to 6 % hydrochloric acid for a period of 5 to 7 days. The ossein is
   washed repeatedly with water to remove impurities and then treated with 1 to 4 %

                                               -2
   lime (calcium hydroxide) slurry to adjust the pH to about 12 for periods of 35 to 70
   days with agitation and weekly lime changes to remove non-collagen components.
   The ossein is then washed and mineral acid is added to neutralise excess lime and
   adjust the pH to 3. The final pH after all wash operations is between 5 and 7. De
 5 mineralised hot water is then used to extract the gelatin. The liquid gelatin solution
   may be filtered through a cellulose/diatomaceous earth plate and frame filter and
   deionised using an anionic-cationic resin bed. The resin solution is evaporated to a
   concentration between 15 to 45%. The concentrated gelatin is filtered, pH adjusted
   to between 5 and 7, sterilised, cooled and air-dried. It is then milled to the required
10 size and packaged. The alkaline process may take up to 20 weeks.
   Gelatin   is used, for example, to encapsulate various foods and nutritional
   supplements but especially medicines for oral administration of pharmaceutical
   formulations. Plasticizers such as glycerine may be added to gelatin to produce soft
   gelatin capsules. Formaldehyde and other aldehydes may be used to harden gelatin
15 capsules and enable them to pass from the stomach to the intestines.             The vast
   majority of soft gelatin capsules are manufactured from Type B gelatin, in particular
   bovine Type B gelatin.
   Omega-3 (i.e. "w-3" or "n-3") polyunsaturated fatty acids such as cis-5,8,11,14,17
   eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3; "EPA" also known as timnodonic acid) or cis
20 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3; "DHA" also known as cervonic
   acid) are well known to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (or
   "IBD")   (see,   for   example,   EP0244832A;      EP0289204A;        EP0311091;      and
   W093/21912A, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference).
   W096/36329A (Buser et al; published on 21 November 1996) exemplifies hard
25 gelatin capsules containing a fatty acid formulation ("Purepa") derived from fish oil
   that comprises 42.4 wt % EPA in free acid form and 19.9 wt % DHA in free acid form.
   The formulation also contains other free fatty acids including 0.5 wt % "C22:5" which
   is a docosapentaenoic acid. The reference does not specify whether the C22:5 fatty
   acid is an omega-3 or omega-6 (i.e. "w-6" or "n-6") polyunsaturated fatty acid. Each
30 capsule is film coated with Eudragit* NE 30-D which is a neutral polyacrylate material
   comprising poly(ethylacrylate-methylmethacrylate) having an average molecular
   weight of about 800,000.     The capsules pass through the stomach and disintegrate
   to release the contents in the small intestine. Results indicate that clinical relapses in
   Crohn's disease may be prevented by the oral administration of such coated
35 capsules.

                                               -3
   It is disclosed in US2870062A (Scherer et al; published on 20 January 1959) that
   "standard gelatin capsules" disintegrate in contact with deliquescent or hygroscopic
   chemicals, such as liquid non-ionic detergents, salts of strong acids and bases,
   choline chloride and chloral hydrate, encapsulated within.        US2870062A discloses
 5 the use of capsules made from specially selected low viscosity, high Bloom strength
   gelatin prepared from acid treated bone precursor. Such capsules do not appear to
   disintegrate when left in contact with deliquescent or hygroscopic chemicals.
   EP0100052A (Yu; published on 8 February 1984) discloses soft gelatin capsules
   containing PGE-type prostaglandin fatty acid compositions.          Comparative studies
10 appear to indicate that soft gelatin capsules made from Type B gelatin accelerate
   degradation of the prostaglandin composition whereas soft gelatin capsules made
   from Type A gelatin retain the stabilising effect of the solvent in which the
   prostaglandin fatty acids are dissolved.
   US6234464B        (Krumbholz    et   al; published    on   22    May   2001)   discloses
15 microencapsulated unsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid compounds or mixtures
   thereof.   The wall of the microcapsules comprises two layers.        The inner layer is
   composed of bone gelatin (gelatin A or gelatin B), casein or an alginate or by a
   derivative or salt thereof and the outer layer is composed of gelatin B, gum arabic,
   pectin or chitosan or a derivative or salt thereof. The unsaturated fatty acid may be
20 an omega-3 fatty acid or and ethyl ester or glyceride thereof.              US6234464A
   exemplifies microencapsulated 95% EPA ethyl ester in which the wall of each
   microcapsule comprises an inner/outer layer combination of gelatin A/gum arabic,
   gelatin A/pectin or gelatin A/gelatin B.
   W02005/079853A (Buser et al; published 1 September 2005) exemplifies a soft
25 gelatin capsule containing a free fatty acid formulation comprising EPA in free acid
   form in an amount from 50 wt % to 60 wt % of the formulation, together with DHA in
   free acid form in an amount from 20 wt % to 30 wt % of the formulation. The gelatin
   component in the gelatin shell is porcine Type A gelatin. The reference discloses
   that soft gelatin capsules containing free fatty acids in which the gelatin component in
30 the capsule shell is Type B gelatin can harden over time, and that such hardening
   increases the disintegration time of the capsules and reduces their shelf life. The
   data presented in the reference demonstrates that, unlike the soft bovine Type B
   gelatin capsules, the disintegration time of the soft porcine Type A gelatin capsules
   does not increase significantly over the period of time measured, and therefore the

                                              -4
   shelf life of the capsules is improved by using porcine Type A gelatin in place of
   bovine Type B gelatin.
   It has now been suggested (see, for example, US2013/0177643A) that the omega-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acid, cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-3;
 5 "DPA" also known as clupodonic acid) may have a significant influence on the
   therapeutic effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oils. However, the
   Inventor anticipates that the free acid form of DPA will cause hardening of a soft
   gelatin capsule in which the gelatin component in the capsule shell is Type B gelatin.
   According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a soft gelatin
10 capsule comprising a soft gelatin shell encapsulating a pharmaceutical formulation,
   said formulation comprising cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3;
   "EPA") in free acid form in an amount from 25 wt % to 99 wt % of the formulation and
   cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-3; "DPA") in free acid form in an
   amount from 1 wt % to 75 wt % of the formulation, wherein said shell comprises a
15 gelatin component made up of porcine Type A gelatin and at least one other gelatin,
   said porcine Type A gelatin being present in an amount of no more than about 75 wt
   % of said gelatin component.
   The porcine Type A gelatin is usually present in an amount of no more than about 70
   wt %, e.g. no more than 65 wt %, of the gelatin component. In certain embodiments,
20 the porcine Type A gelatin is present in an amount of no more than about 60 wt %,
   e.g. no more than about 55 wt %, of the gelatin component. In certain embodiments,
   the porcine Type A gelatin is present in no more than about 50 wt %, e.g. no more
   than about 45 wt % or no more than about 40 wt %, of said gelatin component.
   The porcine Type A gelatin is usually present in an amount of no less than about 10
25 wt %, e.g. no less than about 15 wt % or no less than about 20 wt %, of said gelatin
   component. In certain embodiments, the porcine Type A gelatin is present in no less
   than about 25 wt %.
   The gelatin component comprises at least one other gelatin which may be selected
   from other Type A gelatins, e.g. bovine Type A and fish Type A gelatin, and Type B
30 gelatins. Preferably, at least one other gelatin is a Type B gelatin.
   The gelatin component is preferably a binary mixture of a Type B gelatin and the
   porcine Type A gelatin.

                                                -5
   The Type B gelatin may be from any suitable source but is preferably bovine Type B
   gelatin.
   The DPA in free acid form is usually present in the formulation in an amount of at
   least 2 wt %, e.g. at least 3 wt %, or at least 4 wt %, of the formulation.
 5 The DPA in free acid form is usually present in the formulation in an amount of no
   more than about 50 wt %, e.g. no more than about 25 wt %, of the formulation.        In
   certain embodiments, the DPA in free acid form is present in the formulation in an
   amount of no more than about 10 wt %, e.g. no more than about 8 wt %, of the
   formulation.
10 In certain embodiments, the DPA in free acid form is present in the formulation in an
   amount from about 3 wt % to about 7 wt %, e.g. in an amount from about 4 wt % to
   about 6 wt %, of the formulation.
   The EPA in free acid form is typically present in the formulation in an amount from
   about 45 wt % to 99 wt %, e.g. in an amount from about 45 wt % to about 65 wt %, of
15 the formulation.
   The formulation typically comprises DHA in free acid form in an amount from about
   15 wt % to about 25 wt % of said formulation.
   In certain embodiments, the formulation comprises EPA in free acid form and DHA in
   free acid form in a total combined amount from about 60 wt % to about 90 wt % of
20 the formulation.
   The formulation typically comprises at least one further omega-3 polyunsaturated
   fatty acid ("PUFA") in free acid form.      The at least one further omega-3 PUFA is
   usually selected from a-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3); moroctic acid (C18:4 n-3);
   eicosatetraenoic acid (C20:4 n-3); heneicosapentaenoic acid (C21:5 n-3); and
25 eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3 n-3).     In certain embodiments, all of these further free
   omega-3 PUFAs are present in the formulation.
   The total combined amount of omega-3 PUFAs in free acid form in the formulation is
   preferably from about 80 wt % to about 95 wt % of the formulation.
   The formulation also typically comprises at least one omega-6 PUFA in free acid
30 form.    The at least one omega-6 PUFA is usually selected from di-homo-gamma
   linolenic acid (C20:3 n-6); arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6); linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6);

                                                -6
  docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5;          n-6); gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-6); and
  eicosadienoic acid (C22:2 n-6). All of these free omega-6 PUFAs may be present in
  the formulation.
  The total combined amount of omega-6 PUFA(s) in free acid form in the formulation
5 is typically no more than 10 wt % of the formulation.
  In preferred embodiments, the formulation is a refined and concentrated fish oil
  product. The following is an example of a suitable formulation for encapsulation to
  form the soft gelatin capsules of the present invention (all in free acid form):

   Suitable processes for producing formulations for encapsulation in soft gelatin
   capsules according to the present invention are described in US13/734846 filed on 4
   January 2013, published as US2013/0177643A1 on 11 July 2013 and claiming the
   benefit of US provisional patent application Nos. 61/583796 filed on 6 January 2012,
 5 61/664,047 filed on 25 June 2012, 61/669940 filed on 10 July 2012, 61/680622 filed
   on 7 August 2012, 61/710517 filed on 5 October 2012 and 61/713388 filed on 12
   October 2012.
   The formulation usually comprises an antioxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisole
   ("BHA") or a-tocopherol. The antioxidant is usually present in an amount from about
10 0.2 wt % to about 0.4 wt % of the formulation.
   The soft gelatin capsule is not a microcapsule. In this connection, the soft gelatin
   capsule typically encapsulates from about 100 mg to about 2000 mg of the
   formulation.    In some embodiments, the capsule contains about 500 mg of the
   formulation. Such embodiments may be intended for administration to children. In
15 other embodiments, the capsule contains about 1000 mg of the formulation.           Such
   other embodiments may be intended for administration to adults.
   Release of the formulation from the soft gelatin capsule is usually controlled to occur
   primarily along at least a significant portion of the small intestine. In this connection,
   the soft gelatin capsule may be coated with a polymeric film coating to control
20 release of the formulation in the intestines. Initial release is preferably post-gastric
   with the bulk (e.g. at least 50%, preferably at least 60% and more preferably at least
   75%) of the formulation being released in the ileum. Release is preferably sustained,
   e.g. in a microdrop-wise manner.
   The polymeric film coating may provide time- (but not pH-) controlled release of the
25 formulation. An example of a film forming polymeric material suitable for providing
   time- (but not pH-) controlled release of the formulation would be a neutral
   polyacrylate coating such as Eudragit* NE 30D.         Release from such a coating is
   sustained in a microdrop-wise manner.
   In the alternative, the polymeric film coating may provide pH-controlled release of the
30 formulation. Such polymeric materials are known as enteric polymers. Examples of
   suitable enteric polymers include cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), cellulose acetate
   trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMC-AS) and
   anionic poly(meth)acrylate material such as Eudragit* L or Eudragit* S 100.

   According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process
   for manufacturing a soft gelatin capsule containing a pharmaceutical formulation
   comprising EPA in free acid form in an amount from 25 wt % to 99 wt % of said
   formulation and DPA in free acid form in an amount from 1 wt % to 99 wt % of said
 5 formulation, said process comprising encapsulating said formulation in a soft gelatin
   shell comprising a gelatin component made up of porcine Type A gelatin and at least
   one other gelatin, said porcine Type A gelatin being present in an amount of no more
   than about 75 wt % of said gelatin component.
   Soft gelatin capsules of the present invention may be used in the treatment or

   The following is a description, by way of example only, of a presently preferred
   embodiment of the present invention.
15 Soft gelatin capsules according to the present invention are produced using a
   standard rotary die method involving conventional equipment operating under
   standard parameters and conditions.
   EXAMPLE 1
   Porcine Type A gelatin powder and bovine Type B gelatin powder are mixed in equal
20 proportions by weight to produce a gelatin component powder.                The gelatin
   component powder is mixed with water and the plasticisers, glycerol and sorbitol, and
   the mixture is heated to form a molten gelatin mass. Two thin ribbons of the molten
   gelatin are produced and passed between two die rolls which determine the shape
   and size of the capsules.     The formulation as described in Table 1 above (and
25 containing a-tocopherol in an amount of 0.3 wt % of the resultant formulation) is
   injected between the two gelatin ribbons just before the die rolls seal the two sides of
   the capsule shell together to form the soft gelatin capsule. The resultant capsules
   are then dried (28h @ 25'C/20% rH) to the required moisture content.
   The composition of the finished capsules is about 62 wt % gelatin component (50%
30 porcine Type A gelatin; 50% bovine Type B gelatin), about 23 wt % glycerol, about 5
   wt % sorbitol. The moisture content of the capsules (as measured by loss on drying;
   15h @ 105'C) is about 10 wt %.

                                               -10
   EXAMPLE 2
   Porcine Type A gelatin powder and bovine Type B gelatin powder are mixed to
   produce a gelatin component powder having a ratio by weight of porcine Type A
   gelatin to bovine Type B gelatin of 1:2. The gelatin component powder is mixed with
 5 water and the plasticisers, glycerol and sorbitol, and the mixture is heated to form a
   molten gelatin mass.      Two thin ribbons of the molten gelatin are produced and
   passed between two die rolls which determine the shape and size of the capsules.
   The formulation as described in Table 1 above (and containing a-tocopherol in an
   amount of 0.3 wt % of the resultant formulation) is injected between the two gelatin
10 ribbons just before the die rolls seal the two sides of the capsule shell together to
   form the soft gelatin capsule.       The resultant capsules are then dried (28h @
   25'C/20% rH) to the required moisture content.
   The composition of the finished capsules is about 62 wt % gelatin component (33%
   porcine Type A gelatin; 67% bovine Type B gelatin), about 23 wt % glycerol, about 5
15 wt % sorbitol. The moisture content of the capsules (as measured by loss on drying;
   15h @ 105'C) is about 10 wt %.
